The Double Life of Véronique," Split Alice
","I save films. By that I mean that some films I expect to be so precious that I want to save them for some future drought, or blue period where I need spiritual insulin. Or it may be that a valued filmmaker has died and I know there is only so much to see new and I want to pace it through my life.Kieslowski is something of a demigod in my film world. It isn't that he has mattered so much in the sense of affecting me. Its because he can push geography with the slightest touch, infer emotional richness with the most subtle of motions, show us beauty headon  headon without artifice. His the most delicate power I know in cinema. His 'Decalogue' is complex, open, engineered to be contradictory in ways that seem natural. But they are not where the real juice is. Its merely where he worked out the way to weave vision and narrative conflict with his companion and creative partner.It's 'Three Colors' where it pays off. These are miraculous and I wish them on any open soul. They will tear you gently in ways you will not notice for years, and then know all of a sudden when you meet someone.In between 'Decalogue and 'Colors,' we have this, essentially an adventure in moving from Polish to French vocabulary, both emotional and chromatic. Here we see some of the strokes we will encounter later, in one colored film even with the remarkable Irene. But he seems unsure here. Things aren't integrated between cinema and narrative as they were before and would be afterward. The eye doesn't inform with curious discovery, instead seems to glance around and hover. I suppose it is because the story isn't well developed in the way that others are. The deal with Kieslowski I think (beyond the beauty) is that he is able to infer future urges that probably will loop back into places and persons we see. (He closes a very few of these ordinary loops in the third colors film). But he never closes them, not the ones that matter. So we are left with our own emotions going ahead and anticipating results that matter to us, things started and not finished, breath sent out for us to catch and breath.This film is based on Alice in through the Lookingglass, with a number of less-than-deft fixtures to the source. He tries to build grand arcs of anticipated futures around this symmetry but they aren't fragile and supported by our wishes as we have elsewhere. I think it was simply a time of adjustment for him, and I cannot recommend this, even though I saved it for decades. I will suggest that if you do watch it, see the same story, the same emotional effects, the same tantalizing near-closure in 'Sex and Lucia' by someone less gifted with the eye, but more gifted with the mysteries of women. Watch out for the delicate tearing.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",Null,42,49,16 November 2008
"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Injured
","This is yet another in a long line of films that works on the notion that athletic achievement has something do with success in life, or inner understanding or even successful relationships (which in movieland is simple love).So we have a story about an unathletic dweeb who... well, you know the story. Hilarity and sweetness ensues.You have to be pretty hard up to buy into this, to allow this to help you define how you approach love and life. It isn't just the movie that is bankrupt. But there's something about this worth commenting on. Thandie Newton.There, I've said it. Regardless of how inane and even dangerous this movie is. No matter how wrong the ideas and vacuous the humor and therefore the soul of thing....No matter how empty it is. It has Thandie.Now here is a question: why should this matter? She's pretty, but hundreds or starlets are.You should know that your commenter is male, and old enough to wonder about beauty. And even though this movie is absolute trash, she is enough of a magnet to keep one engaged. At least some folks.My theory is that if a woman (never a 'girl') has something in the range of some ideal of features and frame  the specific are vague  then she can pretend to beauty and achieve it. Thandie is within that range genetically, but I think the allure isn't physical  its a matter of entering a seductive space. I'm sure that If I met this person outside of the screen, I would be unimpressed. Its the character she assumes here/ It has something to do with a perkiness that appears internal, an emotional alertness that is advertised, A centering in self that assures us that she is a genuine prize.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",Null,2,5,5 October 2008
The Blair Witch Project," In the Corner
","Spoilers herein.I was very impressed with this little film. I had stayed away because of the kiddie audience, but I found it intelligently conceived.
The first thing in film is to decide who the camera is. The gutsy thing is to make it a character, and the most straightforward way to do that is by POV shots from someone in the story. `Strange Days' has the best POV sequence I've seen. But these are hard to manage, and almost always used sparingly.Horror, real horror should rely on something deeper than shock or disgust. Most strategies depend on creating a character (sometimes a situation) that is threatening. In this case, the scares in the theater are due to direct encounters with this character. But even then, that bugaboo is threatening the people on screen, not you.In this gutsy move, the strategy is all focused on placing the viewer within the film. Every shot is POV, from either a 16mm camera or B/W video, often shooting each other. Rather brilliant conception, but from there one has a few big problems to solve.The big one is how to handle the exposition. It may not be obvious in most films, but there are two completely independent jobs of the storyteller. The filmmaker is a clockmaker, creating a world, characters and situations within that world. Some collection of devices must be managed to tell or show us the viewers what this is all about. The other job is the real work: allowing the clock to work: the characters and situations developing in some engaging way.The first part is no small matter in horror or its sibling, science fiction. Most clever approaches use visual shortcuts to refer to previous movies, but that's another story. Another approach is to adopt a world that we all know: from Potter or Ring books, or old TeeVee shows or comic books. What these folks do is a radical departure: they did all their exposition outside of the film, primarily on the web, but also with a TeeVee documentary on the documentary. (If you like this notion of a created metadocumentary, check out the the mind-blowing `The Falls.')Then, all the film has to do is reference that `myth' in a few, very well engineered `townspeople' interviews. We have one visual motif, the stick figures. One environmental reference, the stacked stones (and the `coffin' stone). And we have just one narrative device, and this is where the intelligence of the filmmakers impressed.For all the time in the woods, essentially nothing happens. There's incidental friction; they encounter sticks and stones; one member vanishes; a puzzling `message' is delivered. But there's no narrative advance. Until the very, very, very end, when Heather goes in the basement and sees her friend in the corner. By this time, we have been groping to tie the `myth' to what we see. We are given this one touchstone to the myth, about one child being put in the corner while another is killed in presumably some gruesome way. That connection sears for only a second, then our eye goes blank. (That this was the video, not the film, is especially well conceived.) The whole narrative is collapsed into that one second that we see with our own eyes. Right there. We explain it, not anyone in the film. Scarey as all getout. Clever. Self-referential.",Null,12,22,10 January 2002
Saturday Night Fever," Stigwood's Legacy
","The Beatles tried it and failed. They, especially Paul, saw movies as a sort of music, or at least a sibling of music. They saw how naturally and effectively they were able to change the world. So they tried movies, and it was a disaster. ('Hard Day's Night' wasn't theirs. I'm talking 'Magical Mystery Tour' here.)But it got a lot of entertainment heavyweights thinking if something better could be done than those stupid Elvis movies. Robert Stigwood had built a record empire. (In those days it was black plastic.) And he thought he could make big hits by thinking about movies the way he thought about record albums.So we have this and 'Grease' as successes, and a few failures as well, including the BeeGees as Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Whew, that's a rough one.But this one changed the world of movies. Music and movies always have had a dance of possibilities, mostly built around two models. Either the music was part of a realistic story, like when Micky and Judy 'put on a show' so you have the show and some events surrounding (usually threatening) it. And you have a stagy otherworld -- a peoples opera -- where the world of the story and that of the music blend.This is sort of in between, more like a show within, but there's a magic in the notion that the story more than wraps the show, it is a striving to actually pull the ordinary world into the world of music and dance. Its what I call a clever fold. We the audience identify with Manero who strives to take his mundane life and make it a magical, transporting show. Just like (exactly like) we were yearning to turn our own lives into something like we associated with movieland.So it works. And it was a first of this new model -- and also a new mode of promotion. It is a touchstone. But actually it isn't that good a movie. Some of the style has passed us by. We all used to know that Travolta character, and he's been replaced with a different, more dangerous and broken stereotype now. And we don't tolerate much now without what we call irony, a different sort of fold, dismissive.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",Null,5,7,2 February 2006
The Avengers," Other Worlds
","From time to time, I have the gift of unique movie audiences. I've watched 'The Brady Bunch' in an after school audience of teen and preteen LA girls. Down the road from where I live is the Pat Robertson school of film where most students believe they are in a fight with the devil and film is a most powerful tool for Jesus, and I can feel that in the response to certain films. My home theater is in the midst of a significant military area, so I sit next to warriors and their families when wondering about the war movies I see. This includes the so-called seal team six, and all the navy pilots in the mideast.But the most precious of shared dark space is when I am in Shanghai. I saw this film there, the only nonasian in the crowd — other than the 7 year old I was with. Then after a period of reflection, rewatched 'The Empire Strikes Back.'So I saw this film about the clash and merger of different worlds and dimensions while in full swim with that dynamic myself. (Chinese officials block access to IMDb, so this comment will be posted on my leaving.)The Star Wars films, the first of them anyway, demand only two extensions of the universe beyond a projection into the future. We assume that the future (or we did then) would include large machines, space travel and expanded notions of universal governance. There is no particular need to modify what we accept as the world we live in on that account. The notion of the force, and how it is woven into Jungian family dynamics was the big leap, the thing that forces us to stretch our universe. I think I understand the appeal of this across ages and cultures.The Marvel universe requires a different set of expansions. The time is now, yet we have world government and massive military machines and the same anachronistic limit on weapons. (There has been no advance in weapon technology: guns and swords.) We no longer need monsters to be designed to that actors can suit up, but even the CGI characters inherit this limit. But because they have to engage in hand-to-hand combat, we'll be asked only to assume beings more or less like us (but ugly) and big machines. They have the same notions of weapons (swords, guns, blasters) we have in both the real world and the cinematic sci-fi world.These limits ask little of us, but they limit the battles to be that same old crap we have seen hundreds of times before. The only thing Marvel could have brought was competence. Whelon does that.Where Marvel asks us to extend our universe is in the acceptance of complete, independent other worlds. These are not just different planets with the same physics, but different dimensions with (as much as the comic artists can imagine) different physics. This is a big assumption, and I suppose only a few enterprises (religious ones) can pull it off, because you have to take the space to define the different laws of the other dimensions.Marvel had a crew of different artists and writers, and they did not start out with a combined universe in mind, until a few managers until they combined several weak characters to sell more comics. (Stan Lee takes the credit for this, and I do not know the history well enough to dispute it.)So we have Tony Stark who really asks that we believe that the reach of technology will expand. We have several Marvel characters that also require only that we accept normal scientific accidents: radiation-based usually. The main disruptive device here is a crystal that asks only that we believe it emits some unknown radiation. This is only a cousin to the mysteries of the LHC. That takes care of Fury, Iron Man, Hulk and Captain America. Hawk and Widow are just spies with extraordinary training (along the lines of Batman).Thor, Loki, Asgard and the creatures from yet a third dimension are what expands this. We are asked to believe in an open, manyworld universe. Not other planets (as with Superman). Not humanmastered magic (Harry Potter, the Jedi, Dr Strange), but other worlds. I credit Lewis Carroll with making this possible.Having said that, what Whelon does is allow the character interplay to be a reflection (that is, folded) commentary on these assumptions. Everyone among the 8 or so members of the team looks at and questions the worlds of the other. This is where the Chinese context comes in. I suppose in the US, Captain America is seen as partly a joke, what we shorthand as only a 'cartoon,' but here that distinction is lost -- especially as the actor is encouraged to take his role seriously. Here, what we have is Team America taken seriously.What is seen here — and the China market for Hollywood blockbusters is as large as the US market — is a dull-witted, good-hearted American soldier taking command. He is manipulated by the government and military leaders, and supplied with the most extraordinary technology. He even — and no one should be surprised by this — has access to the powers of the other worlds. The blond hair and Germanic manner really stand out here.Oh and the redheaded girl, with the spotty past, guile and commitment to do good.I have no idea what effect this will have on global audiences. The Marvel franchise is now as powerful as that of Star Wars and Potter, and much more able to be mapped to current events. Fury even references them. But I can tell you that this was a thrilling experience, to see this with the additional fold of the audience, some of whom looked away from me when leaving the theater.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,11,23,10 June 2012
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Muir's Rushmore
","During the first tedious outing, I was full of wonder about how the form of this developed. I am interested in the puzzle movie, something that nominally started with the mystery. Some intelligent movies devise ever more complex and subtle puzzles, the wonder of which engages the viewer.Then there's the mainstream thread which asks ever less of the viewer, and merely panders to notions of how the mystery conspires to be so complex. Well that was what occupied be in the first embarrassment. Now we have this.Second movies in a franchise fascinated me, especially when the producers are as ambitiously greedy as this one. That's because the first movie gives them an opportunity to test the thing to death and to refine the formula for the second. So if you see any change whatever, you can rest assured that it was because of very expensive testing, marketing considerations and an understanding of narrative tokens.That's why I wonder what Helen Mirren is doing in this. She's 63. Now, recently she has given a serious study of Elizabeth, but this hiring decision was made well before that. Mirren's past is based on her overtly sexual being. She was essentially the first actress to make a living with her breasts and actually grow into a serious talent. But along the way, she has retained in many roles and most importantly in her public life, the sense of open sensuality. She's a sexual being first, and an intelligent observer of emotions behind that.Its quite rare. So why is she in a kiddie movie? A PG-engineered dope-fest? Why is she more openly sexual than the ordinary love interest? This is not accidental. Her wet top, her partially exposed breasts... these are engineered decisions. Why?I think it is insurance. I think that when you build a franchise today, you have to do so thinking of the saleability in 30 years. DVD marketeers look at what older viewers like, and its no surprise that they like two things: the familiar and sex, or at least what implies sex. And they look at who will have all the money in 30 years. It won't be the youngsters because the old always steal from the young.She's there so that when these 27 year old boys (the target) are grown into 63 year old men, they'll still rent this, or whatever amazing extras can be packaged. I'll bet nearly anything that there are salacious deleted scenes with this fearless woman. And probably naughty commentary as well.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",Null,3,7,12 April 2008
Angels & Demons," The Simple ologist Professor and Antimatters
","Pointing out that Ron Howard is incapable of making a good film is too ordinary and obvious a thing to say. This time he got a cinematographer that at least frames things well.You don't have to read me to learn that this thing is dull in all the ways that even the Nic Cage Treasure Hunt movies solve well enough.But what I find fascinating is that the story — quite apart from the movie — is pretty well engineered. Its not a particularly good story, just that the targets and shifts seem to be more than competent.Think how he has faked us out. We start with possibly the most standard of genre assumptions: the Church is a conspirator, suppressing the truth, the real truth. The treasure hunt through clues is really a search of the truth. It is the detective story turned into a thriller by adding malevolent power. The device is common, and uniquely American because it plays on the notion of noir, where unlikely coincidences are manipulated by watchers.Brown in fact used this very idea in his first film, and we are primed to see it repeated. And he starts predictably, with a secret conspiracy layered over the Church, powerfully doing some sort of 'Seven' inspired ritual killings. These of course also come from the detective genre, providing some cosmological order for the detective to discover and foil. We have a woman, who we suspect — because she is a brainiac —will provide some essential insight. And so we go puttering along in the genre track.At the end, we have a twist. Now twists are so normal that we would feel cheated without one. But this twist is not a twist within the story, it is a twist that surrounds the very nature of the story, and defuses the whole notion of power and conspiracy that drives the thing. Here's what struck me; you know how when a revealing twist occurs and you have to go back and reinterpret all you know? Well in this case, what is dynamically changed is the very reason for the story. Without a consistent all powerful conspiratorial church that speaks through secret symbols, there is no agency that Mr Hanks' character can have. Unsettling, and a bit clever. Is it enough to recommend? No.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",Null,7,14,11 June 2009
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Used Record Store
","Spoilers herein.There are movies that are well done; there are movies that satisfy; there are those that work, those that stick, those that transcend time to become classics and those that change lives. None of these measures necessarily has anything to do with each other and any can produce a movie worth watching.Quentin usually bores me because he is a mere shopkeeper rather than an artist. When it comes time to squeeze out some cinematic matter, it doesn't seem to come from his soul but from his catalog of very fine components. There is an art to arranging them nicely, but unlike his friend Rodriguez he doesn't make them his own.What does a clever man do with this condition? He makes a movie about it. The story is about someone who has a killer talent and upon deciding to create something (a baby in the story) chooses to become a used `record' store clerk and pays the price normal in such tragedies. All viewers will surely know that QT was himself such a clerk at a `used' video store, where he carefully built his vocabulary of things to use here (his western influences) and in Vol 1 (his Asian ones).The movie is nominally an action picture but the story is all built around some dialogue focused on the end: is it possible to both learn from a master and be a shopkeeper? Is it tenable to make a movie that does nothing but masterfully cite masters, always an apprentice? At what point can the self-loathing of inadequacy be turned to make the subtext original, personal and self-reflexive? Can we ever keep the BB?I liked this because it pretends to be the Bride, but really is Pris with one Bladerunner's eye, Lear's. Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,11,21,23 July 2004
The Legend of Bagger Vance," Bogie
","Redford continues his quest to be the Englebert Humperdink of film by creating uplifting Hallmark moments. The idea is to create a zen-like chicken soup metaphor, first fly fishing, then horses, now golf. The fishing film (`River Runs Through It') was far better, closer to noble,  because it was more meditative and exploited some creative shots. This has some of that, which is to its credit, but its all buried under a pretty syrupy story. Of the story, there's not much positive to say.
The regional accents are particularly bad -- why couldn't they bring on a coach or at least get everyone to use the same fictional accent?I think overly romanticizing a racial stereotype is just as demeaning and more pernicious than denigration. Just ask Native Americans. They'd be better off being portrayed as savages than as spiritual, environmental, peaceful, wise people. At least the former is an obvious trap. Redford should know better, and here is just capitalizing on the Tiger Woods rush.",Null,7,14,12 November 2000
Vertigo," Too Dizzy
","Spoilers herein.One really has to separate the idea of this film from its execution. I think the idea is terrific and the execution wobbly at least by today's standards.First, the story, which is clever and self-referentially about the making of itself.Initially, we are shown the female lead's eye and told that there are spirals within spirals concerning that eye.Then we have a prolog that tells us that the person you expect to fall isn't the one that does, and that the overriding driver here is guilt.Act 1 starts with a `Thin Man' type bantering couple as a blind. But the detective format is by steps perturbed. It quickly happens that our detective falls in love with a clearly deranged married woman who kills herself by jumping off a tower.Act 2: wracked with private and public guilt, our detective is beaten. He is literally put into the looneybin. After a year, he discovers a girl similar to his beloved. Completely obsessed, he becomes `filmmaker' and casts her in the role of his unforgettable love. At the end of Act 2, we discover that she really was his lost love and was acting then. Now she has to act as if she never acted, while playing the role he `writes.'Act 3 has the focus on her balancing the reality of one created self with that of another created self, and interacting with our hapless detective who is part creator, part witting viewer and part unwitting viewer in the play.The denouement comes with his realization of part (but not all) of her act and her (accidental?) fall from the same tower and the forthcoming guilt that implies.The `detective' as both discoverer and director and at last writer.This is an incredibly rich construction, especially considering the period and the restrictions of the studio system. It has lots of folds for our actress to play one of her several personae off others and for the `detective' viewer/creator to be baffled by moving among layers of creation and reference. Lots of opportunities to have the `acting' be movie-like, for instance in Judy's first appearance as Madeleine but pretending not to be Madeleine, where Hitchcock has her emerge stalking from a green fog.But now to the actual realization as a film. The reason we love Hitchcock is because he invented the notion of a camera eye that moved with curiosity, and he was able to use this as a central element in the narrative. It isn't exactly a new visual grammar but it was revolutionary then and common practice today. But that revolution isn't employed in the service of this wonderful narrative. What we have are just two remarkable shots, neither anything like the `goodbye Babs' shot in `Frenzy.' The first is the explanation of the murder: we have to be impressed by the economy by which we are told how the murder was done. Only a couple seconds of images.The other image is the first appearance of Madeleine in Eddie's Restaurant. This is such a rich construction that Peter Greenaway was to expand it into an entire film all by itself, complete with `green' and `red' worlds, `The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover.' It deals with just this same shifting in and out of actor and role denoted by kitchen and dining room.There are a few other competent shots too, but nothing of the brilliance of eye and narrative we saw in `Rear Window.' In fact, the production is rather poor once one gets past the colors, interiors and costumes. The key problem is that a narrative this complexly folded needs real actors. And not just ordinarily good like Tony Hopkins, but that rare kind who can present several dimensions at once, like Sean Penn and Julianne Moore. What we have here are pretty slim talents made worse by working for a guy that demands `just stand here and say these words the way I tell you to say them.'
Even played without all the dimensions (which is to say `old style,' before Brando), Stewart can only go as far as befuddlement. Novak is decidedly a lesser talent whose only qualification so far as Hitchcock is concerned is her one look. By today's standards, those horsey eyebrows look ridiculous.And so does all the cheesy backprojection. Watch this because Hitchcock was an intelligent film mind and he had an amazing idea. But he didn't pull it off here.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.",Null,20,39,18 August 2002
"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Walkabout Prissy Scintillating Dragsled
","Spoilers herein.Prissy, Prison, Pristine. That's what we have here.I like the approach these filmmakers took. The story is plain stupid. No matter. The characters are the thinnest of stereotypes: the flaming gay, the embarrassed bi, the genetically-determined transsexual, the exhibitionist asian, the miraculously likeable mother-earthy bisexual woman (who also provides shelter in the wilderness) and the true-hearted oaf who is sexually innocent and honestly discovers the heart(s) under the glitter. Stereotypes -- no matter. The production values are unimpressive; the acting approprates the actual manner of drag cabaret, which is to say that it is not acting at all, but prancing.No matter, because just as with the characters, the superficial appearance is just a nervous mannerism, done without thought, and the real value is elsewhere. What the real matter of this project is to build a few strong images that stick. And surprisingly a few have from Priscilla, and that says quite a bit for this viewer who seriously watches ten movies a week.It is all built around that image of a drag queen on top of a bus blasting through in the desert wild with dozens of yards of fabric billowing as a train behind and decibels of song leading. It is a matter of filling space: the kite, the unexpected performances, the appropriation of aborigonals (or perhaps the other way), but most of all, the shots of this performer on the bus. It is shown twice and I have not doubt that it was both the original idea and the pitch to sponsors. Another shot, the three from behind in leggy outfit climbing the hill of their destination. It works, It sticks.You must decide whether sitting through this is worth collecting those three images. (It was for me.) For all the rest of the `I'm outrageously gay, and isn't it fun' prancing, go watch `Hedwig' instead.",Null,5,13,17 April 2002
Black Swan," The Math
","When I encountered 'Pi,' I was profoundly upset. It happened again with 'Beautiful Mind' and 'Good Will,' other films about mathematical imagination. How, I wondered, could something as inherently cinematic as the mathematical imagination be so clumsily handled? How is it that the only way we can even partially experience this on the screen (in most cases) is through music and not image?How is it that someone as obviously predisposed as Aronofsky fumbles? Well, here he redeems himself and makes the film about geometrically guided genius that eluded him before. The form is dance, the mathematician here is a ballet dancer, and the dream within is well known music, often backwards. But those choices are merely conventions used to allow the camera to dance as it needs to. The opening scene lets us know how our eye will be constrained and what energy it will have. We later discover this is a dream, a nightmare so we know we are entering an internal world and only seeing the 'real world' as it penetrates and is structured by this savant.here we do have the vitality of a mathematical vision, the partnership of things and the seeing of things. Here, the camera moves every bit as energetically and gracefully as the subject. Some shots I simply cannot fathom how they were done unless with precision, quite dangerous choreography of bodies, camera and lights. We are in the space dancing as we are watching the elements in the space build order.Yes, our subject is mad. Yes, she is a driven genius. Yes, the people around are relative imbeciles, slaves to their own ghosts but without any reward.Yes, she is prepared to die for the immersion in her own creation, but that is what it takes, what drove Nash mad. Yes, she has to unharness the beast within, without which she has no sight whatever, and which always hurts. Always. Thank you sir, for giving us this.

Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," New Ships
","The franchise has shifted. The 'first trilogy' was visually-centered. It was quite literally a ride, allowing Depp room to creatively be silly. Some of the cinematic stretch was significant, and I still remember the Shackleford reference fondly. This is something entirely different. Sure, it has busy sequences and characters from the same universe. But now we have something story- centric. Images are pasted onto the story rather than the other way around. There's even an excess of story and excess within story with the excess being a character itself. There are at least three love stories, one of them tender and conventional, all of them centered on Catalonian women.There is something of an overarching battle between Christianity and the supernatural. The extreme irony is that the Spaniards are the token of the faith. In actual life, they were the ones who invented the notions of supernatural evil, the first continental faith-based genocide and New World slavery. There is a nice little revenge story that references Moby Dick. And at the end two Peter Pan like affirmations of the (pirate's) life of adventure. I liked it. I liked the gush and mix of narrative. I liked the appropriation of Almodovarian values. But I have to say that no one knew how to leverage Penelope the way Pedro can. She is not inventive like Johnny and Geoffrey. She is a vessel, a vulnerable vessel that can be filled with female assets. But she has to gather that from the environment.

Men in Black 3," Griff
","When I started this IMDb-commented study 14 years ago, the notions of folded narrative were commonly used, but not so open in the industry. Now look where we've come, to a state where it is mandatory for a blockbuster investment. You know something has passed its freshness when even the common term for doing so has 'jumped the shark.'The folding dynamic I'm talking about is the simple trick of putting an audience member into the story. The theory is that this helps us get engaged with the story. It is not a dumb idea; with film, we really do have a body of evidence that this — in many varieties — actually works.But this particular device as handled here seemed a bit desperate. I suppose that is congruent with the general feel of desperation in the project, desperation to recoup costs.Our on-screen surrogate is a character named Griffin. He is from 'another dimension' and can watch and rewatch, coming to story knees that he likes. He announces when things are getting engaging. 'Touching' him allows sharing with his vision. Griff has control over his place in time, which place is the main plot point in the story —Why we know this came from a consultant and passed by dull investment types? Because it is so blatant. The actor was chosen because he plays this identical role in 'Hugo.' He is introduced to us at a party at the Factory, where Warhol is revealed to be an actor of the inner story, playing a role. He provides a device that locks and preserves the world of the story.Two other factors are possibly subliminal influences...I am writing this comment on a visit to LA, specifically to a neighborhood where these types of consultants live, 'observer consultants.' The area is 'the observatory area,' Griffith Observatory. In the comic 'Zippy the Pinhead' a character named Griff frequently looks down at Hollywood goings on with a telescope from the observatory.A deeper connection with the name is the griffin. This is hybrid creature invented by the Achaemenid Persians (Darius, Cyrus) whose culture was deeply folded. The Griffin (half eagle, half lion) was a symbol inspired by the Zoroastrian (the original Zoroastrians) notion of a being that can see and control itself, that good 'speaking' had both a story and a story about a story. The entire notion of two-worlds, two logics was destroyed by the Greeks and replaced with logic and truth. But the notion persists in folds in literature.Lewis Carroll reconnected the beast with the role in his Alice works. As I say, the level at which Hollywood works is more Zippy than Achaemenid, but that connection is there.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",Null,5,10,27 June 2012
The New World," Matoaka's Second Miranda
","Malick's method is to frame films as remembrances. Remembrances of romantic notions, whether freedom, peace, war or love (as his four films trace). This way, he can exploit a languorous floating through remembered reality that never is that gentle or considered in actual reality. He can use his narration as things remembered, floating over the sights. To make this as effective as possible, he plays all sorts of tricks with the sound, having different boundaries of different types between what you see and hear.Added to this is a considered approach to framing. You may have noticed that most filmmakers stage the action as if the world arranged itself to fit nicely in the window the camera sees. It makes for nice pictures and clear, precise drama, but we know it for what it is, a theatrical device. Malick is like Tarkovsky; he likes to discover things and if the way the world frames things so that they are off the window we see, so be it. That's why his battle scenes are unique. With most directors, you'll have smiting and dying nicely so that we can see it. Or alternatively, we'll have point of view shots that are hectic as if we were a participant. These two battle scenes have the camera as a disembodied eye that shifts about as if it were the eye of dreams, or nearly lucid recalling or even retrospective invention. Sometimes hectic as if it were point of view, but never looking at what a combatant would, instead having a poetic avoidance.I first met Malick when he was a lecturer at MIT and I a philosophy student. He spoke of French Objectivism, and was clearly bothered by how the notation and language constrained the ideas. At the time, I was doing my thesis on Thomas Harriot, who is the hidden motivator behind everything in this story  the real story. Malick never saw the thesis because by the time it was finished, he was off to explore this business of experiencing from the 'outside' in cinematic language.But Harriot is likely the inventor of the 'external viewer of self' notions that Malick liked (as they reappeared in the French '60s) and uses in his philosophy of film. Harriot suggested he got it from the Chesapeake Indians. So the circle closes: a film about a people using their own mystical memory-visions.If you take a little time to tune yourself to Malick's channel, you will find his work to be transcendent. I consider this one of the best films of 2005, despite its apparent commercial gloss and the mistaken notion that most will have that it is a love story. It is about remembering and inventing love in retrospect. A world is always new so long as the imagination of recall is supple.+++++++++The rest of this comment is of an historical nature. The love story is made up of course, but that's apt for a movie that is about invented memory. The Indians are mostly wrong, the body paint, hair and dress; according to the only document we have, the John White paintings, men and women were mostly nude even in winter and prided themselves on tolerance to the cold. There is no mention of the famous local hallucinogen, cypress puccoon which was widely traded and how a stone age people were able to survive in a land a hundred miles from the nearest stone.(My original comment was deleted, presumably because there was a note about the unpeaceful nature of the people. Readers may want to consult good histories for that.)Harriot (a scientist and mage) wintered over with a nearby 'holy' tribe in 1585, and after he left, Powhatan destroyed the tribe lest they combine their magic with Harriot's and overcome his stranglehold on taxes. He married the wives of the chiefs he murdered. Matoaka (Pocahontas) was almost surely the offspring of this union and it is why he sent her as a naked 10 year old to negotiate with the Jamestown settlers, who Powhatan thought was Harriot returning.Powhatan never exiled Matoaka. When negotiations with the settlers failed, he married her off to a satrap in the north to expand his empire. From there she was kidnapped. When he knew that Rolfe had shamelessly promoted his marriage to an Indian princess and arranged an audience with the King, Powhatan sent the two holy men to accompany and protect her, those you see here. She presented to James, her father's cloak that is also shown in the movie. It was designed by Harriot for the his host, the husband of Matoaka's mother.The scenery is very accurate and was filmed where things actually happened and in a few spots within a few hundred yards of where Harriot wintered over (and I now reside).The Harriot/Matoaka story is a key source for Shakespeare's 'The Tempest,' and it is likely that Shakespeare actually met Matoaka when she visited Harriot. One of the accompanying Indian priests had an argument over God with a Nixon-like cleric who subsequently published a list of all the demons thus mentioned. You can see that list of demons appearing throughout 'King Lear.'Viewers interested in racial matters may be interested to know that by the time of these events, Spain and Portugal had already imported over a half a million African slaves to South and Central America.Ted's Evaluation -- 4 of 3: Every cineliterate person should experience this.",Null,130,214,10 March 2006
Scarface," Three Men of Excess
","Spoilers herein.This may be Stone's best screenplay because it allows him to color big and be vulgar. And this is just exactly what Pacino does best: come down on a part like a sledgehammer -- not acting so much as pounding. I find both of these guys boorish. But watch what dePalma does with them.
Pacino's excess maps directly to Montana's excess -- both acting out the same role. dePalma keeps his distance from Pacino, holding the camera outside his space, never sharing his perspective. This is the first time that his camera's swoops and pans start to emote, to add substance to the narrative, to actually paint. This is where he gets his legs, leading up to what I think is a high point in cinematic painting: `Snake Eyes.' No one can do better without stealing from him.Excess -- so it matters that the substance of the film are the three American excesses: the Latin manner of self-satisfaction, the gangster ethic of gimme, and the church of drugs, all of which underlie the peculiar religion of the US. Stone does a good job with the tension among these three. Latin sex versus unsexing coke; American opportunity versus the destruction of success; violence versus humor well before Tarantino. dePalma uses each excess in his style: sometimes with great effect. The sets are so theatrical they approach fantasy; the moves of the camera are greater when the architecture has grand features. The moves are duller when Montana is. The cutting jumps when he does, as in the first interrogation, and when he argues with his mother over the sister.The best sequence cinematically (to my mind) is the attack in the Babylon, with the pans and mirrors, but there are other fine visual treats here. Credit the director. Most films are about other films -- this one is largely original sofar as the visuals and is the root of many that followed, including some of dePalma's own.Pfeiffer should be great, but she's merely pretty. Her thinness of presence is just right for the trophy girl who wasn't there, and she only gets by because the character is perpetually stoned. Wonder if she ever suspected she was being used that way? Mastrantonio has much more fire -- central to making the final sequence nearly work. But I guess it is hard to build a career on that. She pretty much faded after Scorsese's `Color of Money,' used that fire the best.",Null,22,33,17 April 2001
Frost_Nixon," Rehabilitation of the Dead
","I am always happy to be proved wrong when I am negative. I did not believe it possible that Ron Howard could make a film that is remotely watchable, especially since he figuratively married Brian Grazer. The two together have such an insipid work view that even with potentially weighty material what they give us seems to be from a world made up on a schoolbus.But this is very effective at what it attempts. Its a very simple dynamic, but it has significant resonance for someone my age. He manages to hold the tension all the way to the end, and that's no simple task. I think that the way he has done this is to put himself into the Frost character: a thin intellect struggling publicly with difficult ideas and complex situations. I can easily imagine that the struggles he had with trying to guide Langella into complexities.Fortunately, Langella has already done this part  without the hulking posture  in the superior 'Starting Out in the Evening.' Even more luckily, the Watergate situation is one of the best stories in politics, newly reborn as the US struggles with how to handle the crimes of its 43rd president.And more luck: the situation is inherently cinematic because its a story about a similar goal: how to reveal a complex truth for the camera. So generally, Howard is able to keep himself focused. But there is one element where Howard/Grazer just cannot help themselves. They have to add a pretty girl who appears only for this story (she is met on the plane on his introductory trip). She them provides the domestic support that seems to be at the foundation of every Howard story. She is pretty. I last saw her in a story about a college quiz, where she was 'the appealing one.' But here she is a distraction that doesn't fit, a long answer to a simple question. Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",Null,8,16,1 January 2009
Walk the Line," Performances
","At one level, this is the same old thing: success, booze, redemption, comeback. Nothing new at all here and the history changed to fit the formula. At another level  the one most moviegoers will see  is a concert with background intended to make the concert richer. If you had ever seen John and June perform, you will know that this movie version is a whole lot better. And you may also admit that the reason you went to see them wasn't because of their music, but because of the whole story of them and what they symbolized -- and how that colored the music.In other words, their lives were deliberately part of the show. They made it so, even punching up John's ex-con status and other tough guy attributes. The whole Carter family developed this as a marketing strategy long before John appeared, though their lives were artificially made in the mold of wholesome, white Baptists.So, if you follow these things, what we have here is a nice construction: Two stage performers who make their lives part of their performance, portrayed in another performance (the movie) that features the reverse: lives illustrated through stage performances. Managing all those layers as they have makes this mildly interesting.And the surprise of Reese is something too, though it makes sense if you know the type that southern women played as roles in those days.What's missing is all the interesting stuff. John's obsession with the devil, the theories of his brother being murdered or committing suicide, the long-term weaving of paths with Bob Dylan  holy and otherwise. The debauchery. The deliberate manipulation of religion in the 70s as part of the public relations of his comeback. His phenomenal loss of weight. The rivalry among his touring mates. Deep, deep, rivalry.Now wouldn't all that real stuff have made a better movie than the formula script we have here?As with all big movies these days, you have the movie proper and you have the beginning sequence. Studios (meaning financiers) take these very seriously and bring in a separate creative team, usually uncredited. This opening is far, far better than the movie itself. It has a whole different feel, obviously a different director and cinematographer. Obviously edited by a different crew.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",Null,21,36,27 November 2005
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Intermediaries
","This is a new genre, I think. You go to it not so much for what it is, but what it points to, and what filters have been applied. Perhaps the genre was cemented with the Depp Pirate movies which had noise and story, but both were presented through a filter of ironic humor. That's what we went for.There was nothing new about that, except that they added this bit about the acting. Depp's pirate is delivered to us, not as a traditional actor would, nor even a comic. (Think about how Monty Python did pirates.) The innovation with Depp was that he delivered the character by going around the barn and filtering it through multiple culturally-rooted references. That business about Keith Richard was just a way of naming this prismatic presentation style.The only other male actor capable of this is Downey. He has another franchise where he plays things the ordinary way, the Bruce-Willis-winking way. Here, he can out-Depp Depp. It is because Depp's sponsors have commercial intent outside of the film, in amusement parks and associated merchandise. Downey's sponsors keep it all in the film; they just want as many viewer dollars as possible.So they can leverage three other properties of the film by this overt filter method. Of these three, one has appeared before, probably best identified with the Bond franchise: the extreme situations. These are not effects like those of 'Lord of the Rings' or 'Avatar,' which enhance the glory of the world we see. They are stage shows, more like a Penn and Teller Las Vegas act, where they become characters whose presentation is distorted for our amusement.But they combine it with a specific notion of the camera, an explicit awareness that the camera is there and that it has been spliced onto your mind. We first saw this a very long time ago, and I suppose we have Sacha Vierny, then Chris Doyle and then the incubator of Hong Kong films before it became a staple in 'The Matrix.' Here, we have close examination of the details of the chaos around our characters. We even have Downey running through strategic events before a fight. These are not happenings in a fight as much as they are our anticipated visions.Lots of films have these three intermediary type folds these days. But this franchise has something the others do not: a well understood, almost archetypal story foundation. This isn't just a character to play with, like Ledger's Joker, it is a whole story about storytelling, our first and still strongest. So Downey can honk around within a larger honk-structure that the filmmaker is managing. He had this in 'Tropic Thunder' but that drew on thinner, more comedic foundations. It never referenced war, rather starting with intermediary: war moviesThe Holmes foundation gives us access to the idea of understanding and stating the logic behind why things happen and what moves people. That's gold in this business of building layers to look at the layers that look at things, especially when our on-screen surrogate is so deeply embedded in the story.An example of how this pays off: throughout the film, our Sherlock works out all the moves of the fight to come, and is therefore victorious. Midway through the film, his predictions are cut short when Rapace's character surprises us and him by unexpected intercession, so that sets us up to read these predictions and predict how they will play out.At the end, we have a battle of minds between Holmes and Moriarty where what we see is not the fight itself, but their shared anticipation (dare I say a game of shadows?) of what will happen and how each will outwit the other. The fistfight is there of course. So is a chess game. So is a similar game of war involving monarchs and their strutting ambassadors. So is a deeper game being played involving finance, power and influence. And - later - we learn so is a game to con Watson (and thereby us) into thinking Holmes dies.(There are touchstones in the original Holmes stories for each of these.)That all four of these filtering processes have the same, coherent style, even down to the film-page metaphor of the credits and the comically heavy score. But notice that final detail: there is no reason in the story for our seeing Holmes' strategy and not seeing the whole thing (with the oxygen mask). Nothing in the story, no strategy in the game, would be changed if Watson knew.But that would defy the overarching fold, which no modern film can ignore: noir. Watson has been captured and manipulated (on his wedding night!) for our amusement. So if we are playing a game, then the film has to keep from him and us a key element.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,7,16,17 December 2011
The Incredible Hulk," Panel Pens
","I'm not sure what it is about Marvel comics that turns their movies into unsuccessful films. There's some profound consistency in the approach. It clearly originates in a specific concept of what the essence of comic books are about so what matters in translating to the screen.My theory is that Marvel had a fan base in the 60s and 70s (when the form we see was established). The fans and artists reinforced a style which was more spefically rooted in the comic books of the 30s before comics became essentially cinematic.I'm talking about superhero books here. DC was the first to become exclusively cinematic and the first to market that to TeeVee and Movies, which in this context are equivalent.It's precisely the uncinematic nature of Marvel that made them successful as books. The design of the panels is profoundly static. The postures and even the builds (which are the main defining characteristics here) are not derived from any stage. The physical humanness is deliberately removed so that the characters and stories can be more abstractly pure.It's the same crowd that is producing these movies. Unlike, say the Batman series where artists are given great freedom, this production shop controls the approach tightly. That's probably good for the brand, but it makes for pretty tepid movies. Oh, these can be as loud and colorful as the next guy's. But they will never have the power over the soul that  yes  the comics have.And gosh, if Liv Tyler's job is to just look appealing, why would they photograph her so poorly?Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",Null,7,12,23 February 2009
The Monuments Men," The Diary
","I am thankful that Clooney is working. I've heard him speak as himself; he is a good man, interested in good things. I forgive him his lack of range as an actor, because the characters he plays are so engaging. And he made 'Good Night, and Good Luck.' That film was based on two ideas. First was the notion that a real event is so intrinsically powerful that any reasonably accurate portrayal will allow its fracture of time to be evident. Those were times which stressed the American ideal and good men spoke up. Now are times that stress American values ever so more and the press is silent. So on this score alone he was right in planning this film.The other idea from 'Good Night' is that there is power in words, and to make words cinematic you photograph smoke. This worked alarmingly well. An entire turbine revolves around these two ideas, focused.Now here we have the first of these again. We were at war. Some nations were doing profoundly evil things. We weren't dealing with nuisances, but the loss of our very existence and surely the core of representative democracy. America remained noble, and perhaps the pinnacle of this was the way other nations, cultures were supported. Possibly at no time since Darius have conquerors been so respectful of heritage, even of the defeated. This is powerful stuff, this American history, this notion in our time.The movie should have worked. All it had to do was to focus on this singular ideal.But we have at least three movies muddled about in one mix. I assume this because of meddling by financiers. We have a 'Dirty Dozen' who somehow represent the hundreds who actually were there. This has the required: famous actors giving recruitment nods at the beginning, then antics. We have the similarly required redemption of souls typical of the genre, but done without the usual wit, grit and score.We have the story of two artistic objects, elevated among others because religious art can be surrounded with cinematic gravitas where more direct soul-to-soul touching could only be cinematically convoyed by a film that truly is transformative art. This component is also profoundly weak. We never care.Buried in these rambles is a third movie, a whole movie apparently shot independently. This is so sublime, so powerful that I am recommending the whole thing to you. The story is simple: a Parisian curator is recruited to help Germans steal art on a grand scale. (This was Germans, not Nazis, and was general theft but here we focus only on the art.) She secretly keeps records in the hope that it may be returned, even though many owners were murdered.Once she is discovered by our heroes, she doesn't believe they could be so noble. Surely, she believes, one conquering army will be be as appropriative as another. She comes around when the ideal becomes real, and helps. She is central to the successive recovery of much, before the thuggish Russians arrive.A simple story. All Cate Blanchett had to do was show up and walk through it like the others. But no, she is riveting. I couldn't breath when she was on screen, so taut was the space around her. It almost seems that Clooney engineered three levels. One is the memory we carry of war films. A second is a sketch of a war movie as background to this powerful third level of the woman's story.Cate's character is drawn with many unknowns. She is without a partner, steeped in tragedies that we cannot know. She is hungry but reserved, steaming but tacit. All her pains are channeled into deliberate, constraints that we see in every motion — and later in the precision of the diary. (Whoever made this prop deserves an Oscar.)It seems that both Clooney and Blanchett studied what worked in Schindler's List, where it wasn't the investment in speech that anchored the story but the creation and honoring of a document. The document (her diary of the thefts) then inherits all the qualities of the irreplaceable art but distilled into something to build a cinematic situation around. This is truly an achievement.Oddly, the whole enterprise is framed by Clooney's character presenting to senior politicians, first to propose the (reluctantly approved) saving of art and then to report the successes. I don't think anything like this actually happened. The dynamic was that the war effort was not a success because of armies, but because of the inventions of civilian scientists and engineered manufacturing miracles. War is always about the technology of destruction, so is at root about harnessing genius.After a certain point, keeping these folks engaged meant building some healing into the enterprise. Simple as that and a far better story.",Null,1,1,30 December 2014

Then if they do well, it somehow reinforces the schools' identity, even to the point of increasing in their mind the value of the education. I'm not kidding, if you don't know the US system.Similarly, if a few gymnasts go to the Olympics in the name of your country, they somehow reinforce your national identity when they win. That's because both the universities (excepting MIT) and the Olympic community have shamelessly exploited the assignment of self.This film is strictly formulaic, but expertly edited. The skating camera-work here is the star and gives a thrill. This is very much in the tradition of 'Red Shoes,' in how it blurs the line between the watcher and the dancer.That's the point of this. It plays off the political nature of the game. It begins with an effective collage of cold war related political images - not images of events so much but images that have become tokens in their own right. Prominent shots of the World Trade Center are included. The idea is clearly that if the US can beat the Rooskies, then any miracle of victory is possible.So we get the 'Mighty Ducks' story, except these kids get motivated by representing the US against their militaristic Soviet counterparts. You will get excited by the game, and likely feel dirty as a result of having been so jingoistically manipulated.Here's the thing that interests me: how the story is folded into the manner of its telling. Disney's method is to drill, drill, drill so that the competitive 'play' becomes natural. The idea is to not be particularly creative, like the 'All-Stars' are.

","I did not enjoy this, which is a rare thing among so-called con movies.The idea in con movies is that there is a game among certain players, at least including the writer and the viewer. Sometimes there are on screen detectives and discoverers as well. We have those here in Tucci's detective and the 'girl next door.' And then there are the marks. When you have all these folks as discoverers of the real story, there are all sorts of opportunities for us to be fooled. Its the detective genre with multiple facets. In order to be effective, you have to have some things be very 'readable' and others unexpected and novel. In this case, you have at least 5 cons, possibly seven. But they simply aren't fun. I think it is in part because they aren't different enough from each other. More important is the apparent rule that when you have several 'semantic distances' (that is: the distance between discoverer and the discovery), they all have to be the same. Lest you think this is something impossible to see or measure.In this case, all the cons are of similar types (bad) and different semantic distances (also bad).'Old Boy' despite its other flaws, got this part right, the distance part.

Requiem for a Dream," Cocaine Pi
","There is already a glut of films on drug addiction. Filmmakers love this subject just as actors love to play mentally handicapped characters. In a comment on one of them, I plan to provide a survey of this and how addiction of the subject feeds the addiction it depicts. But not here, because what is interesting about this film is not that Aronofsky started with a notion of a world and might have successfully portrayed it. Rather the interesting thing is that he has a particular style of film-making that seems inflexible, and his problem is to find that one subject that is apt for the style.Consider Terry Gilliam, the visual pythonista. He's very talented in creating quirky worlds with odd juxtapositions of props and sets. And he understands self-reference, the type found in British humor. But his overall sense of profundity is thin, and his mastery of narrative immature. So while his films are interesting in the sense that unlikely accidents attract attention, they are generally disappointing and messy. That is, until 'Fear and Loathing.' That's because the drugged mind is precisely composed of odd juxtapositions and weak profundities. And Gilliam's sense of self-reference (aided by Depp) is able to combine his condition with Hunter's. It works; it works well.Now turn to Aronofsky. He comes from a different visual tradition, one where slicing and dicing is the rule. Its not so much what the camera sees but how it sees it that is important. His first product: 'Pi,' was a spectacular mess. That's because he assumed that mathematically induced hallucinations were something drug-like, and that mathematics was arithmetic, and that the connection between mystical cosmologies and axiomatic dissonance was something simple. No one noticed the lemonade-stand approach, because there may only be a couple dozen people alive who know uncontrolled mathematical visual worlds, and there is scant literature on this to be found.Here, he turns to something that everyone thinks they know: simple erosion of the mind and will from drugs. Here, his cinematic approach is more apt. He shuffles, he jiggles and follows, he splits, he injects a repeating snap when the character does. Burstyn does an Emily Watson and completely bares her pathetic soul, and we are shocked at the supposed cost to her personally. The camera does succeed in intensifying the documentary feel, so the blur between character and actor is increased.So both Aronofsky and Gilliam have now produced, with the aid of talented performers, the one decent film their styles can accommodate unless they mature. What then? Well, in Aronofsky's case, it could be to develop the other thing he has done here -- he has created a somewhat masterful narrative of frustrated dreams. Personally, I prefer the understatement of 'Stranger than Paradise,' to the continual beating of the obvious we have here. But the self-referential notion of the fabricated TeeVee image defining this woman's hopes, mirrored by the similarly fabricated Movee image defining (not merely reporting) the loss of those hopes shows a promising narrative mastery.Let's hope he works on that for a few films and takes the Ridley Scott approach to growth on the cinematic side: do stuff you don't understand and develop the ability to adapt the vision to the narrative, not the other around. Not the other way around.",Null,24,41,12 August 2001
Sucker Punch," Intersection as the Razor to the Eye
","By now you will know that this is a box office flop, presumably because it caters to a demographic that gets easily confused, and the more engaged watchers can't muddle through.I will say that I admire the overall structure. By now it is not very novel, but there are some intriguing touches in the way the layers relate. The first is that of all the parallel lines, the commenting public seems to have all been taken in by the trick of assuming that the first layer you see is the base layer, is reality. In this case, we have an evil man, two susceptible stepdaughters, sexual advance, death and imprisonment of the surviving girl as revenge. She is sent to a corrupt mental institution and lobotomized.In the few days between admittance and cranial invasion (by eye), we learn of a (woman) doctor that uses theatrical therapy.We fully buy that on this foundation, other layers are built as fantasy, the next layer being that the asylum is a cover for a brothel, exploiting the girls, none of which appear insane. In this layer, the girls plot an escape. Most die. A third layer is supposedly what goes on in the mind of our-girl-of-interest while she is seducing patrons in the brothel layer by her seductive, theatrical dance. This has what is considered state of the art CGI battles in different settings. (It is a blasphemy to relate this to Alice in Wonderland, as the PR machine does.)The layers connect at more than a few points, preventing a clean, 'Inception' like solution. Unless of course, the first layer is not the base layer. I believe this was an early decision in the structure, submerged as the thing grew bulk. In fact, I believe this is the 'Moulin Rouge' influence. (The same curtain device is used in the beginning, and the same stage metaphor used to cross worlds. We have the same conflation of acting, inhabiting a life and whoring/dancing.)So it would at least have been mildly interesting to me: a well financed hack using a folded formula with an intelligent heritage. The boring battles would have been tolerable, but what had me wanting to run away was the vile sexism. The first two layers (counting conventionally) treat the girls as amusing property. There is a disturbing tenor in the approach. Okay, we see that all the time and it can be used creatively to jerk us around. But not here.Here we are solidly, inescapably, placed as the male in the audience, drooling over the extreme sexualization of the girl. There may be layers for her, but there are none for us. We are given permission because we are placed midway between where we presumably stay in life and the extreme stance of the pimp. His two-fold extreme exploitation gives us the designed room for simple leering, which we are tricked into.Still, if we had nothing else but that first action scene, minus one trope, I would have been thrilled. This battle is set in a vague Yimou Zhang inspired setting. The heroism, and cuts are reminiscent of old Kar Wai Wong/Chris Doyle. It is not novel but it has some sweep and you do get swept up in it (assuming you have forgotten the prior stuff).But even this has something that offends. I do not know the name of this pose. It is when the hero has jumped an extraordinary distance to enter a fray. He/she has one knee down, the same hand on the ground. The other knee is up and that hand has a weapon. This is the moment when you can see the glower in the hero's face where the environment is about to be justly destroyed. He/she has confidence that you as the viewer will not allow her to lose. Whenever I see this, I choke, just as when I see at the other at the end of an event calmly walking away in slo-mo while some profound conflagration erupts behind, gently blowing hair.A perceptive reader pointed out what he saw as the Henry Darger connection.

","What do you do with a modern western? Since now, few stories can be presented without some nod to self-awareness, you have to update it somehow to incorporate perspective. One solution is what we have here.If the normal mode is that the viewer captures him or herself in the power of pure, abstract story in driving life, then the obvious next step is to have a character captured by story. Its what happens here.Crowe plays a typical outlaw: so bad he's a pure fit for the archetype and therefore good. He's so opposed to the law of the land that he strictly follows the law of the genre, which in this case is the law of the medium. He's placed himself in a situation where he can reinforce his own story. Its why he lives.Meanwhile, he encounters a farmer who we have gone to great lengths to understand that he is without story. Moreover, his teen son is engaged as his designated watcher, and we learn that the son believes there is no story there. What to do? Well, we have to have the bad guy, who owns the story by having mastered it, write the story for the farmer.Its an amazingly simple construction, but apt for the genre.I imagine it is delivered well enough. There isn't much cinematic novelty presented or required. In fact, sticking extremely close to the old, established shots and mugs is essential to the project.

The Sound of Music," The Goatherd Watches
","After the relative disaster of 'Mama Mia,' I watched this. I was convinced that the way that was made was drawn from old musicals like this. In particular the first number running through the woods was from this (and copied in countless other places).On watching this old gal, I was surprised both ways. Most of it is far worse than I remembered. I mean both that the cinematic methods seemed more tired now that we can see how limited it is. I also mean that the thing within, the story is meaningless. Is this how we think of falling in love today? Probably film romance comes through just as small an aperture now, but the notion here seems too direct.But it was also a surprise. There's one scene I had to watch over and over again. Its the scene where they give a puppet show to 'The Lonely Goatherd.' Its absolutely amazing, everything about it. Especially notable is the visual rhythm which is composed unlike anything else in the project and I assume was shot and edited by a different crew.Its a performance of a performance, which makes it unlike the rest of the film. The pace is managed differently for each of the three levels: puppeteers, puppets and viewers, but each pace is integrated into the others. Its a small achievement, but its sweet and compared to the rest of the film seems like 'Lawrence of Arabia.'Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",Null,3,12,5 August 2008

","Standard fare: good guy is endowed with superhuman killing capability, presumably used in the past for what the Agency thought was good. In simple retirement, he is drawn by his sheer goodness into massive, efficient elimination of the bad guys. There isn't much else to this.What's interesting here are three stereotypes that have enough currency that nothing has to be explained. Despite what we know of decades of incompetence, if someone is hinted at having field experience, we assume he (or she) is essentially invincible. Is this just from James Bond? Is it a tacit pride in having our guys be badasses? Do some American viewers feel empowered by this? What we know of the Russians is that their gangsters are distributed in small groups and that oligarchs aren't involved. They make their money by state-granted monopolies and the graft, while prevalent is notably non-violent. Yet the mere mention or Russian gangsters with profoundly loyal minions (why?) is enough to assure us that they are worse than any other organized violent group we have.  Tattoos. Now this is fascinating. Most of what we know of the Russians is that they are heavily tattooed. 25 years ago, tattoos and motorcycle gangs were conflated and in films we knew the Japanese gangsters by their tattoos. But today, every kid with $50 has tattoos, and many of them try to project toughness. Is it just that these bad guys have thicker lines and cover more skin?Here, all we have to see is a holdup man with tattoos (and a skull keychain) and we know all we need to.",Null,3,4,2 February 2015
The Longest Yard," 6 Degrees of Separation
","When you watch these things, they provide little amusement by themselves. All the fun is in watching ourselves watch it.What's interesting is that this is a genre twice removed. You start with the sports movie. The formula there is rather strict: underdog or compromised hero, forces working against them in a deliberate way, goodness and godliness equated with something like perseverance and commitment, and the little guy(s) triumph.For some reason this little formula just won't die and I think it is because we have discovered how to make sports cinematic. Or we have reinvented sport to be cinematic: basketball, for example.Because the formula is so tight, you can have all sorts of comedic takeoffs. When Burt did his 30 years ago, that notion was fresh.Now we have a whole new genre to apply, the Adam Sandler movie. I admit I like this man's created persona. He seems to have good intuitions about how to surround himself with elements that support his type of light, self-deprecating humor. '50 First Dates' was in its own way a parody of self-referential cinema, the re-introduction to love each episode. Turns 'Groundhog Day' inside out both in concept and manner.So in watching this, you have several degrees of separation: life, whatever collection of metaphors that sports abstracts from life, movies about that, movies that parody that, and this, an Adam Sandler movie of a parody of a representation of an abstraction of life.++++Since watching 'Bleak House,' I am reminded of how much society hates lawyers. When something is so deep, it takes on a life of its own, beyond stereotype. James Cromwell has made a career out of playing lawyers and men who have power and carry it with a dignified artifice. Dangerous because they know their own fragility. He also does wardens, as here.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",Null,3,7,25 May 2006
Source Code," Time and Times and Half Time
","An unfortunate rule in science fiction is that you have to explain the world. Thus, you have to maintain three story lines. One is the story that you give the viewers to get them from where they are to where the film is. Usually, the filmmaker either calls up a genre shorthand or invokes an all-powerful military or corporate force.A second story involves the mechanics of that world as they develop through the film. Here, the mechanics are simple: you have the real world (of the movie) and an eight minute entry into quantum parallel worlds sharing a common event. As the story progresses, a human mind powered by love is able to shift the layers of that quantum reality. Okay.The third story is what we allow ourselves to register, be it a romance or redemption story — or one of the very few other options in the sellable storybag. The goal of a talented storyteller (at least in this market) is to enhance the engagement in that third story by folding the second and possibly the first by some shared structure. Think of '50 First Dates' which successfully merged all three and teased us into investing in the romance beyond the barriers we normally would erect.Now this. These three story threads coexist in the same ninety minutes, but otherwise they are distinct. The first is a cheat: military technology don't ya know.The second is also a cheat of sorts because the parallel quantum folds aren't used narratively. We have the faint impress of a detective searching, plus some explosions. Chicago is made safe (in one of the parallel realities, but not the one we started in).The third story is perhaps the biggest cheat of all, the romance: boy falls in love and gets the girl. But how? Why? There is no seduction, no pull, no engagement between them or between the couple and us.'Inception' is sometimes criticized for being sterile. It wasn't for me because I was able to ignore Hans Zimmer's hospital machine drone, and surf the resonances among the three stories and their surprises. 'Groundhog Day' was a success because of its uncomplicated harmony among the three (the first alluding to camera magic).This is a disaster.

Skyfall," Hacked Screens
","Gosh, what a difference it makes when you bring in real artists!Here we have essentially the same formula as always, produced by the same Broccoli thick heads as usual. Also, as usual, the production was 'troubled,' with fundamental changes occurring well into production. Plus for the first time we have blatant, distracting and excessive product placement. But the project works for me because the center of gravity has shifted.Not every sequence could be affected by Deakins. The outside action sequences require conventions that are rather inflexible artistically. I doubt he even saw them. But boy, what a difference a master cinematographer can make in scenes that actually drive the narrative. Two struck me as masterworks of set design combined with camera-work. One was the scene in the glass skyscraper in Shanghai, including the establishing shots. There was much of Orson Welles' 'Lady from Shanghai in that, but done with more energy, and yes even competence.The other sequence is where Bond, bound to a chair, meets Silva in a strange computer room on his island. Where the Shanghai sequence was without words, this is full of them. The set is largely defined by what is not in it, including the supposed supercomputer equipment used to control pretty much anything. More about that in a minute; the item of interest here is the use of space after we have seen that most of the skin of the buildings has been compromised. Much has been made of how director Mendes has been influenced by Nolan. It is obvious in these two sequences in tone and design, but I see a bit of genius here. A lot of risk in a gadgety genre, where too much information is the norm.Unlike Tarantino who borrows without improving, these sequences at least do add something to the cinematic vocabulary. I see this vocabulary as one of modulated hesitation mixed with unexpected omission. Superficially, it is all about making things a little less straightforward than usual. The way lines are delivered; the way spaces are defined; the balances of greys (where the magic of the lens is enhanced by digital manipulation purely for tone). But it goes deeper than that, as deep as the contract filmmakers have with our preceptive mechanisms.The convention uses a predictable rhythm to deliver information, mostly visual, either in spatial texture, objects or edits. When you dance around that rhythm, the viewer starts to worry whether he/she will miss something. When you do actually omit some details, even if they are trivial, it increases the eidetic anxiety and drives the viewer to be more engaged.I think we can now expect Nolan to be as incorporated in new films as Hitchcock was in his day.I cannot let this film pass without mentioning the computer issues.The trope here is one we see a lot — a supervillian who seems to be able to predict every move years ahead and put in place all the parts to flawlessly execute a complex plan. This, I believe, came to us as a reverse noir — assuming you understand noir the way I do: as control over the universe within the film so that profound coincidences are arranged for our entertainment and poor, mostly innocent souls in that world are jerked around. I built a model of narrative folding around this understanding.A modern version of this has a character on-screen with the same power to manipulate reality, in essence allowing our hero (and usually his girl) to defeat the noir control. It is nice enfolding that allows a talented filmmaker some clever options. I remark on this because this fellow is a hacker, and in fact does all his work via the internet, excepting the one planned killing. Usually, this is where I go nuts.Either it pretends to be real, in which case the depictions grate because film demands that they do it wrong. Or it is clearly cartoonish (like most movie violence), in which case I am convinced I could do it better. But here we go into uncharted territory. This is Christopher Nolan reality, a version of the real world that is abstracted differently than usual. The balance between references to reality and those to genre are different and ambiguous. The actor is superb at being the fulcrum of this balance. Add in that noir complication and we are playing a different game, not one of computer magic in the hacker sense, but computer magic in the cinematic CGI sense.Here is your clue. Our villain is never seen actually working on a machine. This is important because he is partly merged us as viewer and his bending of the world is filmmaking magic. Q on the other hand has to have all the trappings of a computer worker. Sure, he is supposed to be good, but good only at machinery inside the movie world proper. The best he can do is leave 'breadcrumbs' to Skyfall Lodge. He is a simple stereotype, where Silva is not.So it is odd that things shift depending on whose world you are in. I am a computer guy and for me Silva is entirely believable in principle, even while standing in his bizarrely unrealistic computer headquarters. And this even though we know he is an old field agent, guys not known for smarts.With Q on the other hand, we see what he does, including stuff supposed to be from Silva. It is all bogus, as screwy as 'Tron.' I think Mendes decided to make him this way rather than to use the approach Ridley Scott did in his recent Alien film.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,5,13,28 April 2013
50 First Dates," Drew Draws
","Spoilers herein.I've come to appreciate this actress. Women can do things in that space between the film and us that male actors just cannot. Blame it on the feminine nature or cultural imperatives, depending on your views. But there is no denying that the art is quite different for women.Drew is not a particularly intelligent actress, nor one concerned with particularly noteworthy projects. But she knows movies, she knows herself and she knows how do a few things in service to the projects she chooses.And she does choose. These days she is a power in the business and can shape a project, even one initiated and controlled by Sandler.In this case, she works with a simple notion that has depth: movies are never about life, always about other movies. Date movies especially refer to a particular work of love that was invented by movies - and only exists there. So they are about memory. Each visit into a film is a new short term memory that we relate somehow to the frame of our larger lives.In other words, this is a movie about movies pretending to be a love story comedy. It starts with an incongruous James Bond parody, but not a parody to us, rather to another character in the movie. And not just one girl, but many, each representing a genre.

Catch Me If You Can," An Alternative World of Torn Labels
","Spoilers herein.Yesterday, I saw the first watchable Scorsese film in decades, and the same today with Spielberg. Something weird is in the wind.And yes, I know this isn't a `real' Spielberg movie and that he only stepped in after paging through a half dozen directors, and only to protect his investment as a producer, and only because he has no real project underway. Still, I'm surprised. The compact Spielberg usually demands of the viewer is that in return for allowing him to turn us into children, he will expertly push children's buttons. He has been consistent in this even as he plowed through `serious' matters of war and holocaust. All are steeped in juvenile sentimentality. His recent `AI' and `Minority' were solid attempts to escape himself. After all, he knows he will not be remembered well and wants to be before he dies.So even though this is something he stepped into late, I count it as a solid victory for the pressures from his peers to make a real movie, with an intelligent stance. He does. Its not a great movie, but it has smarts. And it is relatively original.The first thing is how he adopts the notion of making the film itself a character. Lynch did this first (to my knowledge) with `Velvet.' Most recently, Haynes did so with `Far from Heaven,' where the dynamics of the story occur not in reality but in the artificial reality of films of the era. So the limits of `society' were the action of the film as a force within the drama. So too here -- to denote this we have the colors of the stock of the era, we have the very air of the film world invading as smoke. And we have the director asking the actors to discard modern irony and act as if they were Michael Caine in the early seventies. `Pleasantville' was another in this line -- the production designer is from that project.The film is set up as a reverse con. We know in the first couple minutes what he did and how the con ends. The traditional con story is a film within a film, which gives the opportunity to make the inner film the character as already noted. It is a clever idea that only could be conceived by someone intimate with shaping film. It makes the outer film more genuine by making the inner one more counterfeit.Then we have the actors. The con artist is the most sought after role in all filmdom because the actor plays a character who is acting, something that allows them to exploit their own experience (often the only real experience these stunted lives have). Decaprio doesn't quite rise to the challenge. We've had one wondrous performance in `Gilbert Grape,' and another intelligent turn in Luhrmann's `Romeo.' Nothing of note since except occasional competence. He is competent here. Hanks gives us his regular routine: he's sinking fast, turning into another Morgan Freeman.The real acting here is by Walken, who exceeds Spielberg's shaping of the project so much that we suspect no one really noticed it made the others look bad. Amy Adams has a passion that Leo lost long ago.Incidentally, we have another filmworld jab at the French here. They really do have thuggish police who brutalize Americans when possible. Film `police' too. And the Mom in real life was a real tart who played a dumb soldier for US citizenship then sold herself to a higher bidder. But why introduce all this without developing it? The man in charge here has a special ax to grind, I think.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.",Null,10,14,25 December 2002
The Hangover," Roofers
","The detective story. We have many cases where humor is overlain.But we have few cases where the mystery involves the detectives. Usually the detective is implicated in some way, or is involved through some matter of honor. Other than 'D O A' I do not know of another film where the detectives were the victims. The jokes work here, as does the pacing. It has energy. But the thing that intrigues me is the mystery. We have a missing tooth and a missing groom. There is an unexplained animal, baby, police car, wedding and pursuer. The setup, with a pending wedding that sets the clock ticking, probably relies overly on us having seen 'Sideways.'The strange engineering here is the distance maintained between the guy world and the girl world. Its too consistent and effective to be mere intuition. There are script consultants for this sort of thing but it is so well integrated I believe it have been there at the beginning. We have the chatty quite lovely bride, steeping in girlie stuff in soft poses. There is a prostitute who factors in the mystery. It seems they had to reach far to find someone as appealing as Heather Graham: needy, attractive, innocent but still a hooker. And then there is the bitch, harder than any stereotype known to me.The result is the reinforcement of the insular pretend work which we enter in order to enjoy the story.

","Sometimes a movie just grabs you.This one is formulaic. I have not a shred of respect for the artists involved, not a one, not a shred. And yet it works for me.And it works even though I am deeply engaged in all sorts of self-referential and 'ironic' structures. This story takes itself serious. There is humor of a sort: Whoopie Goldberg is convinced she needs to be funny, so does her jackanapes thing, but that's IN the story, not of it.It may take a special sort of talent for people to seem like they really are taking things at face value. Demi does this particularly well  something her former husband just couldn't do. What happens for some is that the foundation story is so strong, the yearning so overwhelming that we join in. All the business about money laundering and threats is basically background noise to make things move while we can steep in this notion of love and loss, sustained desire.I admit I cried. It may be because I watch tons of clever movies and simply need a place to pour out.I'm not sure about the development of popular songs in film. 'American Graffiti' was more than 15 years before. The excuse for songs there was that kids listened to the radio. Still here, we couldn't accept a song as simply part of the score. We had to be introduced to it as a record being played in the story, during that erection scene. Afterward, it could be recalled, but only after that literal insertion into the world of the story.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",Null,3,5,2 October 2007

","I'm surprised that Downey has held out this long. At some point, you have enough money and want to return to your art. He says this is his last, and I believe him. What we have in this case is him on his way out, dictating terms. And we have a pretty good movie as a result, far better that the earlier ones and leagues better than the usual Marvel.He booted out the director and got the guy he worked with on Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. That film found a distance between noir detective movies and self-satire that was novel, delicious. It is carried over to here. No one but kiddies can take these movies seriously, so the game is to find that space in between the world you show and the world of the viewer. Usually it has to be reflectively comic. Guardians used that effectively. What we have here is more subtle, letting the genre itself be the joke. It isn't just that the villain is an actor; the idea permeates the whole world.He booted out the writer and got the hot new guy, someone who understands snappy situations and narrative distance. He'll probably burn out, but here he matters.He changed the formula from girl-in-distress to give Pepper some kickass scenes. And finally, he fired ILM and got WETA. So we now have some sense of spatial imagination and adventure where before we had dull bombast.This adds up to a great deal of fun for me. Sure, there are a lot of things that don't make sense and are pretty dull, but they are in different places and ways than with the usual Marvel product. You can't eliminate these, but shifting them is novel, competent, self-aware and appreciated.If he leaves the franchise, he will have done so with some honor, and some demonstration that he knows what he is doing.

The Ring," Well Done Well
","Spoilers herein.I've been following the trend of films about films. Horror is an especially interesting case. In quick succession, we have had `Blair Witch' in which the tape and film embodied the evil and the act of filming brought it into being. That was followed by the even more clever `Witch 2' where the realities of video and film were separate and warring for control over there mere humans. In the following year we had four slasher films which employed the making of slasher films in their plot in varying degrees of reflexive sophistication.And now we have this which pulls out all the stops. In this version, a character supernaturally creates the video. The video plays a marvelously multipurpose role: as a film within a film, as the charm which saves the boy, as the charm which both contains and summons the spirit of the girl, and the useful device of showing it all to us.Along the way, we have heavy use of cinematic icons: water, the ring/well, the tree, the horses, the TeeVee. There is some skillful camerawork and clever use of height in the well and the barn attic room. Naomi Watts stars in her second film of this type where a character creates what we see and what we see is blurred with `reality.'The story is relatively simple: the intrusion of the film-within on the world of the `basic' film, starting with a fly within the video entering the world of the watcher. It all proceeds according to a pretty clear logic with Naomi entering the world of the girl (and vice versa) by steps until we see the daughter conflated with her son. The only breaking of the rules are those darned telephone calls.But the rest is from the self-reference playbook: the husband works in the film business, the wife in the `reporter' business. The sign of impeding death in the blurred camera. The whole mystery is unraveled by finding and looking at newspapers and videos.I saw this under the very best of circumstances: in an audience of about two hundred midteenagers at the 7:30 show. They came in groups sufficiently large to make them unruly and vocal. The swell and movement within the theater was extraordinary, which brings up a quandary fro the filmmakers. The self-reference of the story works best when this will be rented by small groups of teens for showing at home, and the larger market these days is rentals over the theatrical run. But the effect within a theater is notable. Clearly, they have their eye on the rental market because many of the effects could have leveraged the big screen at least as well as the original, especially when contrasting between the contained video and and video taking over the screen. Oh well. This is the first really obvious compromise -- in terms of artistic decisions -- in favor of the rental market I know.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.",Null,6,11,17 November 2002
Spartacus," Fighting the Good Fight
","Spoilers herein.For decades, filmmakers have fallen into three camps:--those that believe film is a simple entertainment medium focused primarily on storytelling--those who function as artists in what they consider the newest and possibly most powerful art--those that recognize the other two, but see film as as a means for conveying a message, beit journalism, essay or propagandaKirk Douglas was clearly in the third camp. A solid American, this is his personal commitment to liberal American values, seasoned by his zionism. The context was a dangerously paranoid government apparatus that was slipping very close to fascism. Douglas was a major player at the time, and he is behind what we see here: good and evil; slavery and freedom; the power of a righteous stand. Not only is it explicit in the story, and his performance, but in the way the film was made and the collaborators selected.  What makes this a mess is that there is a fundamental mismatch with watching through Kubrick's eye. He was brought in after production started and disowned the film on completion. He is clearly in the `art' camp, possibly America's best example. Incidentally, in recent years Douglas has shifted his membership retroactively to the `mere storyteller' role in a speech to the National Press Club and his book.Sort of takes the honor out the principled stand, doesn't it?",Null,11,18,11 December 2001
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Love Conquers
","Of course the story is vapid. That's what kids demand. But this has two things that appeal to me.One is the dimensionality of the thing. I saw it in three D and was very impressed. There is nothing new in terms of the effects. We have your zooming and your stuff coming out of the screen. We have slomo, bullet time and an impressive freeze and pan in the midst of a plane crash. Nothing new but extremely competent. The best equipment must have been used. Some sense was given to depth in the back. For instance, Milla lands a plane in Alaska and we see the foreground crisply and the plane out of focus in the distance. There are many scenes like this where even the CG is appropriately blurred or unfocused. It was thrill and competent. (A water scene must have been largely cut, because it seems unnecessary.) All the situations are ridiculous until you imagine that they must have been that way in order to have the sets and effects.The second thing that just makes me melt is when you have a filmmaker who is filming his lover. There is a tenderness and familiarity to this. Milla knows how to appear appealing, but Anderson does some particularly affecting cinematic caresses. Consider just the opening action scene where multiple Alices, all with superpowers, are attacking the evil group. (They call it a corporation, but there is no indication of corporate qualities.)Her gymnastics are more than what we need for kickass woman action; they are created out of imaginary Millas and imposed on her to make her seem more alluringly graceful than she really is. Some subtle changes in her shape are visible in the CG Alice, especially that superAlice we meet initially. Interestingly, Anderson teases us with his very first sequence where we see a woman's legs. We think they must be those of the starlet. They are — we later know — a quite different shape than Milla's legs, but identical to the ones we see on the simulacrum that follows. Those legs dance, made so by how her lover imagines they would.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",Null,5,12,22 September 2010
Deja Vu," Story in the Story: Tony's Bladerunner
","My regular readers know I harp on and on about the tricks of narrative folding. Sometimes it must seem a stretch, but I believe this collection of devices to be at the core of cinematic storytelling. And others do too, obviously. This time, everything you see is built around this notion.The simplest folding is where the story provides for a movie within the movie, so that we the audience can merge with the audience we see on screen. Its all about getting us engaged; simple as that. I wish we had more films that mattered, that we can actually use in building a life, but Bruckheimer has his place too, I suppose. Especially when a Scott is involved.So what we get here is simple but extremely effective narrative folding, Scott's standard super-effective camera which knows how to be ambiguous in these matters, and both turned to the goal of grabbing us by the throat for a thrill. The fold this time is us watching a crime as detectives, and what we see is a detective watching the same crime. So perspectives overlap and we have several scenes where our screen contains people looking at their screen, notable in the same proportion. And we also have time folding, in fact the designated scientist explains it as folding with a piece of folded paper. This allows Denzel the opportunity to be driving at high speed in two time periods at the same time. Very clever if you must follow the Bruckheimer rule of car chases  that they be spectacular. As with any Scottfree film, you must see it on a big screen, and I say that with some hesitation. That's because I know a director's cut will arrive on DVD. It'll feature some enhanced nudity. Ho Hum, nipples. But I expect it to alter the story the same way brother Ridley's director's cut of 'Bladerunner' did. You will know from the trailers that Denzel's character goes back in time. Once. But you will see hints here of something that has been edited out, hints that he would have had to go back many times, like 'Primer.'When he appears at the hospital, he has a marking on his chest that only an experienced traveler would place, and that isn't there the first time he goes back.. At Clair's house, he carefully moves a glass of water as a signal to one of his future selves. At the marina, there's the appearance of corpse-reducing alligators. Note my prediction on this, I see into the future: Scott will un-dumb down this story.One interesting thing is that for the first time I can recall, Denzel's style of being is appropriate. Less interesting is how Hollywood thinks technical projects like this might look, all nice and neat with military guards all around and no maintenance techs to worry in the background. Nah.Summary: The girl is pretty. The threat has a ticking clock. The folding works and we are thrilled. Washington isn't repellent.

","In my book, Spielberg made one movie worth watching: 'Close Encounters.' Its in the French tradition, and really has some depth. Afterwards, he had a disastrous '1941,' and then his adventure with George Lucas, someone who actually understood how to center on entertainment first.Afterwards, we've been served nothing but polished, empty entertainment, cinematic junk food. This is his first of that period since Lucas. Its amazing success worked against us all because it froze this possible talent in a worthless mode.Seeing it today makes me notice its flaws.

As I write this, she is actually someone in the industry who knows her craft, understands her limits, readily exploits her strengths and seems to do intelligent and hard things.Its sad seeing this, watching a filmmaker die (represented by the 'scientist' who can only watch and record while important things happen without him).

It is not so much that it was perfect, but that we have remolded ourselves around it, as part of the victor's healing.I recently saw some other Bogart films (like `Treasure'), and they amazed me in how poorly they worked. How mannered his acting seemed.We have beautiful faces in other films, even this face (which we still have in Isabella). But nothing seems to compete for the certain archetype of passionate commitment, of pathetic yearning, of immature desire, of refugee desperation.The interior sets -- and how they are photographed -- show a definite post `Citizen Kane' influence. In fact, one can see much of the Mercury Player flavor in these characters, particularly Greenstreet.But you know, this film has so melded with dreams that you don't need to screen it.",Null,13,21,10 August 2001
Minority Report," The Ghost of Christie
","Spoilers herein.Speilberg continues in his reborn quest to be an intelligent filmmaker. Once again, he starts with an idea that is remarkably sophisticated. And once again his biggest enemy is himself as he lards on all the junk he is addicted to.First the intelligent idea. The primary thing an smart filmmaker does is make certain basic decisions about the stance of the narrator and camera. The most sophisticated options are provided by the detective story. In the basic form, the filmmaker and viewer engage in a joint voyage where they both collaborate and compete to invent a world by discovery. But over time, this template has proven amazingly flexible and fertile. For instance the greatest experimenter of the form, Agatha Christie, once wrote a story that revealed at the end that the narrator was the murderer.`D. O. A.' was a sweet turn on the form. In that film, the murdered man staggers into a police station. With moments to live before the poison finishes him off, he recounts his detective work to discover who killed him. In `Minority Report' we have the obverse: we learn early who the murderer is, and the story is one where he uses his detective powers to determine who and why he will kill. In literary recognition of the trick, the head `precog' is named Agatha. (The other two are also named after mystery writers whose styles salt the story.) It is a very intelligent device extended in an even more intelligent, cinematic way: the precogs have visions that are `recorded' and sorted out with a futuristic display. The detective in this case mirrors the viewer who is presented with a collection of visual fragments and tries to make sense out of it. The screenwriter played a similar trick in `Dead Again.' So we have Cruise's detective spending lots of time shuffling through the images, looking for patterns and clues. He manipulates the images physically, which is precisely what an actor does as he works on-screen. Some of this ground was seeded by Greenaway in `the Pillow Book,' where the actor literally had the script written on his body -- an idea more commercially exploited with `Memento.' A fragment on this idea is preserved in the sequence where Cruise's eyes are removed and he is left in a room with huge old films projected on the walls.Add to this the further notion -- dropped in production -- that the entire film may be recalled images from an imprisoned Cruise as he sorts through his own visions plus Agatha's. This trick, used to great effect in `Brazil' and  in another form in `Forbidden Planet' was abandoned by Speilberg because it was `too intelligent' and not entirely accessible to a ten year old, his target mental demographic. Along the way, many similar compromises were made in the name of entertainment: certain thriller and science fiction conventions were adopted and the whole project sunk to just a `me too' commercial product. One great compromise was the use of Cruise, who like Speilberg was a promising talent mired in mawkish self-marketing and reliance on technique.The problem is that if this film is judged as a science fiction thriller alone, it fails. The invented future isn't novel, consistent or even engaging. The chased hero routine lacks control in the pace. The unfolding of the logic is unrewarding -- our iconic doctor of evil inexplicably performed a murder that he is elaborately covering up. When all is revealed, it seems too thin an armature for all the flying sheet metal.Agatha here is played by a remarkable actress who completely bests Cruise. She had played `Jane Eyre' in a vision of the book much like the original idea of this film: she plays both the author writing and the character written. In `Emma,' she was the character ineptly written upon. Speilberg has her stagger in an actorly manner and pop out of the water for amateurish utterances. But she finds all the emotional spaces he can't see and fills those well. Watch her here and in the future. I predict good things.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.",Null,15,22,27 July 2002
Finding Neverland," Still Not Found
","Spoilers herein.Never have I been so disappointed. This movie is right up my alley: I'm studying so-called 'folded' films. A fine example is when you have a movie that has a play inside it and the reality of the two blur, like with 'French Lieutenant's Woman.'This has another layer, the 'neverland' which folds into both. And the physics of neverland contain the mechanism for folding: 'just believe.' Somehow the producers knew that the material required folded actors. These are rare, possibly fewer than ten but include Kate and Johnny. I suppose the producer in question was Michael Dreyer who worked on a very similarly folded 'Iris,' also with Kate. They also made a very obvious choice: Dustin and Christie to represent the 'old' school of non-folding. Hoffman's character does nothing but shake his head over the lunacy of the project.A built in advantage is that everyone knows 'Peter Pan.' And most filmgoers will know some of Depp's man-child characters. Some may even know Kate's first significant role (Juliet Hulme) was based on Wendy.Starting with those astounding advantages, the writer and director proceed to turn fluid motion into mechanical clanking; movement into poses, emotion into cloying emotionalism. These actors must have hated it, as all the blending and folding became telegraphed shifts. This wasn't folded reality: it was quirky imagination.Julio Medem would have made this into a lifealtering experience for all concerned instead of Oscar Wilde lite.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",Null,13,23,21 November 2004

He still hasn't mastered the art of projecting a scene into the next. Moore can carry the focus, but not the focus to come in anticipation.

In Bruges," The Setup
","There are a lot of writerly things going on with this script. Most of them are standard devices. Almost too standard.But there is something I noticed. The spoiler here is that the story takes over by the very end and the structure of the story forces the characters to knowingly act as they know they must. Even at great sacrifice. This works by two means. One is conventional: the code of the assassins is underscored as it is in hundreds of movies. This is supplemented by the nature of the place as a sort of purgatory which has its own rules leading toward passage.But there's a second writerly trick at work here. Its the use of story fragments being introduced at one point in the story in such a way that they are tagged with significance. Then those story dynamics take on a life of their own and retouch the narrative later on. An example is that the threat of a bottle is introduced. Later, that threat appears. Its only done there and a few other times so we can subconsciously read the sense of the story. Midgets dying. Guns in rivers. Written instruction. Weight and climbing stairs. Prostitutes.Of course the all-important film within the film makes an appearance. So this sets us up for the noir-driven ending where an earlier story element inserts itself taking control.Ferrell always understood this method, even as Bullseye. He's good, that one.

Kung Fu Panda," Turtles and Wisdom
","Dreamworks has finally made a cartoon I can stand. It has finally outgrown the limits of its founders, three men an the attitude of good enough. They've for the first time put more money into one of these than in the promotion of it. They've finally weaned themselves from the contracts with Microsoft.Three things impressed me. One was the attention to the characters, at least the top three. This really was world class. You can see it both in the writing and in the subtle way their faces are rendered. No expression is direct or static. Every expression fleets through a number of emotions. Its what good actors do, but animators aren't limited by the human instrument, so can make the expression of expressions more theatrical and therefore more effective. They did well here, wisely focusing on mouths and not eyes. (They still do poorly with teeth.)The third thing was the use of vertical space. They are catching up, and its only notable because it isn't Pixar/Disney. But it means that now even the dullest of animation shops has adopted the rule that when you can, use that third dimension in a way that physical cameras cannot. What they do here is not remarkable compared to what others are doing. But it is remarkable when the fat kid in the class gets interested in aerobics, the laggard thinks being smart is finally coolThis has one well engineered fold. It starts with a highly abstract cartoon. We know it is a cartoon, because it advertises itself this way. Then we are told it was only a dream, essentially the movie within the movie. This is at the same time the real cartoon starts, but we register it as reality. Its a good trick.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",Null,11,16,15 June 2008
Chinatown," Another World
","Spoilers herein.Polanski is worth watching no matter what he does. Sometimes, the film is relatively free of context, like the nearly perfect `Ninth Gate.' But watching those take work because you have to cocreate the world.Sometimes the film is set in the context of a genre where the metanarrative is about how it sets within the genre. `Rosemary's Baby' was great because it played with everything that came before, adding great portions of architectural evil and fey vulnerability.Noir revolutionized film. The detective was our representative in the story, unravelling the order of the world. Noir turned that on its head, directly referencing what came before. The noir detective was still our avatar but was swept up in the world he was trying to understand. Everything happens TO him, not around him.Now Polanski does a Welles and Nicholson does a Brando. Both are techniques of self-commentary at the same time as commenting on the genre. Both are both IN the films and OF film, but until `Chinatown' they had never been attempted at the same time.

Gravity," The Other Red Shoe
","One use of science fiction is to purify the threads of a story by displacing them from the distracting familiar. This gives more than clarity; it often frees the narrative to rest in our souls rather than our eyes, rather like the contra-intuitive dynamics about orbital mechanics. If you speed up, you go slower.This story is distilled. There is no villain, no love dance. We have only three characters. As with many films, the inner crisis of our central character is impossible to film, so we fold it onto an external, visualizable phenomenon but here it is also pure, austere. It allows the story to be independent from genre. So when a saucy astronaut uses a line from Star Wars, we make the connection through real life instead of film-to-film. Of course that guy would say such a thing. When the lost guy, usually the hero, miraculously appears well after we have forgotten him, we have no doubt that this film will not follow the usual trajectory of him saving the 'girl.'So this worked for me, worked in a far better and deeper way than the actress could know. She delivered a simple skeleton: broken woman recommits to life. Perhaps this is something she knows. This viewer embossed his own narratives, and became totally committed himself. The filmmaker understood how to help this, so he creates polar environments. One is celestial and in being full is empty. No sound. No passion.The other is physical environments we only see when purged of the living, but very heavily populated by the artifacts of life. Photos of course, but the power is in the everyday: a dental retainer, mementos from the astronauts' families, ordinary trash. These tell us more about the background humanity than we could have gotten from a few actors trying to collectively deliver the sense of the race.So we can readily put ourselves here. We can readily engage with the notion of needing to fall out of mourning and into commitment. We have something close to a literal birth at the end. These things are very difficult to end well and even here the filmmaker makes good choices.I like that it is entirely cinematic. If we need a fire extinguisher, then earlier we were given in offhandedly. If we need the noir notion of the innocent randomly challenged, we are given it visually — paralleled by the random loss of a child 'for no reason.' If we need the requisite three visual ouroboro, we are given some rather powerful images: the ten minute meditation at the beginning; a lovely, sustained triumphant fetal position on the first accomplishment; a profound fireworks which includes the capsule containing by this time ourselves.We do have precedent. 2001 was a tryst with God through weakness; Solyaris is not Tarkovksy's greatest achievement, but it may have been his most ambitious vision of introspection. The Solaris remake (with George Clooney!) was technically better but with less ambiguous reality. Sunshine was more ambitious than any of them in this regard of inner/outer, but included some 'action' stuff for better or worse.(Try editing that film in your mind.)I saw this in 3D and am profoundly thankful. I never noticed a gratuitous effect, and only once was reminded of the cheap glasses on my nose: when a tear floated close and was snapped into focus. That said...I have written in these comments many times about the evolution of the camera. I believe we are in a state of accelerated evolution in how cameras are used and consequently how we dream — when we dream semi-lucidly. The camera used to be and move where a man could. Then we got dynamisms in the curious and ironic eye. Then we got the sailing and noir camera. They did extraordinary things but never something that a physical camera could not do.Pixar changed this with stances and motion tropes not possible with physical cameras, and we embraced it. Now you can find this in mundane action movies like Transformers. How to innovate? Cuarón does what I think nearly impossible: he gives the supernatural camera eye a curious passion. Where someone else would draw in to display some detail, he withdraws into context. Where another may feign 'realism' he embraces the unreal vision of nature. Where a camera would be expected to be sympathetic, his is cold and vice versa.

Erin Brockovich," Soderbergh Punches the Clock

This film was created by Roberts because she found a character she can do. He dives into the world of bitches, smarmy personal injury and corporate lawyers, and irresponsible companies.What depresses me is not Roberts. We already know her limitations. We've heard this story many times; there's nothing new here. Roberts is no Russell Crowe; `Erin' is no `Insider.' (Why moviegoers celebrate this is truly depressing.)No, my problem is that Soderbergh is an artist -- the whole society loses when he works on tripe. The framing, the editing, the abstraction is so pedestrian it hurts. Maybe this will pay for something good on down the road.But I did get something out of it.

Meet the Parents," Parental Discretion
","Spoilers herein.Movies are seldom about life, but life is often about movies. Most cultural dynamics are fueled by stereotypes and those stereotypes are manufactured for us in increasing measure by film. There's a feedback loop where filmmakers chase formula and that formula follows from previous films and the stuff of this formula in most entertainment is stereotypes.This film is pure drek. The slide of DeNiro from great actor isn't even interesting anymore. What IS interesting, at least to me, is how Stiller is reviving a certain stereotype -- the warmhearted, weak Jew: the oddball anti-intellectual. When Chaplin played the tramp, it was a class thing. When Jackson plays a literate killer, its a race thing. The portrayal of Jews at this level is both: it seems unhealthy to me, and somewhat cowardly, much lower than the septic tank jokes.Instead of the Jew-doctor, Stiller plays a nurse who is belittled by `real' doctors. Instead of the banker powerbroker, we have Stiller easily ridden by the CIA guy (incidentally a John Bircher to judge from his bedtime reading*). His predecessor and still competitor is a Jesus-freak. He is bested by a cat. His name is derided. Shrewdness (that mainstay) is replaced by spinelessness and incompetence. His bumbling destroys an altar.
But he still aces his grad school test, and once away from the WASPs becomes aggressive, so there is some hint that underneath is a `regular' Jew. These films have lots of managers, so surely this is engineered. I can imagine the pitch, knowing they have Stiller who can play this kind of part.
Think about it. Not funny is it?(* For those who don't know, the book DeNiro is reading is perhaps the most influential screed on `global Jewish conspiracies' in the postwar US. Such stuff as: Eisenhower was secretly a commie Jew who gave half of Europe to Stalin.)((PS This comment was written in the same suspicious-of-everything stance.))",Null,14,24,1 August 2001
Se7en," Ed5y but Ordinary
","Spoilers herein.What a great boon these DVDs are! -- where we get to view and review with comments from the creators.Sometimes the creative artist is a poor authority for the depth of their own art. So it is with some interest that I check if what I have seen was what the director thought he put there. Often, I find them simply working on intuition. But the better performing artists are different. They must always intend -- if they do not intend a specific feel or effect then it simply is not there. That's why when a DVD commentary involves an actor it is of particular interest.In this DVD, we hear Pitt, who really commits to delivering, who worries, who prepares, who sublimates self in order to create an image of himself in your mind. And we hear Freeman who is arrogant, demanding of you and not of him, offering a here-I-am take-it-or-leave-it style of acting, which he calls `intuitive.' This really explains a lot for me. It's why Freeman is a negative attractor for any film I consider, and Pitt the other way around.Either way, Spacey is the only one that connects with his character, and he's given a relatively simple job. I admit that this story moved well, engaging by shock and unexpected moves when I first saw it. But on repeated viewings, substantial sloppiness gets in the way. What remains is the very fine lighting. I think `Fight Club,' was much the superior film. This one hardly rates any celebration.",Null,18,31,14 February 2001
I'm Not There," Shades
","This was the semantically richest and emotionally deepest film experience I have had in years. And since I am different now that I was five years ago, it could qualify as near my favorite. It will likely not be so for you, at least to approach the way I did. It seems that you have to be my age, and have lived through the events the wrap this. Also, you have to have invested some part of your personal poetry in that of this man. And finally, you have to be sufficiently cineliterate to follow the amazing shape of the eye-concepts that are serially birthed.Often I say that essentially all films are about other films, rarely reaching life. This does that, reaching life, but by going through, punching through art by force. It presents a collage of images in such a way that we can see through the space in them to truth. Its an amazing feat. But in order for it to work, you have to have those patches sparkle for you.So for instance you have to have internalized Fellini's one masterpiece, and be yearning for decades to escape the now close confines of the imagination set then. Of course when it was new, it was a wild ramble in the jungle, but now turn to tethers in the park. You really have to chafe at what passes for cinematic art, and dream of the next film, the one that will do for us what '8 1/2' did then. You also have to have lived through the blasphemy of the Vitenam war and ideally have been on the 'right side' throughout and still bear the pain of it. You have to  seriously, even though the director is too young for this  have had your life ruined by the revelation of a lying government, coupled with the spinning parade of false hopes from artists, many of whom we still admire. You have to have built your life taking into account mistrust.But you also have to have had this particular dancer as a focus. This man who split into so many men, most of whom were designed to charm, all of whom weren't men at all but crystallized paths to salvation. You have to have invested in a few of these paths yourself enough so that it cost you more than it ever could Dylan.If you have all of these traits then you already have the web on which this tarantula dances. And this will seep into you like some exotic solvent carrying subtle hallucinogens. And it will haunt you forever. Oh, you'll be able to slough it off and pretend that this is merely a clever puzzle of kinematic trivia. But this will hurt. It will hurt a lot, but only because of memories now defused.It will make you soar as well, because it is so massively glorious. Many Dylans, well of course. Different ages, races, sexes. My, surely true.Stories about films of one in another, about hiding from each other, about having sex with and spatting with each other. About disowning, and writing about each other. About one being another's blood, who is the hidden eyebrow of another in a Joycean web, but one that makes sense because it is made out of the stuff that made us.What impresses me so much is that even before this was conceived the filmmaker had to know something like this fabric of selves existed. And he had to  without having lived it himself  develop deep intuitions about how this specific soul danced upon us in music and images. He had to understand how to borrow and bend those images with the music in ways that would make Julie Taymor blush: 'Thin Man' used not for confused sexual tension but the conflating of superficial dylanology with artistic expiration. 'Pat Garrett' as the context for a world rather than the escape from one. Over and over again the juxtapositions of life events, image and music (often performed by others in strange deviations) are all wrong but so right.And then this artist had to see it all cinematically, to send it directly into our soul. I suppose this is a particularly broad leap because of the disconnected way this must have been made. I celebrate this. You might wonder if it worked for someone, somewhere.

Then they, independently, select a film style to exploit, here screwball through Busby (instead of the screwball through Capra of `Hudsucker'). Then they run wild with all sorts of cinematic devices, always cinematic narrative.Of the Coen films I know, this is the most fantastic in terms of shifting realities. Hudsucker shifted often, but only into the `newspaper' mode of `It Happened One Night.' Here we have an arbitrary number of realities and levels, all unstructured which is the point. It is also a favorite because it has Julianne doing what she (and very few others) does best: playing a character who is acting. She gives us herself as the actress, the character as the actress (here an abstract painter) and the quite different character the character plays (the femnist family anchor).

Unbreakable," Night Time
","Why was this made? To establish a new genre, following on the heels of `The Sixth Sense.' Playing it safe, we have Willis again as confused in the face of the supernatural, a knowing boy, a background wife. Right, and a plot twist at the end. Fund it well enough to ensure a high level of craft and produce not just good box office, but also a new Hollywood trend to ride.
It's not going to happen, primarily because this film is just not good enough as an assembly, but also because people can only be freshly surprised once. The last film depended on its writing and the trick of largescale retrospective reinvention. This was a trick of the written word, not something that comes out of the visual medium. In an attempt to be more cinematic, this film ambitiously adds two elements:--An attempt to be self-referential, or at least contain mirrored symbology in the comic book motif--An attempt to build a peculiar world, slightly surreal, presumably to serve as a springboard for plot turns and artsy effectsBut these are implemented clumsily. Part of the problem is Willis. His appeal is based precisely on the notion of an ordinary guy, specifically an ordinary guy in an ordinary world. But the real problem is the writer and we presume his committee of advisors. He is a print writer with a good visual sense. (The scene in the train is very good.) But he is not someone who can visualize the world first and then cinematically animate a story. This trend is already dead, killed by its creator. The comic book thing could have been used well, as it is the root of image-based storytelling. Surely this is what was intended But all we get are a few stares at covers.

Star Trek," Uncanny Valley
","In CGI circles, when they talk of artificial beings and reality, there is a phenomenon called the 'uncanny valley.'The idea is simple. The closer you get to reality, say in a fake human, the more we are willing to believe it, until you get close. Then the graph of believability plummets until you have a human that is perfectly human. Almost real but not quite is the thing we least accept. Filmmakers know that if you fall into this uncanny valley, people will run away. 'Polar Express' is often cited as an example, because if the people had been less people-like — perhaps as munchkins — we would have readily accepted it. Gollum seems real because he is not a person.The whole Star Trek franchise is based on staying away from this valley. It was cheesy by accident at first, but then by design. The effects were obvious, the acting of a particular style. Staying away from all the normal production values make it resonate more clearly; we are fairly adept at filling in the gaps in things like this.The one thing that they migrated to as the thing we were to accept as truly real and accepted as real was the spaceship. As the films evolved, this became more and more of the distraction. It was on the real side of that valley, allowing us to pull everything else on the other side over in our imaginations.But here, this new guy gets the formula all mixed up. This is not Star Trek, but an ordinary action movie with Star Trek allusions — and the same ship.Sure, the thing is expertly delivered, and the time travel tricks are interesting enough to keep us engaged. But the actual story is too close to being real. It tries too hard to matter, instead of being a Trek Fable. So it falls into this uncanny valley, this black hole of near reality.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",Null,29,55,23 May 2009
Fight Club," Flashback Humor
","(Spoilers herein) Films like this frustrate. This is so competent, so engaging that I curse it for wasting the chance to say something memorable, or important or perhaps both.What's good is the way that they've solved the `narrator problem.' here, the narrator has imagined the hero (we find out), which is rather clever. We become cocreater of the hero because the narrator has cast the whole film as a conversation with us to explain the last scene which we see in flashback at the beginning of the film. Along the way, we are reminded that we are messing with the film, and the film with us. This latter goes so far as to have the hero work as a projectionist, explaining cigarette burns. He inserts subliminal pornography, which we see throughout with a longer, more noticeable flash toward the end. When we find out about Pitt's non-existence, it is underscored by images on `video.' Add to that the inherently cinematic nature of voyeuristic personal violence, and this film has us captured.When we return to the last scene, Pitt tells us that the whole thing is `flashback humor,' the most strongly selfreferential trick I know in film. Obviously, the self-referential notion of narrator is the reason for this film. That's why Ed Norton bought the film rights to `Motherless Brooklyn,' which exploits a similar experiment in the narrative mystery. In that case, the narrator has Tourette's.So the film competently captures us, and then what? A wasted opportunity. My major complaint is that this film meant nothing, imparted nothing, only thumbed its nose as if to say: I can capture you as easily as the doofuses in the story and for just as capricious a reason. We deserve better. You with talent should do better.Lesser complaints:Norton and Pitt are excellent, though Pitt has much the simpler requirement. Why waste Helena Bonham Carter? She's got the moxie; she's been memorable before. I think the director just didn't know how to use her beyond a vapid sullenness. Another wasted opportunity.Narrative tricks like this are best when they follow the detective story `play-fair' model. This is what `The Sixth Sense' does. On a second viewing of that film, everything works, but with new information. More, some minor problems become clearer. Not so with this film. The writers have played too fast and loose with motivations. It is rather in the `oh, that was a dream' or the `oh, time travel reversed that' category. And it could have been tidier in this regard without messing anything up.Most every scene was weird (a good) because it ran against short-term expectations. But the scene where Lou and thug visit the fight club is pure stereotype, and predictable. Why?I wish the last scene were more, more something. This is where it really begins to hit you that the whole thing was motivated by an illusion, with as much effect.Bottom line: this film is so good, and its makers so talented that should be held to higher standards. I give it a 9 for competence. You should see it for that reason. But it has no purpose.",Null,26,49,24 June 2000
Akira," Hard Edges
","This is an interesting film. The story is sophomoric and the characters are, well, cartoons. But the cinematic world is interesting. The creator was clearly brimming with ideas, and these are obviously from his print efforts.This was done using print techniques. meaning that the animation is drawn and page-sequenced rather than using what are now common computerized techniques. So this may be the best of the films that are 'hard-edged.'The art itself is all cartoon, meaning each object and person has sharp outlines. This is hardly unique, even with modern (but cheap) animation. But at least here, you have some clever shading and use of complementary colors. Few colors are used throughout. Shadows and blends are also 'hard' of course.More interesting is the hardness elsewhere. Because this is cell art, there is no motion blurring. Its lack is jarring once you've gotten used to films which use it, so because of its age, this film has already achieved a curious antique effect of hard motion. Obviously, the animator was aware of this, because he uses extreme discontinuities between shots. The result isn't just simple choppiness, as others have noted, but a continuation of the punkish style of hard edges, as well as an evocation of comic panels.Stupid story, but curiously stylish, dated animation.",Null,9,24,31 May 2000
Citizen Kane," Narrative and Eye Disconnect
","Spoilers Herein.This an extremely influential film, by one of the very few inventors of cinema. But I do not think it is Welles' best. (That's either `Othello' or `Lady from Shanghai' depending on your religion.)First of all, this is not the work of a genius, but the excellent product of three committed artisans: Welles, Tobin and Mankiewicz.Mankiewicz, with his brother, were the industry's working intellectuals. Here (aided by Houseman), he simply got a client intelligent enough to know what was up. Similarly with Tobin, who was the Sascha Vierny of his day. These two men pulled on Welles, but as we will see, in independent directions.The story, Hearst and all that, is irrelevant except for the notion that a writer in the right place can create reality if willing to pay the price. The acting is fine of course, uncharacteristically abstract -- but that's hardly innovative nor groundshaking. No, what makes this film important are two features, and the failed relationship between them.The first of these is the incredibly complex narrative structure. Things that are normally nested frames: a reminiscent flashback, a text annotated with pictures... are here multiply set up and in turn enfolded into the film proper. We see a newsreel, whose footage later appears in the `real' action; we have a recalled death vision of a childhood but that becomes untenably self-critical; we see her singing and again from her perspective. We have several on-screen narrators but each gets swallowed. There are so many narrative devices at work it keeps us spinning, sledding as each comes into play and is then reabsorbed. The puzzle is assembled several different ways. Nowhere else is such narrative cleverness been even attempted, not by Lynch, Bergman, Wenders, anyone.The other innovation is the breaking of convention with the eye of the camera. The camera takes positions -- physical and philosophical -- that were previously utterly unknown. Previously, the camera was audience supplemented by `context' shots: perspectives that a human observer might not see but that seemed natural. Now, the camera is something unto itself that we have to accommodate. The camera does things no human would or could. It sometimes (often!) sees two things simultaneously, something that never happens with the natural eye. It has a curiosity that we would not have directed. The eye defines the lighting, not the other way around -- here everything is colored not by what it is, but by how the film's eye changes it.Both of these experiments are masterful. They changed the world of films, and hence dreams, and hence all of abstract thinking forever.But the flaw, the lethal problem with this film is that the two experiments have independent lives. They are not coordinated beyond some fairly easy touchpoints and then only in the simplest of ways: an image that is being described by a speaker and the nature of the newsreel. It is as if there were TWO geniuses at work, each doing something important and neither communicating with the other. So when there is a shift or a trick in the narrative, the eye is ignorant of it.But hey, it was just the man's first film. He quickly fixed that in `Othello' and especially `Shanghai.' The merger of eye and narrative is the real revolution. `Kane' raised the question, which is why it is important. Tarkovsky, some Bergman, Malick, Greenaway have subsequently succeeded with this merger using different devices, but the master is Kurosawa. Welles made Kurosawa possible. It all starts here, but only as a promise. In real terms, the film is a failure.",Null,22,36,28 May 2002
The Birth of a Nation," Bad Influence
","Spoilers herein.This film marked a disastrous turn in American society. No, I'm not talking about the overtly racist content. Any nitwit can see that and adjust, though I suspect that my grandchildren will decry with equal vehemence the content of the films I now casually accept. The disaster that `Birth' brought was far more pernicious, subtle and limiting than something that can be recognized and changed by men of good will.This was the birth of film as illustrated books using a slightly expanded vocabulary of the theater. Film could have been a new medium when it was born. It could have been transformational in the way we see the world and reason about it and ourselves. But the birth of film was as a retard, a small adjustment to plays. Griffith was from the theater and successfully found a theatrical formula that worked sort of: a simple play augmented by a context of huge action, here both the Civil War and `facsimiles' of history: things that couldn't be created on the stage. Griffith's formula was only an imperfect solution, but such was the potential of film that 'Birth' became not only an enormously popular film, but also a pattern which still dominates today. We still think of films as expanded plays and demand the same things of them.Some filmmakers (Greenaway comes to mind) have been creating films that live up to the potential of the medium, both reinventing film and fighting the pattern. What a disaster. How much better off we would have been if Griffith had failed to invent his narrative mulatto!Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.",Null,15,33,16 April 2003
Memento," Skin as Photograph
","Spoilers herein.I rate this very high on my scale, primarily for its ambition and intellect.Usually I get annoyed at IMDB comments that report the story as if it were important, but it is here:---Lenny's home is attacked, wife raped, him injured. He develops this `condition' which has no physical cause. In other words, the condition is invented. The insurance investigator (Sammy Jankins), uncovers him as a fraud by using electrified test blocks. Knowing this, his wife challenges him and he `accidentally' kills her rather than face the condition. Sent to a hospital, he escapes and ties up with the cop who investigated the case. Together, they track down the petty crook and kill him. Over time, the condition becomes more pronounced and embedded. The cop (Teddy) is crooked and exploits Lenny in a doublecross drug deal, getting him to kill Jimmy. Jimmy's girlfriend Natalie also manipulates Lenny to first chase off Dodd (who is looking for the missing money). Lenny decides to get even with Teddy, so plants a seed that he will use later to justify killing Teddy.---It is essential to know that Lenny was never an insurance investigator, and that his condition is self-delusional. The order and ritual is not to cope with, but to create the condition. Remembering his wife increases the intensity behind the psychosis -- remembering his investigator gives him identity and focus in refining the condition -- knowing all this transforms the idea behind the film into something of genius.That's because it is deeply self-referential: us looking at a film, especially at a mystery, is just the same as looking at a few polaroids and trying to create/remember a past. Watching movies is self-delusional, and with detective stories it is a game of wits between viewer and writer to outwit and manipulate each other just as here between Lenny and Teddy. (The filmmaker calls us, we shouldn't answer, but we forget.) This film goes further. An actor forms the picture by putting words on it; in the case of acting, the `picture' is the body, so it makes sense for the clue/words to appear on his body.The combination of the three (words on skin, remembrances of images past, the mind duel with the writer) adds up to a pretty mind-expanding framework. That alone transports the intelligent viewer to another world, a shocking world of self. This makes the film important, and an important film deserves criticism.So what could be better?The ink on skin as referential of film acting was done so much more elegantly and deeply with `Pillow Book.' The playing with time was moderately clever compared to the other, deeper games in this film -- but it could have been much more challenging. It could have stuttered (`Limey') could have folded (`Pulp Fiction') could have paralleled (`Run Lola Run') could have spiralled deeper (`Snake Eyes'). Maybe in the next film.I did not think the eye of the camera was very clever. This had `noirish' writing but not filming. More like the later `DOA' in the black and white would have really spun. The dialog and plot were needlessly simple. If I am going to go to the trouble to displace my mind for a day or two, I want it shifted beyond Jupiter. That the story was so simple was pandering to the dumb masses and annoyed.But the biggest flaw was our friend Guy. Moss is not a real actress. Guy is, but he's of the rather simple kind, who thinks he plays a character. Consider what this film is: it is a film about films first, and within that we have a character inventing another character and reality. That's three roles in one. Woody Allen made a similar movie so far as this matter: `Sweet and Lowdown.' It was a fake documentary about a guy who created a stage persona which he subsequently adopted. Simple stuff plotwise compared to `Memento.' But it had Sean Penn. Watch Sean play three roles at once, weaving them into a complex multidimensional space. This film was intelligent enough in its conception to warrant such texture, to have the actor remind us that we are him and he isn't.",Null,28,47,14 May 2001
Inglourious Basterds," Detectives
","There's something profoundly offensive about this. Oh, it isn't the gratuitous catalog of stereotypes. Its the fact that they are stereotypes, unmodified in any way. It isn't that it doesn't move, but that it does so without passion. Borrowing is part of life, but a simple collage is different than a living ecosystem.Comic books are still comic books. The illusion of movement is just an illusion.There are, however, two things I enjoyed.Brad Pitt is amusing, not in the context of the film, but in the context of his craft. He is turning into a worthy actor, taking chances and not relaxing. I cannot imagine anyone else with this range. Chris Cooper? Pitt is not an intelligent man, so he cannot be an intelligent actor and he cannot stand outside this business and annotate. But he can be overtly ridiculous, and that is good enough here.The other thing is the way the film within is constructed. It is as blunt as everything else, but because of what it is, it is fun. The thing is set up for a film within, misplaced. The literal film within is a war film, perverted by an exhibitor. But the real film within is the film of that film's audience, who as viewers have done to them what they celebrate on screen. It is really a very elegant idea, just kicked on our face.Oh, a more structural elegance works a whole lot better. This is not extended from the war genre, but the detective one. Our main character is not the leader of a group of terrorists. but a master detective in a efficient machine that gets increasingly madder as you get away from him. Detectives are our most deeply cinematic narrative flows and QT knows what to do with it.Sure he builds this out of trash, but he lines things up properly, we discover.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",Null,11,23,1 September 2009
Underworld," Underwear
","Spoilers herein.Style and genre aside, the central engine behind this project is sex. This is fine with me, after all we go to films to define fantasy, and we demand ever new twists on what we want.We don't have many kickass female heroines. I suppose the key milestone was Weaver's Ripley. Extremely stylish and dark surroundings, but we knew though she was in the darkness, she was fighting it. This was in the context of Michelle and Julie as Catwoman and TeeVee's Mrs Peel, all in tight leather.Another touchstone was Angeline Jolie's Tomb Raider. All her female parts were pumped up to press upon that leather and give us a Playboy female version of 60's James Bond. In all cases, you start with the female character and wrap in some dark environment. All the rest, story and tone are subservient.What we have here is something interesting. This 30 year old has the figure and face of a magazine model, with the bored flat expression to match. Pour this tight little body into a rubber suit with especially reflective pants and you have something to anchor your movie. Everything else - story, action, mythology etc, was just borrowed.Imagine, a vampire story with no redheads! Just goes to show that no one involved understood the genre. They just wanted to feature that rubber underwear. All the style is simply in support.But to make this work, you have to have a charismatic woman, or an extremely skillful filmmaker. This has neither and likely won't be cited as a touchstone by a commenter on whatever sex role experiment the movie world next produces.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",Null,6,14,17 September 2004
Coraline," Button Wholes
","I believe that the lucid imagination puts their own markers in the public conceptual landscape. Regular readers know that many of these for me are films that anchor personal structure. But I have some books that do this as well, and probably at a more fundamental level. One of these is 'Alice in Wonderland' and it is a minor game to recognize that work in contemporary copies.This film is blatantly patterned after Alice. The two worlds, the vaginal transition. Mirrors, small doors. Animated flowers. Wicked queen. There's the business of returning to the origin by walking away and even the cat that advises. All of those bits are here, plus a dash of 'Pinocchio.' But there is another influence that may not be so obvious to you.I encountered a very special piece of stop-motion work a couple years ago: 'Blood Tea and Red String' which is also derived from Alice, has this surrogate ragdoll notion and also supports a storyline of capture for love. The stylistic elements in this later project clearly were influenced by that film which I gave my highest rating. So in watching this, I touched two of my most important markers, plus having the folded notion of one world similar to the other, but more magical except for artificial eyes. Its an example of Ted's law, one which may help to extend or better understand it.The dimensionality of the thing — advertised heavily in my area — was trivial, uninteresting. It was a compelling show, owing to its structure. But you'll do better to go to the sources, I think.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,5,9,29 July 2009
Shakespeare in Love," A Bad Play within a Good One
","Spoilers herein.This film surely hit a mass marketing sweet spot, I suppose because it was competently crafted, had a twee love affair, displayed some quaint costumes and gave the faint impression that in spite of its fun, it held something important. That last quality is the most important to me, especially when Shakespeare is involved, especially when the writer is Stoppard.Some time back, Stoppard took two minor characters from Hamlet and recreated the play with most of the original themes and many of its metaphors. A key device was the self-referential play within the play. The whole thing (`Rosencrantz and Guildenstern') was brilliant and stands as one of the masterpieces of 20th century drama. Since then his light has mmed.Here, he takes many of the same clothes and tries to drape them on `Romeo and Juliet' to emulate an ordinary date movie. There are some crafty touches in how the play within is bound to the play without, but they are mostly played as jokes. All the intelligence goes out of the concept because the core concept is broken: R&J is Shakespeare's most poetic work. It overflows with ideas - it overwhelms. Here, you have a double reduction: lace is turned to linen so far as the poetry so Hollywood doesn't turn off the masses; and the play is reduced to a love story, minus the drugs, charms, politics, fate, all the external machinery of the original. So one must completely discount the Shakespeare and Stoppard content and think of this film as a common thing.But what possibilities they had! At the time this was set (about 1592-3) Shakespeare was duking it out with Marlowe, by far the better writer. Theaters were closed and they were in competition for Southampton's patronage. The poetry jam was stanzas of Marlowe's `Hero and Lysander,' versus Will's `Venus and Adonis.' Will, who has left an illiterate wife back in the country enters into first a homosexual relationship with Southampton, which then becomes a bisexual triangle with a `Dark Lady,' probably (married) occult siren Emelia Lanier. A way cool lady.This was the time of Raleigh's famous `school of night' which studied the `black arts' and with which Marlowe was associated. (Will parodied it in `Loves' Labors' Lost.') The great scientist/magician Harriot led the school, mentor to Galileo and Kepler. He never published, indeed repeatedly destroyed his notes, because of recurring heresy trials. Similar trials resulted in Harriot's friend Bruno being burned by the Pope, Galileo coming close, and (likely) Marlowe being murdered, leaving the field open for Will. Southampton would later lose his head over this, driving Will deeper into the Catholic occult intrigue - all this recorded in the mysterious sonnets (and later referenced in `The Tempest').Now there's some hot stuff! Wow  what Stoppard could have done! What comparative drivel we have instead.",Null,10,19,16 May 2001
Dawn of the Dead," Scurrying
","Spoilers herein.I really admired how this was constructed and consider it a better film than the original. The deal with that original was the Dead were slow and stupid but incessant and inevitable. Here, the form is reinvented in a new genre, that started by 'Alien' and copied hundreds of times with various alien swarms.The key here is the pacing, which I think is pretty well understood for that escape genre. The enclosures, the secrets, the small scenes of pathos, the innumerable 'them.' The kickoff. And that ending, the one that bleeds into the credits, is a special coda with post- climax superfrenzy.I admit to not being steeped in the Zombie genre, though I recently saw 'Video Dead.' But I think this doesn't qualify. These are scurrying, smart, growling monsters. No, I actually sought this out because of Sarah Polley, who interests me. She is a serious actress who has done well enough in a few intelligent films and following such careers is one of my minor hobbies. She must have done this because it was local. There's nothing of her in this.Also appearing is Lindsey Booth, someone else I am watching, but in this case only because she is a slim redhead. She is slim and redhead here, and little else but provides an excuse for the rescue that triggers the climax. She's the scoobydoo component, and that ain't all bad.The original depicted the Dead as a disease, or diseased, apt to an age discovering AIDS. This one depicts the Zombies as mad, precisely the sort of evil madness we bestow on jihadists. Think I'm joking? Look at the very first shot in this film: hundreds of Muslims praying (in unison, naturally).Ted's Evaluation: 3 of 3-- worth watching",Null,8,18,25 March 2004
Iron Man 2," Dimension
","Common sense hits the front office at Marvel's adventure in movie-making. Until now, they've just made bad films. Bad.The basic problem, I believe, is that the rest of the world is out exploiting the third dimension and Marvel insists on making flat movies. Even Spidermen, where the character lives and fights in space was flat. All of a sudden, Marvel and ILM wise up. This not only matches but excels what we have at this time in terms of complex three dimensional motion. The camera flies. Objects fly and the two weave in ways new to us. The camera is usually placed in some relatively stationary place to allow you to see what is going on. That place is removed from the action. Sometimes the camera becomes or emulates a POV of a flying or moving object as if it is in the action — or perhaps a character. The game in this new future is a matter of combining the two so that it has the properties of both, but is neither. Done well, it generates pure cinematic excitement. Done well, it overwhelms everything else and thrills because it is so otherworldly. It is done well here. Done well. And it doesn't have to be used to cloud deficiencies elsewhere. All is at least competent and some things: Downey, Rockwell and the production design are excellent.This dimensional thing is done so well that it is mirrored elsewhere. Stark's computers have a hand and voice manipulatable three dimensional, haptic, multiaffordance holographic interface. The motion is less important here than the notion of projected dimensionality. His nemesis? Well, he manages an entire army of drones by a single QWERTY keyboard and a DOS-like display. The contrast is, I think a deliberate thing. They would have pimped up Stark's machine anyway, but having the contrast is a subtle narrative reminder of the difference in dimensionality of the thing.Oh, it is also mirrored in the two women. One is a lighthaired, ponytailed redhead who never leaves the plane. The other is a fiery darker redhead with wild hair (in her real persona) who in a remarkable fight scene is profoundly three-dimensional. Samuel Jackson has decided to do anything, work anywhere, take any pay cut to be the face of the master organization that watches us. I think he knows that this legacy will live for generations, planted in juvenile minds eager for explanatory conspiracies. These theories for some reason rarely are discarded as kids age. It is his face now that is often associated with the leader of the new demigods the genre is creating. Smart building of intellectual property for someone with limited range.Downey. What a guy.

Alien: Resurrection," Different Worlds
","Different WorldsSpoilers herein.I've just rewatched `Alien,' `Aliens' and `Alien Resurrection.' Considered simply as films, each is a fine film but they come from worlds that are more different from each other than the normative world of now is to the world of any of them. Just viewing them is a course in filmmaking.Ridley Scott's `Alien' is the most impressive, knowing that it was only his second film, that every effect is physical, and that the budget was so low the spacecraft is cobbled together from used aircraft parts. Even at this early point, Scott has the ability to create a unique look and has the mastery of craft to coordinate every element (acting, score, movement) to reinforce that look. That he chose Giger to base the look on was brilliant. Organic darkness -- evil embodied in living things. The alien ship, though only briefly shown, is a sequence that will live way past the time that the monsters of the series are forgotten; that blending of beast, environment and narrative is unique in all filmdom. Really amazing that the sequels didn't go back to that ship. Scott has grown to be one of our best and most original filmmakers -- Alien and `Blade Runner' (with `Forbidden Planet') are the very best `real' scifi films we have, meaning films that are not just adventure films.Where `Alien' is scifi in the service of horror, `Aliens' is scifi in the service of action. Aliens is a war film, and equally impressive as one of Cameron's earliest. Movement and conflict. More emphasis on the familiar is necessary for this approach, so we see the sets and costumes less adventuresome. This is a thrill which uses the trappings of scifi only as another thing with which to impress. The mood created is projected not into the image as with Scott, but into the theater as something to amaze. Cameron hasn't evolved at all from this film, only been given ever bigger effects with which to amaze. So one might consider this his most `genuine' film.`Resurrection' seems to not be as admired by the fan base. But I think it every bit the equal of the other two. In this case, we also have a new director, a European with two fantasy tales under his belt. But those set a tone that is strikingly weird: the tone not in the setting, but in the psychological space in the story. And that's what we have here. In Cameron's film, every character is a stereotype. Here, every character is an anti-stereotype: the black guy isn't jive; the cripple is the toughest; the sex kitten is a robot... even the hero isn't really. This is also the most cinematic use of the camera, using the psychological eye. Scott dwells, Cameron moves, Jeunet examines. He doesn't mind annotating the past films (rather like Van Sant's `Psycho' annotates Hitchcock's).The only negative thing I note in the sequels is that Weaver isn't adaptable enough to understand and get behind these diverse visions. She understands Scott. Cameron doesn't really care, but she is outclassed by Jeunet.Seeing any one of these enhances the appreciation for the other two.",Null,8,14,27 June 2001
World War Z," Angry Water
","I understand that the development of this was a mess. What mattered to me were three things done well:The transition from normal life to the human waves was jarringly effective. What I expect is a traditional zombie story. Some explanation and setup is given for the impending invasion and then we encounter the unrelenting but slowly moving threat. Here, we have a different formula: one we have tested with Tom Cruise and Will Smith: we are involved in everyday tedium and then bang! Explanations come later.How do you innovate with this, make it more compelling? You leverage the effect mentioned in a moment. A tsunami builds. No one knows what is happening. You only know that people are desperate to flee at any cost and the panic is the initial horror. What could cause this? The pacing is perfectly timed to outrun our ability to absorb what is going on, just as it is for our on- screen folks.Even in the midst of this shared confusion, we note that our hero has a different relationship to panic. (We know he is the hero only because he is Brad Pitt and that this film is produced by him for himself). He alone seems to absorb what is happening faster than anyone else, including us. We see him notice without knowing what he is understanding.This is the highest level of craft, it seems to me, focused on the hardest part of the story, the beginning.A second notable feature is what got this movie made, I suppose. The threat, at least in the first 2/3 of the movie, the original bits, is not zombies but zombie waves. Elsewhere I have written about using architectural water as a threat. A major advance was Perfect Storm and later Titanic where water could be given behavior, personality. Then we had Hereafter, where Eastwood directed a tsunami with intent.What we see here is mobs rendered as flows, and the CG processes being those used for water working against gravity. There is genius in this as well, and a genuine advance in the art. (This comment is on the two-d version. I cannot see how a three-d-ization could improve anything.)We also have a couple sections of good writing (noticed by my writer partner). These are placed where we expect to hear boring exposition, something about military labs or space probes. Something dreary but necessary. The first instance is with the Harvard genius who we are told is our best hope for understanding. he gives a speech instead about the capricious weakness of violent nature. It is a magnificent short speech, and then this last hope is dispatched.The second great hope is also a trope: the Jewish doctor. His speech is well crafted as well. It runs against what we expect from the genre; no exposition. It also runs against what we expect from the WASPy Harvard guy. It is instead a meditation on perception, something which furthers the (at that point still undeveloped) special power of our hero.This thing falls apart in the ordinary challenge of wrapping up a story. You can tell where a weak last third was pasted on. Now the zombies become individuals again and the storyline stops countering the genre. This is tense in the traditional way and works, but is far from the skill level of the earlier decisions which placed us in a new place concerning our view.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,3,7,11 August 2014
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Puppets
","This has jokes that often work. It has a genuine pathos that is surprisingly rare and is now the trademark of Apatow productions. It has Hawaii and two women, one pretty the other a beauty. It has a deftly comic foil in the 'other boyfriend.' It has some frontal male nudity that probably should be commended simply because its avoidance is ridiculous. Here, in fact, we have it twice and though it is meant to punch up those scenes, I found that it actually was dramatically integrated.But because I am a narrative folding nut, I'll point out the three inner performance folds. The girlfriend is a TeeVee star on a show for which our hero writes music. Her inner role reflects on her outer one.The other boyfriend is a British rock star, whose onstage persona is mirrored in his character in the film. And the thing ends with the hero's play within the play. In this case it is an extremely clever musical comedy derived from Dracula and performed by a mix of puppets, humans in costume and the participating puppetmasters. It is really quite wonderful by itself and after the story ends, it is clear how the whole project grew out of it. The integration of the idea of a love that 'smothers' is brilliant.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,3,6,3 August 2009
12 Monkeys," Brass Monkey
","Spoilers herein.Terry Gilliam disappoints. He makes a competent film. He often folds narrative through time as he does here. He uses architecture as a central element in his shots. He is bold with camera perspectives. He creates alternative and strange worlds. He often deals with class actors who do their best work for him. He tweaks the scifi genre in sort places. All of that is true here. All of that is stuff I like.But this film has no coherence. It is not enough to have a clever space and a clever camera angle if the aren't coordinated to create some effect. It is not enough to have Brad wonderfully careening if your eye isn't in the right space. There's just so much good stuff here all jumbled about. Little is controlled or exploited.I contrast this with `Fear and Loathing' which had several advantages:--Gilliam knew he screwed up on this one and was smart enough to know what to fix--He was able to write his own script. This one has two many literary devices to comfortably be shoehorned into a novel cinematic framework.--He had Depp, who understands how to act in a way that defines the space the eye only imagines. Depp's character was hallucinating and the hallucinations mapped well to Gilliam's sense of an alternative universe.Not here. Willis and Pitt work really well together, each at the end of explored personal territory, but it isn't the same territory Gilliam shows us. Hitchcock -- who is relied on here -- affirms reality instead of redefining it.Usually I can find some clever self-referential irony in this: a story about dissonant perception told in a manner that is perceptually dissonant. But it seems too competent a notion to put on this project. Things are different with `Loathing.' Better.One think: I kept looking for someone to say 'minkee' after Peter Sellers' famous, Python-inspiring bit in 'Return of the Pink Panther.'",Null,6,12,29 May 2002
Au Revoir les Enfants," The Artificial Real
","I've saved this for some time.Louis Malle in two of his later films changed me. 'Dinner' and 'Vanya' were remarkable for being extremely layered, very much aware of itself as film drama. I delayed seeing this because some of his other films were significantly less impressive, even ordinary. This is his most straight-ahead film I believe — straight ahead in the sense that you are intended to simply fall into the reality of the thing with the camera and any dramatic convention as irrelevant. So careful is he to be without artifice that he sacrifices all the devices he could have used to engage us. The thing is quite simply narratively incoherent.The coherence and power is supposed to come from outside the film. We are told that these events really happened as we see them, that he is the boy who is the narrator, and that the entire film exists only for the final scene. There is no need for structure or storytelling when you have those two qualities. I have to admit that the last scene does have power, both because of the way it unrolls and the fact that we know it happened — that cruelty comes home. But you have to pay for that by sitting through what amounts to a boring setup; old man memories. Just because something captured the storyteller when it happened, doesn't mean it should be part of the story.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",Null,5,9,8 January 2010
Shaun of the Dead," Looking Down
","Spoilers herein.Movies are nearly always about other movies, and here's a great example.In this great piece of writing, we have explicit nods to three layered worlds. There's the world of the viewer, from which the simple artifacts of troubled relationships are drawn. At a rather precise rhythm, this is brought to the front, no matter what else happens.Then there's the layer of the pubgoers, Shaun and girlfriend. And under that is the world of the zombies. Ted's law is that when you have a film within a film, the abstract distance between the first and second is exactly the same as between the second and third. The film starts with Liz telling her boyfriend that she doesn't want to be with him any more because she is afraid she will become a zombie. The boyfriend goes around the room and takes apparent zombies and makes up a film for each one: gangsters, porn and so on.Then, we fall into a movie within the movie as effortlessly as an unwanted, even disturbing song comes up on the jukebox.

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Edges
","Smart movies always have a seed. If you want to read them, it always pays to start from that seed.Disney has been very smart about those seeds in the past, and they may be entering a new age of power in this regard, now that at least one of their research ideas has born fruit.The seed in this case comes from the business reality that Disney has a special way to leverage movie franchises through their themeparks. The question is: what cinematic effects can you put into a movie that will stick in the popular imagination AND be exploitable in a completely different domain, the one of physically built rides, what they call 'attractions.' There are colorful characters of course. But what else? Worlds, but how to define worlds. What works? Viewers might not be aware of the rather exotic science that comes into play, in addition to following trusted artists with intuition.'Treasure Planet' was an experiment in how to place a camera so that the environment was the star, more precisely the built environment, the ship and planet. And in that case, the edges. The world is made of edges  in our eye and mind. It wasn't a particularly effective movie, either as entertainment or architectural experiment.But there were lessons learned from it. Most of what we know in film and architecture goes back to Orson Welles, in particular his 'Othello.' The first one in this franchise was very serious about this, a heavy investment. Sure, they wanted to sell theater tickets. But more than that they wanted to built monetizable intellectual property, duly injected into the culture.With that as preface, look at how the camera relates to the built spaces here. Its extraordinary, extreme. Every shot starts with the inclusion of an edge, which is then registered with an object: a ship usually, but any space. The reason is because they will later be selling entry into that space.See how every composition is thus influenced. You can see it immediately from the opening: rain on lips of teacups... what a device! Then scanning  not panning  to tell you that what you will get is place defined first. The situation is always placed.Later, the big effect is a huge wheel. You can just see the brainstorm: we need something that is spatial, that moves, that moves differently than anything else in life or the movie. We have to be inside it and outside. We have to as characters be manipulated by it, its dynamics not influenced by humans.Then see how that is set up earlier by the similar device, men in suspended globes (of bones!).Its a remarkable advance in the cinematic lexicon.

Argo," Will's Good Hunting
","It has been a month since I have seen this and I am struggling to write a comment, because of what I know I will see in another CIA-supported movie: Bigelow's movie about Bin Laden.All movies bring history into the story, but movies 'inspired by actual events' take serious risks. My problem is not particularly about this movie. Oh, I've carried a prejudice against Affleck, because of his first film. As popular as it was, it got MIT wrong, NSA of the era wrong, and mathematical hunger wrong. Written by townies, it blew a tremendous opportunity. Both Damen and Affleck have done fine work since, and this one is surely a well made film. I am imagining that limiting himself to a 40 year old cinematic vocabulary, and relying on Clooney's experience made it easier.The problems are that movies of this kind are market-driven, which means we see what we want to see. When you combine that with political agenda, you can get into serious trouble. Bigelow signed a contract with the CIA allowing them control over what is shown, and they used that to promote the lie that torture worked. We don't know what constraints Affleck is under; I assume they are inherited from the book which in turn would be constrained by the Agency.In both cases (Bigelow and Affleck) the actual stories are engaging enough. Affleck didn't have to insert all that last minute cliffhanger stuff. He didn't have to make it seem that Canadians did little. He didn't have to make up that stuff about Carter. There was no reason to omit the planning for the disastrous rescue mission for the hostages. He could have noted that the current president of Iran was a leader in the 'student' invasion. He might have introduced the reason the US was so tepid in its response, related to lost nuclear technology that is now in the news. I suppose all of these may have been 'suggested' by the Agency liaison.Oh well. I did like the narrative folding. Here we have a somewhat fake movie about a somewhat faker movie, the two woven together by the notion of manufactured stories. That main fold is obvious enough. I also liked the insertions — not on the book — of the internal movie references. The first was the direct copy of sets and movements from 'All the President's Men,' subtly establishing the work of the men we see as rushed creative discovery of the right story. That worked for me. The second is the background thread about the man and his boy. Affleck's character is separated from his son. The movie he is 'working on' is a film where a father goes into an exotic land to rescue his son. At the end, we see him miraculously restored to his family, with a storyboard artifact denoting the new narrative. It was a bit too obvious for me, but well crafted narrative folding.Viewers may be interested in the actual movie. It was not a raw, discarded script that was developed. It was instead a well developed science fiction movie that failed to get financing. Because of the legal limbo, the Agency was able to appropriate it. It was a real movie, and one whose notions are also folded.It was written by Roger Zelazny, a then best selling Scifi author whose gimmick was to appropriate a magical world from religion or the occult and stage a story within a simplified replica work built on the pre-existing cosmology. His 'Lord of Light' adopted Hindu notions for the purposes of body-sharing. It was the basis of the script which was to be the biggest budgeted movie of the era, filmed while a theme park was built in parallel. The notions of relative truth in religion, of mixed identities, of intrigue, of manipulated fabrication can be folded into the richness of viewing this if you know about it.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",Null,4,7,8 January 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Stealing
","Spoilers herein.Disney films usually have a moral. Here they stretch themselves in several ways beyond the obvious first-time PG-13 rating. The implicit moral here is that it is okay to steal so long as the establishment is unreasonable. And further that there is a higher justice.What's interesting is how the Disney machine works. They'll exploit any cinematic notion they can to give a thrill if that thrill is somehow tied to increased admissions. Disney has the industry's most advanced lab on these matters: they track artistic notions and cognitive science in quest of maturing artistic notions as fodder for their products. This is no collection of artistic types, but serious scientists, intent on engineering your response.Put those two together and here you have an interesting theft: the wholesale adoption of the architectural camera. We saw it in 'Nemo' where the whole thing played with the three-dimensionality of the space. We saw it in the second Harry Potter movie, where they paid lots of attention to the placement of the situation in relationship to the actual building of the school. In Hollywood filmdom, this technique -- always locating the camera in relationship to a wall -- was developed by Terry Gilliam. That explains why Depp works so well with the effect. He knows where your eyes are supposed to come from.Rush has worked on four films that reference the placement of self in space. These two together: the good and bad pirates, are both intelligent actors that can listen to the lab. This is an engineered product, openly stolen from others (like the equally well- engineered 'Charlies Angels 2').It's not as clever as 'Nemo,' not something you will actually remember like '12 Monkeys,' not something that challenges you like 'Panic Room' started out to be, not as self-aware as 'Hulk's swoops. But it uses the same notions, and uses them well enough to give a good ride.

Star Trek Into Darkness," Lens Flare Flair
","I've put Abrams in the same category as Soderbergh and Kubrick but only as a junior member. These are directors that do all the production stuff excellently, but whose creative life is in what the camera brings. They see the film not as storyboards (like, say Spielberg) but as the dynamic vision the storyboards represent.That's why Abrams likes to acknowledge the camera. He does so by his sweeps, by his slightly unusual color balance. In places he likes to play with unusual depth of field. In his best film (Super 8), he makes the camera an on screen character. But none of these has the power of his lens flares.He is so in love with them that he has a dedicated team that adds them in artificially. Because unlike Malick he isn't going to wait for the 20 minutes of perfect, natural light per day. I find it too cartoony, and suspect that in a few years we will laugh at this. But I surely do celebrate the man's love of the camera and how he shares it.",Null,2,7,27 February 2015
Stripes," An Army of Laughers
","Spoilers herein.I'm convinced that comedians don't so much find what is funny, they invent it. Because it comes from comedians, we laugh. Humor is not timeless but always mutating depending on who the leaders are. In this way, we are simple recruits in the army of laughers. We may complain, but there it is.The Marx brothers are still funny, but for different reasons. It would be better to say that they are funny again. When I first saw `Stripes,' I thought it hilarious. Now it seems not even campy.Why is this? My own theory is that Bill Murray learned his craft just when overt irony was fashionable. This was after Lenny Bruce could be pure by being profane and before we got into nostalgic humor. So he developed his routines around the notions of not being the character. This is his purest: a cool guy who is not cool, knows it and believes that not cool IS cool. Its reverse Austin Powers, who we're supposed to laugh at.

12 Angry Men," No Dissonance
","This film deserves to be on anyone's list of top films. My problem is that it is so perfect, so seamlessly polished, it is hard to appreciate the individual excellences.The acting is top notch. I believe that monologue acting is quite a bit simpler than real reactive ensemble acting. Most of what we see today is monologues pretending to be conversations. But in this film, we have utter mastery of throwing emotions. Once the air becomes filled with human essence, it is hard to not get soaked ourselves as the camera moves through the thick atmosphere. Yes, there are slight differences in how each actor projects (Fonda internally, Balsam completely on his skin...) but the ensemble presents one vision to the audience.The writing is snappy too. You can tell it was worked and worked and worried, going through several generations. It is easy to be mesmerized by this writing and acting, and miss the rare accomplishment of the camera-work. This camera is so fluid, you forget you are in one room. It moves from being a human observer, to being omniscient, to being a target. It is smart enough to seldom center on the element of most importance, so expands the field to all men.This is very hard. Very hard, to make the camera human. So much easier to do what we see today -- acknowledge the machinery and jigger with it. Do we have a filmmaker today who could do this?Ted's Evaluation -- 4 of 3: Every cineliterate person should experience this.",Null,314,369,26 April 2001
Hostel," New Tortures
","Gosh. We are left today with only three horrors. The extravagant slasher movie, the wet Japanese ghost haunting, or the conspiratorial torture movie.This last seems to have very few degrees of freedom. The setup of the conspiracy can be deep, folded and reflexive, like 'Saw.' The tortures can be increasing gruesome, horrible and explicit  well, that essential. And the manner of the film-making can be excellent, meaning that the cinematic expression increases the rush and horror.This last is what is advertised here. To judge from the box office success, it does actually push the state of the camera. I didn't see it. There was obvious attention to presenting one and a half torture scenes. A lot of expert attention went into this and I even image that they were shot early as a means to attract funding. The rest is merely adequate on all accounts.The formula demands that the victims 'ask for it' by at least making bad choices and ideally participating in one end of the machine for pleasure or profit, that machine turning around and biting. Here, it is sex. We are led to believe these guys are seeking deviant sex; it is mentioned enough and why they travel to this 'dark' place. We never see any of course, because the formal for some reason allows exposed breasts to represent all matters of sex.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",Null,13,25,2 December 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Lucy in the Sky
","Writing about big movies like this is a real pleasure because you can assume that the reader has already been exposed to the mainstream opinions and obvious controversies. So one can focus on other, perhaps more interesting issues.I was never a fan of Lewis' romantic Christianity and his allegorical crusade, not with the genius of 'Alice in Wonderland' as the benchmark. Or the King Arthur stories. But I have to admit that while I found his written tale dull as Oxford dust, his storytelling ability had magic, and that was what made the thing fun for many. That business about the narrator being explicit and commenting on what is happening is lost in the two movies.Oh, I should say that you really should see the 88 BBC version first. It was both cheaper and more magical. It had much better kids except for the young girl. Neither production gave us an awareness of the powers of the Queen (except via wand), so that power had to be carried by intensity. Therefore, the screaming queen of 1988 fit better into the dynamics of the world.If you do see the 1988 version, it will remind you how artless this modern one is. I'd say about a quarter of the shots in this new one are almost perfect copies from the older. Look at really great productions; 'Aliens' comes to mind, and you will note that there is not a single interesting design in this whole thing. Every shot, every character (mostly dumb rubber masks in queen associates) every character action is from the third bin down in familiarity. That is, except Tilda.Magic should be in the way the thing is portrayed. Nothing here seems magical at all, nothing like 'Time Bandits' for instance, or a few of the better parts of 'Lord or the Rings.' The sets were dull, the magical places ordinary.I am an admirer of Tilda. I'll see anything she is in and expect to enjoy it. She did have a captivating sequence here in the final battle, but it was ruined in a way by the dreadfully staged 'stone table' sequence before. Straight out of a 40s cannibal movie, with a set so cheesy and artless it made me squirm. No Baz Luhrman here.Here's the thing. Tilda knows a whole lot more about what works and what doesn't than the director. So she's created her own character in his vacuum, her own wardrobe and makeup. Some of that is great, but it doesn't fit anything, not the book, and not the lumpy director's vision, or what it seems to be.So what you end up with that's positive, is an appealing young girl, an amazing witch in the battle scene, and one extremely nice cinematic effect. It was so good it made everything else seem cinematically unimaginative. This was when Lucy pulled the sheet off the wardrobe to reveal the tree carving (Alice again!). The dramatic movement of that drape was wonderful, just wonderful. It was featured in the trailer. Then you got Lucy's gaze for the first time, one that is repeated tiresomely thereafter.That this wonderful bit of magic came and went before Narnia appears made me look in vain for more.(There's another scene that could have been great. While Lucy is being hypnotized, virtual satyrs dance in the fireplace, a sort of dream within the vision within the movie. Another director might have implied what Lewis does, that everything that follows could be Lucy's Dream.)Oh, there's one overt decision the director made. A sad one. He decided to play up the Nazi angle. So we have that incongruous bombing sequence where the Germans look like monsters. This gave Tilda her cue to have an Aryan look and movieland Nazi coldness.What follows is an intrusion of the American battle narrative on the original British one: war is depicted as inherently vile at the beginning up until Santa Claus becomes an arms merchant. Thereafter it is depicted as glorious, with the girls now involved as warriors. The shift is that Christians are battling evildoers, you see.

The Notebook," Folded Prayers
","Spoilers herein.There's a lovely Shinto tradition of folding prayers and leaving them on trees. The more clever, careful and perfect the fold, the more whole the message will be.I am in the midst of writing a book about `folding' in film. Folding in this context refers to layers of some kind that carry double meaning. The simplest and easiest to describe is the kind of folding in this little movie.A movie is a message sent to us and sugared enough in some way that we will receive it. One of the most effective flavorings is the `love story' which though invented by books is now exclusively owned by cinema. The message we send to ourselves and our loved ones about what love IS is a message that comes from films, each of which is a lower order of message.Sparks understands this, so he devises stories about messages. With `Message in a Bottle,' he did it simply with one layer. Here, he employs three, which added to the two above makes five folds in this slick film, five origami birds approaching our window.Sparks' three messages are:<ul><li>the one from Noah to Allie every day</li></ul><ul><li>the notebook of the title that Allie wrote, effectively to herself to use her love to bring herself back to her love</li></ul><ul><li>the letters that Noah wrote, one per day for a year.</li></ul>Now whether you find the gauzy valentine haze too sweet, or the notion of the world (not just the world of love) too smooth and safe, you have to admire how this film was conceived. These sorts of things don't happen by accident, they are engineered by people who study the deep cognitive mechanics of this business. Oddly, the plot suggests that happy unengineered accidents are what are more real.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",Null,11,20,26 June 2004
Public Enemies," Robbery
","One of the things we miss in our gangster movies is the sense of the time. We (Americans) came very, very close to a socialist state because of widespread frustration at the undeserving aristocracy. It had only been 15 years since a similar frustration in Russia exploded. In the depression, the rich got richer and everyone else suffered, some profoundly so. Robbing banks was simply a small payback and Dillinger was among several folk heroes.The FBI then and to some extent now, were seen as thugs hired to protect the moneyed interests. They would be brutal, using intimidation, violence and extralegal means at will. The film captures little of this context, instead focuses on fine tailoring and reflections in perfectly polished getaway cars. I think Mann was constrained by the script and had only two ways of building a film. One was simply to apply style, which is done here well enough if in ordinary ways.The other makes the experience worthwhile for me. For many filmmakers, it is not whether your film engages from beginning to end, because largely your audience is stuck. So long as you keep then busy, you can concentrate all your film-making in the end. Few films end competently anyway, so if you have your audience pleased as they walk out, you've won.The last three scenes matter. They affected me.The first has our hero sitting in a theater watching a gangster movie, pleased, using it to design and reinforce his own story. Previously, we had him and gang in a similar moviehouse where an on screen FBI spokesmen tells the audience that Dillinger and gang are likely in the audience. This was an very effective setup for this later scene. Depp, who has merely walked through the thing until this point, gives us a powerful internal dynamic.The next scene is him leaving the theater and being killed. First he stares down a spineless FBI thug, who we had previous seen brutalize Dillingers girlfriend. Then, the killing. This one scene is cinematically perfect, I think. It will likely be something I will recall for a long time, everything effectively and unexpectedly choreographed — unexpectedly because all until then had been ordinary. The final scene is a sort of epilogue, the honorable FBI agent reporting to the now imprisoned girlfriend fictional words from the dying gangster that bore into her heart. This also works. Quiet. Effective. Direct, with no apparent cinematic devices. It erases the flash we had seen only seconds before, carrying the emotion into something so human it hurts to even recall.

The Other Boleyn Girl," Closed World
","I'm an easier audience than most. Cheap effects, poor production skills by modern standards and cheap theatrics are all ignored when there is even the dullest of hooks. I grab and am willingly pulled through. Hey, I even liked 'Miss Congeniality.' I even cried at the disgustingly manipulative 'Little Miss Sunshine.'So I could have cruised through this, hanging on the one device it has: our surrogate viewer in Mary. It could have worked too, if Scarlett was a deeper actress and was able to convey that all the lushness we see is because her eye is in a decorated mind. It could have worked if it wasn't such a closed world.The 'closed world' deal means this: everything we see is 'explained' or tightly bound up in the story? Henry is king? Well then his kingliness is bound up exclusively in dressing, having fun and worrying about babies. There's no tie to anything outside what is carefully strung together with visible ribbons. No character, no urge, no happening crosses the shell that contains what we see. This is underscored by the way the cinematographer handles the visuals. Yes, he gives us more lushness in framing and positions than usual. But in keeping with the costumes, these are all from a well known vocabulary, just more elaborate. And the physical framing is closed world. Its stagy. There's nothing that bleeds off the frame to imply that there is anything at all in the universe but what you see.This is why people call this soap opera-ish. It isn't because of the emotional dynamics themselves, which are strong enough to matter in a worthwhile container. Its this notion from the TeeVee that there are only a few people in the world and the story is just a matter of who sleeps with who.But there's a larger opportunity missed here. There really are only two choices you have when combining great societal movements with personal emotions in this way. Either you can posit a world of great souls who somehow pull the world into a future, shaping by the power of being they have. Then we study that power.Or you go the way that things seem to the audience: things happen that are uncontrollable triggering incidental forces on the people who are in the way: political leaders and interesting people notwithstanding. Its something friendly to the noir tradition that we know a lot about now. They did neither here, and since they didn't give us a known cosmos, that stifling of the closed world is accentuated.Too bad. This was an interesting time, leading up to and preparing the way for the literary enlightenment that still glows, now in film. The times literally resulted in a storied way from what emerged from then through Shakespeare and Harriot, through settling the new world with idealists rather than simple catholic thugs.... on through to the creation of the rich vehicles for thought we have now: like the stuff a available to grab for this film and this comment. Henry was a responsible monarch, less driven by personal desire to see a spawn rule, but more concerned about shaping the future. That meant severing ties with the Catholics, a tie denoted by his marriage. She had to go for reasons outside her womb. The entanglements of religion, wealth, power had to be reshaped. We know he was most thoughtful in this, that he recognized a dying feudal system and the rise of urbanism. We know that his daughter  far less intelligent  followed through with his plan and got all the credit.None of this open world stuff is visible here. The women don't even seem desirable, and that blows the whole soap opera deal.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",Null,5,9,28 September 2008
Elizabeth," Virgin Acting (and Why)
","Spoilers herein.The first job of fine film in my estimation is to transport our minds through our eyes to another realm. This often requires dangerous adventure on the part of the artists concerned, most necessarily the director. Rarely does it occur in British-made historical costume drama. That's because they are constrained by a stuffy notion of the static observance of `important events.' In such dramas, the character displayed has to hold our interest; all else (particularly in costuming) adds a reverent poise.This is better than that. Elizabeth is an important figure for sure, certainly among the few most influential to my life. She broke the back of Catholic meddling in civil affairs, establishing the first (albeit fragile and oft submerged) notions of state-sponsored freedom of religion. She was the first post-renaissance monarch to elevate plebian arts, as much responsible for Shakespeare as the writer himself. She was a master at coopting religious archetypes to manipulate the masses. All of this is the matter of this film. (She also tacitly encouraged Thomas Harriot in inventing what we now know as algebraic logic, but that's outside the scope of this film which deals with the simpler forces of war and brutish Papism.)But that's not what entrances. Instead it is a combination of the director's commitment to highlight destiny as the focus, and the art of Ms Cate in projecting, infusing her personality into her surroundings.This director is unknown to me. He seems to be of that swelling class of competent, self-aware directors without pretense. There's no dogma here, only knowing craft, especially in the eye of the camera. His DVD commentary is very good - listen to him share his notions of the eye, even to the eyes on her bedroom lace, the eye of the cross-shaped windows, the schizophrenic eye, the scheming eye. He's not a master, but he is better than what he attempts. (Compare this to the stage-struck eye of Merchant-Ivory.)But the key ingredient here is Cate Blanchett. This woman lives in her surroundings. She is as vulnerable to fate and as open to voyeuristic examination as Emily Watson, but she is as commanding (when needed) of her environment as say Pacino (to pick an extreme case, and so flawed). Compare this to the imperious Dench (and many others) to see how important is that former quality. (There must be an Australian acting coach that teaches this, as others from Sydney show this awareness.)The director sees this, and has been adept at building wonderful surrounding characters.See how Rush lobbies for a closed soul. He is perhaps our most celebrated closed actor. (Many others are closed, like Freeman and Hackman, but Rush has depth that they do not.) He ultimately wins and we grieve a little. (His surrogate is played by the quiet method actor Frain. See him in `Titus.' where he shines because of this.)See how the completely open actor Fiennes tries to lure her into simple, emotional acting. (He would succeed the next year with the malleable Paltrow - with Rush providing the same contrast.) (His surrogate in this film was the explosive intuitive French suitor.)See how the ultraminimalist Norfolk threatens with his theatrical intensity, the traditional theatrical style of acting opposing her filmic style. (In fact much can be said of how film style undermines superficial religion, which is why Pat Robertson invests billions in cooptation.) His surrogate is played by the inestimable Geilgud in a minimal part.See how the master Cecil is played by the grand master of British film. Watch him try to guide her through destiny with a vision greater than the other characters, but less than us as viewers: we are given control over both the camera's eye of fate and the knowledge of how things `turn out.' Lord Attenborough's presence catalyzes Cate's, and he is outgrown. (Cate's mirror is the famed Fanny Ardant, who does not close off herself and so dies. Her acting style is also external, intuitive, flamboyant.)Blanchett is a wonderful talent, here with all the support she needs. How lucky for her - and for us. What we are given is a film of actors about acting in a film, and the forces in conflict to command us as an emerging virtual `nation' of participants.",Null,17,27,29 May 2001

But it is instead that wrapped around an idea that while old is the hottest thing among Hollywood: folded narrative. Often this is called reflection and it focuses on films about films.In this case, the 'outer' film is your regular John Hughes piffle: gaggle of nerds and a beauty. Incredibly dumb adults. One wild card weasel. But inside that movie is another one, about movie-making and the oft-cited issue of performers being prostitutes. In these two regards, the movie is like 'Moulin Rouge.'But here, the joke is on the other side, the heroine 'prostitute' escapes the movie, while the innocent boyfriend dives in and succeeds. The manner of how this is presented suits the subject matter: most of it is told in narration from the POV of the hero, and many small films-within are presented by us 'seeing' his imagination.I'm increasingly convinced that there is more intelligence in the Hollywood writer's community than the genres (and the commercial pressures that constrain them) permit.

","Full feature animation has settled into two paths which will never again pass. One is the long form narrative which makes animated films no different than most other movies, real movies. The other is a collection of jokes. Now there are lots of non-animated movies that have adopted this strategy as well, but cartoon jokes have different rules. They are more extreme in situation and character, but they depend on an ordinariness and familiarity for their baseline.Watching one of these hurts your soul, I am convinced, because it trains you to not actually notice the story, the ideas, the emotions. It hurts the whole world, because if we cannot see beyond the joke, the simple shot, we elect dummies. We marry for fun. We school to tests.This should be boycotted.

Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Situated Dance
","I seem often at odds with the mainstream reviewer community when it comes to big summer action movies.The press doesn't like this. The gameboy community does, I suppose because any sort of serious recognition outside the shell is valued.Well, I liked it. I'll recommend it, though only on cinematic grounds; I know nothing of the games on which it is based.When I go to these, my values are specific: I am going for a cinematic experience, period. The story is largely irrelevant: I need it to be enough to provide a linear skeleton on which to pace my visual imagination. It provides a rhythm of concepts only. This is not a trivial requirement, and is dependent on all the normally valued qualities: the actors, dialog, empathy and so on. You cannot have too much or too little story. It has to know its place in support of a deeper experience. There must, must, must not be too much condescension or elaborate justification of the worlds.So far as the story, this suits and nearly achieves a very high mark. The only problems were the overdeveloped notions of fraternal allegiance. Someone crept into the studio at night with the notion that they could say something that matters, so they larded something 'important' onto the script. This could better have been handled in the 'Lion King' way, without the Shakespearean aspiration and actor.So the story gives a pace of ideas, and it also supports the creation of a cosmology. This is far more important to these films. We have to just get how the world works. Once we do, our minds fill in the blanks of sense and what we expect to see. The situation we accept is what allows the narrative unfolding to work. They did a very good job here. That is despite two dangerous problems.I know a great deal of Persian history, and of course this has nothing to do with that rich reality, richer and more magical than is imagined here. And there was a cosmological quandary in the central magical device. It would have reversed time while destroying the world, but the destruction would be in a future that would be erased. Huh? But even picky me easily skipped over those otherwise barbed snags.Those two foundations did well enough in setting up the cinematic experience. In just the past couple years, all of Hollywood has developed a new sense of space. This may be related to the rush to 3D, but that is primarily an anti-piracy measure. Real filmmakers have just simply developed new spatial tools as the SFX compositing software allows for radical camera sweeps and editing continuities. This makes some of the new crop of action movies spatially cinematic.We are lucky enough to see some exciting experiments in how this will play out. Here is an approach dear to my heart. The camera is conservatively used; it is not placed in the action. It always has us as a disembodied, prescient observer. I like the blend, but we do not have it here.In other experiments, we use space in a large unconstrained way. Dragons swoop, Nemo swirls. King Kong falls. There is very little of that here, and in fact there is a cinematic parody of this in the 'sands' effect at the end. What we have instead is a complex, detailed, accurate spatial interaction with the architectural spaces. The characters — mostly our Prince, but also some Jedi Ninja Magi — establish the planes and occlusions with an understanding of the new cinematic vocabulary we have, a collaboration between our minds and the software (based on surfaces, luminescence and occlusions). There is a dance between object and situation that simply thrills me.It may thrill you as well. Gemma is wonderful. I do not expect her appeal to last. She may be as shortlived as Sean Young, or possibly have a couple years like Liv Tyler. But here, she shines, acting with her neck.

Coffee and Cigarettes," Resonance
","Jarmusch's approach to film  and presumably to life  works for me in the large but not the small. I'm sure you encounter this in lots of places as well: situations, people and philosophies.He attempts highly engineered ordinary events that have no content. That aimlessness is the point. His art is in designing the lack of ordinary film order in such an extreme but directed way so that we get the message by its omission. This technique allows him to come down on the side of characters rather than composition.Its an old contest, usually between the orchestration of the filmmaker and the instrument of the actor. But he completely reframes the question. That's why he is important and his films, and particularly his 'book' film: 'Ghost Dog,' should be watched.Along the way, he's discovered that all situations are conversations and no matter how complex things get, the conversation is always between just two people. To prime his pump, he sketches, just like most artists. You have to take such sketches on their own terms, as ancillary to stuff with substance (even if with him, substance is subtraction).Others have already told you that these sketches are uneven. There is no consistency of tone among them, in fact they are so disconnected we infer what you likely have already read: these were done across huge chasms of time, philosophy and technique, sliding into the notion of encounters and communication as resonance.My own favorite by itself makes this worth watching. Cate Blanchett is our most accomplished 'folded' actor, meaning she can convey two characters in one performance. Here, she literally plays two characters, conversing with one another. She obviously wrote the dialogue because each phase slips under the one from the companion. It is her interpretation of a Jarmusch situation: an emotional encounter drained of all the theatrical conventions of emotion.

Oldboy," Vertigo
","No movie stands alone. When we watch it, we bring all sorts of expectations to it, and a large part of that is the genre we expect. If we expect style, we are particularly acute in how we judge that factor, for instance.In fact, we've come to rely on how a film announces itself. What I find interesting about this one is that it deliberately subverts any expectations we might have along these lines.For example, most viewers will consider this a 'revenge' movie, a very specific subgenre, and judge it on those merits. The problem is that the filmmaker goes out of his way early in the game to announce that these fellows are correct in their assumptions.He then pulls the rug out from under those simple viewers, just as he does the hero. That's the art here, and you'll have to judge just how important it is to you.I've become aware in the last few years how important the entry into a film is. The biggest, most shocking thing a filmmaker does is take us to another world. There are two big jumps he or she needs to make. The first jump is in the first few minutes, where the nature of the work is presented. If the movie is a strict genre film, this is easy because we have so many shorthand designators. Music is important.The second big step has to do with the first plot point. In this case, the episode tells us that the hero (our surrogate) sees only what is intended. His perception is bent, manipulated. His TeeVee is our movie.I registered this against films that weave stories about how stories are woven. The touchstone of course is 'Vertigo,' where two forces or beings on screen struggle to create a 'movie' in front of us, each one trying to define a false future that merges with the similar future of the movie we watch.'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,' 'Open Your Eyes,' even 'Tampopo' are examples of this notion of storytelling, one that is intelligent and engaging. We have three entities as creators here. We have the guy we think is the master creator, Park, who we see borrows images as if he were in a drugged dream and can dream only in terms that he saw before he was locked up and gassed.We have the supposed master manipulator, who hypnotizes, drugs, confines, bribes, and uses force and technology to make things turn out precisely the way he wants. Precisely, with no misstep whatever. Nominally he is the one creating the reality we see, but his manipulation is more perfect than that even of Park, so we know he is suspect.And then we have the fellow that seems to be the puppet. But is he? He is the one that writes. Such comprehensive notebooks or diaries are common code in movies for something we enter. He is the one who dreams, for whom the images on TeeVee become a fantasy life replacing the 'real' one.He is the one with the interesting hallucinations that start with the purely hallucinogenic notion of exiting from a truck onto a grassy rooftop. He is the one who eats life, and in fact traces his roots back to the manipulator by surveying restaurants.That business about snow and lost tongue and erased memory at the end. Shouldn't that tell us who imagined or created what we see? This idea originated in '2001,' where Kubrick played with the notion of who was narrating what we see: is it man, computer or deity?

Spider-Man 2," Stories About Stories
","Spoilers herein.I was as disappointed in this sequel as the first. Not because there weren't some interesting elements - there were. But because the key promise is broken. This is a superhero whose herolife is swooping and three-dimensional. The future of exciting movies is in exploring and exploiting this notion. `Finding Nemo' does. `Val Helsing' does. But this one, which is built around the graphic senses of motion and depth is completely devoid of these except for a few brilliant moments in the first exterior fight with Ock.I used to think this was because huge projects demand risk avoidance. But with so many big films having a dimensional architecture these days, even to `Pirates of the Carribean,' I can only say that now it is a matter of incompetence.There are other blots as well, most notably Kirsten Dunst. She had one of the most explosive introductions of any actress in `Vampire.' But as an adult (still playing youngsters), she is in way over her head. She needs to stick to vacuous, fun-loving dimwits like she did well enough in `Eternal Sunshine.' MJ in the comic is a voluptuous model. They needed to get someone who actually looks redheaded and IS voluptuous and full of life. An Alicia Witt type.But there are things to like. As I understand, the shooting started without a script and at some point much later Michael Chabon was brought in to fix it. The film was the mess we sometimes still see. I'm told that he fixed many `ordinary' elements relating to dialog and sequence and such.He also emphasized the basic foundation of the thing. Spidey was invented not as another superhero, but as a story about the superhero story. A metastory, one that already had several `story-about-story' elements. The main one in the book was the deal with Jameson's creating a negative) myth with Parker himself complicit.
Chabon uses all his `Wonder Boy' tricks to emphasize these and add others: MJ is now an actress, and get this - starring in the first play about metastory. Osborn creates a metastory about his Dad, Aunt May about her husband, her husband (from beyond the grave) about Peter, MJ about young Jameson, arms about the motivation of Octavius...Its a carnival of narrative pasted on other narratives.

The Secret in Their Eyes," You Eyes, Your Love, Your Passion
","This is a truly lovely film that has potential to change lives. I will consider it for my 'list of fours,' when I report it.You may simply fall into the rather soft world it builds, one in which love can be redeemed as a matter of earnest justice. It is a simple coloring of the by now familiar Spanish-language model of anti-noir. In noir, the on screen characters are buffeted by events and laws in a world designed by the act of us watching. In the Spanish-language model, the on-screen characters imagine a world that bobs and weaves around the world we want to impose on the movie. Sometimes this is called 'magical realism,' and I suppose that concept makes sense in novels where everything is internal. Here in cinema we see, we live in worlds.As with the best of these films, there is careful structuring. Underlying all this — I'll call it mirroring here — is the effort of a man to change reality. Plot-wise, he needs to recapture a lost love with a colleague. This is mirrored in his need to revisit justice for a violent murder that terminated the most passionate love he knows. He follows his own passion, amidst a speech by his assistant about the inevitability of passion that is mirrored in how the murderer is captured.I'll take a moment away from mirroring to remark that this capture scene is in a packed soccer stadium. It is in a continuous take that seems physically impossible and has the edgiest cinematic tension I know.This is literally two movies spliced together. To begin, we know it as a police procedural, with a love story under. It morphs about halfway into the dual: a love story with a detective story under, and the detective story now is of a different kind.That 'different kind' has to do with the mirroring of time. The early mystery is who committed the murder and how to catch him. The later mystery about what happened after the in-story watchers let him free. He folds these together by writing the past while we watch him struggle with the future. He literally writes half of the film and his creation may well be fiction. We see him struggling in the first scenes. When his love reads the novel she asks if that is how it was because she wants to know the world she will inhabit. She is pleased, saying that things will be complicated.Even this is mirrored. Where our detective creates a world by narrating it, the bad guy ends up in a limbo where he gets no story, literally.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,4,6,27 November 2010
Billy Elliot," Battle Dancer
","This is a replacement comment.Though the dance was passable here, the story is so vapid and unembellished, I sat there looking for another movie. And I found one, battling to get out. It was clever and true, overlooked because of the mediocrity placed in front of it. You can find the tragedy of an eleven year old girl in northern England. Her father was caught in an affair and also fired, so he sits around the house getting drunk. Meanwhile the topic of sex (urges, power and denial) pervades every moment of her home environment.Debbie approaches menarche in this atmosphere which heightens her curiosity about sex. She is rejected by her sexually frustrated mother, so the attraction of sex combines with a need for companionship. Her mother starts a ballet class for Debbie and her little girl peers, in the hope that some of her lost accomplishment and youth will revive, if not in Debbie, perhaps one of her friends. Thus, Debbie is transformed into pupil from daughter. But neither Debbie nor any of the other girls shows any talent or focus.So her mother seizes on a boy Debbie's same age who wanders in. She takes advantage of his own lack of identity -- exacerbated from the normal vortex of puberty by sexual confusion and the loss of his mother. Debbie's mother gives this boy some focus and is able to charm him into the enterprise of dance.The core of the film is Debbie's attempts to come to terms with this usurper sibling, by similarly trying to charm him with anything at her disposal, including her childish sex. The battle between mother and daughter for Billy takes on the more abstract battle between the charms of sex and the drive for personal expression. Much of the real estate of the film is taken up in Billy's reaction, including some dances which play out this battle.There's other guy stuff going on in the background as well, fights and strikes but they merely are there to provide a loud noise to illustrate the challenge of little-girlness. Ultimately, Debbie loses the battle because Billy is really gay (something the mother sees straightaway), and she is presumably doomed to a wasted life as non-entity in a dying coal town. (At the end, we see Billy's lover, the grownup, more clearly gay childhood friend.)Nicola Blackwell utterly steals this film as Debbie, shining completely through all the noise and motion that swirls around her. There is an unforgettable scene where after a pillow fight, with Billy on top of her, she strokes his cheek-- one of the strongest images of the entire year. (The next time we see her, she plays Lolita, offering herself opencrotched and lollipop sucking. It is the last time we see her. Afterwards, her surrogate takes the place: the little blond girl who is consistently outside his back yard.) That stroking scene establishes the emotional apogee. She also has the perigee (the comic center): when walking with Billy, she holds a stick against the wall, then walks by lined up cops, similarly holding the stick against their genitals protected by shields.You might enjoy this -- be transported into how a sexually frustrated little girl imagines the world -- much more powerful than 'Dancer in the Dark.'.",Null,3,8,1 August 2010
The Fifth Element," Give Us a Word
","Spoilers herein.Science fiction writing has its share of really deep and complex work. Science fiction films do not, in large part I think because it provides a simple scaffold for special effects and other moneymaking cinematic crutches. The only intelligent film constructions I can quickly recall are: Forbidden Planet; 2001; Bladerunner, and yes, this. Surprised?What I like are not the effects so much. Nor the story about Milla being a reconstructed key -- that's all rather illogical and unimaginative. Some of the small touches charm, but they pale compared to the big trick: the Chris Tucker character. He becomes the frantic narrator; self-absorbed but contrarily not as he is lost in the role of being the eyes for a whole population. The filmmaker puts himself in the film and by reference our own appetites for titillatingly exaggerated explosions and suspense.
So if you love science fiction for its metaphoric notions, for its clever creations of new or alternative worlds, then you will also be annoyed when the public draws it into the trivial sewer of cowboy revenge, of Bruckheimer propane bombs, or predictable, Hardy Boy last-minute escapes from doom, of bulbous boobs, of cheap scares. And you will appreciate this wonderful intrusion of the Tucker character. Willis has an appreciated comic talent, which in my memory will be epitomized by his one-syllable responses to that randy public.",Null,13,27,19 July 2001
127 Hours," The Hand Left in the Thing
","There are so many filmmakers out there that I am still approaching many films the way they were intended to be approached: as self-contained works of art (or craft). But there are some filmmakers I know well enough to trust in a larger journey, something of a shared life. Danny Boyle isn't going to change my religion, or the nature of my relationships (except for 'Sunshine'). But he does have something that effuses every film that gives me energy. I never really got that from Frank Capra, but I do understand that is how he fed his public. Boyle is different though because he not only doesn't rely on a formula; he seems to deliberately swing as far from a typical center as possible. It is almost as if he wants to find a film form that tests his cosmology of hope. Where Herzog goes to the edge and finds threatening nature and flawed mankind saturating the world, Boyle finds precisely the opposite.I almost did not go to see this, in fact put it off for a good while. I should have trusted the man, because what could have been morbid is turned at many points into a matter of celebration. He begins and ends literally with crowds celebrating. Throughout, he inserts an audience into the lonely ordeal, without the distance that prevents us from sharing. He masterfully exploits the folded notion of his film and the one our trapped explorer makes.I contrast this with Herzog as mentioned but also and particularly with Penn's film 'Into the Wild' about the slow sapping of hope from our lively adventurers. That depressed because it posited the inevitable grind of a destructive beauty. This sets that aside, and lets our man shine. We are deliberately exposed to little of his personality, so little that we allow ourselves to grow the character into that sphere of we carry ourselves, the one that meets life at the boundaries.(Never mind that in real life, he is something of a nitwit, a soulless consumer of achievement. This is Danny we see. And I like what there is of the man.)Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,5,11,31 March 2011
Pirate Radio," Stolen Treasures
","Every waking moment we convert our lives to stories, with the largest component stories we share with those we choose and those we don't.At some point for each of us, that shared story contributes to a genre and loses its personal connection. That is a death of sorts where your visceral connection to life is transformed to the same connection but through a medium controlled by market forces and a narrative shaped by its own laws. That death hurts, so while some big part of us celebrates when we re-encounter the thing, some other part dies.If you were there in the summer of 67 when music mattered in a way impossible to communicate now...If you were there when it seemed that the actions of a few musicians and the millions who fed them drove, literally drove the cosmos, pulling the dead husks of the old behind...If you really believed in a God and the goodness of life because you knew it through the joy of shared ears...Then this movie will present quite a challenge. You cannot do other than love it: the craft of the narrative is strong. It hits the entertainment marks in ways and at times that we expect because we paid. The music is strong, very strong and illustrated in ways that at least do not offend. The characters are derived from those we want to like. The sex is affable enough. Rock music is saved at the end by an enthusiastic public who we see throughout the story as being of all ages and classes.And yet there is this sense of loss that this is what it has come down to, some pop tropes with familiar sounds. Some amusement as though the tentative futures we held so dearly and the prayers we burned for did not matter. Compounding the ambiguous feelings for this well done thing is the involvement of Hoffman as our (in my case) American surrogate on the scene.He is there for the music and not for the fame or sex. He alone is willing to die. As an actor, we have seen him before straddle the line between what matters and the way it has to be delivered. But he does not do that here.

Batman Returns," No Difficulty with Duality
","Spoilers herein.What Burton brings to the table is a quirky design sensibility. All other elements of his films are conventional Hollywoodisms. But when he hits a sweet spot with that situational and production design, it works. At least it works as a voyage to another planet.His first Batman film was a disaster in this respect: it visually lacked both imagination and control. He knew he screwed up, and this time he fixes nearly everything that was broken the first time around. He still has that dead melodramatic third act, but everything else is great.The city bears some similarities to the Gotham of the first, but he lives in this one. It has a perverted life, rather than the carcass of the first. He literally places his camera among architectural elements of the city this time. The batcave is completely reinvented to be more jagged, dark and schizophrenic. The contrasting ice cave really does contrast: it has light and color and movement and life of a twisted sort. The chemical factory and cathedral of the first was just a set of large props.Someone paid attention: the `world' of the city is blunt industrial, an anti `Metropolis,' largely broken. Michelle's apartment is modeled after the building in Welle's Kafka movie I think. (You can visit that building today.) The cave has organic roughness, a completely different world altogether. This craftily sets the `two-world' theme of Bruce's mind in which we presume this all happens. But the clever introduction of a third design consciousness is what makes this really fly. The ice cave is part sewer and part 1964 New York World's Fair. The structural elements here are so radically different in conception that I can only think that three different talents created these three architectural notions. (Incidentally, we saw these structural elements revived in the recent interiors of the ice cave in `Die Another Day.') Keaton does change character depending on the forces of the surrounding built space. This is a fantasy that perhaps only an architect could appreciate: a visual drama of dual forces within the mind.Even Elfman's honking is better. The `girl' in this one participates in the split world dynamics as well. Very clever writing, this. Michelle's architecture is what she wears, which is another element of the genius in the art design. The problem is that something happened -- I do not know what -- and the effect was messed up at the end when they changed the costume all around. This was in the days when Michelle still had something to offer, and because I have hit her hard on some other films, have to note some informed work here. Most of the body acting is by doubles of course, but her face shots in costume use a knowing device: in `real' life, she acts with her eyes and as Catwoman, she acts with her mouth. That mouth is borrowed from Helena Bonham-Carter. (In fact, when a film actress makes something work, many lessor actresses appropriate it. Its part of the game, and one can have some fun with Michelle's later films guessing who she's imitating.) DeVito is one of our most intelligent actors. Not as an actor, but in his understanding of reflexive notions in humor: his `Momma' was based on Nabokov!

Finding Nemo," Space
","Spoilers herein.Steve Jobs drags us all into higher awareness. He does so by grabbing our attention by conventional means but does his real work subliminally.In the computer world, what we see is a coherent, accessible approach with appealing style. In the movie world we see the same, except the art of excellent character development and storytelling is substituted for sheer functionality and ease of creativity. In both, we all are pulled by this tractor into a more refined space.And space is what it is all about, in particular a notion of location in space coupled with a higher degree of freedom within that space.This has been a concern of intelligent filmmakers all along. Griffith merged the theatrical space with grand vistas of mass movement and did so from a spot no human would normally have. Welles and Kurosawa played with this, the first by working with architecture, the other by flattening in deep focus. But until the eighties we always had to deal with the reality of the ground -- and the horizon.The real appeal of 'Star Wars' wasn't the cowboy story or guns, nor the pseudo-religious trappings, though we all thought it was. It was the freedom from that hard bottom, the Earth which we interact with in as consistently as breath and blood. 'Star Wars' -- and '2001' before -- gave a thrill because our visual vocabulary was now expanded spatially rather than ALWAYS being referenced to the floor.Pixar's work has always been cognizant of this new frontier even when owned by Lucas. Under Jobs, every film has become more and more dimensional until now. We don't honk around with the camera as much as I would like, but we do set a new standard for interacting space. Naturally, all else is well crafted but serves this notion of space ? especially the fishtank business.Ted?s Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.",Null,6,10,13 June 2003
Blade," Vampire Sex
","Spoilers herein. Cat's eye comments follow.Vampirism has always been about sexual domination. This is the story of Norma Louise Kuzma, an illiterate Ohio jewess. Molested at ten, raped by her father, pregnant in junior high, she ran away at fifteen. In the big city, she became a disciple of a sex cult, then a minor leader in the cult.Her lord, Frost, was one of an organized group of men who consumed and enslaved women (and weak men, enlisted to do the dirty work of the enterprise). We enter the story with two events underway:--Frost decides to exploit a force from ancient wisdom to further his power: this force is the deep subconscious power of vampire icons to harness more powerful images of sex. He intends to subsume and leverage the power of his peers (pornographers and pimps) for a new medium: the vampire movie. He expects to affect countless millions and become immensely rich.--Coincidentally at the same time, a TeeVee preacher named Blade decides to fight sex generically. He does so not because of the destructive effects of sex slavery, but because he is reviled by sex in general. He himself is a sexual being -- he hates himself and strikes out at every instance of sex he finds, and incidentally finds himself confronted by Frost.The story focuses on Norma, here using the name Racquel, and her betrayal. She fights the fundamentalist because he is so destructive -- in fact Blade's actions drive her and her comrades closer to Frost. Frost offers family, protection, bliss, while Blade offers only death. To a large extent, Frost's power comes from the people like Blade who drive confused souls in his direction. (Most cops -- and politicians -- are also driven to Frost and his peers because of the outrageous inability of Blade to compromise, to see their humanity.)But the tragedy is that Frost lies to Racquel. He is using her for pleasure and for her abilities as a lieutenant in the liberal Army. He promises a future of new levels of honor, perhaps even some notion of self and control over her own life. But he has another queen in mind. The story is presented very cleverly with a lot of stupid, blunt, battles between Frost and Blade. The point is to show how superficial are their own ideas of self, how pointless the carnage and how meaningless the battle. Norma is only seen on the edge, which is apt. She expects to have her role as porn star be elevated to that of real artistry in playing a vampire goddess. The tragedy is both in her failure and in how she fails; she is abandoned by Frost, then stabbed in the eye (no foolin) by Blade. She literally explodes because of a sexually transmitted disease of the blood -- cooked up in a scientific lab for other (useful) reasons but enlisted here in the battle between `good' and `bad.'",Null,4,11,9 June 2001
The Great Dictator," About the America that Exiled Him
","I find this film remarkable. Here you have a man at the peak of his celebrity who has some moral responsibility. How rare! Imagine Michael Jordan risking all (and eventually losing all) in order to do the right thing. This film is a multidimensional risk: he is trying to master the talkie (though his talent is in the visual), he is trying to mix tragedy and comedy (always a hard mix, and nearly impossible when using current events) and he is trying to actually effect his audience, to counter evil in the land.One must remember that when this was started, Hitler was generally admired in the US and essentially no one at all was standing up for the Jews. (In the film: `first we get the Jews, and then the brunettes.')I think he succeeds so far as the talkie, but he doesn't stand at the top of the heap, and several years before, the Marx brothers had made their own, superior, antiwar movie (Duck Soup). He succeeds in mixing comedy and tragedy only by alternating, and extending the length of the film.Concerning his effectiveness in countering evil: his impassioned speech at the end is powerful. But it appears to have had no effect whatsoever. This is the man that McCarthy and friends drove from the US!

","I saw this amazingly disappointing film along with millions of others. I was going to write my stock comment about Marvel not being able to make anything cinematic. But I wondered why. It has something more than respect for the drawn comic panel, where every scene had been storyboarded and shot as if it were a storyboard.Then I remembered and rewatched ' A Fish called Wanda.' That had the same smell. The problem is simple I think. They start with the action shots. These incidentally involve characters, okay, buy that. These have to have lives. Okay. The lives have to have history, connections, reality. Nope, too much trouble, so let's just connect up some genre fragments. Family? Add sibling rivalry and a dash of parental abuse based on misunderstanding. Romance? Add in something that later you can devalue by having be pretend.The problem is that instead of situating the film in a world — any world — and then identify some narratives, which then have dramatic color, they start with the color, going backwards. They never get to the world, which is why all the narrative seems external, remote.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",Null,13,26,7 May 2009
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," Obnoxious Mistakes
","Spoilers herein.Amazing how often films preach one thing and then perform the very same sins they warn against. The `moral' is to be particularly self-aware in how you present yourself: the `yourself' in the story is woman creating a little drama of love. The film itself started out with one heavy strength: the always reliable notion of actors playing characters who are actors. Everyone is scamming everyone else. Rich stuff, that.But it also has a heavy burden, the untalented, plain Goldie Junior. Her mom has built a career on a giggle, but at least late in life, she has learned enough of the ordinary tricks of the trade to not embarrass. This film, by Sandra Bullock's creator of promotional vehicles, has the double burden of pleasing us and her managers.You can see where the original film wasn't bad: especially some of the various episodes where the humor is in our discomfort. But you can also see where the test audiences forced a completely reshot ending: the original ending was at the basketball game with the forgotten necklace, something set up with great elaboration.

Alexander," The Borrowed
","Cyrus and Darius knitted together the largest empire known before or since. Their method was innovative, to allow local control preserving the culture and gods. What they added was infrastructure: roads, a universal set of laws (the first case law) weights and monetary system.The system was perhaps the least corrupt of any complex government before and since. Gathered in Persepolis were scholars tasked with collecting and synthesizing knowledge from the entire world. Darius knew that any oaf can conquer, but only a statesman  a concept he invented  can govern.300 years later the system had devolved, and various component states no longer saw advantage with the Persian federation. Into this, a bold and athletic thug moved. There were some spectacular battles of course, but most of the conquering was a matter of showing up in force.When Alexander reached Persepolis he committed the greatest sin against knowledge known: he destroyed the great libraries, killed all the scholars and burned the entire place to the ground. The one great invention of the Greeks was the principle of retrospective narrative, what we call history. Since they wrote the history, they get to choose the narrative. Their spinning is masterful, complex and rich. But all the components are borrowed, not original.Now Stone makes a movie depicting what he thinks are key elements of the story. Stone has no original cinematic vision, all is borrowed from giants who went before. What he brings to the table is the ability to spin it together with some deftness, some craft. At least that once was the case.Two narratives, the original and this pale child. Borrowed, but this doesn't have the typical Greek riches. It doesn't have the introspection either, despite the many cinematic tools available (and some from Greek theater as well).Hopkins continues his slide into the embarrassment of pure mannerism.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",Null,7,13,4 May 2005
Hot Fuzz," Too Fuzzy
","I'm recommending that you give this a pass unless you are studying narrative introspection.'Shaun of the Dead' was quirky enough that it carried a presumption of cleverness in the small, so minor twists seemed funny and we were therefore amused. This doesn't have that character, at least not in the film itself  merely the idea. I wasn't amused, however lots of people seem to have been.What is worth remarking on is this business of embedded introspection, a sort of a movie about movie-watching.Of course all movies are about other movies in the sense that they rely on the past cinematic vocabulary for effect. And this type of movie, which spoofs others depends directly on us recalling the movies they quote to make fun of. We inherit narrative.But there are further, deeper tricks that have become common now and this is prime example. The setup is that a supercop, the kind that only exists in movies, is sent to a small town. Some trouble is expended to tell us that the town represents reality, being closer to the audience than the world of the supercop. The running joke is that he is teamed with a dolt who is obsessed by supercop movies. They watch some of these as well as talk about them (too much I think), and at the end, they enter that world of the supercop buddy movie. The trick is that we introspectively enjoy the original form (action, editing) and the layer above which is poking fun at them.Okay, so far so good. Guess who the bad guys are? Well, we are introduced to the townspeople as a bunch of watchers. And an elite group in the town who more literally ARE watchers. they have the town covered with cameras and watch from a command center. As the movie segues into the supercop-world sequences at the end, the watchers engage in a battle to determine just what sort of a movie it needs to be. They are fighting for a sort of Frank Capra small town Stepford perfection.Its 'Blue Velvet,' which was a battle of two movies for dummies. 'Blue Velvet' in turn was a cinematic battle based on the battle for narrative control in '2001' and Kubrick's 'Lolita.' (Which in run was perfected by Nabokov.)So, its worth watching if you are a lucid viewer.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",Null,10,24,2 August 2007
Constantine," Elizabeth Sings
","I knew from the very beginning that this would be a little different from the title sequence. It uses a font that is put together in an odd way. It is a rather jarring effect, just in that one word denoting that we'll have ordinary things presented in extraordinary ways.This told me before the movie started that they had some professional help in the production and art design... and they gave those folks power. They are the people who gave us that dancing bag in 'American Beauty' around which that whole movie is constructed.This movie is getting panned, and I wonder if folks are seeing the same thing I saw. Yes, the characters are unengaging and superficially drawn, sort of  well  like in a comic book or a music video. Yes, the story is a bit incoherent. Some script doctoring is apparent, but the important thing in stories like this is the part they get right: the cosmology makes sense. At least it makes sense if you have exposure to biblical cosmology: I think it true that in all the key regards this is much more biblically accurate than Mel's adventure in pain and blame.What we want from things like this is the ability to tap into another world. The details of the story are superfluous. There are three ways to do this, all exploited here.1) Use folding. In this case, the fold is us seeing something which has a story about people seeing things that others do not. It seems a simple trick, but it has profound power. It is not done very well here, but it is done ambitiously. We assume subliminally that what _we_ see is something no one else can.2) Be novel in the design of the alternative worlds. In other words, make it look like we are seeing something no one else has. That's rough in movies where everything must refer to a prior vision. That's the way our minds work. So they have to show us something we have already seen in other films but make it seem different.3) Use at least a few actors that have the ability to link for us the folds among the four worlds: ours, the 'real' world of the movie: the real world of the movie but with demons (Men-in-Black-like); and hell. I suppose they thought at first that Keanu could carry the weight merely by association with the similar layers of 'The Matrix.'But it is the amazing Tilda Swinton that does the heavy lifting in the folds here. She's another redheaded Australian-influenced actress that can do folding. You may not know her; she gets few parts I think because her appearance is so striking. But if you have a chance you may want to see her in 'Orlando,' where she plays much the same character (also ambisexual) and 'Conceiving Ada' where she literally conjures up an alternative world. She's been a talisman of folding in other films: 'Vanilla Sky' (together with Alicia Witt) and 'Adaptation,' where she is the ultimate customer of all the folded worlds. For this character, I believe she channels Jenny Runacre's 'Queen Elizabeth' in the punk folded 'Jubilee,' which is one spooky movie. She's the real thing and I hope we see more of her. In true folding tradition, both her and her character trigger the folds here.Who cares if the thing doesn't flow well or is poorly constructed in how any of the worlds forms a story. I think it is a point of honor that it doesn't in this case. For a point of reference on this: I thought 'The Hulk' was cinematic.Hell is never really shown. What we see is a vision as it would be translated to someone without the tools: a ruined road in a desiccating landscape. Seems apt. Same thing was done to similar jarring effect in 'Songs from the Second Floor,' from which this borrows artistically. Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,10,18,29 January 2006

","Spoilers herein.The first thing to decide when creating an intelligent film is who the camera is. We start out here with one identity and discover that we actually have another. This is a well known if rarely pulled trick in the mystery genre. Films like this are essentially mysteries, following all of the important rules. That makes them more engaging because the viewer engages in a game with the writer (and her surrogate the actor) to outwit each other.The filmmaker here is very intelligent in leveraging this by exploiting Kidman's rather hypnotizing, slowly incubating terror.",Null,8,11,31 August 2001

That made him a name, and since then, he has been able to get work based on his `don't rock the boat dependable corporation man' image. As a result, all his films are designed by a committee whose primary value is avoiding risk.And that's what we have here, something like what Microsoft would do: massive, polished, `good enough' and boring. The appeal of Homer's poem is the story of Achilles in the context of a legendary battle. Market forces of film have turned it the other way around: the reason for this to exist is the spectacle of the battles and the scope of the sets.But these battles have none of the personal humor of Braveheart, or the sweep of Lord of the Rings, or the orchestrated movement of Ran, or the freneticism of Private Ryan, or the beauty of Thin Red Line, In fact, they excel in no dimension and so are forgettable. Similarly with the sets and costumes. Good enough and no more.Only Saffron Burrows and Peter O'Toole escape embarrassment as actors here - Peter because he cannot be coaxed into strutting externally because he is already excessive internally.

Brokeback Mountain," Rule of Twos: What Wives Know and Allow
","Larry McMurtry is a good writer, but a lazy one. So he sticks to one of the most common formulas, the rule of twos. When used well, this compounds. So we start with two people in love, natch. That will split so that we have two pairs, two husbands and wives. The husbands will be where the story happens and the wives where it is watched from.Then on the other side, you'll need a pair of external watchers. If the two wives are internal watchers, you'll need two almost-wives as external ones: here, the newly betrothed daughter and the almost fianceed girl friend. The center of the thing is the pair of watchers, the wives. Even though all the attention is on the guys, the thing revolves around the two wives.(At the end, we encounter a third wife who simply echos the deal: what wives see and know, what they allow and what they govern.)Lee's projects all exploit the rule of twos. It was obvious in the first one I saw, his love/food movie, and every one since. He seeks out scripts structured this way because he knows how to exploit them. Quite apart from the human dynamics, look at how he handles the scenery. A hack will give us full-blown, high octane beauty against which you'll contrast mere humans fighting or flowing.Hacks like Robert Redford in 'River Runs Through It' where we are assaulted by the beauty of the place. Or if you want a western, 'Open Range' which not only grinds the scenery into our eyes, but gives us an encyclopedic tour of all the impedimenta of ranching. The worst example I know is 'Proof of Life' where the agenda was most obvious: vast openness, claustrophobic confinement.Look what Ang has done. The mountains are glorious but photographed dully as if seen by someone who grew up there. In fact, when you see the postcards, the difference is obvious: the cards are romantically unreal. He's included all sorts of genuine gear and methods but in no case has he veered off to show: hey look at this article of truth. No, his truth and scope are amplified because they are assumed rather than tutored.(There's only one place where the power of cinema is fully unleashed. A juxtaposition of fireworks and Ennis when he 'explodes.')Now, knowing this, and that the thing rests in the two women, look to see the two moments which form the fulcrum of this thing. Most good filmmakers have one scene in mind when they conceive the movie and everything grows from that center. A rule of twos man will have two. One is the moment when Alma first lets her husband go off knowing why.The more powerful sun around which everything revolves is a scene where Ann Hathaway as Jack's widow recounts his fate. The makeup is extraordinary, worth a dedicated comment. (Teeth.) But watch how many emotions go through her face as she tells the story. We discover what she knew, even what her culpability may be. We discover the existence of her own closet of secrets and rivers we'll never see.Sure, Ledger is good. But you have to understand how carefully this internal/external no- speaking notion was set up and sustained in every element that surrounds him.

","If a life in film is a a relationship with a being, then this is the shoes. They're handy, and only seem necessary when not dreaming.But they're not what gets you anywhere.I consider this Tim Burton's best film. That stop animation thing was more successful, but its too artificially goofy. This is more real and the idea is to straddle the line between homage and distanced observation. Its the only one that I think works, though 'PeeWee' comes close. But that's because that whole movie is in its tone. Here, the movie is centered in the beings involved and how they relate to the films they are making, which of course happens to be the same relationship the characters and actors have with the movie we are watching.Its because it is a real movie, with arcs, three acts, and an end that works. Burton isn't so picky about these things in his other projects and none has all three. I wonder why no one holds him to this value, of building a film from the inside out. He needs someone to guide him away from merely starting with tone, and Elfman honks.There are two folds here. The first is obvious, a self-described quirky filmmaker making a film with wit about an unintentionally quirky filmmaker making what he sees as serious films. The second is the 'Shadow of the Vampire' bit about Landau's Lugosi. Its something of a wholly separate thread, handled with a different tone in all dimensions. Meaningful narrative needs tension, and I am increasingly convinced that in cinema that requires two different whole personalities.

Not so long ago, filmmaker had two choices, something had to be real, or it had to be drawn. But the drawing was real too. Now, the advanced of computer-generated techniques is so great that soon it will be cheaper to make a computer-generated film than by any other technique. We'll still have the others, but only because of nostalgia. There'll be a demand for old-fashioned Disney-type films because we remember that world fondly.

The Hustler," Bank Shot
","Spoilers herein.Here's a game I play: find the similarities between the story and how the story is told. After all, the same mind makes both decisions. Often there isn't deep reflection on the choices -- they just feel right. But sometimes the relationship shows careful selection of strategies and philosophies.  We see here that the key artists know what they were about and engineered the drama to reflect the dynamics of pool.The story is simple: characters as pool balls, bouncing off of one another, with a particular combination shot resulting in both a death of one and the better placement of another. Every element of the story reinforces this notion. The staging is very abstract, very clean. Cinemascope black and white provides a wide table. But watch these actors. I really appreciate actors who have both ability as actors and ability to integrate their methods into the larger methods of the project. Very few actors know how to do this, or even care. They instead substitute what we as viewers call 'ensemble' acting, which consists of bouncing off of each other like balls. That happens here, but this is Scott's project: he adds a dimension to this, the dimension of manipulating the dynamics of the actors. Meta-acting. His character manipulates everyone else; two of them (Fats and Fast, whose very names indicate permutations like poolballs) try to manipulate each other, and the method is manipulating balls. But then of course, the balls are them, their configuration affects the competition between Fast and Fats, and on up the chain determines how well Scott and his character play their games.Scott is an underappreciated actor, actually I mean to say that he is appreciated for his superb ability to do the ordinary rather than his risky attempts to do (as here) the extraordinary. I can this folded acting. Newman knew he was being manipulated as an actor and himself claims to not have learned folded acting until much later in 'The Verdict.'Piper is exploited as an actress just as her character is.

Terminator Salvation," Flamed
","With these kinds of movies, if you get the world wrong, then the whole thing falls apart. You need the definition of the alternative world, because the differences between it and what we know is where the agency of the story comes from. 'Fifth Element' was basically banal, but it worked well because we knew the world, we saw the differences and we saw how they were leveraged in the story and cinematic elements.The world in this thing is all wrong. Whoever imagined it thought that piles of rubble, with predictably spaced fires (fires?) would do it. For the long shots, you had to have fire as well, so just use the same sorts of flares Ridley Scott used in 'Bladerunner,' because — so he says — he simply had no money. They thought that an oblique allusion to Jesus would substitute for the more powerful notion of entangled causality and plastic time from the earlier installments.Since it is simply a loud, boring rehash of old bits, the viewer is free to ramble.The overlaps with real life? As it happens, the reference to robots that look like humans but which are mechanical 'inside' is already something that has moved outside the movie imagination and is accepted as real by most. Add in the face of a governor and there is a sort of folding here. Not directed, not effective, but clearly engineered.Its the notion of the conspiracy that intrigues me. Usually in this brand of science fiction some large part of the permanent world is determined to mess up the lives of the players we focus on. This interests me because it extends and leverages that peculiar cinematic trend of noir: that the existence of what we see as a film, literally creates the dynamics we see, shaped not because they make sense in the world, but that they make sense for a cinematic narrative. Coincidences happen. Forces arrange themselves. Knowledge is sculpted.It helps when the world of the conspiracy is complex. Here, it is not. There are machines. They do what appears to be nothing at all except hunt humans. There is no world- creation, no cosmic urge other than that. Even Marvel comics does better than that.The only elaboration is the apparent plot to trick a man-machine into believing he is a man with free will, only to discover that — initially at least — he is not. But he gains his humanity in such an uninteresting tin man sort of way, you will cringe.McG usually has a lighter, more complex touch. He does have one scene in the beginning where Connor's fight in a helicopter has the camera affixed to the frame of the copter. It is buffeted, and inverted. It seems to have been planned a s cue that an intelligent framing will unfold.

Insomnia," Waking Life
","Spoilers herein.The element that makes cinema unique is the ability to fold: to shuffle time and narrative both by the mind and eye.Nolan showed great promise with `The Following,' built around a very ambitious narrative structure. It moved the notion of narration way in front of the camera and even beyond, in front of a character's eye but behind his mind. Other experiments have tried this from the failed `Watcher,' to `Snake Eyes and `Body Double.' Nolan failed because his story had too many noir complications -- plus it is difficult to simultaneously twist both the story and the narration of the story.He solved that in `Memento.' A very successful project which amazed more with its competent handling of the problem than in the value of the experience of actually watching it. It promised much of a future from someone who understand what film was all about. But as with Soderbergh, that promise is dashed. I am sure that Nolan believes his new sponsor, Soderbergh, that you can alternate commercial projects with the more personal work (like his `Limey'). We'll have to see in both cases.But as to this project, it fails. The notion of the original was clever: history can be changed by shifting evidence, and that shift can make the merely true truly true. (`Lone Star.') The backbone is the story of cop who planted evidence to catch the real crooks and is mirrored by a mystery writer who worked the other way. His quest involved making his murder fiction more powerful by inserting a real murder in it, then mirroring the reporting on the page with the reporting to a cop. The idea went further into Nolan/Soderbergh territory by having the `narrator' experience sleep deprivation which produces hallucinations and memory transformation of the sort that influences perception and especially memory. This is the stuff that involves the viewer in confusion about what is true, or so it was intended.But no one seems to have told Pacino, as if he would have listened anyway. Any opportunity to introduce ambiguity is completely wasted by him. He hallucinates from Robin's eyes but makes no note of it. He has a recurring Lady Macbeth moment of the indelible blood, but we get no feel for the shifting of memory as a stain. At the end, no one in the theater got the intended ambiguity of whether he knowingly shot his partner or not. The intended point was that he didn't know now, but my whole audience believe it was settled as a revelation.Swank, who knows something about acting about acting, plays a mere Sandra Bullock role here. What a waste. Robin Williams gives --  surprisingly -- the best performance of the project, which should be a real warning. Little is made of the fact that he is a writer of detective stories. That the letters (do they exist?) from the murdered girl were good poetry, elicited by him in her mind just as he (in the original film) enters Pacino's mind.Is Pacino's character a live worth living?

500 Days of Summer," Death by Numbers
","Boy, how frustrating it is to have a movie that is nearly perfect in some respects but broken in others, especially when it has the potential to do things.This has the potential because it is a love story that bends the expectations from movie romance more toward the ebbs and flows of real life. In breaking this habit of expectations it uses a clever device: it breaks the linear narrative, giving you a numeric timescale. This is handled effectively because the film establishes a space for us outside the flow, populated by us and a narrator when we shift times.There is another device, used less expertly: architecture. The setup is that our guy is not a whole man romantically because he is trapped in a traditional romantic comedy sort of world. He literally works for a metaphorically apt greeting card company, generating fantasy. This is as opposed to the more three dimensional world he sees and appreciates but has yet to commit to. We are reminded of this whenever we enter that neutral narrator's space because the timeline is a number over an 'architectural drawing' by his more mature self.It should have worked. It surely was well enough considered and has a first class place in the film. But the problem is that the filmmaker did not understand architectural dynamics well enough to use them. What he thinks is architecture is the grouping of buildings you see when sitting on a park bench and mapping the three dimensional experience to a two dimensional drawing. This is as great a mistake as being in the greeting card business and sort of poisons the dynamic that this is supposed to support.But I count it a plus that they knew about the dynamic and tried even though they didn't actually capture it.The thing that doesn't work in my opinion is the girl. I've just seen another film, much more ambitious that Zooey anchored. She mastered the thing with a practiced stance at being outside the reaction of self without being within a state of self knowledge. Here, she is supposed to be ubercute but secure in action, something not normal in film woman. But she cannot pull it off: either she is earnest or she is submissively appealing, or she is in control of her life but never all three at once. And this is what we need.In fact, in the midst of our hero's depression, he has a blind date with an attractive redhead played by Rachel Boston. (Why are so many secondary redhead actresses named Rachel?) She is better at this synthesis than Zooey, but perhaps that was deliberate.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",Null,4,6,21 August 2010
Juno," Baby Formula
","Okay, we've had some experiments by risktakers, and now its clear what this new formula is. This movie is effective because it understands what that formula is, what it has to do and then does it with precision.The formula is to take adolescent vulnerability, define it away from the normal high school stereotypes, and exploit it with coolness depicted lightly. So what you do is discard one of the two primary urges of youth (to belong) and emphasize the other, to be cool (to which others want to belong). Being cool is a token standing for being genuine and true. You are therefore endearing and what weaker teens aspire to be.All of us are essentially teens (or pretending not to be), so this dynamic plays on the attractiveness of the character. Its a simple formula, rendered here by very clear writing devices. Its important that the boyfriend be uncool, with his only distinguishing attribute that he was picked by the girl. This is done by the usual means; he's a skinny dweeb and acknowledged by everyone as such. But he's also a member of the recurring nameless group of runners, a chorus all undistinguished in their appearance and behavior. There are writing tricks as well. When we first meet him, she thinks his running shorts are 'more gold' than the others. There are three important occurrences where he is conflated with furniture, and the metaphor is made stronger by our heroine thinking about assuming the same role. These are so prominent, that I suspect they were the first things imagined.A key scene has her teetering on the edge of seducing an older man, the husband of the couple designated to receive her baby. What she's done is place herself in the way so that he can seduce her. Its something that we sense as subtle in the movement toward the seduction, when she backs out. He asks why she's there if not for this, and she avers that she 'wanted to be a piece of furniture in his life.' This is careful writing, very tightly braided.Of course we aren't meant to see any of this structure because the idea is to fall in love with this girl as exemplar of a personality attractor, and a catalog of desirable traits. She is given some wonderful lines, and directed to deliver them with precisely the type of natural confidence the role requires. Not the role in the movie, but the role such people play in our lives. It helps that she is slight, lesbian (in real life) and confident.Other writerly devices...The 'adult' couple who will become adoptive parents turn out to be a sort of mirror: a strong woman (with flaws our teen doesn't have) who clearly has picked her male the same way Juno has. He's literally furniture as well, stays home. Has his own room. He is not whole person, and indeed is one of the followers instead of an leader in this social business of who defines who. He leaves the scene to find himself after we learn that is even attracted to Juno.The whole thing is designed as an abstraction. Well, most of these movies are, but this is all affirmed through the credits when we see not a real film of our character walking (after introducing us to her chair), but a semicartoon. Its a cartoon world, with a semireal Juno walking through it. Those first few minutes of a movie are when we are particularly sensitive to cues about the nature of what we are to see. The visual unreality segues to an encounter with a convenience store clerk that affirms, yes, we are to see a semifantasy here that plays with roles. The music underscores the sketchy cartoon motif by being all overtly handmade.Once in the thing, we are surrounded with the need to define ourselves by others, with a focus on children. Her mother is defined in 20 seconds in terms of her three new babies. Her stepmom (who has a new baby: 'Liberty Bell') is defined in terms of the pseudobabies she still wants. There's the Jennifer Garner character. Its even in little things, like the Manga comic designed for boys of a kickass pregnant teen. Its significant that except for a teary moment near the end, Juno doesn't need a baby to be cool. And we end lingering with a view of that innocent, natural strength, as she goes back to her chair.Good writing.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,21,37,21 January 2008
The Day After Tomorrow," Burned Books
","Spoilers herein.Why oh why do makers of bad films sometimes put a really good actor in a minor part? It just makes everything else seem cheap. In this case, Ian Holm has a few small scenes that anchor the film. He plays the part that Francois Truffaut played in 'Close Encounters,' that of interpreter and connection to the real work of excellent film.This film starts the same, with vignettes from all over the world, including a nod to the snippet that Attenborough filmed in India for Spielberg. Then it simply borrows bits and pieces from other movies: the father who wants to earn fatherhood, the loyal sidekick, the guy (same guy in this case) who cuts himself from a dangling rope to save others, the black supernerd kid, the smarmy Republicans and on and on.Its all pretty boring except for the wall of water, and we are left trying to sort out which of the 'facts' is plausible. The most unbelievable thing in this whole enterprise is the notion of a president who is the LAST to run away! But that business about a drastic drop of temperature. At least it is novel and we have the fertile mind of Art Bell (our modern Charles Fort, who incidentally all but lived in the New York Public Library) to thank for that.

Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," 28 Rides Later
","The politics of summer movies is strange indeed. Critics seem particularly out of tune of viewers excepting for gross ranking. After the second weekend, word of mouth trumps advertising, so it will be interesting to see how this current crop is rated by IMDb viewers after that. As action movies go, what matters to me first is the cinematic experience. Story, characters and such need only be sufficient to give an excuse for optical adventure. That's why I like Stephen Sommers and Peter Jackson. They understand dimension, and provide it to me in ways that are new and exciting.'Spiderman' in all three episodes should have been at least as good as the best. Instead, as with all the Marvel productions, it was far less rewarding than average. They are boring if you can't get excited about the characters; I just can't imagine anyone who could. We need a 'Doctor Strange' movie. And we need some other filmmakers than have been seen in the Marvel corral.For that Doctor Strange movie, we could do a lot, lot worse than go with Verbinski. I'm impressed by this movie. It's not of the 'King King' class, but it has quite a few interesting elements.What most people will remark on is the characters, led by Depp. They are good enough excepting the 'girl' pirate who is so far below the others in charisma it will set female imagination back a couple decades. It was a mistake made in the original, a soccer snooker that we got stuck with. We needed Geena Davis, or her successor. If Geena was the new Sigourney, who's the new Geena?The story is very well tuned to my mind. Every major character has some duplicity, not all of which we can guess or even understand after we get the whole movie. I believe they did this to give the movie legs, so that it will be watched over and over again after the opening honeymoon is over. But it has an effect that I appreciate: the narrative is sliced and diced as we jump from story to story and shifting intents. Its by some otherwise crass writers, but in this context doesn't seem overlarge.What's nice are two cinematic effects.The first I have remarked on before. The intent of the film is to merge cinema with theme park, a unified monetizing strategy with two different media. That means the film is more extremely architectural and spatial than usual. A reward for those of us who appreciate space. As with the two previous films, each episode on a ship establishes the ship first as a space, and then the characters within. Its rare; its hard; its effective; it empowers imagination and lucid dreaming. And probably sells Disneyland ride tickets as well.The second cinematic value I appreciated was the variety of styles and effects. Usually a summer blockbuster is pretty much the same noise from beginning to end, with the only variety coming from the different tools used by the effects subcontractors who lead different action scenes. But there was so much design here as we moved from one storyline to another, it made the thing seem as if we were visiting different rooms, each with its own world dynamics. Its most obvious when we first see Sparrow in his limbo, a ship frozen Shackleton- wise in a smooth surface of ice. This, by the way really does quote the amazing Hurley photos of this very real episode in history. Somebody knew their history of cinema and pushed that perceptron button.That business about crab-stones is inspired. (Oddly the paired effect  when Kalipso is 'unleashed'  is the least memorable in the film.) The idea of having Depp encounter versions of himself is extremely clever and I know of no one else who could have pulled it off. Its what he does in his mind when acting anyway.

","One nice thing about this is the casting of McKellan and Stewart. Despite the latter's adventures with the stupid StarTrek, he is an intelligent actor, as is McKellan. They tower over the amateurs in this film as their characters should. About bad acting, can we be spared from Ms. Berry in the future?The photography is overloaded on face supercloseups, and the tone is suitably dark. None of the sets thrill.What's awkward about this attempt is how muddled all the conspiracies are. Thrown into the same blender are Nazi mass murder, Nazi experimentation, radioactive fallout, mind control, US war-time mutant experiments (to come more explicitly when we find out about Wolverine), religious righteousness in the Senate, one-world governments, the hidden x-men, and the evil mutants-who-are-sometimes-merely-mistaken. Are there supposed to be bad guys? What's the central struggle? There's not enough intelligence here to put shades on the real driver. It's paranoia in the comix, which are far more intelligent and nuanced than this film. How can that be?The ultimate Marvel film should come from Dr Strange.

Spider-Man 3," Entangled
","Its not going to be another comment about how large complex projects have to be unimaginative for the simple reason of coordinating all the geographically dispersed teams working on bits that need to integrate. I've studied this in some detail in the film business. Its a mundane insight and I won't bore you with it.Let's just say that of all the superhero movies, this one has the most possibilities for giving us exciting dimensional vision. 'King Kong' did it, and I saw some titillating motions in another WETA project, 'Van Helsing.' And there was some promise in the last Spiderman's fight with Ock. And its not as if dull studios can't do dimensional: just watch that first chase in 'Casino Royale.'But this is as pure a cinematic waste as I've experienced, so let's talk about why it fails and why it appears not to.Film is a matter of assembly across different worlds. There's the central world of the embodiment anchored by the actors of course, and there's the world of the cinematic cosmos, how the world works and the eye we borrow behaves in it. On these two armatures are assembled all sorts of bits that each are placed individually but that we seldom see as bits. What we are meant to see is the overall organism, the being of the thing.There are only two ways for this to emerge. Either you use convention or you rely on some coherent orchestration, usually from one mind. Here it is mere convention and why this is ordinary, even ordinarily ordinary. I've given up on Raimi, and so apparently have all his talented collaborators: Dykstra, Elfman the most obvious. He's the new Verhoeven.He's interested in events and not circumstance. Snapshots (as is Jonah Jameson) instead of story; parts instead of assemblies. Its film-making 101, this, that real film is not about independent panels like a comic book. There's motion involved. That motion has to behave in accordance with and at the same time define and illustrate the world we see and the dynamics of how we see it. Those rules of motion are negotiated over time between us and the filmmakers, and constitute an evolving vocabulary. What he have here is the cinematic equivalent of two hours or 'you know' and other such automatic, meaningless utterances. Part of what we pay for is this game, and under normal circumstances the question we decide is whether we want sugar or meat. Here we get cardboard.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",Null,15,27,15 May 2007
Match Point," Not the Point, Not the Game
","God bless Woody.He drives me nuts. He told us his psychiatric diagnosis 25 years ago. He 'Zelig,' someone who bends to the strongest influence he encounters. He's often able to become master of whatever tradition he falls into, though we always seem to judge him on some past project we like. We think we know the man: well, we know a few things. He wears Manhattan. He has a stuttering mask of indecision. He loves not women but how they slide between what is and what they wish for us and them. But as an artist, we know nothing. Everything is a new experience, a new adventure and even the framework for exploration or experimentation shifts so there is no way to describe what we have. Anyone who purports to misses the point. The man as an artist must be taken as the quantum blur surrounding the poles of what we have encountered.When he makes a film, it rarely matters as a film. Oh, some do. I would value 'Sweet and Lowdown' and 'Annie Hall' even if we had nothing else, and I would pay dearly to see the three hour mystery cut of 'Annie Hall.' But even those adventures pale when considering the vast, deep wander through cinematic ideas he's taken us.So when I sit through this mess, and wonder why, why could someone do something so mindless, so lacking in richness... I wonder what, is he dead already? This has no elaboration, no noir agency, no complicating perspective, no folding, passion. It isn't even what it shows, an ad hoc inventiveness to pleasure, contrived at the last minute. It does have some introspection on the unlikely existence of itself  accident.But it isn't accident. Its yet another street he's wandered down, another Tourette's utterance. It has no value in itself as a movie for me. It doesn't have to. Its another, different page in a life that has become a larger movie for me. And is there any better thing to say about a life as an artist?The lovely thing is that the films are essentially all most of us have about the man, and each can be used as a window into the others.One thing about each film is that it is a lover that he abandons, probably already on to the next one.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",Null,7,10,24 July 2007
Yes Man," Lost in the DVD Store
","The main character here is described to us as someone with no life. As the movie proceeds, our man has a modern redemption: he is enriched. It is important to get this initial notion of emptiness conveyed to us in as economical way as possible because generally it gets in the way of the following endearment-comedy cycle that these things depend on.So our guy is shown avoiding real life and aimlessly drifting through a video rental store, picking through time-wasting DVDs. This film would easily be one of them.Once again, ordinary life is contrasted with a magical world presented in the way that a movie is. People come and sit in an auditorium for an hour or two and their lives are transformed. The people in the ordinary world are hypnotized. I call this simple device 'folding.' It takes that audience and conflates it with us, and we subconsciously adopt some of the characteristics of the on-screen audience. It is a cheap shot, a simple trick. But it works, and this is why we see it so much.Otherwise the thing has a standard form: girl won, girl lost, girl regained in a public display. Since we already have blown the audience effect for another purpose, here we have the audacious plot element that our appealing girl teaches jogging photography in one of the most cinematic urban parks in the country! It is just because of that last scene where a crowd as surrogate photographic voyeurs, can applaud the ultimate kiss.Zoe is appealing.

Resident Evil: Extinction," Two Hundred of Milla's Legs
","I went into this with mixed expectations; ever since 'Transformers' caught me by surprise and thrilled me, I never know what to expect. Perhaps some clever artist usually in the background might do something special that grabs. Later chapters in series films often allow this, as they are better engineered generally.I saw the first of this series and thought it surprisingly full of cinematic ideas. Not particularly novel, but notable. Milla understands the camera. There's something happening in film types for women and its not inconsequential that Milla's body type is working where Tomb Raider's didn't. This body type is usually associated with Eastern European women in porn and its cousin fashion modeling at the supermodel level. It starts with Nastassja Kinski, and how Polanski and then Shrader directed her. I think she was a significant influence on this.And there's the fact that Nastassja was lovers with those two directors, and Milla also with her two best. I expected that to show here. Even though her husband isn't directing, he is the producer and owner of the franchise. And he chose an energetic Australian to direct. I'll never avoid an Australian. She was redheaded in the first one. I knew that she would not be here, but her sidekick Clair would. It matters with this woman definition business.I sorta liked it. There's not much imagination in anything: zombies are ordinary zombies. Sets are ordinary, more from the stagy than the realistic side. The technology is distractingly goofy  does anyone take any of this seriously? We were supposed to have already two generations of tech-savvy kids. The story is the ordinary business about an evil corporation that controls the world and ruins it. Even the underground stuff is borrowed. But what does work. No I'll say it differently: what I think matters here is how her fight scenes are composed. Now, you should know that she is not human. She's part human, part machine and has some supernatural powers that are probably explained in a teen-daft way in some game material. So you get lots of triumphal shooting and especially slicing with some scimitars, usually associated with pirates (coming from north African Arabs, so associated with them too). Lots of fight poses.I believe those poses are not derived from any martial tradition, or cinematic template, but are designed to showcase certain parts of her body, and how she moves. Its not about boobs here, but thighs. Everything in this movie revolves around her thighs. What you would normally think of as key shots associated with anchoring the narrative serve a different purpose. They shown her pelvis and always the same movements. I suppose they did some audience testing on this since the first one. The story is targeted toward the what happens at the end: she kills her creator and nemesis, and discovers hundreds of copies of herself, all nude of course. Its pretty clear what they intend here.Maybe it won't stick. But I bet it does. If it doesn't, it will be because her previously boyish face has been so surgically smoothed and puffed it seems inhumanly repellent.

Midnight in Paris," The Woman's Kitchen
","I am temporarily in a situation where it Is difficult to see a film. Building the conditions to watch one properly are rare, so when you can build such a space, what film do you build it around?As with meal long deferred, most of the digestion is in the anticipation.As it happened, choices were limited, but we were lucky because in retrospective wisdom, I would have chosen this.Woody is all about yearning; knowing the worth of the true center and the anxious stuttering around it. The device is that he poses himself just at the extreme of where we are so as to reward both the truth of the vision and relative resolve of our quest. As usual, the narrative is folded: a 'Hollywood hack' intent on making something more genuine. We know — we watchers — that the man is emotionally rooted in Manhattan and has largely defined it for us cinematically. Sinatra can only sing about it, but he invented the antidote city: Las Vegas.Also, we know that Woody is filming in other world cities to escape his creative constraints. Some camera and processing technology is new as well. (And because we are up on the Hollywood component of the Marshall plan, we know that Hollywood invested in making Paris (and Rome) romantically attractive.)Storywise, we have our pilgrim encounter great artists, or at least artists, writers and filmmakers who have found an essential place in our narrative of what art is. The names alone — without any exposure to the art itself — carry weight. Cinematically, there is nothing more substantial than those personalities of the past who have penetrated our souls and established a ground. Nothing, that is, except the quest for love and how the gravity of the one gives fragrance to the other. A girlfriend who doesn't get this has an affair with a pedant who maintains the protections against this truth — a bit too obviously: there are two obviously constructed scenes with this guy about confusing wives and deep, deep sexually-connected muses.When entering his films, you make allowances: that there will be reduction of the noir hero to self-effacing almost paralyzed observer. This time it isn't Woody himself, but we have to struggle a bit to get over how Owen is like and unlike the character we know Woody wrote. And as usual, the focus is on the women. Not the women themselves, but how they appear and know it. And how they use that appearance to drive energy through (alas) creative men.(How different the world would be if Yoko, Oja, and the Alices, including the one featured here had been effective in their art. I eagerly dive into the woman-driven notion of creative energy but where are the female Woodies? Miranda July? Where are the women filmmakers who can film their lovers to effect?)Anyway, Woody allows us to have fun encountering the names, putting bodies in front of them and amusing us with the simple lesson of their ordinariness. Fortunately for me, this filmmaker is predictable enough — and the women herein performing in such familiar ways — that the taste of the meal is a delicious before as after.

A Bridge Too Far," Brits Do Their Best To Lose the War
","Spoilers herein.What a remarkable story. What a remarkable event that this was made by Brits. Self-examination? Exploration of the still arrogant class system that even then insisted they were a world power? Apology?Quite apart from the historical significance of the event (and the significance of the film of the event), this is rather worth watching. It isn't because of the story, which is muddled and drifts off into ratholes like the operation. (Remember how clear everything was in `Seven Samurai')? It isn't because of the acting, which in general is British `tea-pot' acting. That is except for Anthony Hopkins. I've really pinged him for his later work, but here his readings are a true as wind.It isn't for the score which must rank among the worst in film history (for a major film).It isn't for the feel of tension, or the effects or anything like that. What makes this special is the camera. The shots of the airdrop from that first flash of beige planes until Sean Connery takes charge is brilliant filmmaking. The focus on tank treads, on glider towropes unfurling; the POV shots of dropping soldiers, the rise of the attacking tanks over the bridge. Although one loses the narrative thread of what's happening where spatially, the viewer certainly gets a feel for the machinery so it makes sense when Connery's group is stuck without it. The bridgemaking sequence flows like the water under it and seems to have the same inevitable inertia.Now think about this: no helicopter shots. no slowmotion. no CGI, no compositing, no filters -- just the vision of one man and a simple camera in the moment of happening. (just like Connery's bunch with their shoes and rifles and little else while all the technology is set apart, waiting. Every framing trick Speilberg pulled in `Private Ryan,' you can see here except the underwater shots. And better, less cluttered with the need to thrill.

Zodiac," Construction Watcher
","There's purpose in film, in certain film conventions of narrative. Its a sort of quantum physics of narrative. Not the uncertainty side, but the fact that there are different states; you can be at one state or another or another but never in between. Humans think this way, perhaps because you cannot have half a person, half a mind.Anyway, there are several discrete stations that we accept in relation to film stories, several discrete distances between what we are allowed to see and what our avatar(s) see in the story. At one end is the mystery where our relationship is more with the writer or some god than the emotions in the story.And then at the other end is stuff like this, the purest form of which is the procedural. In this case, there is a mystery, a story to discover. We have on-screen detectives and within certain narrow limits, we discover what the detectives do. We may see things a little before, but we never see more or know more than they. Procedurals only appeared well after the detective meme settled into our narrative vocabulary. So it is a sort of second generational shift in the mechanics of discovery.And who is at the center? Robert Downey Jr, one our most talented folders  and by that I mean someone who plays a role, but also plays a metarole of an actor playing a part. Here his character tries to horn in on the narration and fails, becoming a substance abuser. How meta is that?I like Fincher. I like it when he is bolder, but all these guys like to do a project from time to time where the art is in the precision of the narrative placement. And he does amazingly well. It would have had to have been a procedural.There's a shot of the murdercab where the precision is noted as it follows the cab to the place. We are precisely over, precisely. The cab stays precisely in the center of the frame. Precisely. We are locked into what it moving, with no allowance for godly insight from other contexts. Its a statement.There's another quite wonderful statement. We see the Transamerica being constructed in an animated sequence. It seems particularly automated, deterministic.

Milk," Good Enough for a God?
","There's a scene early in this film that is reprised at the end. our hero at 40 says he's done nothing he is proud of, nothing that mattered. Then we follow him in the next 8 years until his death, where he -- we are convinced -- has. Its a patriotic story, and I cried. But the timing is bad for this effect, because its quite clear that in real terms we are not much better off as a nation after thirty years.The country is more driven by Christian fundamentalism than ever, and remains more fundamentalist than, say, Pakistan. Gays are even more attractive scapegoats for rousing the base than ever before. Though the Anita Bryant of the events we see was publicly humiliated, we manufacture Anita substitutes in large numbers.This ran through my mind, because though the life we see may have seemed significant, I wonder. And the same can be said of the film, and that's what this comment is about.Van Sant knows how to make an effective film. This has all sorts of narrative devices based on recall, each of which reinforce the others.Its framed by a tape made by the soon-to-be-murdered activist. It merges staged drama with real news footage (peppered with fake ones). It merges real and imagined threads in his life. Most profoundly, it merges clear 'modern' visions of the Castro in its day with seemingly genuine footage as we would see it today: grainy, jerky, dated dyes. There are other intermingling of things from the time with modern ones. We notice them because the times are so close. Simple things like colloquialisms, political notions. Bigger things like the carriage of key characters, the cadence of speeches, even street chats.This is all to say that there is a lot of very clever engineering here to fold us into the thing, its times and energies. But is it good enough?Sure, we are glad that a 'movement' was started. We celebrate his life at the end as we are supposed to. But is the project strong enough to change us? Surely I have encountered films that are powerful enough to turn lives, to crease souls. Does this material deserve something like that, or is it enough to make us feel right for its last hour? Can you have a powerful film and a simple celebration? Can significant true events be recounted in a way that causes more significant events  which is to ask whether the true can come from the true.I only know that this film was fine.

The Prestige," Dead Hats, Squashed Birds
","Let's face it, there aren't many good writers for cinema. Yet the bar has gotten higher while certain narrative structures have become more acceptable. Nolan has earned a place as one of the best without a Spanish surname. It seems he starts with a notion of multiple parallelisms in narrative, then fleshes them out using some of the techniques common in or best literature, but always envisioned first cinematically. The five parallelisms here are: Warring magicians (mirrored by the warring real life magicians Tesla and Edison). The realities of life and pretended or performed life, with the common fold of the play we see and the performance(s) they make. Multiple existence of beings Different slices of time as the narrative is unrolled backwards and forwards in bits. The way the stories are recounted in two overlapping diaries, each a lure. Pay particular attention to this, and the fairly literate references, starting with Van Helsing and covering at least a few Shakespearean phrases.Its therefore 5 times more clever, engaging and rewarding than 'The Illusionist,' itself a competent oneway fold.Spend some time with this.

The Terminator," The Obsession to Hunt
","Spoilers herein.After a few films, you get to know a director's mind. Sometimes that mind is broken or limited in ways that has the serendipitous effect of creating work that the public embraces.Vincent Van Gogh is one of my icons for this phenomenon, a deeply disturbed man with vast limitations on his vision but one major crack (and a few minor ones)into a whole new world. It doesn't matter whether the artist understands this, though Vincent did and wrote eloquently on it. Either way, when the public embraces such stuff, the world changes. It shifts center to the new way and sometimes seals off the areas the artist never saw. So sometimes, effective art damages us.Cameron is a force in film, possibly as damaging in his way as Speilberg, but with far fewer and less varied films. What he sees and can display must be attractive to judge from the receipts. What he cannot see is less obvious. Here is his first real film, his `Rocky.'In my comment on `Aliens,' I noted the radically differing styles of Cameron and the man who invented the sexual, scifi horror genre. Cameron starts with the stunts, adds humor and then finds places for the actors and situations. Most work the other way around. Scott starts with a general vision first; for him, stunts are merely punctuation of the visual space. But Cameron starts with a mechanical skeleton, not at all unlike that shown here.And then his strategy is to be relentless in eliminating the human elements of the film: those elements like character development, richness of situation, emotional space. He crushes them just like Arnie's cybergoon, because they simply mess up the cleanliness of his movie. Such `soft' stuff is for wimps. Any sort of irony or annotation is for eggheads and who needs em.In the roughly 20 years since this was made, the film world has changed radically with much energy attracted to the Cameron model. The machines in Hollywood are winning. Four years later, `Die Hard' introduced a simple sort of self-effacing irony into the model and until now that is the only human remnant remaining. It is hidden, and the hardcore action guys often poke fun at it (see `XXX' vs `Men in Black 2'). And more, now life further imitates art with Arnie planning run for political office!The point is, folks that watching film can be great fun even if the films themselves are poor.

Hellboy II: The Golden Army," X-communicated
","The strategy here is obvious: discriminate from a dozen other summer movies by providing a more engaging character and more imaginative creatures.Its with a bit of sadness that I am finding del Toro unrewarding. Its because I value deep film experiences so, and because as a class, Spanish-speaking filmmakers are head and shoulders above others in the values that matter to me: cleverness, reflection, emotional insight.Del Toro is none of these. The story on him is that he is supposed to be a visually creative genius in the imagination department. Well, if he were, it would be an imagination focused on objects and not environments. This is a killer, because film depends on the creation of a world, and worlds are not the things in them. Its about the stuff that surrounds, governs, colors and produces those things and beings. Good plays can be based on characters, but good film always requires a world.So okay, what about the beings? Are the characters different and deep enough for us to immediately see that this is different? For my money, Red is drawn from pretty ordinary clichés. And the supposedly novel beings from this and 'Labyrinth'?They're impressive just because someone made them, but they all seem to come from the rubber mask tradition even though the technology doesn't limit so. This man fails on both counts as an imaginative Mexican.The one thing that I did notice and which was remarkable was the clockworks. His first movie (I think) was 'Chronos.' It had an object with watchlike gears that we would sail through. The same effect is used here in several areas. One is the credits, which usually tells you this defines the universe of the film.Its in an incidental scene where an ectoplasmic being introduces his soul into the mechanism of a complex lock in order to divine the combination. (He succeeds, opening to another world.) The fight in this episode ends with a beast getting caught in part of a related machine.And its the primary device used in the climax, sort of bridging from the clock that drives the universe to one that drives the mechanical army. It also spills into the machinery of the each golden soldier who is indestructible because of attunement to this celestial machinery. And it provides the physical environment for the showdown between hero and villain, with them having a conventional old fight while hopping among cogs and gears Chaplinwise. The problems are: the vision is unoriginal, and the practical stage for the final fight is hugely clunky as if it were a Busby Berkeley stage. But its more than this. Its the only thing we have that is environmental. Its the only thing given that helps define how this imaginary world works. We have a prophet who gives Red's life back and tells of things that MUST occur. But none of it is related: the machines to each other, the machines to the determinism of fate, the machines to the cinematic situation.Orreries are special in film. They work.

Cloverfield," Great Invasive Idea
","Sometimes the idea of a movie can transform the experience of watching it, and sometimes only on remembering it. The challenge is to have ideas that are not only clever and appear so, but which actually make good, effective films that matter.I went into this thinking that it would be an evolution of 'Transformers.' That film worked for me, and worked in ways that were beyond anything I had seen. Sure the story was dumb and the very idea of the robots was childish. But the way the film was put together was a bit astonishing. In old movies, if there was a monster destroying a building, well then you saw the building being destroyed as if you were a placid god in the sky somewhere. With Transformers, you never really saw things this way. You saw them as if you were an observer threatened by and involved in the action. You were running, avoiding, occasionally glancing and sometimes accidentally seeing part of what was happening. It was new, marvelous. But we always knew the cameras were not associated with humans, at least not the ones on screen. The idea was to trick us into adopting the disembodied cameras we always accepted and allowed us, the audience to be threatened, to be there.Now this. Some of the effects are the same. At least in the beginning of the disaster, we only partially see what is happening. And there are many times when the camera is unsteady. But I got the impression that although the camera was handled by a panicked character, we always saw more than he would have. The camera was always where we would have wanted it, arranged to increase the dramatic effect.Transformers was silly and we could assault it. Cloverfield was supposedly real and it assaulted us. That makes the deliberation of camera a whole different thing. Its control is external to what's happening. We do realize this without thinking about it, and it diffuses the terror and changes it to spectacle. This folding technique only works when you have the commitment of the audience. They thought they would get it with the teen soap opera at the beginning. Didn't work for me.It would have worked better if she hadn't ASKED to be rescued.Nice bridge though.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",Null,13,25,29 January 2008
Hotel Rwanda," Bribery
","There is a certain sadness, a certainty of sadness in stories like this, and the movies that tell them. It reduces to us being made to care for a very few souls and then celebrate when our chosen people escape the fate of many others around them. The cost of this dynamic is straightforward: we have to make the others die, often horribly. It is a cheap sort of drama, the cheapest, the basest. It dehumanizes us because we become complicit in dehumanizing those that are sacrificed so that we can have a perhaps challenging but comfortable theater experience.We'll see it in blockbuster movies, when some alien invasion or natural event kills millions (or billions) but we follow a few that escape. We'll even see it in the shootouts of ordinary magical gun movies where the others drop one per shot while our guy wondrously and gracefully kills.But in this case, the tragedy is real. It really happened: a million people killed in as much time as a summer vacation: killed by neighbors with machetes. A million people killed because we stood by. The film does make a very central point, but not clearly enough. There are two warring tribes here, Hutu and Tutsi. But genetically they are identical. They speak the same language and culturally are the same. The difference? Belgium race theorists created the difference so that they could turn over the country to those they believed genetically superior, and that superiority determined by body and facial proportions. The accursed 'golden mean.' (The distinction until then was one of class.)We do have Nick Nolte in the role of Privileged-Non-African-on-the-Spot. Joaquin Phoenix as a reporter supplements his role. They have the task of letting us know these facts and also that the genocide was easily preventable if a few troops had been sent in, which could have happened but for French and Belgian obstruction. No more than ten bureaucrats in Europe — whose names we know — killed a million while the local church helped.With that sad background, we have a hard time celebrating the survival of our hero and those he saves. This is made harder because the drama is poorly constructed and executed. It not enough that the wife be a good soul, or that the hotel manager be resourceful, or that many cliffhanger episodes are pulled back from near disaster. It is not enough that two little girls are found at the last minute and whisked to an adjacent country with laws and safety. It is not enough. It almost is not anything.The camera could have been used. We know how to do that. We had a camera on screen in a ready role. There could easily have been the power of effective cinema brought to this event, this reportage,When you make a film that involves political events so significant, you take a responsibility.

","Here's a remarkable project. Its poorly made, with much of the incoherent elements hiding behind its presentation as homemade.It has nonprofessional; actors and it shows. It has catchy songs that by themselves are forgettable. The girl isn't very appealing. It mixes elements from love stories that are extremely formulaic with those that are not, and the actors never understand where they are supposed to be in this. Theoretically its a mess.But it works, and it works so well that I want to recommend it to you. Its almost the perfect date movie because instead of vicariously seeing the 'happy ever after' ending and going back to your imperfect relationship, you know you would end your own movie differently.And the imperfections work, because the tone between the world of the movie and the movie is folded perfectly. It isn't that the movie is close to reality, no.There are elements that are real. The boy and girl are indeed friends, songwriting friends. Dublin does exist, or did. They did write what they sing. The story is about a ragtag experience of making a song that works out, the same as the ragtag making of the movie.The songs really do weave into the story, no deeper. Usually it is the story that the songs compliment. Here, the whole world of the story is in the songs, their tone and their sharing. Its the sharing that matters here, and it transcends everything else in the movie that may distract us.These two are soulmates. They were made for each other. They are meant to be together. We see it more than even they do, and that's the reason why this works so well.Usually in romantic movies, we are bludgeoned with the romance. Here, we are simply exposed to the result of the coupling, and we invent the romance ourselves. What we invent around those songs and copious open space is far deeper than anything that could be shown.The end is a bit perfect for this, because they both go back to prior romantic commitments and we know it is wrong. We force ourselves out of the movie and endorse the soulmatedness of the thing. In previous comments, I've remarked on the power of folding in storytelling. Here its perfect and complex, and I suspect largely unintended. That's because if you watch the DVD extras you'll see how the director stumbles about. I can only assume the producers were the ones with the intuition that matters. So avoid those extras if you can. But one piece of trivia is a must. You must look it up in IMDb to know what she says in Czech to him. Its the whole film, hidden.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,8,11,27 December 2007
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Control
","My notion of noir is simple: it is a form of narrative that recognizes that there is a viewer, and that the presence of the viewer reshapes the world to make an interesting story. That is, various unlikely circumstances occur; portholes to visibility by us as ghosts are opened; knowledge by the characters of what is going on are gated by what we know in a too and fro of dominance.It is, in other words, a world where the very presence of a viewer controls various aspects. A central character (usually one, usually a random man) struggles with how he is buffeted; comes perhaps to understand it and in the normal form achieves points in the game that puts him at the same level as the viewer. We are a sophisticated people, and this has been around for a long time — and in cinema and cinematically influenced art as well. So we have some clever adaptations and twists. One common form is the massive, all-controlling conspiracy. Another is the modern detective story where the discovery is about the detective's self as much as grokking the murder. Yet another is the con story where we follow the controller's actions but only at the end discover the means of manipulation.Here we have another variant, which is essentially a detective story to discover who is the control over the world that is manipulating our random guy, aptly named Smiley. It shares elements of the three examples above, but allows for a deeper texture because it recalls worlds that have dynamics we understand. So a talented filmmaker can reference these.And boy do we have a talented filmmaker!One world is simply the world of men with power and how they perform small ballets in their relationships one to another to be top dog, using deniable, even unconscious tactics. This becomes the foremost world in this film, and gives our main actors something to use. All of them are first rate; all respond with insights from the craft. Kathy Bates is perfectly placed as a displaced analyst with enough vision to value 'her boys' for their sexual attractiveness at the top of the heap we see.Another world is the cold war. It was hot when the book appeared, but the book already was treating it as a sort of fantasy world that came with prefabricated rules. In some ways, it has taken until now for this perspective to fully mature so that this film in this time can be far deeper than the original novel was in its time. Frankly, in its time it was trash for airport reading, of the Grisham variety. Yet another world is that of Britain in the early seventies. This was a bleak country, still not recovered from the war while its adversaries were soaring. It clung to the US instead of the continent. There is a wistful desire to please the master here that hits home for this US viewer, knowing what I know about the relationships of the intel communities.And we have the inner, personal world of loves, companions, friends, trust and sex. These are always where the bones of a story rest, and are broken.All of these are noir worlds, all manipulated by various controls (Controls, as a proper noun).All of these are masterfully called, merged and presented with us unsure of what we control.Already, I have this as a candidate for one of my two rare selections of the most important films of 2012 (my 'Fours').See it.

Catch-22," We Hate This, That's the Catch
","This is great film-making. I have never experienced greater skill with sound editing. The acting is terrific, the writing crisp and intelligent. The conception deeply nested. Why has the viewing public discarded this film? Interesting question.Usually the answer is that the film is a poor evocation of the book. It is, of course; films are fundamentally different beasts than books, so the closest one comes is to have congruence of story. But the story is the least important element of either fine books or movies. No intelligent viewer looks for sameness in an adaptation.I think the reason is simple. We are happy to accept war as heroic. Deep down, that's what we believe; whether as an inescapable fact of evolution or of chauvanistic indoctrination. Against this backdrop, we apply the stuff of our apparent convictions: that war is funny (MASH, the escape movies) or grossly brutal and confusing (Platoon, the first part of Pvt Ryan-- which then reverts to the noble). We just cannot accept the view that war comes from stupidity and selfishness, because it convinces that we, all of us every one is at root stupid and selfish. This movie is so good, it convinces of that fact, and that's why no one wants to watch it. So no one is convinced. That's the catch.",Null,222,327,19 June 2000
We Were Soldiers," Custard
","Spoilers herein.My dad was a man like this. I saw the film in an audience filled with men and women like this. I've worked with many people like this. The smartest among them know that wars are fought over ideas, and struggle to understand those ideas as intelligent warriors.One understanding is the notion that ideas take on a life of their own and act selfishly to reproduce themselves, adapting as required. One way that ideas battle each other is in films, because films invent society. And so we have the ideas behind this film and the recent `Black Hawk Down,' battling for a subliminal control over how we think of war.And it is a battle royale. Both films use a state of the art visual vocabulary, much advanced since even `Pvt Ryan.' And both films depict an air cavalry mission gone wrong resulting in a stranded, outnumbered group of rangers. Both center the motivation of the men of looking out for the guy next them. Both emphasize the `no man left behind' principle. But `Black Hawk' is a film about situations. Situations create war and the mistakes therein. In that film, the characters are deliberately confusing and there is lots of attention given to spatial definition and position. `Black Hawk' is first a cinematic being with visual sense to which a narrative is applied.`Soldiers' exists in a different world altogether. In this world, men drive events and cause wars. Their commitment (shown here as nobility) is the engine. Personalities matter, even to the point that the killed are listed in the credits. So this film spends lots of time on character development (such as it is) and interactions among (mostly between) them. `Soldiers' was born as a text, to which is here appended illustration.World of difference between these two views, one could say religions. This conflict of ideas is as profound a war as any. And we are the participants, and some of us combatants.You define yourself in large part. And a large part of that is in deciding what you think is funny, another area where movies battle for your soul. That's tough, but at least you can engineer how you approach war movies, and which ones you reach out to.I see that we are polarizing around the old John Wayne issue, with Mel Gibson taking that role. As for me, `The Thin Red Line' is the deepest, most visceral war movie.",Null,10,18,9 March 2002
The Adventures of Tintin," WETA Gold
","There are only three ways to turn on your mind. The third is too dangerous to even sketch.The most common is to allow it to do what it wants, tracing known pathways and presenting known patterns. All imagination comes home to rest.But then there is art, which in my book is able to coax the imagination out of the familiar. Sometimes this immediately extends what you know, making your house bigger. Sometimes it centers on that oldest of organizational keys: space. Sometimes it is cinematic. That's what we have here, sometimes.Oh, there is the story-stuff, inherited from a Belgian comic. That is discardable. And there is the cloying story-boarding of Spielberg who I believe is living with the growing fear that he will die never having made something essential.But behind all that is the WETA parts of this film. Spielberg does his spiel in telling the story. And he gets the lion's share of the money and credit because he owns the property. But he turned all the spatial management over to Peter Jackson and his special effects house, WETA. And we are far better off for it.Elsewhere, I have celebrated what WETA digital fx has done, which is to take the concepts pioneered by Pixar and extend them in deliberate, engineered excess. The Pixar idea was to reinvent the personality of the camera. Since it is a virtual perspective, it can use space and movement beyond what we accept at the range of a physical camera. Much of Pixar's success, I believe, is in how they reframe who the viewer is in the story by reinventing how our eye discovers.The Pixar ideal is to do this in ways that are imperceptible. The WETA philosophy is to always be a bit beyond the comfort level, always overloading our mental abilities to sort things out spatially. This both gives an exhilarating film experience and on each viewing an extension of how the mind sees. It literally expands our ability to perform spatial reasoning — which for most of us is most of our reasoning.We saw this in the Lord of the Rings projects, which despite cumbersome story and distracting heroics were visually aggressive. I believe that 'King Kong' was made solely to perfect some insights, which I presume come from founder Jamie Selkirk.(The weta is a species of insect unique to New Zealand which comes in a broad variety, filling the role that in the rest of the world is taken by mammals. (New Zealand has none.). A common characteristic, the one every kiwi child knows, is the ability to jump aggressively. They have been essentially unchanged for 500 billion times longer than the average film, yet every jump of the bush weta is unique. Without wings, they have the ability to perturb their path. You can see the analogy in the movements of the camera in earlier projects, like 'King Kong.')There are three scenes here where it is obvious that Spielberg turned over complete control. The first is a seabattle between two ships. This is pretty darn masterful, because the Pixar/WETA camera philosophy has been used in an ironic, comic way in the later 'Pirates of the Caribbean' episodes. You can see the anti-irony here where the battle is truly between the inventors and masters of the treasured technique, and the Disney (and now Pixar itself) thieves. I was ecstatic.The second is a chase scene through a Morrocan village which was a pure advance over anything that has come before. Here there is no irony, though movie buffs will find a great many references to other chase scenes as reimagined by better camera perspectives. Two I will tell you to look for are the reference to the Geena Davis stagecoach chase in 'Cutthroat Island' and the little girl parkour chase in the recent 'Columbiana.'See this in 3D.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,4,6,10 January 2012
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," The Best Beatles Movie
","The question is not whether this film is good, but why it was so phenomenally popular, and is remembered so fondly. Unless you were there, it is hard to understand the context. This is a Beatles movie in Bonnie and Clyde clothes. Check out the John and Paul caracatures, complete with Sgt Pepper moustache. The photography is ripped out of Warren Beatty's mind, and casually surrealistic. The musical scenes, especially the bike scene, are inspired by the Hard Days' Night school.A distance from reality is established in every detail: the overexposed photography often lapsing into sepia, the anachronistic dialog, the `look at me relax' approach to acting, and the abstract, supernatural posse composed of legends who are not supposed to come here. Someone was able to put his finger on how to package a revolution for consumption. This commercialization is of course why the greater promise of that revolution never appeared. This film made Robert Redford famous, a generous soul and minor talent, and it is easy to see why he would be proud. But Paul Newman knew better even then, and I suppose he regrets having participated. No matter, he has real legacies.When I reviewed it last week, the Beatle connection was immediately obvious. And I was struck by the Katherine Ross character. In 1969, how we wished Yoko had been like that.",Null,13,26,4 November 2000
Moana," Disney within Disney
","I was expecting a standard, manufactured Disney Princess item. What I encountered was a powerful embodiment of myth in a young woman, with the notable exceptions of the coconut pirate and glittery crab sequences. These were conceived and directed by others. I suppose many commenters will speak to the different appealing techniques used here. I'll just speak to the visual narrative nesting because I've been tracking this from Lassiter's early work.The simplest example of this nesting is when two-d hand drawn animation is embedded in the three-d world. I believe that over time, a law of proportional abstraction has developed. When this works, we may see a film that has an inner film of some kind that is more abstract. The cinematic effect is to set the 'distance' between us and the main film. That is, we have a sort of quantum imagination where the simplifications we negotiate with a filmmaker are recorded in what he/she shows us as simplifications the movie's characters make with inner 'films. Showing us those inner films is a part of the filmmaker-viewer agreement. We do have that here with the depiction of Te Fiti and especially Te Ka, with the visions Moana has, rendered in decades old conventions. But something new is here: the story starts with literal story panels in animated tapa cloths that tell the outer story about the gods, demigod and the natural laws we will live in. That inner story is rendered in lovely, textured three-d using the now standard conventions of super-reality to register as real. But inside THAT story is the same two-d conventions in the demigod's living tattoos. While the 3-d flow moves through the future, the two-d panels not only remind us of the past and the world's dynamics but directly interact with the characters.The refreshing novelty here is that the tattoo/tapas cloth effect is used for the reverse purpose. The common distance is maintained, but in this case there are not three layers (our world, the movie, the movie within) but two: our world as the same as Moana's and the 'movie' world as the myth, the tattoo and mystical/god world. I think this is why the movie, the main movie with her life played out in it, seemed so close to me emotionally. Masters of cinematic engineering. See this: 3 of three.",Null,10,21,12 January 2017
Ocean's Twelve," Shifting Realities
","Spoilers herein.I'll go to see any Soderbergh film, but in the past I'd have to be prepared for them to be either one of his 'serious' or 'cash in' projects. Cashing in is okay, but I think his serious experiments say a lot about his intuitions and intents. They aren't the most intelligent experiments, but possibly the cream of the mainstream Hollywood director's establishment.Here we get both rolled into one. Its not as edgy or visually intelligent as 'Good Thief,' but it has some elements.First the bad: Soderbergh's notion of structure is the vignette. He'll shape a segment as if it were a skit with all else just backstory. For instance he has here a terrific piece where Pitt and Clooney as veterans and Damon as novice go to visit a Dutch heist coordinator. They converse in a highly abstract and idiosyncratic parablese which amuses us and flummoxes Damon. Damon inadvertently calls the boss's young niece a slut, and we are never sure who is putting on whom.It is a wonderful orchestration of clever writing, spontaneous acting and intimate camera-work. These last two are a particular concern of Soderbergh's, but with a well-written shape it both confused and clarified in different directions. This one segment is the soul of the whole project: it amuses, it has a lot of collaborative, seemingly ad hoc acting, and it makes no sense.This was never a heist film, instead it is in the con genre. That genre derives from the detective story where the writer is trying to fool the viewer (and some characters). In the con, some characters try to fool some other characters and the writer selectively covers and uncovers narrative so that the viewer is fooled as well.Interesting twists happen when the viewer is fooled differently than the sucker character, or when there are multiple and parallel cons. The narrative folding comes in the parallel, warring realities that the viewer must surf. But always there is a resolution of the 'real' narrative, just as in the detective story. You always find out who is the fooler and who the foolee (including ourselves).And as with the detective story, we are told just _how_ it is done. We expect this and have to be given some special reward if this doesn't happen.It doesn't happen here. There is no way to go back and put together a story that makes any sense at all. Surely this could have been done, but the plain fact is that Soderbergh doesn't care and he wants us to know he doesn't.Instead, he wants us to focus on his folding. He folds all his 'serious' films: movies about movies (more than four levels deep in 'Full Frontal') or about imagined reality. 'Limey' overlaid scattered intent with parallel jumpcuts.In this case, he has Julia acting a character who pretends to be Julia. In an homage to 'The Player' he has Bruce Willis as her companion when Julia com Julia. You can just imagine him cackling with his players over this bit.But it is all clever bits like this in the small: nothing clever at the scale of a real movie. For that, we'll have to wait until he stumbles away from his enchantment with the miracle of acting and discovers the miracle of long form writing.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,42,85,10 December 2004
Crash," Off to the Side
","Its an exciting time to be alive because basic notions of narrative are being reinvented. Movies are where it is happening.Now imagine that you are a writer and you want to do something honest, because honest is affecting and you want to resonate. Suppose you suspect yourself of simple, superficial effects, like that offensive 'Million Dollar Baby' affair. Suppose you have some money and you really want to escape the feeling that you don't matter. You'll make your own 'important' movie.There's a challenge. Essentially no movie today can be honest and direct in the sense of being without modern reflection and what folks (inadequately) call irony. You just cannot escape it, no matter how emotionally pure and connected you wish to be. So the first challenge is to structure the thing so that these elements are shunted off to areas where people won't notice. This fellow knows enough about his craft to do so, and the results are interesting.Contrast this with one of Altman's multithreaded projects. Or 'Magnolia.' The way they work is that they assume the world flows independently of what we see. The camera jumps from node to node, discovering enough about what is happening for us to make a story out of it. But that story is ours, synthesized in the eye. This here is different. Everything we see are stories but they are complete stories. We see the beginning and end of each. We know that each isn't a part of a great river but is contained in discrete packages for us. The stories take the place of the world and come from the film to us. We have no say in making them.Now this, I think is by design. All the modernity, the self-reflective and ironic character we need is shunted off into this cosmological corner, into place where most viewers never look. That allows the stories, and more importantly the actors, the freedom to just work at connecting. Not a complex connection where we get context about the channel, but direct, emotional contact. That's because this whole project is based not on making sense, giving us cleverness, or even mattering in our lives. Its all about connection, contact, soft crash. Its an engineered risk, because it confounds itself in unexpected ways. The first is that it underscores that matters of race in the US are matters of inherited story. Those templates come to us in life much like the stories in the movie come: whole, encapsulated, apparently immutable. Inescapable. But at the same time, since the boundaries are so solid, the role of will and change and redemption are so remote, all we can do is take it as it comes. So it connects while it comes and is lost after it goes.I think this writer, Haggis, might actually be able to do something that matters, that folks will count in the future as something forward and not backward. He sure understands the machinery. There's even a mechanical fold about mechanical folding. The most intense story is about a black man and his not-so-black wife. He's a maker of films (actually TeeVee, following Ted's law of layered abstraction). The things he makes are race stories, and his constraints mirror those that Haggis has. You can see Haggis diagramming this.All in all, the connection didn't work with me. Its too contrived to be real. To judge from the way it is celebrated, most viewers will disagree because to them the mechanics aren't noticed as intended. I may have ruined this for you, which is why I put the spoiler tag on the beginning.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,8,13,29 August 2007
Snatch," Style, But to What End?
","Spoilers herein.This kind of film superficially resembles what I really yearn for: heavy cinematic qualities in the filmmaking. I look for a harmony of vision among how the camera is managed, the edits are composed, the music punctuates the image. Snatch has this, and sustains a pace almost frenetically conducted. I was really impressed with the effectiveness of style that was pulled off here.But the reason I yearn for this is because of the power that can result when these cinematic skills are put to the service of climbing into one's mind. Few things are as powerful at the social level than such films. The written word goes deeper, but film is more visceral. So I have to ask in the service of what art was all this Snatch motion created? And I think in this case, the flash alone was intended to be the only justification.
That's not good enough for me. This film is an interesting empty vessel. In contrast, the first Mr Madonna isn't afraid of life. We're better off with him. Less style, but more substance, the stuff our brains and nerves eat.Kudos though to Brad Pitt. Even though this film is a waste for him, he is on a laudable journey to plumb many non-mainstream niches, while eluding the fate of Julia.

Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Facets of Perception
","Spoilers herein.Different things characterize a Kubrick film: cold style, a languorous deep camera, intellectual humor. But for me, all of these pale compared his primary concern: investigating who the narrator is.He hated `Sparticus' and struck out to do intelligent work. His collaboration with Brando failed, so he bought `Lolita,' the most adventurous narrative literary experiment til then. It featured a narrator who is obsessed, possibly mad and surely not to be trusted. Kubric (rather radically) translated that layered presentation into the POV of Quimby, who assumes multiple characters, either driving or populating Humbert's worlds.He would later hit paydirt in `2001' with the idea of three battling narrators (human, machine, alien) for control over what we see. And later with `Orange' about a film that indocrinates itself through film.Along the way, he tried this: four narratives all provided by Sellers. The idea was that each man imposed or reported his own reality and you really wouldn't know which to trust. Our man Peter broke his leg though and the whole thing shifted, but it was changing character throughout based on other accidents as well. Yes, I know there is a story, but it really doesn't matter. In fact it matters so little it changed every day, and so did the tone of the film.Scott turned out to be comically stronger than guessed. The president morphed into someone less fey, the pie scene (which was to be a Marx Brothers tipoff) failed. So I see this as minor Kubrick, a failure of what he intended. It is a great Sellers film for the Von Braun/Ed Teller bit, and for that it is appreciated. But if you want to see a master succeeding at something only he seems to be able to do, you'll need to look elsewhere.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,11,24,24 October 2003
The Beach," Exotic Adventures
","For me, when a film fails to engage me by itself, I jump up a level, in this case making it a chapter in the movie of the life of Danny Boyle. I like the guy. I like his instincts. He envisions worlds that resemble reality but which can only exist in cinema, and then he allows the world to emerge in cinematic constructions as if it were its own character.This is an enticing way to invite us into a film, because it comes to us one with the means by which it comes to us. But this film failed, even by his measure. I think one reason is the heavy-handed control the producers asserted. Key elements of the cast, story and art design were beyond his control.But still, you can see some missteps, and they become more obvious when you see how Boyle handled similar challenges in subsequent movies.The exotic here simply does not impress as exotic. He fixed that in 'Slumdog.' There is the dramatic device of encounter with merciless nature as purifying. This is a questionable dynamic for a viewer to accept because accommodating it for living is expensive. Nonetheless, Boyle mastered this in 'Hours.' And then there is the more interesting and powerful notion of the 'inner movie' as it folds into the larger events. In this film, we have the idea of computer games. The writer makes an awkward conflation of desktop computers and hand-held gaming, and also email with gaming. But long before that, there are difficulties. The inner game Richard experiences when in his heart of darkness does not comply with what I will call Ted's law: that the difference between the viewer's comfortable world and the normal world of the film (here the community on the beach) should be the same as the difference between that world and the hallucinated one.Boyle solved this amazingly effectively with his 'Sunshine,' which very much impressed me in this regard. But there is an inner hallucination in 'Hours' that works and the more contrived TeeVee show in 'Slumdog' that works as well. Both adjust to this rule, which seems to be a hard limit on our ability to comprehend narrative.So I see this, not so much as Richard's story, but the story of Danny's disastrous encounter, and what he learned.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",Null,3,7,27 June 2011
Fast & Furious 6," Precision Convoy
","I really have to give the producers credit for how they have tuned this franchise. At some point, the formula will have to outlive Diesel like Bond had to survive after Connery. The fans won't abandon the series but as with Bond, the constraints will get ever tighter. In the meanwhile, this is still evolving, getting more pure. What I see is that the target audience for this is not 13 year old boys, but men who incubate a nostalgia for when they were 13. That bends everything.The car chases, for example, are not designed for cinematic excitement as if we were in the cars. They are designed to mimic the way boys play with cars; heavy with crashing and public mayhem. It is why every situation is abstracted into a contest between car armies.I believe this is why we don't have that business about Fathers and remote sons working out issues. We see that in almost every kid-targeted movie. Instead, we have a similarly reduced value: loyalty to family, regardless of cost. Any cost.Here, the supposedly lost family member doesn't want to be rescued, in fact fights it. This reduction ends up giving us some very strange plot necessities: the girl friend who sends her man away for family is odd enough. But the new mother (the only real family in that world) who is willingly left alone, unprotected, was really something.It is also why the women here are so unlike what we expect in a teen oriented movie. These aren't the buxom, seductresses of teen fantasy. They are stereotypes that a middle aged guy will have grown.  The woman in the family who turns out to have been cheating all along.  The woman who needs to be rescued in spite of herself because of stubborn stupidity.  The sexy beauty who will leave when you want. The compliant wife.We do have some wiggling butts when a street race is starting, but that's presented more as just part of the brand, as incidental as lacquer is to racing. Sex in this film has less to do with genitals than trust and shared adventure. You have to have been in a relationship for years for that to register, and be well past testosterone mania. Men control the machine, not the other way.More nostalgic value is in the 'dirty dozen' gathering. We have teams now in many action films, but here there is an emphasis on the outlaw nature of the individuals. The dirty dozen trope goes as far as the phone calls after which everyone immediately gathers.The stunts are tiring. The way the justifying story develops is proudly weak. But I find the engineering of the thing to be engaging as getout. It invents a new market for cinematic color.",Null,4,8,12 May 2015
The Expendables," Sliding Planes
","'Speedracer' and the 'Transformer' movies, even the second 'Charlie's Angels.'These are silly or even bad films by the conventional measures. This is too. It is vapid, misogynistic and fundamentalist. I wouldn't recommend that anyone go unless they know themselves well enough.But like those other movies, there is a lot of cutting edge filmmaking craft in this and I enjoyed it for that reason alone. I think there must be some separation from Sly the image and Sly the filmmaker. I surely — for example — admire the effectiveness of cable TeeVee demagogues at the same time I find the effect vile.There are three notable things. There is a neo-Kurosawan notion of planes, even in the fight scenes. Here is a sophisticated example: The film starts with Sly checking out the mission and deciding to not follow through, abandoning a woman to rape and torture (torture by the way by waterboarding). As in all his combat movies there is a scene where he pensively encounters his conscience and decides to do the right thing, turning into a killing machine for justice. The setup has Micky Roarke in the close foreground giving a story about how he is cursed by not having saved the life of a woman. (What he is doing while giving the speech is cool. The speech itself is pure formula, but the fact that he is painting flowers on an old guitar for a woman who has left him is sweet. He plans to smash the guitar when finished.)During the scene, Sly is in the background out of focus. This is not the way Akira would do it: he would and back and use a telephoto so both would be in focus. Welles talked about compositing two shots with multiple focal points. But here Sly is blurry; he is further away than he would be in reality. We shift to a closeup of Sly as he meets himself and comes to his decision. It is a closeup. His face fills the screen, but he is still out of focus. What they did was crop the shot to zoom in. It takes a craftsman to even think of this and the cinematic effect it gives. And how it mitigates the worst part of any Stallone movie, that turning point, because he just cannot act. So the camera does it for him by setting planes.Throughout, we have muted colors, lots of shadows that swallow the scene with piercing lights. This not only makes the thing Eastwood-moody, it allows for strobes and shadows to animate the battle scenes. They are done well if you can allow for the macho silliness and magical powers.And for every key sequence of scenes, we have a sliding three dimensional camera. Christopher Doyle has changed the world of the eye, bless him. There is a seaplane that glides and swoops like seaplanes do. The camera emulates these movements after showing them to us, and continues throughout much of the movie.Bruce and Arnie make fools of themselves.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",Null,13,30,19 August 2010

You couldn't get what was being made fun of unless you were just the kind of dope who both went to the original movie being made fun of AND you thought the spoof joke was funny. This was pretty clever stuff, right on the edge of spitting in your eye and expecting you to laugh. But we did.The sequel bears the same relation to the original that the Blair Witch sequel did. The original BWP was an intelligent reference to the state of film. The sequel referenced not the same state that the original did, instead it referenced the phenomenon of the first film.And so it is here. This sequel doesn't make fun of the audience directly as before, but indirectly by reference to the first. Not every kid will be able to follow this. But I'm impressed by those that can.Your tipoff is James Woods, and the reference to `Shadow of the Vampire.'",Null,8,19,16 January 2002

","I get annoyed at movies that preach one thing and are themselves another.The story here has two components, a real and fantasy thread. The real world thread is simple. By that I mean there are no dramatic complications at all. The characters are theatrical cartoons. The situation starts out brutally and stays that way without any arc, development, evolution. It is in fact a formula movie, this thread, and one that follows a formula that is based on strict, strict boundaries. One would suspect it was written by a German, it is so regimented. One would almost believe it to be written by 'The Captain,' the bad guy here.It marches. Its unambiguous. Its final and brutal in its morality, just as the Captian is. There are only good and bad people and the bad are not only very, very bad but they get their deserts. Justice isn't nuanced here. In fact nothing at all is.I suppose people celebrate it for its fantasy thread. Yes, the effects are good. Yes the creepy eyeless man was creepy. Yes the Tinkerbells were Tinkerbelly. But is this in any way better than 'Dark Crystal,' which was similarly banal in its cosmology?Look, I'm one of the ones who get depressed at things like 'The Matrix,' but if lacking in imagination, is copying was deep, complex, manylayered. This is something that Franco would have written, and little fascist parents would have trotted to, because its all about absolutes and the inability of humans to be rich, subtle, varied beings.The best we can do, is be 'innocent.'I often can see some good in any film. But not this one. The world is too close to intolerant extremism as it is.

Knocked Up," Accepts Itself
","Even the lowest brow films reward if you allow yourself to watch the machinery of the thing as well as the thing itself. The narrative itself is unrewarding. The humor is weak, the romance ineffective. But what the thing actually is charms.A standard romance has the wonderful girl, the clumsy guy who gets the girl, loses the girl by some complication, and then gets her back, usually involving some public, folded activity. These things are billed as date movies and have highly evolved values for both men and women.The woman's stuff is usually handled by making the guy solidly desirable at root, and supplementing that with some truth about the internals of a woman's life. But the formula is so worn out that studios put heavy attention into innovations that tap the same energy and use the same bankable conventions, but in new ways.So here we have a new twist on the woman's angle. Oh, it has something for the guys, who apparently can be appeased by a few jokes about how doofy we are. The fact that so little will carry us while other complicated narrative dynamics are spun, says more about how doofy we are than the truth of any joke.Those complicated dynamics have to do with the girl-to-girl conversation about the world they have to tolerate. By that I mean the wall of incompetence they face in emotional support. So this is a romance with a loser but its okay because all men are losers.Interestingly, it works. It works better than I would have expected, and that's trying to see it from both sides.Its a clever experiment perhaps two steps closer to defusing the fantasy of the genre is a self-critical fashion.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",Null,6,13,7 April 2008
Alien," Different Worlds
","Different WorldsSpoilers herein.I've just rewatched `Alien,' `Aliens' and `Alien Resurrection.' Considered simply as films, each is a fine film but they come from worlds that are more different from each other than the normative world of now is to the world of any of them. Just viewing them is a course in filmmaking.Ridley Scott's `Alien' is the most impressive, knowing that it was only his second film, that every effect is physical, and that the budget was so low the spacecraft is cobbled together from used aircraft parts. Even at this early point, Scott has the ability to create a unique look and has the mastery of craft to coordinate every element (acting, score, movement) to reinforce that look. That he chose Giger to base the look on was brilliant. Organic darkness -- evil embodied in living things. The alien ship, though only briefly shown, is a sequence that will live way past the time that the monsters of the series are forgotten; that blending of beast, environment and narrative is unique in all filmdom. Really amazing that the sequels didn't go back to that ship. Scott has grown to be one of our best and most original filmmakers -- Alien and `Blade Runner' (with `Forbidden Planet') are the very best `real' scifi films we have, meaning films that are not just adventure films.Where `Alien' is scifi in the service of horror, `Aliens' is scifi in the service of action. Aliens is a war film, and equally impressive as one of Cameron's earliest. Movement and conflict. More emphasis on the familiar is necessary for this approach, so we see the sets and costumes less adventuresome. This is a thrill which uses the trappings of scifi only as another thing with which to impress. The mood created is projected not into the image as with Scott, but into the theater as something to amaze. Cameron hasn't evolved at all from this film, only been given ever bigger effects with which to amaze. So one might consider this his most `genuine' film.`Resurrection' seems to not be as admired by the fan base. But I think it every bit the equal of the other two. In this case, we also have a new director, a European with two fantasy tales under his belt. But those set a tone that is strikingly weird: the tone not in the setting, but in the psychological space in the story. And that's what we have here. In Cameron's film, every character is a stereotype. Here, every character is an anti-stereotype: the black guy isn't jive; the cripple is the toughest; the sex kitten is a robot... even the hero isn't really. This is also the most cinematic use of the camera, using the psychological eye. Scott dwells, Cameron moves, Jeunet examines. He doesn't mind annotating the past films (rather like Van Sant's `Psycho' annotates Hitchcock's).The only negative thing I note in the sequels is that Weaver isn't adaptable enough to understand and get behind these diverse visions. She understands Scott. Cameron doesn't really care, but she is outclassed by Jeunet.Seeing any one of these enhances the appreciation for the other two.",Null,10,20,27 June 2001
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Shaved Fish
","I guess I am glad that Tim Burton is alive and making films if only to keep Depp working and encourage him to take chances. I think it is even worth a ticket from time to time to watch the old boy do something weird that isn't intended as a joke. But Burton's work as a whole seems to be in a rut. He knows how to appear to take chances without actually doing so. This time, we have large singing instead of small. Operatic blood instead of human-sized. Long shots instead of simple frames.I may skip the next couple. Email me to tell me if Depp gets interesting again. For me, all the cinematic effects, though large, are tired and ordinary. All the songs big empty balloons. What fascinates me is the love story between Burton and one of the most interesting women in film: Helena. She's earned a place in my imagination just on 'Wings' and 'Fight,' possibly 'Novocaine.' She matters as a template now and probably will for generations.Its why it is so interesting the way we have her now: written in, made up and photographed by a man who plainly loves her as deeply as he knows  and shares that with us because the deepest he knows is how to make her real on screen. Its not just a love story we peer into, its one we participate in.

Nacho Libre," Frisson of Performance
","I guess the most important element of a comment should come first and be concise: I found this funny, really funny until the end where the necessities of resolving the story begin to grind.There's something about comedy. For me, I like to laugh. And after I do, I like to think about why. Nothing tells you more about a person  even yourself  than knowing what you think is funny. And sometimes that is funny in its own right Black's brand of humor is common enough: be ridiculous by extending common poses in extreme directions without losing the reference to the original. And to do it physically, with those same poses.Hess's brand of humor is something different: to invert exaggeration, and thus exaggerate the straight man role. His 'Napoleon Dynamite' is a sort of Stan Laurel to the whole world.Black's stuff doesn't have enough gas under normal circumstances to do more than provide color to a real movie. That rock school thing was ugly, embarrassing because its attempt at the humor of embarrassment failed. But this finds a sort of sweet spot. I think it is because this Hess guy plays so cleverly with what it means to be a movie.Professional wrestling is one of North America's more overtly ridiculous performance arts and the main fold here is goofing on that strutting sort of presentation. This also folds into religious ritual which is about as popular in the US, though without the macho overtones from Latin societies.Where it falls out of that sweet spot is when our wrestler actually has to fight in the last two matches. That's when things tilt; the humor becomes subservient to the story instead of the other way around.Story is always what kills these things. If this were a TeeVee skit that repeated for 10 minutes every Saturday night, we wouldn't expect a story. But for 30 bucks or so, we do. So we are obliged, but it surely gets in the way, except to remind us that what we see is as manufactured in presentation as those goofy wrestlers.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",Null,3,7,15 October 2006
The Best Years of Our Lives," Slow Meditation on Observation
","Spoilers herein.This treacly story hides some masterful filmmaking.Film is all about observation, except the observed usually contrive to make the observer feel unobtrusive.During this period, intelligent filmmakers were playing with the form so that often films were not only engineered observations but the matter of the movie itself was about observation.In this case, we have two acts. The first act introduces our three returning guys: one each Air Corps, Army and Navy; one each enlisted, non-com and officer; and -- so far as the conventions would allow -- from three different social strata. The central scene in this act is them observing the world (and particularly the everycity Boone City) from the nose of a B-17. It is then mirrored by the observations from the cab.Then we enter the film proper which is about three women as observers of these men. We observe a story about three women observing their stories. As the men are equally spaced, so are the observers. Each woman is a different type of observer:We have the quietly engaged observer (Milly), who appears to simply sit by, but who actually influences the action; the passive observer (Peggy) who forces the action to come to her as most movies do. That final scene where Fred watches her watching and them goes over is classic. And we have the Orson Welles type (Wilma) who actively engages in the action, driving the story and literally becoming its hands.I'm usually not a William Wyler fan. His 'Dodsworth' was a real trial. He had worked with Gregg Toland a half dozen times before, but here is the first collaboration since 'Citizen Kane.' Toland by this time knew how to manage narrative within the staging. There's a really fine scene for instance where The wonderful Butch and Homer (catch the name) are playing piano. Al is in the foreground and splits his time glancing back at Fred on the phone. This particular scene was the template for the opening of 'The Color of Money' where Paul Newman is well into a complicated sell job with a barmaid but listens to Tom Cruise cracking balls behind him.The staging is helped by having all the sets smaller than normal so the people pop out.A side note: you might want to visit Tucson some day. There are thousands upon thousands of obsolete -- and some not -- warplanes parked out there in the desert.

Closer," 4-Braided
","I prefer when a movie is a movie. But when a movie is a very good play, we should be happy as well because there just aren't that many good things around.This is a play, there's no mistaking. All the dynamics in it are seated in the words, all the motives in the four beings. There is no cinematic device used or necessary, except the revealing of the passport at the end, and I am sure that was handled differently in the stage version.Mike Nichols makes a living out of taking constructions that work well on the stage and adding a few cinematic glosses so that the thing gives the impression it was born as a screen being. I find his tricks in this regard distracting, even a bit offensive because he hasn't adapted as the visual vocabulary has. Never mind. Just eliminate the film components of its being and focus on the stage components and you still have something worthwhile, because here Nichols is still fresh.You can read other folks to learn the story. It hardly matters. What matters to me is the clever, deep way the writer has constructed the thing. The visceral effect is from the panic and desperation of love. Nothing new there. What makes this effective, I think, are two things. Writerly things.The first is that he hasn't just described the tippy balance of living in a romance. He hasn't just displayed the radical fuzziness and unpredictability of a world where that is all you know. He's made it the root of the story. This story has absolutely none of the logic to it that you expect when you see a love story. Everything seems real and natural after it has happened, but there's no way at all to predict what will happen next when you are in the thing. Its a great help in storytelling; you have to cling fast to what is happening. Its the best type of engagement, sucking you in by simply making you wonder, even worry about what is going to happen next. Its rare. Its good.I'd like to point out how the four characters are constructed. A popular writing technique is to take one whole soul and break it into bits. Then the bits can get fleshed out imperfectly and interact so that the interaction has a being. In this case, start with a movie. What four pieces do you need? The writer (Dan), the photographer (Anna), the actor (Alice) and the director, the person concerned with the 'skin' of the thing.Its no accident, I think that it is impossible to settle on any one of these characters. You can go through this experience time and time again, each time tracing a different person's path, or the path of a relationship or even an urge.This part is great too. Apart from Nichols' cinematic naivety, there's only one blot: Julia Roberts. She just doesn't understand what it means to be part of an assembly. She's not an actress in the real sense, the theatrical sense that Nichols knows how to sculpt. No wonder he wanted Cate Blanchett instead.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,15,22,15 January 2007

I think that a mistake, and would like to recommend to viewers that they put two others higher on their lists -- one very early and one very late.`October' is highly experimental. Extreme even. In it, Eisenstein tried everything and with committed youthful passion. Not everything works. Not everything was carried over into future work. But the film has soul compared to mere competence. It lives rather than just points to life.`Ivan Part 1' is much later. Apparently by this time, Eisenstein has abandoned the montage and (because beaten all his life) has adopted the relaxed, `normal' style. But this is not so. It has instead been so completely absorbed it is invisible, But it is there with shocking mastery. If you are interested in film and editing.

Taxi Driver," Traffic
","Spoilers herein.Readers of my other comments know that I believe that there are different types of films, depending on whether the skeleton is the writer's, the actor's, or the camera's. The more I use it, the more confidence I have that in general, one drives out the other. Just before reseeing this, I worked on `One-Eyed Jacks,' which is probably the touchstone of the actor driving out the eye.But here, we have a happy accident of three talents that don't step on each other: DeNiro, Schrader and Scorsese. Of these, Schrader is the strongest and every deviation from his vision weakens the fabric. The one main example is Keitel's dance with Jodie.The key device here is that the narrator is Bickle. Everything is/must be something he personally witnesses (until his death) and reports to us. The idea is far from novel. Why it works here is Scorsese's intuition to play the camera OFF of Bickle, while De Niro works to keep the attention on him. That tension (which Schrader intended) is what makes this work.But this is not perfect. Keitel, like De Niro doesn't get this dynamic; we don't want De Niro to, that would ruin the main device because we want him to pull to himself against the camera. But when Keitel does his stuff, it has a negative effect because there is no narrative countermeasure..Foster's presence was good enough when this film was new because the very idea of a 12 year old whore was enough. But seeing it a quarter century later, you can see her thinness compared to the rest of the cast. They really understand their characters and crawl into them. She has no idea, none at all.Another problem is the cab metaphor. Paul didn't quite center that one. He did get it right later with the ambulance in `Bringing Out the Dead,' which used the same energy of selfish actor pulling one way and camera pulling another way. But that time, they fought over the vehicle at the same time they fought in your mind. And of course that had De Palma's eye.Finally, the camera we see here has energy, but far less than what Scorsese's buddy De Palma was doing at this time. Imagine what De Palma (or Hitchcock) would have done with that angel shot after the massacre.",Null,14,24,22 December 2001
Shutter Island," Situation Theory
","Scorcese is an accomplished cinematic mind. There is no question of this. When he dies, we will celebrate the loss of a talent.But his life has been compromised by limits in the depth of his religion of cinema. This has haunted him, and he will not be happy to die until he conquers this.The problem is simple. I'll call it the curse of the character, and link it to Dante, or even Homer. That it dominates much written narrative is purely an accident of war. This is the idea that humans exist as complete, each one of us carrying a universe within us that some of us are able to project and carry around us.If we build stories, then, the stories are about the nature of the worlds attached to characters. The characters can actually be tragic, manipulated by their own world forces, or even uninteresting. But no matter how you slice it, the narrative follows people and the containing world is an annotation, an effect. I believe this is 'Italian' in film-making and Scorcese was captured by it. Unfortunately for him, the cult of the actor in Hollywood (and associated market forces that support critics) feeds this. So he adopted deNiro and made films that were at least competent. But the camera could only follow bodies.But all the real juice in cinema is in this idea of noir. It has penetrated everywhere to some extent because it matters. The religious cosmology of noir has a world that exists apart from any humans. It pre-exists, has its own laws and dynamics. Being external to the souls of humans who appear, it blows them around and tinkers with those souls.It has the advantage that the film's narrative can entangle the existence of the world with the viewers and their needs. It brings the film to the viewers in a sort of contract, a dialog that cannot be refused. It also allows the camera to exist in a world apart from the characters. Thus, the filmmaker can inform us of the situation. Space matters. Texture, color, light all have their own lives.Scorcese has been bothered by the fact that his films did not do this; could not. Here he was with the craft, the skills, but not the vision. So in one of the most intriguing inner stories in Hollywood, he attempts to escape his own limits.He shifts from deNiro-like actors to deCaprio style. He tries, really hard to discover. His 'Gangs' was a noble attempt, but a failure because of problems with funders. 'Aviator' was his first noir success, helped by the influence of Cate (playing Kate). Check out the story, which mirrors Marty's plight. Marvel in that cool scene where the room is filled with strings.The rat movie was a retreat. And now this. It is a pure victory, an personal achievement. Some of us have been rooting for the man in his encounter with himself and are doubly rewarded with this film.There are elements in the story that reflect this quest of the filmmaker. I wouldn't want to focus on them too much here, because the reader may think that the story itself matters more than it should. But see the references to Spielberg's similar quest with 'Close' and 'List?' See the imposition of the noir narrator and the notion of slippery trust? See the folds in the anagrams? Look how at the end, we have shifted truths but the ambiguity remains. He could indeed still be the investigating cop, now compromised. In fact, this could be a flashback to the episode we learn happened nine months previously. (Note in particular how the tie changes toward the end.)Those story elements would have made a good comment. I'll do that elsewhere. Here the point is to look at how Marty has a new eye. Look at how the camera is almost never anchored to a person. Look at how it always — always — starts with some focus on an element of the world then slips to catch a person (always Teddy, then his focus). Look at how well we understand the importance of location, architecture, place, space, situation. Look at how for the first time ever, Marty shows space: flying paper, ash, dust, hail, leaves, trees. Look at how he even explores the architecture of water a bit. Watch with admiration as he announces his love for Thelma (his editor), and allows her some rubato in how the thing is paced because she owns the clock of the world, now hers.My immediate context: I saw this in a theater with a pride of chattering young Marines.

Capote," Florid Wrappers
","I hold certain films to a higher standard than others. 'Fight Club' could have been important instead of merely threatening so. We have others that spin up wheels of competence in representing life but seem to lack any understanding of life itself.So I am profoundly disappointed by this.Yes, it has a good actor exercising the opportunity to be the center of a world that we see only through his eyes. I've followed him from 'Twister,' where he made that story all about himself by his quiet control from the corner.And the thing does work in the way we obsess about celebrities, and revel in their quirks but only so long as we can understand those quirks and manage them in ourselves.But the thing about this is how the world is delivered by an artist, how pieces of it can be sectioned out and packaged. What we see is the wrapper only, usually. Capote was all about wrappers where other writers -- the best ones -- are about the selection and sectioning of pieces.So okay, movies are about wrappers too, because the best of them are self-aware and that self-awareness is about how they wrap life for us.Capote was a cinematic writer, the first one unless you count Hunter Thompson. He'd impose florid visions on a substrate of ordinary life and sculpt a shape on those visions that made it seem as if the underlying matter of life had that shape.He imposed style on fate, and gave us a whole new generation of possibilities for writers, mostly useless of course.This is important stuff, the stuff of which you could make a great movie, especially if you have a team who understands. And Hoffman surely does understand this. Even in his most undisciplined moments like 'Love Liza' he built a layer of wrapping and simultaneously pierced it. Its what I call folded acting, giving us two layers.Now look at this movie. It is all wrapper, all style. It is a romance in the sense that you can slickly move your mind over the lubricated latex skin of the thing and never touch anything real. No nerves, muscle, juice.There's the wrapper of the killer's world. Of the book Capote wrapped around that. Of the persona Capote wrapped around it in his fabricated person. Of the book Gerald Clarke wrapped around all of that. At each layer, these artists gave us means to touch the reality within. Now we come to the fifth wrapper, the one of the movie.And it seals off all the reality. Was the hanging supposed to be that piercing? The snubbing of 'Mockingbird?' The withdrawal from prison visits? Can any defender of this film claim so? Ask yourself what effect it had on you when Capote withdrew to Spain? Was it any different to you than when he withdrew to Manhattan? It was in all the other wrappers, because it withdrew the needles.No needles here folks.

Life of Pi," 30 Million Sephiroth
","How is it that Scorsese can get 3D so wrong and someone like Ang Lee get it so right?Sure, there is some dimensional silliness — a hummingbird in the first few moments... a message thrown into the water that lands in our laps — but the general philosophy here is to use the technology to define *space*. Usually, we are given an array of objects, but here the goal is space itself.I have been seeing very few movies recently, but I think so far as the handling of space, this film is important — a real advance over what went before. Compare for instance the handling of the water in the shipwreck to that of 'Titantic' or 'Perfect Storm' or 'White Squall.' The water here is architectural, dynamic but conceived as a whole. When I've noted previous advances in the cinema of space, they have been less in the architecture and more in the introduction of height, the position of the virtual camera and the emotions evoked by how that camera moves.Following the ideas of the book about the folding of experience, story-telling and religious ecstasy, we have visual metaphoric blending of underwater, various effects on the surface of water, stars, storms and modes of fluorescence in each of these. The notion is that the story with the tiger is likely fiction, and that the 'real' story was not 'as good.' We have strong hints that this is so in the written dialog, so the cinematic notion of merging dynamics below the sea with action above the sea makes sense. This begins early in the story with a shot of the famed swimming pool after which our hero is named. Late in the shot we realize the camera is underwater. Soon, the water becomes sky.But because we have shared what came before with our own eyes, we can't unknow it. It becomes folded reality.Another example: early we see a Hindu ceremony with thousands of candles floating on water. The father-voice-of-reason says 'do not be fooled by the lights.' Shortly thereafter we have the lights on the ship moving underwater and presumably triggering the untrusted narration. These lights were previously on the surface, and it seemed to me that the same visual cues were present in these — and later — lights as those we saw in the ceremony.This sort of visual coherence is only possible now where essentially every background is a synthesized one. When you create the world, you can create it your way.So the larger framing has an underwater with the ship named after the kabbalistic (recent kabbalah, not genuine historical kabbalah) notion of truth coalescing around the most attractive story. That ship is lit — again a kabbalistic reference, and the lights morph to totems: animals, symbols and memories. The sprites used in the software to model the flow of particles under the sea is used to model the turbulence on the surface and sky. Further, an associated notion is that everything must be considered as a whole situated assembly; in story terms that is the truth of coherence; in cinematic terms it is the focus on the coherence of space.Lee has always done something like this, even in his student films about dinner tables. In 'Crouching Tiger' the fight choreography was calligraphic and was shown that way, so this was expected. But it IS an advance in the vocabulary and should be seen if only for the cinematic thrill of being present when our imagination advances a step. Note especially how the final shot does a reverse rack where the background moves closer after his feline self has 'left him.'But it fails as a compelling narrative for me. The kid in the boat seemed too Mowgli Disney perfect and not sufficiently broken to be believable. Though the cinematic tone is well thought out, it is presented too much as reality for me. The distance in abstraction between the framing device (the adult recounting a version of the story) and the story is too close. We might have done better to have the framing bits use a different technique, and the tiger be more supernatural.We do have *some* supernatural elements: the magical whale, the storm that seizes the written story, the fact that corpses and excrement vanish from the always sterile boat. The magical island's tooth (truth). The fact that a Japanese ship packs a survival manual in English. But these are plot points, not parts of the world. Tarsem Singh might have done better in this regard.We can assume that the 'alternative story' was shot, because you wouldn't hire Gérard Depardieu for one part of one scene. Perhaps we can see it in a recut version. Hey, if Decker can be a replicant in later versions of 'Bladerunner,' maybe Anandi can be a life-dancer, the real narrator.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,13,27,8 January 2013
Ocean's Thirteen," Sexual Editing
","Is this the most valuable franchise in film? Will it last for a decade?I like Soderbergh. I even like him when he has no goal in the world but making money through simple entertaining.I like him because he actually thinks about film. About the bullets the towels. The phrases and melodies.Superficially, this has two overt components. One is the well established con form. The strict version is that we don't fully understand what is going on and 'see' it only at the end. Then it all makes sense. This is a weaker version where we see some of the plotting and problems. This is where the jokes are.The second overt component is simply coolness. Its the sort of coolness that Apple-inspired ad editing has given us, in opposition to the heavy rap-gangster intimidation-coolness of the last great sales cycle. This is referenced within the movie with a bit about an all American black jumper (with a Jewelled flag on his teeth). Its colorful, fast. The pace is translucent with the music. Vegas Cellophane. The actors are cool. Even Matt Damon, who knows cool, plays uncool with coolness.But its the technique here that impresses. Shots have shape and how those shapes are modulated (as they usually are not) and then assembled with those shapes forming new ones, is a matter of unique style with this filmmaker. Look at how fertile soft ends are punctured by sharp beginnings so that the very passage of time in the eye here is a matter of conceptual copulation.Look at how many shots end on one of those colored artificial flavors and create a romantic movie at the atomic level as if a John Coltrane was compressing a thousand easy ballads into a few moments. This takes knowledge and the filmmaker has to actually operate the camera to pull this off. It was in his 'Limey' and not in the other Ocean's. And it takes an editor who knows. The best editor was found fresh off 'Babel' which among other variations, had the three segments vary on shotshape assembly. This matters.

Lost in Translation," Godard's Ugly Niece
","Spoilers herein.Let's see. Sofia marries goofy energy ball Spike who has an affair with Cameron. So Sofia kicks him out. What's the second level punishment? Create a story about Spike and Cameron where she is a ditz actress who just made a buttwigglin kunk fu movie, and he is a selfish nit in Tokyo on a shoot.Scarlett gets to play Sofia. Bill gets to play all the movie stars who over the years have given her wisdom, but he has to be funny in his misfitting as well. She chooses to use Spike's own manner of engineered self-referential layers.So far so good. The last time we had a public reaming of a divorced husband was Nora Ephon's `Heartburn.' But there was real talent behind that project. REAL talent.Still, she should have been able to pull it off. Her brother pulled off something similar but more ambitious in his first film, `CQ.' Daddy can pull some strings and get some heavy help in polishing the script, assembling a crew and equipment and such.I went into this with great expectations. Young vision has seldom had such advantages, and her first film seemed to be a clean mood piece.Here, it all seems to have come apart. She lost focus in the act of setting it down.She cannot decide whether she wants:-- A tone poem on distance and discovery-- A framework for comic and sweet vignettes from Murray (who may have been too powerful an actor for her tender disciple: there is an embarrassing slapstick scene on an exercise machine, for instance.) It must be death for an actor to hear that a part has been written for them, and without them, the movie will not be made. that means that the actor has become such a predictable caricature that someone can engineer slots for them.-- A device to publicly work out her own issues-- A story that becomes stronger because it skirts the predicable but then veers off into sweet `realism.'-- A film with no story, with every element of the story undermining the very notion of story, as in the notion of Godard that she says `inspired' her.Problem is, most of these contradict or destroy the others. And yet, there are bits of each of these in this film that excel when they are active, coming out of the basement and grabbing control one after the other. It is odd how easily we handle the mood shifts in this case.I think that is because we assign so much to the sweet face of a young girl lost, trying to translate all these various forces into the simple ability to walk down the street with a smile.Ted's Evaluation: 2 of 3, Has some interesting elements.",Null,37,71,18 April 2004
Tangled," Drawing Love
","Sometimes the inner narrative is clear.The outer narrative is fine enough to sell tickets to parents, thinking this is what their kids want and their kids returning the favor. You'll have to read elsewhere for how well this is done. What fascinates me is how obviously we can see what concerns the animators.This is marketed not as a film in its own right, but as the 50th Disney animation. It is easy to see it as such, as a narrative about the artists.Our heroine starts the film with her obsessive two-dimensional drawings, quite literally cartoons like the initial Disney era. In these is a depiction of an event that we discover is her dream, her wish. Following the princess formula, which Disney invented, we hear her 'wish song,' about this dream. The dream is fulfilled in 'paintery 3d' as the main story.By the end of the film, we are reminded that her memories and the projected cartoon of the entire film has been painted on the walls of her space. There is literally a moment where they start to merge. But in between we have the layer of that cartoon in the 'real world,' meaning the three dimensional world of the current animation technology. In that layer, we have the quest for the three dimensional experience: the losing of the lantern kites on an anniversary.When this came for me, I was overwhelmed. This was partially because the 'fold' worked for me; The watched cartoon was on the walls and the real world was the one I shared with the characters. Disney first did this (to my knowledge) in their dinosaur movie where the 'cartoon' was in cave paintings.The 'lights' was an extraordinarily well done adventure in framing, editing and camera angle selection. There is no Pixar influence here — this is all homegrown Disney and now that Pixar is worn out, we may see a new generation of animated cinema here.Another reason it worked for me is the simple geometry of romantic imagination. Connection is spatial, extreme spatial experience where the senses and sense are overwhelmed. The lantern scene effectively did that for me and I admire its manipulative construction. This is very much an adult movie and very overtly sexual. The source images are in a space created by a sexually manipulative woman, managing a hidden fecund valley in which an overtly phallic tower houses our future stories.So it is extremely easy for me to see this as a story about animation, folding and sex. Pure in each regard. It is not about love. It is about drawing love, and much more romantic as a result.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,7,11,30 December 2010
Barry Lyndon," Living in Space
","Spoilers herein.Kubrick is a hard filmmaker to touch. He's obviously competent, even brilliant in some ways. And a few of his films -- `Strangelove' comes to mind -- make enough sense superficially that one is not compelled to go farther. The problem is that Kubrick never gives us much hint that his films are a whole different beast than the others on the shelf at the video store. I think he relished the confusion.Most films tell a story in the old fashioned way: time moves, things happen, characters act. In these films, the story is largely apart from the storytelling. Because film is different than everything else, the means of storytelling are unique to film. And because film is still new, we have lots of room for discovering how to tell a story.So we have the vast majority of filmmakers and viewers who think of a film purely in terms of the story. But we have another group of people who watch the storytelling, and perhaps (like myself) don't demand that much from the story itself. That's why we admire empty stylists like De Palma, but of course prefer master visual storytellers like Kurosawa.The holy grail is when the narrative of the conventional threads and the cinematic ones mesh, or are coordinated in some clever way. By cinematic threads, I mean a narrative invested in the very fabric of the camera, like `Marienbad,' like `Pillow Book,' like Welles' `Othello,' or with the aid of actors like `Sweet and Lowdown,' or `Vanya on 42nd Street.' There's a sublime joy to parallel immersion in both the story and cinematic narratives.But sometimes along comes a Kubrick to confound us. I spent a lot of time with `Eyes Wide Shut' before understanding it, because I was looking for the tie with the story. But Kubrick has the equation the other way around. The primary narrative anchor is in the cinematic narrative. The story isn't a skeleton around which the filmmaking takes place, rather an annotation or an incomplete dream that results from it. Jarmusch, Malick, and Kar-wai Wong (`In the Mood for Love') have this same attitude, with minor twists.Freed from limiting expectations, I am now able to enjoy `Barry Lyndon' in more the way I think Kubrick saw it. It is not a story about a Black Irish told through pretty pictures. It is a visual tone poem on the seduction of beauty, with a dissonance between natural beauty and cosmetics. The primary story is visual. It needs space. It needs time. (`2001' has the same cinematic narrative, with the `cosmetics' being logic; the minor twist in `Clockwork' is that the cultural cosmetic is in the future.)The part of the narrative that O'Neal contributes is a loose stitching of this to plot elements as seasoning to help our digestion: war/ gambling, arbitrary privilege, duals and duels, face and body costumes, superposition of languages.The ironic point is that Kubrick tricks you into soaking up the lushness, and doesn't punish you at the end. That's why you leave the theater feeling guilty and not knowing why. (He takes away one of our legs -- the story -- and sends us to wander in America, not quite sure what has happened to us.) Can you think of any other artist with that power?",Null,34,46,28 November 2001
Interstellar," Dissymmetries, sight
","The good news that we have the brothers reunited and again working on circular narrative. Again, we have a powerful narrative arc that shifts in unexpected and engages in expected ways.The device is hackneyed: messages from the future, but is handled deftly. Where it is clumsy, we are competently distracted by narrative and visual process. The love story that drives this is novel enough to not fall into one of the three formulas commonly used for 'love,' (despite McConaughey) or two for father-rescues-daughter. We have a chosen child who saves the world by supernatural intervention, but again, this doesn't distract. These accomplishments alone make this worth experiencing because many devices are used to reset our expectations from formulas. Some fail horribly and that keeps this film from my absolute essential viewing list; I'll get to those in a moment. But all that are under the control of the filmmaker are so well considered that they bear mention.Take, for example the visual setting. The story itself is about the folding of time, but in a subtle way. The time of the story is in the future, but the setting is in the past. We refer to the dustbowl. All the cars, buildings, clothes and verbal expressions are vaguely from that era. We never see a brand that would pin down the time.More powerfully, the film itself is made as a science fiction film would be in the 50s-60s, using notions and tropes from that era. The robot is from 'Forbidden Planet.' The notion that a world-saving enterprise rests on the mathematical attempts of one man alone. That a vast enterprise is actually secret and located in one spot, with no suppliers. That construction of a spaceship requires welding sparks. That a heavy lift launch can occur in a building.Look at the computer screens. Nearly all are commandline interfaces. The switches and control panels are from the DEW line era. They haven't managed to use legacy fonts in the signage, but it looks like they avoided the most obvious: helvetica.Even the drone is a currently obsolete model. Underscoring all this is setting the film in Texas. Malick, and before him Bogdanovich, Hooper, Welles exploited the fact that Texas lives in two eras, sucking riches from the present while defining itself in some fictitious and better past.The film is also clearly in a future, after antiscience politicians have written technology out of the textbooks, denying the moon landing and forcing something named NASA underground. The ambiguity of time is conveyed subconsciously and works. I think they used some recorded interviews from the actual dustbowl era.But the flaw, the underlying decay in this film is in who they relied on for the science. They clearly separated the science of the adopted genre (noted above) from the science used in the actual extraterrestrial events. They chose renown physicist Kip Thorne as their authority.The man is an important scientist and reportedly very engaging. But the world of such scientists is divided between those who believe in the primary eminence of geometry and those who believe instead in ordered mechanics. This is a deep divide, highly polarized when the work gets going. Which is better for the problems at hand is irrelevant here. But which is better for cinematic depictions of encounters with the forces of the world well there is no contest and Noland chose unwisely. I may write about this. A good title may be the Carl Sagan effect.On other unrelated matters, some unresolved minor plot threads remain. The finished film exceeded the time budget for story-before-launch as it is, but we'd like to know what the reason for introducing the drone was and why it was important.A bit worse: In the film, we have a very hard won ability to send messages back in time, describing deep science from inside a black hole. I get that. But 'before' all those events, some other souls sent back messages and the physical artifact of the wormhole. Why not use that mechanism, unless the much-mentioned notion of the urges of love are essential to the bridge?",Null,13,24,14 December 2014
Full Metal Jacket," The Battle Photographer
","Spoilers herein.Since Vietnam, there have been a few competent films by Americans about Americans on the ground in battle. I think which one you like best (or appreciate the most) probably says a lot about you and how you look through the filmmaker's camera.Ready? `Red Line,' `Metal Jacket.' `Catch-22,' `Apocalypse,' `3 Kings,' `Platoon,' `Private Ryan.' Seven types of people. How would you rank them? Who are you? How do you see?I listed them according to my own ranking, which is heavily weighted on the degree to which the filmmaker mastered the art of filmmaking to do something to my soul that no one else could through any other art experience. Private Ryan was just a noisey Norman Rockwell. Platoon's war was somebody's fault, and we watch colorful and depictions as accusations. But Red Line weaved a mystical hypnotic internal narrative that put me in the mind (and incidentally the body) of a character swept by violent events. So very expert at understanding how to make us see war around us permanently on leaving the theater.But I rank this film high as well. Less visceral, at least at first. But there is so much style in the manner of the storytelling that it alone has more power than the story itself.The story is clever, however, concerned with framing the narrative. `Joker,' (an apt name if there ever was one) starts with a voiceover. We immediately know it is his story, but we don't know which character matches the voice for sure until the toilet murder scene. So we spend about half of the film, not in the story proper, but in a metastory which defines the narrator. And bingo, at the end, he is turned into a reporter.Then flash to a whore's butt and the story begins with a stolen camera! Immediately thereafter we have a whole different stance from Kubric's camera. Before, it was sterile, `outside' the action like most other films. Now it turns into a camera that is part of the group. It's internal to the gathering and travels with the men as a member of the party. And the camera is now less apparently controlled by the reporter than by the sweep of fate.We go through a middle section which sets up the `war story' proper, and this is framed once again by dickering with a whore. Then we are carried along with Rafterman's cameras. (And incidentally, Kubric's daughter with a camera at the burial pit.)And now to battle, and the style takes on a new Dantesque hue at the third layer of Hell. Just one example: that trio of sounds leading up to final encounter with the sniper are three metallic grating/screeching sounds that transmute to nearly identical violin sounds leading up to Joker's decision to shoot. Another: the sets in this third are transforming. I invite you to compare them to Spielburg's for a literal eyeopener. `Enemy at the Gates' had a similar battle-sniper-set style, clearly derivative of Kubric, but more stagey. Here we have carefully composed primitive shapes and fractal textures that suggest more than mere war: the destruction of civilization but the preservation of a more basic order. Another: the action is interrupted by journalistic interviews where the characters look you right in the eye to underscore that you are there -- you are the narrator; you have to decide whether to shoot or not.Kubric is a very personal filmmaker, and his personality is tied up in abstractions unique to the film narrative. I take war personally, so prefer this film above most of the others, except for Malick which is more personally abstract and therefore even more present.",Null,23,32,27 August 2001
The Grapes of Wrath," Silver Witness
","I am deeply thankful that Gregg Toland walked the planet and found himself to me in multiple projects. Its somewhat easy to pocket his presence when in the company of a great director. Its why you need to see something like this where his influence is so obvious it is hard to ignore.Ford isn't a BAD director, so much. He's actually something of a genius in taking life and simplifying it into one or two tosses of simple objects, then framing those simplifications in an effective way. His films work, pure and simple. But that's what they are, pure without challenging ambiguities. And simple in the sense that so-called conservatives politicians mime.Once you escape the pull of those simplified values you see that his films are a huge waste, fake values manufactured only to support a story strategy; values that have since taken on their own selfish lives.And here. The story is vapid. The acting trite (excluding Carradine) and offensively staged. Its actually demeaning as if these people suffered not in vain because they can 'teach' us something. Suffering is suffering, not lessons. But you won't see the frustrating reduced, artificial here, even with all the obsolete stagecraft. Its because Toland has rendered this so with such remarkable richness that the art of photography overcomes the thing. He captures nuance that Ford cannot see. His documentation surpasses the fact that it is film extras and constructed sets in front of the lens; the lens sees beyond that and gives us genuine pathos, disconnect. Its never in the parts manipulated by Ford in the foreground, but the background elements, the world in which our little play is staged.There's something about the quality of the film that I think we will never see again. Even the Coens, when trying to reproduce the textures in 'Man Who Wasn't There' Had to shoot it in color and print it in black and white. In a few years, it will all be digital. It may even look like this sometimes. But what was happening then, in Kane, here, was that there were chemical memories being formed in catalyzed emulsions in a device, while a master of that device had similar chemical processes working in his brain, and he was able to coordinate the two.

Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Folded Vision, Urges and Space
","Reflective EngagementI normally write about folding; the most obvious is when a film contains a film or play, but there are a bewildering number of types. The most interesting of these to me is when the film 'folds' the watcher in, in some way. The least interesting is when a film overtly quotes another. Tarantino, does this in a way that I think distracts from his other strengths.But what happens when you have a series that is older than most people on the planet, and has a world in some way adopted by nearly everyone that folds simple myths into itself?Some of the novel folding Abrams used is required because the original three were never about a world but a story. That world was borrowed from westerns, minimally to support the story, and adapted also minimally to allow the tech. When you don't have a full world to work with, you can't expand the story into it. This world is sparse; if evil exists, it can only exist in and be opposed in one form. So, Abrams has to expand back into the story rather than into the world. He does it partly by direct quoting, adopting the key themes: parents, magical force as military force, and conflict as spatial engagement.I particularly like how he places some action in the ruins of previous movies. In episode 7, we had the star destroyer. Here we've upped the ante with the ruined death star in ultra-dynamic water.But I am going to suggest here that some of what we are seeing in the reflected story qualifies as folding. That's because the original story was a simple instance of what Lucas probably still believes is a universal myth. Enough time (36 years!) has transpired from the original trilogy and enough exposure through aggressive marketing that the original trilogy's instance has itself become the myth on which we now impress our story.Three examples: The other two films advance the story through task episodes, after which there is an escape-chase. In this third case, the film is essentially a collection of chase sequences during which the story is advanced. Because the backbone is a chase, and we have a mature editing grammar for chase episodes, the maturity of pacing is extraordinary. Blockbuster films have advanced this art and Abrams simply uses the best. There's even a situation of our heroes in corridors being hunted by stormtroopers that is filmed as a mini-chase. So, from my perspective, they've folded the confrontations into punctuations between motions.The second example: after all this time, we have competing on-screen narrators. Palpatine has been manipulating things all along and has magical insight into what our characters are doing. This is folding of the viewer into a character, but of an unimaginative kind. In a more noir-quoting film, we'd have periods where we are reminded that our on-screen drama is only because the hapless heroes are being manipulated for our entertainment. Mapping this viewer's narrative control to a villain is common.But we have something far more inventive and for this viewer, thrilling. Our two main characters can actually see each other, across galactic dimension and occupy a shared interspace. The conflict can be conveyed through this narrative space that we share with the two, especially in an extraordinary fight scene where each is projected into the other's space. But it is more than that. The entire new story that is imposed on the old, is about who sees into whom: Palpatine, Leia, Kylo, Rey, Luke, Han, and the mobs on each side have some vision and agency. Each is able to take action through this narrative space. Leia for instance significantly changes things by insight and narrative governance at a distance. Or is that Luke or Han or even Vader working through her?The third example... The original trilogy is a simple quest in the context of pure good and evil. In the first two in this trilogy, the quest is continued, with little change but a different character. In this final instalment, this is no longer the fabric, but the background for a Shakespeare-worthy love story folded into it. This is grownup stuff, and we can see the fan kids and those who want to be objecting. The Disney folks have made a bold choice I think, differentiating from their Marvel property and investing for the long run. Give me a quest for complex urges any day. That's a story fabric I can build my life around. Polar battles between good and evil don't help me and have made my world worse.",Null,16,25,24 December 2019

","Yes, I do find this man more disappointing than your average action director. It isn't that his movies are any dumber than others. They aren't. It is a reverse prejudice based on two qualities. He has a powerful visual ability, in beings, environments and machines. It irks me to no end that he cannot turn this to visual storytelling. The visuals are engaging. The stories are dull and have no intrinsic connection to what we see.The other expectation is the Hispanic filmmaker's dilemma: so very many use a tradition inaptly called magical realism. Poetry invades physics and we can either have a story where the nature of the story bends the nature of the world, or we have a parallel world interwoven within ours for a while. I am so taken with this style of filmmaking that I would now perish without it. Even Rodreguez has it in his kiddie and troubling exploitation movies. That del Toro seems so oblivious to this richness, while excelling in others that matter.... It is like a master chef's meal that is lovely but made from paper. So all this big slugging machinery?

American Sniper," Focus
","I watched this like many others, consuming a rather simple story. Superficially, we are to admire this soul, both as an individual and representative of a collective who 'serve' us. As with Forgiven, we have some subtle exit from the story in the direction of despair for the country.Along the way we have several other stories. In fact, the whole kick in the chest is that Chris Kyle didn't matter at all. One extra story is that in his eighties, Clint Eastwood is still making films, competently. Any studio is eager to work with him because he is economically focused, doing what is needed only, and cleanly. In a way, Clint is the film model for this stereotype: cowboy, deadly, focused on the mission but quietly preoccupied. Tracking Clint (and Woody and Ridley) through their films is a lesson in mature creativity. Clint is also a student of film history and appreciates the exploitable quality of neonoir. A key element in traditional noir is a regular guy caught up in forces not of his control. The other key element is that his life is manipulated by the viewers collectively. Neonoir adds some on-screen collective that the viewers join. A layered tension is in how the hero fights with this manipulative force, joined with our unease at being part of that force.How Clint exploits that here: We identify with the hero in some ways. We would love for evil to be discrete, identifiable and killable. Slinky, dirty babbling people are handy tokens. We also identify with the nation that created this mess nearly from scratch. It is us that in some recognizable measure (in this film) that has ruined this simple man.About the story itselfI have a study of men who as filmmakers integrate their creative work with their lovers as actress. It is a pretty amazing thing to see collectively and presents a sort of meta-love story more powerful than the tales we see in the on-screen story. Clint himself has done this when younger.But what about when a filmmaker is past sex, when hormones are no longer harnessable in the service of creative power? It isn't celibacy, because there is no tense denial. It is always in the context of memories of loves sustained, and costs of passion. And it is always there, always.

The Devil Wears Prada," Fully Dressed
","Phil Spector invented modern pop music. Oh, some elements shift from time to time and different performer types are selected to posture in front. But the basic formula is one of filling all the holes. He called it 'wall of sound,' but Eric Clapton popularized the notion that the lead defines 'holes' and its the job of the producer to fill them all.It has to do with some hardwired notion of richness in the way we perceive things. My own theory is that usually we encounter things that to be understood have to be placed in some sort of context. We have to provide that context by being whole beings who have our own world and understand it. But we don't, usually. We're incomplete, lazy about this. We want prefabricated worlds to provide context and eliminate ambiguities.That's why we prefer it when an object comes with its own context, like in pop music where there is no vacuum for us to use. Fashion is the same way: there's some sort of bold statement, but it only works if all the holes are filled with accompanying items and attitudes.And its the same with movies. If you want a movie to be popular, to sit well in the popular eye, you need to make it lush in the small. This project shows signs that it is carefully produced in this way. Look at what happens in the backgrounds: colors, energy, motion. Look at what happens in the blocking: compound events conflated. Look at even the simple setup where a friend sees our young heroine flirt with a suitor. There's a huge amount of attention paid to the environment and the people which surround her.A Paris street walk is another very fine example.It isn't as valuable as what I usually look for: actual cinematic art. This is more craft, stagecraft. But it is well enough done to be admired. And entirely apt for a story about an industry that does the same thing.+++++ There are essentially four characters in this. The boss, our young writer, the 'first assistant' who is placed in between in several ways, and the gay (we infer) fashion expert who is placed in between in other ways.Part of the richness is that each of these is fuller than the usual 'lesson' movie would have. All four are compelling performances. But if you haven't yet seen this, I'd like you to pay particular attention to Emily Blount. She's the number 1 assistant.You've probably seen her before in the very special 'My Summer of Love,' something human about love and seductions. I think she's a real talent, something different than the others. Oh, they're very good at what they do, finding the right notes. But this woman has something else, something more visceral.You see, you can dance your own context into this and turn it from something that has no room for you. Try it by following the Emily Blount character, whose name is also Emily. (Hathaway's character is the 'new Emily.') +++++ The moral issue we are meant to capture is more sophisticated than usual, too. Streep's character isn't a devil at all. She isn't quite a useful person in the manner that she actually creates. She doesn't make anything. She doesn't create or design or do anything normally considered the root of the food chain in term of value.She's part journalist, a sort of elevated, influential journalism that Anne's character doesn't have the horsepower to accept. She's also an arbiter of what matters. Its not a new notion, that some journalists create the world they present, and make it seem real by absolute consistency and projected confidence. Its what politics is. Fashion and politics, religion.That final challenge, about whether our young journalist will follow what she sees as the devil, that final challenge is more complex than it seems. And though this is a mainstream movie, part of the enrichment is that they didn't tone it down. And they left us with the conclusion that the girl left and wrote the story we see, one which casts the successful worldbuilder as the devil.++++ Speaking about worldbuilders and fashion. To appreciate this movie, you must see the one on which it relies, 'Funny Face.' Audrey Hepburn, with the smile that Hathaway mines. Similar situation: fashion, clunky girl becomes fashionably adept, conflict between the 'real' and pretend (in that case, philosophy). A trip to Paris  some of the very same establishing shots in fact. An ambiguous resolution that in Hepburn's case involved photography instead of writing.That movie made Jackie Kennedy possible, which made Jack Kennedy president, and from there, another 'wall of sound' that built a reality, incidentally concurrent with the rise of Phil Spector...Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,31,57,2 July 2006

Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The Dark Side
","Spoilers herein.A gifted young man studies under a master and has a natural advantage over him. He has some early success and is attracted to the dark side. Thereafter, he engages in huge projects peopled by relatively mindless clones. His motives are turgid, and though many people are swept up in his enterprise, he ultimately fails.That's George Lucas, who stole much of the plot of Star Wars from the master filmmaker Kurosawa, even down to details of the storm trooper uniforms. But no one knew because Kurosawa's film was languishing in Japan. With a bunch of new effects plus some sophomoric Joseph Campbell mythology he was able to fake the first film. Knowing his limits, he assigned the writing and directing of the next two to others. They are by far the best of the five.Then by some hubris, he takes full control. No one can tell him that he is comparatively talentless, and the result -- though expertly marketed -- is a dud. There's no soul to this project. As with `The Cell,' the effects are lavish but use all sorts of clashing metaphors and philosophies. You already know that the writing and acting completely stink. I'm very easy to please. Often, just youthful experimentation will do it if exuberant, like `Gummo.'But I suppose that this project had so many people involved in every shot that they had to be imagined at the lowest common denominator. That means that no cinematic thrill appeared until the very end. But that last swordfight, especially the part before Yoda appears, is excellent. Shot on the same set as Moulin Rouge, and stealing the blocking from that film, and `Crouching Tiger.' The camera is a dancer, acting as the hidden master behind the drama. Oh if only the whole thing could have been so adventuresome with the camera!Speaking of which, Ewan has been in three of my top ten films of the last decade. His two Lucas films are not among them. (Moulin Rouge!' `The Pillow Book' `Black Hawk Down').Cat's eye comments follow:Serious science fiction readers have been watching these recent episodes carefully. The formula for multi-installment epics is pretty rigid. Successive layers of conspiring power are revealed, and at the end is a surprise layer. The closer you get to the end, the more are the clues of what that layer is, and the game becomes one of detective work.One can easily see where this is going. At the first layer is a conspiracy of politicians and merchants. Then we discover that they are mere tools of a larger battle between the Force and the `Dark Side.' Next we will discover another layer of what creates the Force and the Dark Side and are playing with them just as they play with `mere' beings. That force is machines. Notice these clues:-- The Jedi clearly are blinded to obvious signs around them. This is because the force is controlled by machines -- nanotech machines in their bloodstream communicating with each other. This was introduced in the last episode.-- A solar system cannot be ignored. It can be caused to disappear from the library's computers (by conspiring machines), but its gravity and mass are essential for navigation, and this would be done by computers. So the computers know about the cloner planet and keep that knowledge from humans. Also they inhibit the Jedi from reasoning clearly about it.-- The battle in this episode is clearly thrown by the robots, though they are outnumbered. Consider: machines capable of designing and building other machines who ARE weapons and who can communicate directly with each other -- and these are against humans who communicate bluntly (through machines) and who must operate weapons.-- Taking over of Skywalker includes making him part machine.Prediction: next episode, we will discover the force is the result of emergent complex system behavior of nanomachines that comprise a massive distributed computer. They permeate the Jedi's blood and are manipulating events so that humans destroy each other while leaving a legacy of machines to populate the universe. Presumably in episodes seven or eight, we would have gotten even higher, something like Stars as pantranscendent beings.",Null,10,17,25 May 2002
Corpse Bride," Chopin's Grave
","I liked this a lot, and a large part of the reason is that it is pure a Burton film as we are likely to find.And when I say Burton, I mean that oddly successful collaboration between him and Elfman colored by commercial realities.The big picture is that there are very few filmmakers with the skills and courage to be unique, to make movies that only they could. This goes beyond style into the nature of the soul.If you do not have an interesting soul, you cannot be an artist. If you do not have the courage and ability to reveal that soul in some way to us, you cannot either. So hurrahs for the few in the world of film that do.In a way, this film is a notion expanded around Ub Iwerks' (yes, that's a real name) 'Skeleton Dance' done for Disney and quoted in a couple more hip Betty Boop cartoons. In another way, it is a simple date movie: boy gets girl, boy loses girl by misunderstanding, boy gets girl back and the thing ends in a wedding.And also in a way, it is a love poem to his girl friend. I'm fascinated by these things, where a talented director (usually a man) can shape the image of the woman he loves. Films DO influence how we think of love, but this is more genuine and powerful than any of them, this real love that shines through purely cinematic means. Just think about casting the woman you love as a corpse! She is as alluring here as she has even been.But beyond that is something that is more lasting, the business between Depp and Burton. Johnny is a fine actor, but many fine actors don't get the opportunity to explore new and unknown corners of darkness. He has and is better off for it. And so are we, though whenever this happens we end up with a new character template that inevitably becomes a stereotype. Depp already mines that stereotype in his Pirate movies.But what concerns us here is how Burton/Elfman deepens what he has with Depp. He introduces the character as a pianist, and does so with a piano piece. That piece is a skillful blend of Chopin and pop, but more on the Chopin side. For many, Chopin is the most nakedly emotional yet dark soul they will encounter. No humor, only intimacy and passion. So two clever things were done with this. The first is that the Depp persona (though an animated avatar here) was made deeper by reference to our deepest pianist. The second is that a few musical scenes and effects are set up, all of which reference the scene in some way. There's a sweet musical duet with Helena where they do fall in love. There may be few things more lovely than making love via music played to each other -- with each other.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,20,29,6 January 2006
Romeo + Juliet," Poetry to Visual Affect
","This is not Shakespeare's best play, but it has his best poetry; that's because the play is ABOUT language, about the difference between what something is and the language used to describe it. So among the plays, this may be one of the hardest to film. But alas it suffers from another blessing which is also a curse: the story itself is so powerful that one can build any sort of film or play or whatever around it and have it be likely to work. Thus, we often lose the language.Zefrelli made his own choices in the earlier film; these were relatively conventional. While it cut some valuable language, sacrificed to the gods of contemporary patience, it is by far the better version. But here we have some interesting choices.First the setting. Italians to Shakespeare's England were a comical people, and his setting of the play there would have encouraged the audience to bring heavy stereotypes to the drama. Latins in his day were considered: Foppish: Quick to violence (a stereotype that has been inherited by blacks today, but to Londoners, Italians were nearly Africans): Incredibly proud especially as regards slights to masculinity: Obsessed with weapons.Today, we roll those up under the relatively crude notion of stupid Latin macho. In this film, the director has exaggerated the Latin macho ethic to have the same effect 16th century Londoners would get. It works because these stereotypes are powerful memes which attract many hosts which perpetuate their underlying truth. Baz adds the additional dimension of the people being captured by the superstitious underbelly of the Church.He deliberately straddles the border between apparent truth and satire. These Latins are superficial visually and not verbally. So here is the solution to the problem on how to make a film (which is primarily a visual medium) out of a play that leverages poetic language. The solution is to convert all the metaphors from language to vision. Hence the much-noted lack of poetry. I imagine Baz directing the players to not worry so much about the poetry.Both Romeo and Juliet are incapable of performing the poetry anyway: they are children learning on the job. And what acting skill they have from film is all in the face, not the tongue. They are pretty enough though.I like this film for its boldness. Some of the experiment works since we get the message of the difference between what we see and what is true. This is why Juliet has to see a LIVE Romeo at the end. Living under water is used to good effect. But in the real play, there are so many and such subtle explorations of the theme, and these are scoured away here for a few broad effects. The real message, which comes through loud and clear if you know the play (or even Zefrelli's film) is not the distance between the reality of events and the language, but the reality of the richness of the real play and this film. Equally vast. Equally powerful statement. So we have a playhouse with the back part blasted out to the sea.As a separate matter, the play has three anchors: Mercutio, the Friar and the Nurse. These are handled interestingly here.The Friar is an alchemical master hiding under the cloak of the Church. The play equates the magic of language with the magic of potions, equally deadly. The congruence is lost in this film, but Baz definitely gets the magic part as well as the superfluous ritual of the church. This friar is a terrific, memorable performance of someone who believes he can defeat nature. Serves as an anchor as intended.The Nurse is the true domestic, raw nature, full of uncompromised loyalty but ultimately compromised. Her character is lost here. We NEED to know about the dead sister and why the nurse turns on Juliet in order to save her life. Baz fails here, and so provides no center. For Shakespeare, she's the white space on the palette.Mercutio in the play is a emotionally engaged visionary mystic. We understand that Romeo and Mercutio studied magic (`philosophy') abroad together much as Hamlet and Horatio had. The dream they shared the night before is the axis of the whole action: rather like the magic of the witches in Macbeth. Baz gets this as well: Modern magic is what? Drugs. So Hamlet is given a psychotropic by Mercutio before going to the party. Works for me, because it allows everything to be visually blasted and inexorably tragic. The whole thing after the party is a trip, see? It is why they can meet, become entranced and arrange marriage after an hour or two. (Remember that until this point Romeo is hopelessly smitten by Roseline.)Anyone who wrestles with problems of filming the Bard and comes out alive deserves my respect. This is a weird interpretation, but that's the point.",Null,79,130,16 June 2000
Gone Baby Gone," Baby Arrives
","I love it when I am wrong, and someone that I think doesn't matter surprises me.Ben Affleck put together some snappy lines in 'Good Will,' but that project was so ordinary in form it self-destructed. His acting is generally silly. There isn't a role he hasn't deflated.But here he does three wonderful things.He selects a story that has shape. Its not like the wimpy 'Hunting,' that was just a reslicing of genres. This is extraordinarily unexpected. He directs his brother, who he clearly knows how to communicate with. Casey is by far more talented this way, and benefits from the guidance. Heck, he even got an almost good performance out of Freeman, who has a role just far enough from his ordinary character to surprise a bit.But the key thing – he is cinematic. There's only one totally amateur moment (when the quarry scene is recalled), but there are many well conceived visualizations of what is happening. Its about tone, visual tone, and he gets it. I'm wrong about the man. He just needed a slot. Now lets hope he stays there.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,3,5,5 April 2009
"Monsters, Inc."," Gates Again
","This is a resubmitted comment, the original was removed by a complaint from some anonymous aggrieved party. Let's hope the edits are sufficient this time.You already know that this is the usual Pixar fare, which is to say that it is excellent, better than any non-Pixar animated film. Sure, you also know that and you probably know the usual reason given: that Pixar spends more time on basic storytelling values than anyone else.Here are two elements of this that may deepen your appreciation. The first is that Pixar recognized early that 3D animation software allowed two types of advance in the third dimension. The first is obvious, that everything has depth and reflection and shadow more or less like reality.The second is that once these objects and scenes are defined in the computer, it is no extra work to move the camera anywhere. it can loop and swoop in ways that we never could have before. Pixar decided to exploit this in their storytelling here and later in 'Nemo.'Nemo was set in an environment where there was no horizon so the camera could flow and the watery feel of the place could make the unfamiliar fluidity of the camera seem more natural. Here, is where they tested some of those perspectives in the three dimensional door warehouse and the extra dimensions of going in and out. Those scenes make this for me.The second interesting thing is some competitive background. In those days, there was a shooting war between Bill Gates, financier of Dreamworks Animation (and leader of Microsoft) and Steve Jobs of Pixar (and leader of Apple). This was in the heyday of Gates' dirty tricks and he was intent on burying Jobs forever. Pixar depended on the success of 'A Bug's Life' their followon to 'Toy Story,' so Dreamworks rushed 'Antz' -- a cheapy -- to open a week or so before to steal the market.'Bugs' prevailed, sufficiently at least, and Pixar ramped up for their usual three year development of 'Monsters.' Dreamworks, getting wind of this, went all out with 'Shrek,' their 'monster' movie that could be released six months earlier. It only took a year because the animation is less perfect. But they were overt in their attack this time: 'Shrek' made literal fun of Disney, the Pixar partner. The head guy at Disney was the model for the blowhard King who reigned over a fairytale kingdom populated with -- can you guess? -- all the old Disney characters.Pixar/Jobs would never do something so spiteful. But perhaps they did subtly appreciate the use of windows and gates to the future that always seemed to go wrong.

Bridget Jones's Diary," The Anti-Austen
","Spoilers herein.No author has been more pillaged for film than Jane Austen. Her books have been the source of `straight' adaptations, teen movies, and the recent `Mansfield Park.' In that last film, we had the modern notion of a film about Jane the writer conflated with the story she is writing.Here, the adapter of `Pride and Prejudice' and `Emma' takes things to the next level, creating a P&P that features an antihero. For those not familiar with Austen, her novels are marvelously written, concerning `manners and morals.' Her method is to cast a few honorable people at the mercy of frivolous conventions. The charm of these books is how the frivolity of the times is embodied in some absolutely ridiculous secondary characters. The personal politics of the time are clarified and amplified through this device.So here we have the next step. We have a writer and the story she writes, just as in `Park,' but here the heroine is one of the ridiculous, formerly incidental characters. Bridget is a genuinely trivial person -- stupid, unattractive, without any of the qualities that would elevate her into Austen's world of the heroine.The story slogs through so many references from P&P: the overheard criticisms at the party; the `in spite of my better judgement I like you' speech, the false accusations against Darcy; the character Darcy himself played by the very actor from P&P; the `it is a truth universally acknowledged that..' line; the actor who played Bigley in P&P does a walkon here. Natalie here is much the same role Embeth played in `Park.'What we have here, disguised as a `Notting Hill' for women, is a truly adventuresome idea: Austin from the perspective of one of the dummies. A sort of `Guildenstern.' I can see how this could have worked, if the ridiculous social conventions were actually ridiculed. As it turns out we are asked to buy every one of them: and Bridget gets her man not because she is internally noble, but quite the opposite: he loves her because she is inarticulate, stupid, fat, pliable and trivial. In the process -- since we identify with Renee -- we willingly blend into the broken society.I suppose this is the `identify with the underdog' strategy in mass marketing. Obviously it works as the film is a hit. And because it was cheap to make, will be immensely profitable. I just wish they hadn't spit on Ms Austen in the process: there is something noble about her women, something which contributed significantly to our modern notions of romance. This is an anti-romance.Renee was multidimensional in `Nurse Betty,' or I thought so. Here (and in `Irene') she shows me I was mistaken. Her acting is wholly in her face, and shallow at that. She could have played Jane playing Bridget, or at least a better actress could have.",Null,3,6,13 May 2001
Captain America: The First Avenger," Shifting Interiors
","It just doesn't make any sense to me, how consistently bad Marvel's films are. Perhaps someone who loves the comics can be transported out of the movie into some well established fantasy world. In that case, all you need are a few cues. But they just don't connect with me, with the exception of just a few set pieces. There's one here toward the end, where the two masters finally fight it out. It happens in a Nazi plane powered by an occult force, patterned after the much maligned Northrop Flying Wing. But the plane changes scale up and down ranging from roughly normal size to more than a magnitude larger.The bashing and gnashing is ordinary but the art design of this scene is pretty good. The camera moves in extraordinary ways as the plane careens. It mimics That scene in 'Mr Arkadin' where Welles' character kills a prostitute because she might know something. The environment shifts and the camera as well in a syncopated fashion. Knowing the history of that Northrop design adds to the case; it had control problems that had to wait for computerized control systems that enabled the B2 bomber. Reagan got behind it based on his belief in magic, the presentation coordinated with dates determined by Nancy's stars. Great to see that magic here, with the villain speaking precisely like Werner Herzog.Otherwise, not a single redeeming feature.

The Bourne Ultimatum," Great Scotts
","Why did I think 'Transformers' was great and this not? They use the same cinematic engineering at root. This is simpler and because it is not a cartoon and chase-oriented rather than battle-oriented it grabs better.Both are made by untalented men advised by brilliant producers. In this case, its Doug Liman, who has made study of how the eye can be diced. What he's done is take the standard camera techniques for excitement and toned them up a bit.The model is Tony Scott. In fact, the Scott model is followed so stringently, we have that teletype effect and sound when we are told where the action has moved to. Can we finally get rid of that, please? Its as disruptive as that business of the red line moving across a map used to be.The camera is otherwise inherently cinematic and 'there.' By there, I mean even in the quiet segments, we are reminded that it is a hand-held camera. The interesting thing is that you can see that a machine is putting those jiggles in as no cameraman could be that random. Its not a human eye but a robot one pretending to be so.But you probably won't notice that. You'll notice, as I did, that when the fights happen, you see flashes as the participants would, When you run, you see irrelevant motion as a runner and someone following him would, and taking cues from that amazing section at the beginning of 'Casino Royale.' So why did I like 'Transformers' better? You'll laugh when I tell you. Because the story is more intelligent, and elements of it relevant to the cinematic adventure. Here's an example: the concept in Transformers is that we have a hyperactive, flitting eye. So we are prepared for this by being shown a robot with the same hyperactive vision disorder (and we see things through its eyes).That's not the case here. The story is one of recovered memory, of bits coming together to make sense. The cinematic basis is the opposite. Oh, there's some cinematic memory, the type of stuff from 'Manchurin Candidate,' (with the 'memory' film incongruously striped with use and faded by exposure). That's old model, and it fits the story such as it is.The new cinematic vision is merely bolted on, the way that car chase was bolted on in 'French Connection.' That was about as exciting in its day. Go and watch that movie today and see how bad it is, and you'll see what we'll be thinking about this in 35 years. But it IS a rush if you see it now.Scott Glenn does a good job.

","I checked out this video because I just saw Hamlet and was completely captivated by Julia Stiles. Then I learned that she has already done three Shakespeare adaptations (this, Hamlet, O). This is really interesting. Is this really a talented actress (only 19) who understands something of Shakespeare and has purposefully targeted film adaptations? I've heard she was a success on TeeVee. I have to know, wondering if the flash of brilliance in Hamlet was a one-shot deal.As for the quality of this film, I cannot say. Teen dating dramas succeed or not based on a secret, everchanging language of the subculture. I don't have a pass to that area, so must demur. This isn't much Shakespeare though, just the barest skeleton.Her acting seems fresh, but its mighty hard to tell much here. She's not asked to do much, except for one moment when she reads a poem.

Fargo," Internally Frayed
","The Coens are masters of the tease. By that I mean they'll find a closely embroidered dress and then goof with its perfection. They'll pull this and that element of the colored threads out so that its frayed, disturbing the scene so carefully constructed by the original craftswoman. Superficially it looks more homemade, more genuine this way. But if you look closely you'll see that what they've done is a matter of orchestrated destruction. Things defined by their distance from other things.Past that point it is merely a matter of whether the teasing engages or not.Their previous movie was not well received. The original garment was a combination of a mild Capra screwball and a 30's newspaper fold of a sassy woman detective. The noir mechanics were made explicit, as were the cinematic components.The audience  by this I mean the general paying audience  stayed away. They just weren't in the mood for clever deconstruction, no matter how polished.This is a reaction. Its a wonderful project, just wonderful in its way, but also sad in the implied tightness behind the decisions you see.What they've done is frayed the garment on the inside. Everything is sparse, bleak. All the camera setups are overly simplified, all the emotional mechanics understated. Most of it is buried in the snow.If this movie were made by anyone else, it would just be amusing, a calm sketch of a deliberately uncaffeinated selling itself as if it were a chain of simple products.But it isn't. Its a suppressed visit by extremists pretending to not be extreme. Its Lynch doing 'Straight Story' and not asking us to know that over every dusk hued horizon is one of his ragged unreal movies.Because of this, we see small gateways into the world of the Dude, or the Sirens. The unborn child will enter a different world. The postage stamp will fly to a different world (when the rates change).Watch it for the simple garment, a dress covered by a coat.

Predator," Sgt Rock
","Spoilers herein.Whatever happened to McTiernan? This is the guy who invented the blockbuster action film with `Die Hard.' The formula was clear: an ordinary man thrust into extraordinary situation; characters are simply but domestically motivated, and the whole thing is done with a wink at the audience. The second two of these are hard, fast rules by now. So why oh why does he ignore them?What we have here is Arnie, someone who takes himself seriously and doesn;t have the capacity for self-mocking. Even when it is the explicit point of the film (`Last Action Hero') he can't pull it off. Here, he takes on the persona of the comicbook Sgt Rock: gruff, cigar-chomping, straightahead kickbutt dude who takes no guff. He is surrounded by comic cartoon characters, but when it gets down to it, its man to man hand to hand gladitorial combat. And the Sarge will win because he is an American.There's not a shred of fun in this. Nor a sense of adventure. No character is remotely likeable.The only redeeming value is a nice use of fireworks toward the end when the alien shoots off flares to find the Sarge, though why they would help with his vision constraints isn't explained.I got some fun from this because a layer of winking was added by others. I saw it on cable in the Czech Republic and dubbed in Czech.

Nightcrawler," Wet Spots
","There are some fine things about this that you can read elsewhere, There seems to be no lack of appreciation for the obvious things. What struck me was the role that Russo has.I am interested in films where the filmmaker — usually a man — is in love with his lead actress. Love bends film. Passion drives the creative process and spills into my experience. Here is a case where the filmmaker also wrote the part. And what a part! This is the rare film where the main character (Bloom) is less deep than his foil (Russo).Bloom reacts to and within his environment. His reactions are engaging for sure, but is Russo that envelops him and becomes the environment. He cannot resist. In the past, I have not been impressed by this actress, but here her husband/lover seems to have known precisely what she can do and built the character's behavior around those abilities. Superficially, she is not an attractive being. But look more closely at how she carries herself, even when challenged. Look how in the shared scenes the camera frames her face differently than his. This is built around her.In particular, there is a device called folding, the simplest example of which is a film within a film. Whoever controls the inner film (here an ongoing newscast) we also subconsciously understood to *control* the outer film. Whether Gilroy consciously knew this or not, I cannot say. But you can sense his mature passion in how this woman shapes his world.Another dynamic worth mentioning is something I call *exploitation irony.* A common use is in a film that is ostensibly against sexual exploitation; say it is about a father who learns that his daughter is an enslaved porn actress, is repelled and enlists us in an enterprise to save her. But then we have some sex scenes that are shot to appeal to the very same prurient attractions we superficially deplore. It is a good trick because it builds tension within us. Here we have that with our intended abhorrence for emphasized exposure to violent lowlifes. And then our engagement with the same behavior we are set to criticize. The effect is amplified because of this film-within dynamic and the on screen lover effect.",Null,4,7,17 February 2015
The Aviator," Three Characters
","We all live in our own movies, and particularly like movies of people who do so more literally. Here are three in one film:Martin Scorsese: My regular readers know that I have been very critical of his films. Sure, they are crafted well enough, but the world he created was not one worth visiting. His films until recently were of the Italian storytelling school which focuses on characters. Those characters do not inhabit their worlds as much as create them. Scorsese's camera, therefore, was affixed to people, almost by a visible thread.But those of us who watch film seriously know that there is nothing but empty darkness just outside the camera's eye. There's no world, so there can be no God, or fate, or luck or whatever material you imagine fills the river of life. He knows it is a cheat as well and has said so. Just like many other fabulously successful filmmakers who know their work is hollow, in his later years he's tried to mature... to master a greater notion of creation.'Gangs' was a success in this regard though an unfinished film because the Weinsteins pulled the plug. It marked a completely different approach to space and context, and I applauded it. Now he actually finishes a movie in the new style. Though this is a story of a man, it is no longer anchored to the man. The camera is now Orson Welles' camera with shots of the space with people in it. So obvious is some of this that when Hughes first retreats, he stays out a room that inexplicably (and unhistorically) has strings tied from hither and yon from objects. Take another look at that room and see all of Scorsese's old camera angles. I think we can welcome Scorsese now as the best new filmmaker of the year. This is as much his story as Hughes'.Cate Blanchett: Cate is one of three actresses alive who can fold her acting, meaning that she can simultaneously deliver two characters in the same motions. She's at the top of her game here (while Julianne is devolving with an apparently thick husband). Hepburn was an amazing actress, deeply untalented in the conventional measures but capable of engineering her surroundings to suit. Her engineering of the 'Philadelphia Story' persona is Hollywood legend. She engineered a character that worked, then stepped into it. The old Scorsese would have hired someone like Streep to play Hepburn and lumbered around after her. The new Scorsese allows Cate to flower and willingly supports the folding: an actress (Cate) playing a character (Kate) who is playing a character. You can see all the conduits of control, all the taught strings at two levels. God, what a great time to be alive!Howard Hughes: The movie gave the impression that Howard simply inherited his money. No so. He was a brilliant engineer who famously codesigned systems and the engineering organizations to support them. While most of us were barfing at frat parties, he designed a drill bit (often credited to his father) that is still the standard in the industry, together with a set of screw connections that has since become the international standard. That's where the money came from. And though he went loopy toward the end, he ensured that 100% of his wealth (yes, all assets were sold) went to endow the world's largest private research institute. This was a passionate engineer in a world of monopolistic thugs (Gates take notice), truly what we like to think the 'free market' is all about. The movie also ignores a key movie connection: He always intended the 'Spruce Goose' to be made of wood, and because all US manufacturing assets were committed, he designed a production system that allowed small businesses, even backyard groups, to make pieces that would be floated down rivers and successively be glued into larger parts. This (what he called the 'packet production system') was the first serious research into what we today call 'virtual enterprises.'When the war ended, he sent his virtual enterprise experts into his film business where they used the system (freely giving away details) to destroy the vertically integrated studio system. Nearly all movies today use his virtual enterprise approach and the Weinsteins (producers of this very film) are the current masters of the system.

Oblivion," Dream of us
","One measure of a science fiction movie is whether the science and fiction are coherent. I've been following the Hunger Games saga and this is driving me crazy. Some technology is advanced, some adopted from the sixties. In good hands, like with Nolan's Interstellar, this could be used to advantage.In that case, essential plot points depend on the limits or reach of technology. Because some is advanced and some not, I can't understand the world. I can't enter it. I know the series is popular with young girls, and I assume that is because the technology is invisible, the politics drive the world and what matters is teen love (and family).Here, the writing and art direction get this bit right. Everything we popularly assume about tech is advanced a step and half. The story is silly. The actions of the characters are cartoonish but understandable. The climax is yet another flight into an orbiting alien vessel, the destruction of which saves the world.And is has our smiling boy. But despite all this, it feels comfortable because we can fit ourselves in the world, in the movie.The one exception is the radio.

","This to my taste is another clumsy deal: centered on an existing product, the attempts at being visually coherent should be more successful than they are. Its a mess, visually and rhythmically. There are two things that impressed me though. I thought the 'Rorschach' character was very successful, in part because he pushed a strong path through the chaos that was both the world of the movie and the movie. He was fully integrated: story, bearing, visuals, including some of the setups. Its baffling to me how everyone else would be so clearly inferior in execution. This idea of having a 'mask' (which is basically just a headsock) that forms dynamic blots — it is genius.The other thing, dear reader, is something of a personal quirk. I have a fascination with orreries. These are — originally — models of the solar system that were by gears and tracks, novel machinery of different types, supposed to model the movement of at least the planets. As an student of modeling and abstraction, these have a historical significance for me, and I find that they have become a sort of minor but very strong icon in film.Here we have one, a modern type. It is almost a perfect blend of Superman's crystal fort in the first movie, and the 'device' in 'Contact.' We are supposed to believe that this is the perfect creation of a perfect mind, one that can see everything in how it works and can model it in such a way that it controls those forces. It is, thus, a model of himself, everything he knows and his transit and container. There is a plot point where the lover's emotions destroy is by simply existing, but that is another story.I loved the design of the thing; its just marvelous. These three dimensional model- environments just thrill me. I wanted to recommend 'Knowing' just based on the stellated spaceship alone.

The Bourne Identity," The Studio as the CIA
","Spoilers herein.Here we have another film ruined by conservative studio executives worried about engineering their `take no chances' summer blockbuster. After an entire year of countless arguments, delays, rewrites, reshoots and audience tests, we have as flat and unimaginative a film that Hollywood can produce. This is precisely the stuff we see in this story and countless other CIA-centric plots: the man in the field (Liman) has talent and intuition, but the company (here Universal) thinks it knows better. It throws its power around and thwarts every speck of cleverness. Death and failure result.It was set up to be quite clever: Ludlum's innovation was in recasting the airport thriller as a fractionated narrative told from many perspectives. The protagonist, whose knowledge the reader usually shares, is the least knowledgeable of all. Clancy has since wrapped this style in war gizmos, and Grisham in legal technicalities. Altman brought this notion to film; Tarantino styled it; Liman's evolution (in `Go') was to root the narrative confusion in the angst of discovery which brings us right back to the intent of Ludlum. Okay, you have to begin with a dope as the lead because of the economics of the situation -- that was dictated by Universal and golden inner circle of decisionmakers. The last time we had such a stretch between the intellect of the actor and character in a summer movie was when Denise Richards played a nuclear scientist in `The World Is Not Enough.' Matt rivals Raquel Welch in the dumb department. But sobeit.But see who else Liman assembled: for the girl, he collected Potente who all movielovers know from `Run Lola Run.' That was a breakthrough experiment in parallel narratives with the same intent as `Go,' but an orthogonal approach. No serious moviegoer cannot understand that as backstory to this. Make the `company man' be Chris Cooper, someone whose role here is exactly between his Sheriff Deeds of `Lone Star' and Col Fitts of `American Beauty,' both characters works of art.Make the second love interest (presumably established for the continuations of the franchise) Julia Stiles. She is pretty, athletic and currently inexpensive. Her three Shakespearean film experiments are unacknowledged in their adventure in redefining the narration of the master. (Ophelia as film student!)The magic in a project like this is in the editing and shooting footage to appear part of the editing. For instance, there needs to be a lot of handheld work, and this needs to be jiggly in a selfaware fashion. As taught in film school, the rhythm of the shakes should match the rhythm of the fast cuts. So we got a director of photography who worked with Woo and knows how to do this. Any competent editor would do, but Liman wanted an abstract stance (like his other two projects). Pulling that off with such a nervous camera requires insight, so we get an editor that has slogged through the intellectual challenges of Terrence Malick on his massive visual meditation on war.Then the trouble begins. In the most ironic of developments, the Studio forced all sorts of safe formulae on the project. Gone is the narrative folding of Ludlum and Liman. Gone is the abstract camera: all is framed in those stock `computer screen' images where a shot of Berlin has a text overlay that types out the name with the accompanying clack of keys. Added is all sorts of bumpf techno tracking stuff that was never part of the story (or the real CIA) but sold well in `Spy Games' and `Behind Enemy Lines.' Gone is all the miniconspiracy of Stiles' character (`too complicated for kids'). Gone is the detective story. Gone is any chance for us to like what we see.",Null,9,18,14 June 2002

Once they adjust you into the space, they can do things with the shared imagine that cannot be done anywhere else.And then there are the candy store movies like this. They are incoherent, a jumble of notions and gags from all sorts of different perspectives and conceptual modes. You take it in bits as small as 30 seconds and only as long as 5 or so. Its a TeeVee thing, and to buy into it at all requires a step back from expectations of anything that really works.

It starts with the familiar march, first of our hero. Then from the sides come his sidekicks. I think there was some of that triumphant slomo strutting with swelling music. Then more and more people come from the sides and join the procession, literally behind our boy. Then at the appropriate time, they break out in song, rising in excitement over the forthcoming climax which we know will go well because of his resolve.But then in what is perfectly timed crescendo, the energy increases until it seamlessly tips into a riot.

The direction, acting and all that are pretty ordinary, as is the actual story and it tested very poorly. So - the story goes - the concerned producers brought in a giant in the editing profession to reshape the film. He tightened it up and did some other normal things, but he also focused on transitions between scenes.This film spends a lot of time on elaborate entries and exits of scenes, and is the second film this year to do so. The `Matrix 2' was the other one. But Matrix used the transitions as tools to subliminally remind the viewer of the `difference' between reality and illusion.Here, the transitions are less obvious but no less complex.

","Spoilers herein.For some reason, IMDB dropped my original comment. Only Gandolf knows why. This is a slim replacement, but done after some time has passed. That distance is valuable.The game here is one that you can only lose. Books can tap the imagination in ways that film ruins because what you see constrains what you can imagine. The books were successful because they created a whole world in such a way that found niches in our ability to envision. The best that can be done is to amaze visually, not trample the actual story, and hope that distracts from the fact that something unbounded is now visually bounded forever.My original comment spoke to small compromises made in the film that make the pagan notions fit more clearly in a Christian context. That's likely what prompted the removing complaint, so I avoid repeating the mistake. But I will note how the women, Ms Blanchett and Tyler are photographed. They are so idealized (even for film!) that I sat impressed. The camera can construct beauty and imply so much more. They do so here, and many girls will struggle with these ideals in the future.I think the idealization of Cate adds one dimension to the story that wasn't quite in the book: Cate's magical pledge could be seen as creating a vision that is the entire rest of the story. I prefer this, seeing all the monsters and motivations as coming from this lovely magical queen's mind. Cate as Elizabeth, the magical queen that Spencer has as the Fairie Queen whose dreams define the world.

The Matrix Revolutions," Dimension
","Spoilers herein.Projects like this contain a promise that they will deliver in three areas: style, dimension and cosmology.The promise of style is probably the primary one and the easiest to deliver to judge from other projects. The first `Matrix' did a pretty good job on this, at least so far as the leather-and-shades, the design of the machine world (Metropolis with lightning and tentacles) and the crypto screencharacters.The second fumbled incredibly, especially in defining Zion.Now the leather is transformed to bondage vinyl and the style overall takes another step backward. Instead of different styles for the different worlds, they all blend into a blandness determined by what was cheap for the animation software, with a lack of detail covered by quick cuts. But they are not the deliberately paced cuts of, say `Once Upon a Time in Mexico,' instead speedy cuts designed to distract.The matter of dimension is what engages us after the first fifteen minutes, after we have already paid to sit and we begin to pay attention. `Virtual Dimension' was handled well in the first by the introduction of the various dimensions of reality that intersect in complex ways. The second film added little to this but exploited the matter of physical dimensionality - many of the spaces were pretty exciting, including the framing shootout in the skyscraper.In this edition, it seems that different art directors were assigned different parts of the film (as in `The Cell') and we get a hodgepodge of spatial philosophies. The battles in the ducts, in the dock and in the machine world all had the same blandness, similarly all the kung-fu business that nominally was three-d. Where the first one introduced the `bullet-time' notion of exploring space, we have nothing interesting like that here.Only in the last ten minutes - the fight in the rain - is it spatially engaging. But by that time the story is worn out.The matter of cosmology is the most interesting and challenging of the three, because this is where you intend to enmesh the lives of your viewers with your fiction. It is a cheap trick compared to the old fashioned values of narrative, but interesting as hell in what works. You have to have demigods warring; you have to have love (and similar `human' foibles) as assets; you have to have light and evil; every event affects the very future of the world. You have to slowly reveal higher and higher levels of plotters and counterplottering deities.Lucas was able to postpone judgment on `Star Wars' until the sixth movie. Tolkein had already conquered the major problems before the LOTR movies were conceived, so they had a far lessor challenge. Harry Potter's cosmology never presumes to the scope of religion and always registers as adolescent, so they can even be humorous.
To my mind - as a reader of classic science fiction - the first film promised but this third film just lacked the imagination it needed to build a cosmology worth criticizing.Essie Davis was appealing and real, far more convincing as a human than the women tossed into this mess to carry various stereotypes.

Cast Away," Pathos is not Deep, but The Nesting Is
","(Spoilers herein.)I write this on opening day for this film, while it is still an event. Lots of people are excited, but when significant talent comes close to creating something important, I use a higher standard. There are some fine elements and moments in this film, but the total disappoints.The best two moments are the fire creation sequence, and the plane crash. The firemaking episode is the center of the film as I note below. The plane crash is as harrowing as it gets (speaking as one who was touched by such an event) and supplants the equally person-centered crash in `Fearless.'Scene-wise, the most unsuccessful episode is near the beginning when Hanks gives a motivational speech to Muscovites about the importance of time. His good guy persona keeps him from convincing here. Contrast this to a similar but crackling speech by Alec Baldwin in `Glengary Glen Ross.' I blame Zemeckis for this, exhibiting his execrable `What Lies Beneath' as proof. It was filmed between the first and second halves of `Castaway.' He just doesn't understand global scope - all his skills are local.My disappointment has to do with the point of the film. A biting existential angst is eschewed for a more desperate pathos, in order to lower the risk of the film I suppose. But what's left is empty. There's a small nobility in leaving the old girlfriend to her husband but this only incidental. John Sayles' `Limbo' used the same story to much better effect because he wasn't so namby-pamby about despair.On the other hand, what's remarkable about this film is the way it is structured: it has a many-tiered frame. Often a film is bracketed as a story (`The Princess Bride ` comes to mind), but scriptwriters use all sorts of brackets and here pull out all the stops. It is an elegant structure.The obvious bracket is the package. We see it being picked up from a pretty (we find out) Texas artist in the opening shots. She paints a distinctive winged logo on the box. This box is either returned by the adulterous husband, or a similar box is sent in reply. It appears on the island, inspires Hanks, and is returned at the end of the film, presaging a possible new life. The content of the box, created by an artist, is metaphorically the film.But there are more brackets, both outside and inside of this one.Inside, we have the bracket of the `outside' world, from which he comes to the island and to whence he returns. This is primarily a sound bracket, contrasting the sounds of ships and jets to those of nature. And within that, we have the creation of Wilson by Hanks, just as the screenwriter creates Hanks' character. Wilson is the star, truly the one being with no life, no future. His creation (with fire) is a clue that Hanks will get some distance on his own life. I suspect that much of Wilson is on the editroom floor when the decision was made to tone down from despairing angst to just pathos. Too bad.(Another internal bracket is more of a small plot symmetry. Hanks confronts a painful tooth (`truth' since Lewis Carroll). His dentist is Spaulding (mirrors Wilson as alterego) is on the `outside' (mirroring location) and sets up his exgirlfriend's husband (mirroring relationship). Its clumsy as it is, and probably had a less film-schoolish feel in the original script.)
Outside, we have more brackets too. The film leverages Hanks' role in real life as everyman by setting it at Christmas, and inviting the Christmas audience in. We literally bracket the film with our own lives, a point I'm sure the writer wanted to make.Two other virtual exterior brackets are worth noting. The `Imagemovers' production company is a very clever conception, entirely congruent with the use Fedex is put here as the vehicle for connection. Also, a much overlooked element of movies is the font design of the titles. This film is very clear about titles; there is no visual prelude or underlude. You have the titles, then the action, then the titles again on black.Font design is a non-trivial art. Tied up in the creation of display fonts is a deep hardwiring in the brain about communication, eons deeper than cinematic conventions. I know that extraordinary effort often goes into the design of fonts for major films, as the effect is extremely powerful, albeit subliminal. If you get a chance to notice this font, it is an ambiguous design, half in the calligraphic world (human, nature, free) and half in the chiseled world (civilized, formal, self-aware). But the blurring switches from side to side for each character. An apt bracket.Hanks understood all this nesting, I'm sure. I wish he hadn't squandered the opportunity. But because he performs with such commitment as an actor, we'r e prone to forgive him for his lack of courage as a producer. With `Joe vs the Volcano' in his past, he should have been more adventuresome in commissioning the script.",Null,5,12,24 December 2000

Ideally it goes another place after it has established you, but it has to establish a place, a form, a tone.MIT is a place worth being taken to.

Cold Mountain," The Seed Has a Job, The Bird Has a Job, Bad Movies Have a Job
","Spoilers herein.Bulwer-Lytton is often parodied for his long, tortuous sentences. But he was more influential in inventing a specific form of the novel, a usually lowbrow form in its modern incarnations. This form is based on the journey of a man to reunite with his love, someone who he has only slightly seen but was 'fated' to love. Usually there is a class disparity. The passion is enhanced by the stress of uncomfortable world events which test both lovers. The woman is placed in situations where she discovers nature and the man has a grueling, episodic journey. The episodes in the Lytton originals were based on the esoteric philosophy of the time and included at least one Magus and one siren.Mark Twain 'Americanized' this form in 'Huck Finn,' where the sex was removed and replaced with something more abstract. I mention this because Philip Seymour Hoffman's character is so clearly based on the actor from Huck Finn. It is the only well situated work -- acting that knows what it is and where it came from -- in this film.George Lucas took a cinematic form of Twain's model as colored by westerns and placed it in a mystical context. I bring this up because our goat lady is so clearly derived from Yoda. It is so different from Hoffman's self-awareness it jar-jars.One of the two sirens in this case is Natalie Portman -- also from 'Star Wars' -- whose acting lessons are beginning to take. But we have yet a third directorial stance: more direct and straight. It almost seems that each actor was able to decide what their movie was to be like.Lytton's form, or Twain's or Lucas' can work if there is a constancy, if there is a continuous spinning of the threads that make the fabric of the world we will momentarily inhabit. Minghella's interest is elsewhere, in a mistaken trust in the power of characters. He would have failed by himself, but we can blame all this on the Harry Cohen of the day: Harvey Weinstein. He's not the _most_ barbaric mind in Hollywood, but probably the most powerful barbarian there. His blunt interest in chasing the Oscars is what shows, and why he screwed around so much with the narrative and directorial stance.Fortunately, no one died for this misadventure, but the now intelligent Ms Kidman is surely hurt as she is forced to redo her 'Far and Away' faces.Ted's evaluation: 2 of 3 -- has some interesting elements",Null,9,18,2 January 2004
Kung Fu Panda 2," Seeing Inside
","I've been in China for a month, discovering calligraphic cinematic principles. I had a chance to see this film while there and note two remarkable aspects.The first is that while this is wholly an American film in its obsession with fathers, character sculpting and pace, it is set in China. Because image in China of China is so tightly controlled, and because the Chinese narrative is carried by outward facing youth and commerce, films such as these build the national narrative as surely as Zhong's efforts. But what is this film about? The attempt to rule China by force, eliminating the noble nature of the people, here denoted by Kung Fu. (Yes, I know real kung fu has little to do with martial arts, and that the current focus is because temples had to invent something to sell in order to survive. Real kung fu is supposedly the soul of the Tao.)Though I happened to see this in the most privileged area of Shanghai, Xin Tian Di, I think most of the audience saw it as I did, a successful struggle against tyranny. Shanghai is a city of 22 million. Perhaps a half a million are the privileged, but as much as 75% of the people just in this city are immigrants no different than those exploited in New York 100 years ago. They have no rights. They don't speak the local language.IMDb is blocked in China, presumably because it did not excise films about Tibet. A ticket to 'Panda' is expensive, though pirated DVDs are a cheap as 25 cents, so possibly only a few hundred million people will see this in China. The first of this franchise was a surprise hit in China, especially among the young college educated. I wonder if this will contribute to democratic action, or simply be another American amusement. The other remarkable thing was the explicit use of what I call Ted's Law. This law is my observation that when a new narrative layer is explicitly inserted in a film, it is placed exactly one step further on the distance of between reality and the main narrative of the film. So for instance 'Death to Smoochy' is a film with a certain center of abstraction. It internally features a TeeVee show which occupies its own conceptual space. In all the ways that the film is abstracted, this is abstracted one more step as far, so that we are fooled into placing ourself in the movie as if it is reality. This principle is used in most films, but I really like it when it is done purely cinematically. Here, we have a three-d animated world that we are supposed to enter. Within that world are suppressed memories of our hero, an event where his tribe was killed in a Herodian massacre. The story, such as it has a human dimension, is about our panda encountering this inner narrative. It is portrayed as an inner cartoon, one that uses crude, two-dimensional animation. Ted's law is obvious. But this is so common that it would be unremarkable where it not for a halfstep back from that cartoon abstraction.The film starts with a shadow puppet play, of the sort that any Chinese film-goer will know from Zhang's 'To Live,' (and referenced by Scorcese). It is presented as a two-dimensional cartoon as well, but it isn't until an hour into the film that we are allowed to register it against the 'suppressed memory' fold. So we have the distance between us and the film. We have the distance between us and the original segment of the film as a puppet show prologue. And we have the distance between the main film and inner memory of the bear. When that appears, the original puppet show fold is redefined to be placed midway between those two as an example of another phenomenon I study: dynamic reinterpretation.Yeah, I know this is not a serious film. But that doesn't mean that serious and deep craft is not applied in the investment, and this example is remarkable. To see how well it is pulled off, consider two characteristics of the peacock in his three incarnations: the way his neck moves and the red and white pattern on his tail.Angeline Jolie continues her journey is redefining the strength of women.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,5,10,6 June 2011
American Psycho," Referential Wrappers for Dummies
","Spoilers herein.I disliked this movie, not because it is intelligent but because it is a sophomoric bleaching of a powerful idea. That idea is that the FORM of the narrative should convey the MEANING of the story. In its simplest forms (Faulkner, Kafka) it deals with madness and what has come to be called the surreal. More subtle exercises in Joyce and Nabokov extend that to an emotional breadth and archetypal depth. But that results in hard work for the reader, so from time to time, lesser novelists recycle the idea at the high school level so that a larger and lazier readership can 'get' it.Films have a harder time with this problem, because they work with a more constrained imagination, and have a tighter integration with societal semiotics. Still, we have some intelligent work with the idea. Greenaway is my own favorite, who incidentally doesn't shy away from the edge of violence as is done here. (Why? To preserve the comic stance? If so, the filmmaker is unwittingly like the society she portrays.).One branch of the possibility of such 'wrapped' films focuses on the actor, incidentally playing a character. That's the model attempted here. More mainstream recent film examples of how this is managed well are 'Sweet and Lowdown' and 'The Pledge.' The former creates a faux documentary narrator who imagines the subject. In this instance, the central actor pulls all the strings. A similar dynamic occurs with 'Pledge' where the wrapper is within the story (excluding the narrator). Easier to read.A related problem is that Harron mistakes style in the costumes and actor's bearing for cinematic style. Really thin. This film is as lowbrow as 'Being John Malkovich,' cleverness for dummies. 'Fight Club' was more artful and intelligent, though it wasted its opportunity. The only intriguing element here is the probably unintended notion of Dafoe as an imagined Moriarty. This isn't taken anywhere, but Dafoe does have a haunting presence independent of this simple effort.",Null,13,28,1 March 2001
Little Miss Sunshine," Freaks
","Its a simple strategy. Introduce us to some damaged folks, folks that seem way beyond what we would accept. Then spend some time with them in such a way that we get to know them. Then at the end, compare them to 'ordinary' people so as to trick us into grounding ourselves in the 'weirdos.' Along the way, give us quirky vignettes, alternately endearing and humorous.This complies in gentle ways, following the template so closely it might have been designed by a committee. This is where successful independent films are now, I guess. Sad.In normal circumstances, I'd just relax and go along for the ride, like I did for, say 'Miss Congeniality.' But there's a nagging reminder that something here isn't fair.The denouement of the story  the place where we actually see the rest of the world  is a kiddie beauty pageant. This is the place where all the talk about dividing the world into winners and losers is embossed on us. What we see are horrible little people, absolutely revolting freaks. Its a truly damning thing. And it works as intended. We immediately realize where our own lives are centered  or where we would like them to be.But look closer. What we are revolted about is the cult of little-girl-cuteness. It isn't as deep a cult in the US as it is in Japan, St Petersberg or Thailand. But it is in movies here and essentially everywhere. We are charmed by girls. Its one of the most reliable parts of the cinematic vocabulary. I saw this film paired with 'Forbidden Games,' which is a truly wonderful experience.So here we are given a show that celebrates the cuteness of little girls and we are repulsed. But what have we been watching for over an hour? A family disaster that revolves around the cuteness of our little girl. Its a relentless cuteness show, which we allow in part because we know our actress has been made less 'pretty' by over-sized glasses (another movie shortcut) and a prosthetic belly. But its cute that we are sold. So in the damning at the end, I damned myself and felt dirty coming out. Movies do this a lot, especially teen movies that poke fun at teen humor and then have all the jokes dependent on that same humor. More clever ones do it with heavier subjects. 'American Psycho.'But this is just too much. The writers give us an escape hatch. We can pretend it isn't cuteness and innocent charm, but a more prurient interest we are damning. The contestants we see do try to look sexy and our girl's routine is targeted at blowing that up. So we can pretend it is sex that is the reversal. But be honest. It isn't.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",Null,68,128,15 September 2006
North by Northwest," Hasn't Aged Well
","Hitchcock was likely a genius in his day, and many of his films extraordinary. But at least this one has aged poorly. I was prompted to revisit it because I'm making my own Shakespeare film festival, and the title of this ostensibly comes from Hamlet. He is mad north by northwest as a ruse. There is nothing remotely as sophisticated here.What this film has going for it is Grant's suave composure in adversity, which must have been rare 40 years ago. But this has been played to death in recent decades.What it has against it:--the sets, even the monument are obviously fake junk--the story is unbelieveable. This is normal in film, but in this case there are assumptions about the cold war which even in historic context seem offensive.--there are huge logic holes: for instance the bad guys are spies who on the one hand must hide microfilm in a statue, but at the same time fly their escape plane into one of the most popular national parks!--Eva just isn't that charming, and what's up with her motivation? She's a prostitute that turned good at risk to her life because of patriotism?--If Grant is to be killed, why lure him to a remote location so he can be run down by a biplane? Why does the plane run into the gas truck?--If the spy is so smart, why kidnap Grant and take him to a house illegally borrowed from the head of Intepol? Recall that they knew (or thought they did) that Grant knew who he really was, and they intended to kill him anyway. Why the charade?--Hitchcock was a clever user of the camera, with scenes well framed. But that was in the era of largely stationary cameras. A moving camera was so rare as to have been then a noticable effect. Not so today. Hitchcock's camera is just plain primitive now.--Grant was already an old man. His curvature of the spine is noticeable as well as his stiff gait.--Any tension felt by prior generations was lost on me, and I'm a pretty old guy myself!Lord Edward Bulwar Lytton was highly regarded in his day too.

","Timing is everything.I saw this in a stressed state, looking for escape. I saw it in a grand old theater with large, excellently tuned equipment. I saw it not knowing anything at all about it.And I loved it.Yes, I know people do not like Nic Cage. And I know many were put off by the genre- synthesizing approach. But I found it engaging, narratively and visually. Spooky as getout in places. When punctuation was least expected (in three places) and from three unexpected sources, the crashes were extraordinary. The first one -- a plane crash -- was more terrifying to me than the recurring nightmare from 'Fearless.' It isn't as cinematically impressive as the best complex long shots, but it was as amazing as it gets in a big budget production. The fact that there are no cuts makes the thing absolutely real.There is a spaceship. Yes, it is an ET/Third Kind Encounter sort of ending, framed enough differently to matter and goof on Spielberg. But the stunning thing was the design of the thing. Its marvelous, absolutely new and deserving of wonder. The end is a combination of 'The Fountain,' 'The Fall,' 'The Holy Mountain' and a Chinese film about a princess whose name I forget. I am sure a reader will supply it. I thought it risky in the context but successful. The game here is one of moving not from one plot point to another, but one established location in genres to another. It takes us out of the movie world to skip among such well rooted movie types so seamlessly. They have to be familiar to work.Its not hackneyed at all, using and escaping the ordinary.I recommend this, but only if you can see it loud and big, and only if you have a couple decades of being profoundly influenced by the films this references.The title is apt.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,21,33,15 April 2009
Doctor Zhivago," Shoot the Commander
","This is a pretty complicated movie. Oh, it isn't complicated in itself, in fact it is maddeningly trite a scandalous reduction of book that had many depths. Where Pasternak mapped personal challenges to great sweeps of society, where he set a contrast between humanity and 'shared story,' where he wove a complicated, rich notion of love, where he had deep self-reference in the power of the words of the story and the poems in the story....All this is taken away by Lean and Bolt. What we get is the book that would have been written (and movie made) if it had been made by a soulless filmmaker under a Soviet commissar. Sure, the pictures are lovely, but they have no relationship to the humans in them. In fact, quiet the opposite is the case: everything is so artificially framed spatially and temporally that we know that none of this is the beauty the world presents and we discover: this is fabricated beauty, the kind that isn't embodied. Its the kind that you can watch and like, eyes engaged. But it is not what you can digest into your life and take to your partner.But the fact that it is so inhuman and uncomplex is what to a viewer makes it incredibly complex and in the end possibly reregisters the humanity in us. First the world. Lean is in the tradition of the British empire; that's how his world is constituted. 'Lawrence' worked, because it... Well, it was about impressing a British sense on odd desert creatures, a storyform that even today (especially today) that ill fits. It had as its focus, a man bridging the stories, nay, oscillating in a great space between the two and also between self and nature, challenge and acceptance, wisdom and intuition. 'Lawrence,' in other words, as a story about these manystories being fit into a dull mold, fit Lean's story, so he could tell it.So when we watch this, we see several things. First is the novel behind this that is something of a masterpiece of interwoven destinies, and hence multiple narrative nodes corresponding to the shifting moral environments. Second is the movie, a collection of poses with pop music. Third is the movie that might have been: Brando as the manipulator, O'Toole as the writer within striving toward human embodiment, Tarkovsky as the director showing his truly revolutionary dreamstyle, and (don't laugh) Sophia Loren as the lover beyond love. The screenwriter? Why Nabokov of course.Some other movies: the one about Christie, considered in the day a beauty. In retrospect, two things take away. Then, the notion of beauty was in the eyes, hence her lips were erased in fleshcolored makeup. Today, acting beautiful is all about lips, and actresses who know how to use them. Also, her hair is glued together. Strange how these things change and the reference for fantasy shifts. But Christie really is an intelligent woman and in some situations and intelligent actress. Not here, Lean wouldn't allow it, but at least we have Sarah Polley out of the deal.Its a strange situation. Lean has his 'Lawrence' on my list of films you must see. But the rest just isn't worth much. I'll give him this: he uses trains more forcefully and with more agency than anyone else ever has. And here too. One actor is good in spite of Lean. Watch an early Klaus Kinski magnetize the space around him. And imagine his future after he leaves the train and the pressgang, going on to give us two of the most amazing films in history.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",Null,7,12,19 August 2007
U-571," Real Boats but not Real Navy
","I sometimes am lucky in matching my film experience to the audience I share it with, and this was such a case. I live near Norfolk, the world's largest collection of Navy people, and the heaviest concentration of US WWII submariners.I saw this on opening day, the heavy show (7:30) with the audience packed with young and old Navy. And I have to say, the film didn't work. The models were good, the explosions and all the underwater work nicely done. The boat, at least the US boat, was accurate, and the local paper reports that folks here helped with the specifications.But these actors didn't seem like sailors, never remotely, and the mismatch was pretty obvious in that audience. Maybe Keitel could pull off a chief with better direction, but not here. And McConaughey and Bon Jovi could never reach believability. Submariners are clubby, superstitious and smelly. Submarines, especially the old boats, are confining. Das Boot gave us a feel for the closeness and the terror, and the high mental level of underwater warfare. This movie misses. It takes more than shaking the camera.I have some familiarity with the crypto world. That dimension is spooky and could have been woven into the story to better effect. Instead we have a simple grab for an object. You may want to see this for the underwater effects, but otherwise, it is a miss.",Null,2,5,21 April 2000
The Shining," Battery's Out, Finger's Dead
","This movie has not aged well. Kubrick uses a very old-fashioned camera stance and the dialog is often stagey back-and-forth medium head shots.Scatman is apt, but Kubrick asks Jack to be more external, and that's dangerous with his unchecked exuberance. Duvall needs pumping up.The problem is an old one, and one Kubrick knows. Successful storytelling is bound by its media, so a successful print story can be only a starting point for cinematic narrative. He clearly believes it best when a character or device is external, like Hal, the spirit here, or Hitchcock's mcguffin. His handling of the unseen contrasted with and contained in huge interiors is his strategy and it may have worked better when the film was new. But its just too tame now.What's very nice is the selfreference. It is another piece of an obsessed storytelling about an obsessed writer, engaged in creating a story.I gave this film extra points because it tried to use architecture well. But it did a poor job. Part of this is the unimaginative camera eye. But even a better eye couldn't have exploited the set well. If you want the set to be a character, you need to give it soul, and incorporate the viewer's eye into the form. Welles knew how. Why didn't Kubrick?",Null,12,29,25 November 2000

Wanted," Shoots Itself in the Head
","There's a trend in these big budget action moves to try and support the thing with hefty story components: profundity, explorations of fate and power (often via revealed conspiracies). We come to expect this, and I believe have rather clear thresholds about what works. I think when you try to these ambitious story arcs, you have to pay attention to these thresholds. For all its faults, the 'Matrix' films impose style on a robust enough narrative. You have to have a narrative.Here, we have a story line: young nerd with hidden powers revenges his father, only to discover deceit, then he takes revenge on the deceivers. That could have worked, if it had been supported. It has before, right? There's all sorts of meta-noir possibility here: the ordinary man picked out and placed in a situation long since determined. The idea of death being visited on people, directed from supernatural sources by seemingly supernatural agents. The idea of fate weaving in lives and so on. The cinematic ideas of a man whose vision 'slows things down,' and as narrator for us in voice and sight.But its all given short shrift here. We cannot rely on this narrative to carry us. Hitchock's wife was in charge of vetting scripts for this property of robustness and I believe that the threshold of what can accept in speculative noir was discovered or defined by her. This fails. Which basically leaves us with some very energetic and brutal stylizations within which we can encounter Angeline. I suppose that because of these roles, she is the most bankable actress in the world. I do think she knows how to do this. In 'Smith' she drove the story simply with her attitude. In Tomb Raider 1, I think she successfully defined this persona, a confident sexual being who could match any male film presence. That's what this is all about.She actually does support that well enough in the early chase scene where its her movie. But then we have to start relying on the narrative to move us along, and we get stuck with Morgan Freeman's silliness. She simply becomes a watcher with nothing to do. She cannot carry it off because there's nothing to fill, no movement to get behind.And so much of it fights itself. There's a hint of a sexual relationship, but its random. There's a 'training' session that makes no sense at all and seemingly is inserted only to film brutality. There's much made of curved bullet paths. Is this a supernatural talent, or special bullet designs, or something to do with spin while shooting?But, you know, I could have tolerated the whole thing, all the rats, the predictability, the incoherence. Until the very end where our transformed wimp looks directly at us and challenges us with something so remarkably 'real' that it subverts the whole fragile fantasy, the implied humor. It was so disturbing, I credit that encounter as all the power of the film. It was dumb, blunt and repellent.

Salt," Salting the Mines
","Two things are of interest to me here.One is the growing demand we have for plot twists. We expect to be presented with the unexpected. I think this is a direct evolution from how the detective story entered the film vocabulary. In its pure form, it is an engagement of discovery with the viewer, usually in collaboration with an on screen character. We might 'solve' the puzzle by creating the narrative before the film does.This is a 'fold' that engages the viewer more intensely than otherwise, simply because of the investment. Over time, a branch appeared where the viewer was not expected to guess. Clues and red herrings ceased to be placed. The game was not played. The enjoyment of the movie was in creating a baffling set of facts that were 'explained' at the end. Our thrill comes from the pleasure of making sense out of the nonsensical. This branch has many more examples than the more directly engaging one. I hesitate to say it is less intelligent, because we infuse anything with narrative depth. In this branch, the intelligence comes in being presented with more and more complex solutions. The 'explanation' at the end takes on its own mini-narrative where the initial solution is proved to be yet another level of deception.I believe this is the yearning we have to be engaged. The second interesting thing here is the obvious re-invention of gender roles. Female pop singers are pulling the center of female roles more toward the openly sexual and seductive. The action movie's response is the leather clad kickass woman. The woman on top. The sexual being that is in control. This started first, I believe, in revenge movies where the woman has been raped, so the response is justified. Then we moved into an era where women were fit into samurai-like cartoon figures. This is the scowling, leather dominatrix mode, or alternatively less realistic mode. The extreme is anime where the female is a teen girl in a magical universe where exposed body parts matter. To the best of my knowledge, we have never had a woman — acting as a real women — in this genre. By that I mean a true noir character, not someone winking at the camera. The closest we came that I remember is Geena Davis in her Renny Harlan periods, but they still were based in humor and in any case failed at the box office. However, we were all aware of Geena's Mensa status and her prior life playing flurry, sexually available characters.Only Angela could do what she has done here. I understand that the script was written for Tom Cruise and very little changed with the gender shift. Our Angel allows herself to be photographed looking unattractive. Until the very end, she is not her normal seductive self. Never in the entire thing are we aware of her body. At one point, she is effectively disguised as a man.I'm not one to pick celebrities and follow them like some follow sports teams. But I do believe that this woman carries a lot of responsibility for how a generation of girls will think of themselves. I think she did this in part because of some awareness of that archetype- bending power.And there is the challenge. Like the fundamental changes within the story where 'people' are not as we believed, the slots for people are shifted as well in the larger story in which we live.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,10,21,25 July 2010
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," The Third Layer
","I know of only three periods in Americam history when it can be said that the people as a whole, as Americans, were truly noble. Where being was more about ideas, ideals and intents than tribal exclusionism. One of these was the late sixties. If you were there in the midst of it, you would have experienced something that simply cannot be described today  a sort of group mind that was so shared and shared with better futures that is was often mistaken for spiritual. Much of that reflected and was fed by the music of the time. Folk. Rock, and that quantum edge between that often seemed perfect. So you, dear reader, may have to simply accept on trust that the music of the times, and times themselves, mattered. That's even though the artifacts have been since re-incarnated as ordinary things.Much of that ordinariness has been because of how we have reinvented the story to allow ourselves to handle the disappointment of the futures we ended up with. And a large part of that reinvention has been through movies that retell and reshape.Much of that can be laid at the feet of the slick marketeers behind what has become known as 'country' music, where the story is in the surrounding wrapper of a metastory: honesty, forthrightness, god and country, guns. (This package comes with the standard negatives: anti-gay, woman, minority, etc.)The unwitting patron saint of this particular reinvention was Johnny Cash, a poor soul swept up in his and our addictions until even after death. That's when we got a particularly revolting biography. We seemed to want it. It has true love, a successful struggle with demons, performances of music to fill in for the thin story. Grimaces and joy.It also trivialized what the music of the era was. It turned a whole social movement into a mere plot device, no different than say a Denzel Washington-coached football championship. The music didn't matter at all. It was the fame that turned lives. (Something similar happened with 'A Beautiful Mind' where the mathematics was incidental instead of what made the man mad, and along the way changes imagination in and of us all. But few people believe in math, and nearly everyone considers power in music as heavy.)Oddly, our reaction to this trivialization is not to look deeper at the real thing, but to add a third layer of abstraction that further trivializes. I must admit to laughing here and there, especially at the Dylan spoof. But I left the theater wondering if this is all we end up with from this era. Is it merely a joke now? Is this yearning and work already the same level as the fodder for 'Austin Powers?'Kids used to play with toy cars. They weren't real cars, but the play was generally along the lines of what real cars do, sometimes flying, but not as planes  only cars on air-roads. Then at some point, the cars could transform into robots and the robots themselves conveyed a simple cosmology of good and evil. Play became disembodied, and the connection with reality was lost.This is a transformer movie: three layers removed, transforming what celebrated complexity, subtlety and ambiguity into something manufactured by promoters as a battle of good and evil, and then transformed into a joke.Tom Paine dies again.

Duck Soup," Mirrors
","My earlier comment was deleted based on a complaint, presumably because it focused on the very effective antiwar message of the movie. But you can see that for yourself, so with this try let's focus on one of the two inserted comedic bits. The movie is constructed in two parts with these comedic skits tossed in. The first part is a by then conventional Marx Brothers outline written by others: a rich Dumont, a scheme, a house and theft. Songs. The other half is what they used to call madcap: the battle where all sorts of nonsensical and off- hand jokes could be pulled.By this time, the guys were already far from their Vaudeville heritage. I think their very best movies were the early ones, made in New York and based on already polished routines.But they went back to their roots in the two inserted pieces. One is a routine between two street vendors: Chico as an Italian selling peanuts and an Irish Galoot selling lemonade. It is adopted from a familiar skit and is priceless.Much more cinematic is the mirror bit. I consider this the high point in Marx humor, even though Chaplin invented the gimmick earlier. If you don't know it: all three of the performing brothers are made up like Groucho (who himself is made up). Two of them and later the third, mirror each other in a doorway which used to have a mirror.There is a lead, trying to trick the other into revealing that he is not a reflection. The delicacy of how this develops is what makes it a masterpiece. There's some simple strutting and fake outs. But when they get to the hats what they do becomes very clever indeed. It hearkens back to the vendor hatswitching but engages the audience in a way only possible in cinema.One comes out with a white hat behind his back and the other with a black which we see but his reflection doesn't. When the lead rushes to put on his white hat, his reflection miraculously has a white hat too and he points to the lead as if he were us. Its possibly the cleverest comic fold in film history.Later, of course, they start to reach across into each other's space. Good performers, especially good comics understand this notion of comic space and the problems of how to get the audience into it.If only illness hadn't messed up this act. The best comedy comes from the amount of actor's tears before the performance; the best tragedy comes from the fewest.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,4,12,1 January 2005
Apocalypse Now," The War for your Soul
","Spoilers herein.Much has been made of the personal risks taken by this filmmaker and crew, and the mapping to the metaphor of war:Coppola, already rich and famous for the lush but pointless `Godfather' films, reaches into his soul and decides to risk it to do something important. He deliberately chooses Conrad's metaphor of personal journey, and creates a multi-layered structure: the sense of Man in society; the `reason' of War, colonial wars and the specifics of Vietnam; the meeting of darkness of self at the end of the hero's journey; and at the lowest layer, Coppola's own quest for import as an artist.When I saw this over a couple decades back, I thought it a failure: earnestness does not equal art; commitment does not deliver skill; Italian passion outraces German nihilism.But now, with the `restored' footage, I have a completely different take. I still think it a failure overall, but with some powerful images. As with the Doors, its aspirations were too large for the ability, the vision too grand for the reach. But now with the passage of time, the metaphor has had a polar switch.Twenty years ago, the War was a simple affair: confusing at the bristles, jaded selfishness at the handle. With the passage of time as we learn more, the War has `become' incredibly more complex and unfathomable. Now with the film: it started life as huge, unfocused mess. Over a long period, with radical paring and the addition of a very competent framework of sound, something resulted. Unfocused still, but powerful enough to engage. Over time and repeated viewings, this work has been overgrown by personal probings, and integrated into the imaginative landscape like an incompetent building becoming a fond element of the cityscape. So as the war becomes less pegged in our minds, this film becomes more comprehensible, more whole.With repeated personal handling, this film has become `true.' Think of this: it now has such a clear center that the filmmaker can `enhance' that message. It is now so coherent, it begs for addition. And the three main additions are so, so very apt and self-referential:-- The French plantation takes its reason to be from the mere fact that it has been. That is precisely what this film has become: a colonizer of our minds that now makes its own sense to be there.-- The playmates. Sex -- even exploitative sex -- domesticates.
-- The extra exposure of Brando. Here was a tiger, a man whose presence tore through our minds, who changed the world, who mesmerized. He went down his own personal river before this film and was defeated. Here he shows up in a character who is precisely the actor (with a wildeyed acolyte Hopper similarly spanning fiction and reality). Wasn't clear when the film was new, but is now. These are not the winners we see, but the losers. The horror.To prepare for this redux, I watched the three `Wallace and Gromit' films. Here also was a personal vision, explored at first with extreme commitment, at high cost in the face of detractors. Working by himself for 7 years produced the first film. It was shockingly weird. The second (and probably the best) was a low-budget collaboration with one other monk. As with `Apocalypse,' this film invented itself, by charm insinuated itself into the familiar as if God had put it there all along. Then by the third film, with scores of people, the magic is transformed to cultural momentum.But there is hope: `Apocalypse' hangs on the War, and though that metaphoric connection is severed, it still stays on the shelf we first placed it: as a war movie. And there are other war movies. And since films are seldom about reality and instead about other films, we can rely on others to give us distance from this foreign invader. Two very much more skilled filmmakers in particular: Kubrick and Malick. Rely on them.",Null,16,28,16 January 2002
Disturbia," Rear End Window
","I went to see this because of the advertised, 'Rear Window.'That film was an amazing experience for me. Hitchcock can be said to have invented the curious camera, the camera that moves and explores as if it were a character. It probes, it withdraws, it discovers. It 'finds' the story. It only does in some of his films. Actually, for most of his career, he was merely a highly skilled craftsman. But then he developed this idea. With 'Rear Window' he turned it all upside down. The camera could explore: the world had to be a stage that was composed before and for the camera.Its frozen noir. That film and 'Touch of Evil' ended the ordinary noir period. Since then we can only reference it.Just because it is a kiddie film didn't phase me. These sometimes have the cleverest nuances, the most oblique perspectives.But oh, not here, not here. There's the slightest nod to 'Rear Window,' updated via 'Blair Witch' to have the film within be a genuine film.What we have instead is one of those irrelevant things about teen remoteness and improbable companionship. Onto that is spliced a modern horror bit, with a cabbage patch Hannibal. And only onto that dog's mess do we have the remnant of the fixed pane.Odd, because the serial killer notion often finds its way into films with a strong story, and this is embedded as a movie within, often a counter-noir where the killer and his opposite fight for control over fate, the shape of fate.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",Null,8,15,6 May 2007
The Patriot," Unpatriotic
","In reviewing my over 700 IMDb comments, I discovered that a couple had been deleted after over a year. One of these is a comment on 'The Patriot.' This is my replacement.I believe that film influences one's notion of who they are more strongly than any other public art. And that the notion of self is more affected in terms of nationality than anything else.So although I respect artistic freedom, especially in cinema, we as viewers have to call major players to account when they tromp all over what it means to be American. This film is the worst example I know of distorting history to promote a view of Americans that has more to do with market forces than what is true and right.(Fill in here the real history of South Carolina as a member of the U. S. from then to now, based on your own research.)Mel Gibson is to blame. You would think that after generating a billion dollars in the two years around this film, he would want to spend some of that goodwill on responsible citizenship in his adopted country. Instead, what we get is 'Braveheart' presented as history. It was fine in Braveheart to just make things up -- that was a mythical time and a relatively magical place. Creating a saintly giant is just good storytelling. But recent history is something else. History that changes the basic equations that defined the nation is something else. Tinkering with the notions of democratic self-determinism and collective deliberation is something else, especially when replaced by personal, uncontrolled vigilantism.Worse, this defines not only what we think of ourselves, but what others think of us: violent thugs who react without limit based on personal vendetta. The director is the guy who the previous year marketed a picture ('Independence Day') purely on how funny it would be to blow up the White House and Empire State Building.Mel, you should be ashamed.

Van Helsing," Redheaded Absinthed Alice
","Spoilers herein.This is the best summer action film I think I have ever seen. There is a primary reason and several secondary ones.The primary attraction is that these things are literally thrill rides. And in film today, the thrills come from how the camera moves, period. The state of the art in this regard has matured even in the last year as they've worked out how to sync virtual and real items with camera paths that are physically impossible.Unlike the disastrous `Spiderman,' this camera dances with extreme energy. Notice how those camera paths are registered. We see the motions in the flight paths of the vampires: smooth swoop, hold, swoop in a slightly different direction as if they have discovered something, then end with a radical curve and redirection.Then we experience that same flight pattern ourselves, subliminally making us the vampires. The by now close relationship between Sommers and his chief editor allow this to push, push, push energy, the energy of observation.But that's not all I like. While the eye is in motion, the characters are in motion as well in the ordinary sense. But all the main characters are morphing, a different kind of motion. And as the movie progresses, we are taken through different films, yet another kind of motion of sight: Indiana Jones, Nosferatu, Gremlins 2, Star Wars, James Bond, Stagecoach, Alien, Eyes Wide Shut (in Budapest!) even esoterica like Spacehunter and Hudson Hawk. And of course in very literal ways, the Universal classics.Every character transmutes except Kate, who is more of a tattoo here than a character. Her leather corset produces a waist not quite as small as Nichole Kidman's in Portrait of a Lady, but remarkable in any case.I keep a database of films that employ absinthe. This one revolves around absinthe: the monster's heart and blood is absinthe and the whole tale can be cast as an absinthe vision (as was Moulin Rouge). Kate and Huge drink absinthe found in the windmill (as also in Moulin) and the story turns.And another database on uses of the Alice in Wonderland metaphor, and another on architectural fireworks, and yet another on vision in redheads, all of which are in the fashion now. All appear here in strength.It is a tradition that the strongest vampire wife of the three is the redhead and that she subliminally controls the entire scenario through sex. Stoker implied as much at the beginning and it is that redhead wife who captures and dooms Van Helsing in the book.   This redhead is the hidden centerpiece of the film as well as its vision. It features the amazing Elena Anaya who was the hidden motivator in the very best folded Alice story: Sex and Lucia, and also in Talk to Her which was similarly folded and depended on her motivation (as Eve in that case).My only criticism of this is that the winged versions were Republicanized, sexless. A little Jess Franco-like Spanish sexual honesty would have gone a long way here.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,8,15,19 May 2004
Ender's Game," Internals Revealed
","I do dimly recall the first couple books of the series. They were engagingly written. But more importantly, they used a device that probably won't work today.The books were powerful because they focused on Ender's internal mind. The second book folded this into Ender's own book a what it wrought. A very clever structure. The first book was imagined second, and had to use a different folding device. The solution was games.This wouldn't work today because games have become more prescriptive and in the world. In the eighties, they were vastly more abstract, closer to the imagination than to furniture. See, the thing is that winds of the mind are ephemeral. You have to describe something else to convey the shape of them. This is why, for example, something as invisible as love is conveyed through stories of war or political upheaval. Card's war was only an excuse for the exclusive focus on war gaming, which could stand in and illuminate his internal emotional forces. These were suitably simplified for a teen audience, so the match could be well made. But in the book, the genius is that reader invented what the games looked like, being a cocreater of the world. The pathway through the games then segued to a pathway for the alien creature. Not sure why so many of these alien creatures are insect- like. The movie has most of the same story, but none of this folding. The war is real. The games are as real as the real world (with one exception). So what we are stuck with is having to get Ender's emotions from the face of a weak child actor.Nothing to say about Harrison Ford. He has a rough enough life.",Null,11,16,27 March 2014
The White Ribbon," Stiffed Lessening
","This is truly beautiful, not in the way that Bergman's Sven Nykvist made beautiful silver insertions into loneliness, but as pure, soulless visions of soulless people and their children being ripped. Haneke has famously 'explained' this movie as depicting the oppressive fog on the land which generically produces twisted, homicidal societies. I wish he had kept his mouth shut because that much is obvious as a background.What is more interesting is who Haneke has revealed himself to be, and what he thinks of us as viewers. I've always felt uncomfortable with his films, not because they have an intended unsettling effect (that makes you 'examine' self), but because they make interestingly flawed assumptions about me and how to get to me. Those flaws are fascinating and far, far more engaging and disturbing than the events depicted.In this case, as with many of Herzog's films, the very thing that is being revealed to be destructive is built into the fabric of the thing and the contract with the filmmaker we are forced into complying with. Simple, reductionist morality? Obsessively bleak vision? Condescending view of natural emotions and passions? Yes, yes, yes, both in what we have and how we have it. 'Cache' was at least cleverly constructed, just as this is wonderfully framed. But the man is just too, well too Austrian.There are several mysteries in this story, cleverly not closed. The loud implication is that the children were behind many of the events. This fits the film's intent, as the filmmaker has patiently told us in interviews that these children become the Nazis he is beholden to understand. But much more interesting is a different solution to the mysteries, surely subconsciously placed.Our narrator is the village schoolmaster. He is in a unique position, the only institutionally allowed connection between the children and the adults. He alone has anything remotely like honest love. He uniquely is untouched by the disasters. He is also our narrator, a role we are reminded of throughout. He also tells us at the beginning that what he will tell us is partly lies, partly truth. No doubt, Haneke identifies with this storyteller and has hidden truths about himself just as our teacher has.Look at this closely and you may interpret as I did the second time around. I think the teacher is a plausible culprit, wholly unintended by the filmmaker and hiding his worst tendencies just as the filmmaker has.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,11,29,13 September 2010
Monsters vs. Aliens," Bodily Presents
","This comment is on the Imax 3D version.I'm aware, when I watch movies, of what the scale of the narrative is that I am plugged into.Often these days, its the short for narrative. Eddie Murphy puts on a fat suit and hilarity ensues. Yokels discover oil and come to Beverly Hills. Girl has problems with mom. All the action on the screen is episodic around this simple core.Its what I call 'long form' that interests me. You enter a world with cosmic machinery rich enough to match the one you live in. Things actually happen and change. There is overlap between the worlds themselves and this can matter in how you change and grow.But there is a layer above this, one that threads through movies and often is the only real narrative I can get. In the lowest form, this is anchored on celebrity, so for instance we can follow the story of Mel Gibson from energetic Australian-style actor, through discovering his intellectual limits, making a successful Weil copy and devolving into a caricature.More interesting is the journey of filmmakers, even film ideas. A variety along these lines is the metastory of animation studios. We have the ennobling story of Pixar with all sorts of interesting dimensions, and contrasted with that, the comparatively second rate Dreamworks Animation. Its actually a pretty interesting story to follow, because it has tragedy, desperation, huge risks. It has some scheming — for instance with the 'Ants' movie designed to cripple 'Bugs Life.' Its particularly interesting when they try to leapfrog Pixar.They tried with 'Shreck' and succeeded — at least so far as tickets — by engineering the humor and pathos because they just cannot seen to engineer story like Pixar can. Its an organizational thing I believe; committees cannot make real stories.Here they try something else and the results are pretty shocking to this observer. I think something important has happened. For this, you have to understand Pixar's two competitive advantages. One is the story engineering already mentioned. A second more cinematically interesting is the exploitation of their three-dimensional modeling to give us a new way of cinematically dealing with space, specifically in the way the camera is placed and moves.So what do Marshall-Kennedy do if they want to leapfrog Pixar? They surely cannot beat them on their own ground. Well, they try sex and three D and bury it. I am sure that what is going on here is all the usual stuff, that they had teams for story and gags and pacing and such. But the core experiment was in how to work with sex. By this, I mean not the 'in your face' stuff of beer ads, but the soft familiarity of a sexual presence in the room. I can even tell you something about the age of the guy in charge of this team, knowing the effect that the 'Attack of the 50 Foot Woman' had on boys. Even the gay Almodova was affected; see the giantess scene in 'Talk to Her,' and its foreshadowing in the first scene in the bathtub.What's going on here is that the third dimension allows a presence, a presentation of body that the flat screen simply cannot. Excepting the standard vocabulary of 'in your eye' tricks, all the animation and modeling has gone into Susan's body. Not just her shape, which is expected, but subtle details of that shape. Particular attention is spent on how she moves, with a sensuous grace that is designed to be seductive. Yes, I know it is not obvious, but watch the beginning half again and note how surrounding women are presented, before we enter the action, second half.Look at how many computing cycles went into the way her clothing moves on her body. The cloth does not move as her skin does, but over her skin, emphasizing the womanly movement of the dancer that was used for the motion capture. Study how this compares to sexually-designed Japanese animation projects. See how clearly different and more human Susan's movements are from those of the other characters, especially the humans — except for the women that surround her in the first half.These things are highly, highly engineered. This studio is the most severe in this dimension. These releases are strategic probes into competitive progress on cinematic advantage. Its all about how to leverage the technology to capture eyeballs. Pixar cannot respond to this. Well played.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,4,8,15 April 2009
Save the Last Dance," Hip Hop Acting Stiles
","Spoilers Herein.My two young actresses to watch are Kate Winslet and the girl here, Julia Stiles. I first saw her as Ophelia, and was stunned. So I followed her to a silly teenage movie and saw some confidence and charm. This is an ordinary film for children in every way except for her. But Kate and Julia couldn't be more different: Winslet is more disciplined, internal. Stiles doesn't have that, and may never. She is external -- wearing her role on her body rather than projecting it from within. Thus, her intent cannot be projected from scene to scene. But so many people `acting' in `real' life today carry their own personality on the outside anyway: that to me is what characterizes HipHop. So her style (sorry!) fits this story. We'll have to see if this is the careful planning of an intelligent actress (and her coach), or exuberant, undisciplined talent.But at least here -- where that exuberance colors outside the lines -- is an honest manner of acting that I find really refreshing, and risky. Her carriage is like a young Sigourney Weaver, but is carried with more grace. She does most of the dancing here (which is not world class) but the real dancing is when she isn't.Strangely, of all the possibilities that a moving camera offers in filming dance, the dance sequences here are filmed rather conventionally. This is MTV creativity?But some MTV guy is hip, and wrote in a decorated box of `remembrances' to mirror that from her 45 rpm carrying case in `Hamlet.'As an aside, the lead black male receives admittance to Georgetown, presumably on merit.

A clever writer can start with anything and extend it toward a known formula so that it animates that formula with a new disguise. In this world, the writers are witches.So, one can well imagine the challenge here: target the currently popular formula: brash small group battles (with fists and old fashioned weapons) an organized army of evil. Anchor it in something known that already connects with dreams and inner fears. Implement it with noise and bravado.The only thing of interest here is how clever were the writers.Good witch with red hair and nudity, and who falls (but not permanently) with the guy hero?

Along the way, we get:— Brigette Nieslen when she had appeal.— Possibly the worst collage ever.— Already a reach to try to photograph fight scenes differently by adding split screens.— A bizarre internationalization of boxing. The last edition deftly handled matters of race. This one assumes that we can buy the same deftness with Rooskies.

Dreamgirls," Michael Jackson Spits
","You have only two first choices in making a movie musical; you can preserve its stage nature, or decide at the first to make a movie, something that has a cinematic sense. I like musical presentation and all; I like theater and the contact of performance. Its all fine, but what really transports me is what I think of as opera in the modern sense. Its that multiple delivery of sense, primarily through sweeping enveloping visual grammar, supplemented by coordinated threads: text, narrative, music, emotional and intellectual.'Moulin Rouge' is my gold standard, born as a child of film, deeply reflexive. Chicago was less coherent  some of its cinematic collage really was just chop, but even then they eye needs rhythm and 'Chicago' delivered. That film also had something this has only in certain places: sweat if not blood. We knew that Zellweger and Zeta-Jones are uninteresting people, and the songs manufactured emotionally (as opposed to say, blues songs from someone blue). But we saw them work their guts out.This is an odd, odd thing musically. Start with genuine R&B, sung in Detroit basements and school auditoriums. Now transform that for the market, initially black showgoers. Now transform it again for a similar record-buying public. Again for white recordbuyers (where, incidentally I found myself in the late sixties), and then again for TeeVee watchers (and with added glamor, Las Vegas).Let that steep for fifteen years, all becoming a joke, then transform it again for the Broadway stage. By this time, any performance related to this collection of genres cannot be genuine in any way, merely a commentary. The performers may be black, but its as far removed from what it pretends to be as a scene in this film depicts: a white teen along the lines of Johnny Vee covering a black song. Its not a matter of how good the singer is, even the earnest Hudson who gets the applause here. Its a matter of market forces: art is brought to us by market forces and those forces bend, filter, bleach.Now take that stage show, based on a story about just this: how mass music MUST be untrue  take that stage musical and transform it one more time, and you'll have this. That's six generations from where this music meant something to what it is before it hits our ears. The only thing that can justify this is the full bore experience.The stage show delivered it in spades, because it used extraordinary stagecraft. It was to the stage musical what 'Moulin Rouge' was to the film musical: the vocabulary stretched to its most colorful (read: moving) excess. Where's that excess here? There are three (three?) moments where a rehearsal sweeps around and you find yourself on stage. Once done well would have been enough, these aren't.One character in this needs to be the white space, the root of the thing in terms of values. Maybe it could have been the avuncular manager (Glover) or the silent Dad, or the child. But no one is given the nail. One song at least needs to be performed as genuine. Yes, Hudson's number brings down the house. But it is so overproduced and overstaged its clear it is merely  dare I say it?  a show by a woman trying hard to have a career, not a woman who actually lives in her song.At least 'Hustle and Flow' was obviously dishonest.Oh well.

Face_Off," Shoot the Mirror
","Spoilers herein.There are films that are merely illustrated stories, and there are films that are centrally cinematic. There are so few of the latter, especially as mainstream products, that we should celebrate when one comes along. This one gets low marks from a lot of people because it superficially is dumb. After all, it is an excessively violent action movie with the double burden of two of the most offensive muggers working today. It has no sex.But it has a cinematic soul. There are parts of this that are perfect. Parts of the `When you wish' sequence go over the line and the boat chase is mundane, but the church sequence and two others are as visually poetic as it gets without a story on the big screen. The story is just an excuse, and is a simple construction, but some care has been given to details within those broad stokes: the face-wipe gesture, the `identity' of Dominique (of Dolores Haze fame, possibly the most invented identity in all literature -- Lolita), the cruel jabs at religious watering down of powerful myth, the careful cooptation of the Frankenstein ploy.It also has Gina Gershon in a relatively minor role.

The Men Who Stare at Goats," The Force
","Wars are bad investments in many ways. One of those, it seems is that a war — even a huge, long war — allows only one great 'perspective movie.'WWII ='Catch 22'Korean War = 'M A S H'Cold War = 'Doctor Stangelove'Vietnam = 'Apocalypse Now.'I register this film as the one the world bought by going to war in Iraq. At three trillion dollars and the bending of a national soul for generations, it is pretty expensive. But it does well in my book. It matters a lot to me that we discover new places to observe ourselves. I believe that initially those places — if truly new in the narrative world — will seem both magical and humorous. These films will confuse; war is a confusing beast, but enlighten merely because of their existence.As an experience, this movie had more laugh out loud moments for me than any film in recent memory. There is s seamless mix of cheap slapstick and profoundly sophisticated humor, and the mix tricks you into laughing at hard things, believing them to be simple ones.Two things are notable. The first is that some substantial part of this is not just about wars, but about war movies, and specifically 'Star Wars.' Ewan plays the fellow who is folded into this movie: the guy who wrote it and is our enchanted on-screen narrator. He is discovered to have Jedi qualities. As his wide-eyed character discovers the secret program of psychic warriors, he himself becomes part of the war-joke by reference to the rather daft celebration of violence we have in movies, merely because it is cinematic.The second cool thing is the way that imagination within the story reaches outside the story. There are the usual folds of course: a book written about an encounter that has an interwoven flashback history. But these folds have psychic insight that crosses the boundaries. This magical reality of insight allows the jokes to also cross the boundaries or folds, into the essence of the stupidities of this conflict and incidentally allowing that mix of satire and slapstick I mentioned. It is really quite brilliant: Spike Jonez sort of stuff.The only real deficiency is the end, which is profoundly mis-imagined. I suppose that is appropriate, given the conflict itself. But you walk out remembering the failed end and not the successful views beforehand.I do not know the book. It supposedly claims connection with 'real facts.' At least one is wrong: the research on psychics was in the 70s, and not connected with the New Earth Army. The psychic business was significant.

She's the Man," Shifting Language
","It may be that if you want to understand the evolution of how we reason about ourselves, how we form models and roles... it may be that the richest place to look is the way teen movies have evolved. Kids are the most sophisticated modelers in society. They are also the audience most limited in concerns, which focuses the abstractions on matters of identity.The form of the thing is different than the usual teen version of Shakespeare. Its spliced rather than transformed, which means you have two movies intertwined. The first is the Shakespeare bit about cross-gender disguises and resulting confused attractions. The second is formulaic teen stuff formed out of the playdough of girls-in- sports (which today means soccer or skating) and ordinary filmteen coupling.The reason Shakespeare chose the disguises was because it allowed him opportunity to build layers of meaning in his phrases, always with one bawdy thread. When you get an audience engaged in following the situation so they can decode the language to get the joke, you've accomplished your theatrical goal. After all, the main thing is about them tricking us into dissolving ourselves in the play.Teens don't like clever language, not so far as actual words. What they like is nuance in pronouncing the couple hundred they use. See how writer Kirsten Smith  who has experience with this  shifts the comedic arcs from the phrase to how the phrase is delivered? It isn't always successful  meaning the audience doesn't always laugh. But the shift is as palpable as the multiple gender shifts managed here.This part of the movie really is interesting. Kids manipulate themselves to make their lives simple and the means they use are sophisticated. Just following that is entertaining enough.The other part, is almost necessarily banal. Has to be, just as the girlish cotillion in the plot is. Will our female soccer player play? Will the team win? Will all the honest souls find a mate?

Spider-Man," Skewed Webs
","Spoilers herein.I was profoundly disappointed in this because I expected a creative combination of two warring factions in filmmaking: the framers and the swoopers.Comics are rooted in the icons of preliteracy evolving into stained glass: brilliant colors and grand underlying mythology. Marvel comics (Stan Lee) adjusted the idiom slightly to make the mythology more accessible, and at the same time make each panel more active. He also popularized the overlapping of static panels on the page, so that not only was each panel composed, but each assembly of panels.Pulling on those two poles, the mythology and the framing, must be done simultaneously. By focusing more and more on the framing of the art, it allowed the referenced mythical power to increase. In other words, by making the images more static, the story became more dynamic and thus stronger. What made Spidey so novel was that his superhero action is primarily one of swooping and perching on oddly perspectived surfaces.So this particular comic, Spiderman, provides a much richer basis for effective film art than any other because it has a unique blend of framing and swooping. To appreciate the opportunity, you need to know one of the most lasting and interesting controversies in the film world.`Moving' pictures were seen as a sibling to `still' pictures which themselves inherited much from easel art. Similar equipment and conventions applied. All early movies placed the camera at eye level on a stationary tripod. The movement was one that a normal human observer would see. A second-order movement was introduced and mastered by Eisenstein, the movement of the camera from one shot to another. The individual shots were still from a stationary camera, but there was a choreography of the eye introduced. The setup of each shot was still essentially composed like a photo, rather like a comic panel in fact. The master of that today in film is Greenaway, but successful hacks like Speilberg mine what's been done. In fact folks like Speilberg compose their films first as comics (storyboards) and then replicate the frames.But there emerged a new school, led by Hitchcock that had the camera moving while the action moved. By controlling those moves, Hitch's camera had personality, curiosity. Tarkovsky and later dePalma mastered this and innovated so that some rare films have the eye as a main character. Today, essentially every filmmaker has a swooping camera because he/she can and because composing the Eisenstein/Kurosawa way requires insight beyond the skills of the current crop. So we now have a community of swoopers, mostly inept, constantly copying.So you can see how I got my hopes up. The Spiderman material was rooted in clever framing like Eisenstein/Kurosawa -- it is no accident that Peter Parker is the photographer of Spiderman.But it also depends on referencing and exploiting the swooping eye as with Tarkovsky/dePalma. It also makes heavy use of the odd-angled architecture of Welles, which clearly spilled more from his films into comics than into successor films.But what we get is a depressingly unoriginal treatment, wholly unaware of either the grand possibilities or even the educated eye. This is not just a pedantic concern -- you cannot have an exciting movie without an exciting eye. And this film's eye is hidden behind an inanimate mask. This is the Goblin's movie, not Spidey's",Null,12,24,10 May 2002
Dark City," It's an Experiment!
","Spoilers herein.Writing IMDB comments is an interesting business that often benefits from some relaxation. For instance, I saw Carpenter's Vampire movie and was struck by how poor it was. So I rushed off a comment trying to say some insightful things about the ways in which it was bad. Then the next day -- after getting my life back -- it struck me that the movie itself was a vampire, a lifeless dead entity that keeps coming back in different forms, all more or less the same. These get their life by sucking it out of us.I had a similar experience with Dark City, which had the unhappy coincidence of having been seen by me immediately after Seven Samuri. Kurosawa's movie was effortless, full of life, original. City in contrast was labored, dead, strikingly unoriginal. I patiently listened to the DVD comment by Ebert. Now Ebert is no great intellect, but he does seem to know the art. And here he is, gushing over scene after scene with the most vapid of insights.Moreover, this film finished my concentrated survey of similar themes: Matrix, 13th Floor, Strange Days, eXistenZ, and 9 more, plus some odd outliers. eXistenZ had real scifi meat: artificial layers creating new layers and conspiracies crossing layers and reversing, and with a coherent vision and logic. Not so with City which has a tired old device, not very coherently supported from the scifi perspective. Dismayed, I went to bed.Now, with fresh morning light, it dawns on me that this film is a pretty wonderful example of what it purports to be about. In retrospect, quite a few films are like this -- for instance we often have a film whose `message' is to value the more important elements in life and eschew the trivial. But then it tells the story in a way that can only be received if you pay attention to the trivial. An example pulled randomly from the barrel: `Legally Blond.'And so we have here. Dark City is a world created from past memories by pseudo-people who have no originality or creativity. This world is one in which ordinary people like us are supposed to interact as if it didn't just appear. See? Like the city, the film has no original notions at all, everything is borrowed from a well-established vocabulary from the past. And this is true of every element from the set design, lighting, dialog, even Keifer's accent. The people who created this can mimic that vocabulary with high production values, but there is no soul here. They started with parts and ended with parts glued to the old quest saga. Could have been an intelligent movie if they know what they were doing.The only question is how YOU responded to the experiment. Did you understand it was a prison to escape or at least control and reshape? Or did you behave as you were meant to?",Null,25,42,27 November 2001
The Machinist," One and a Half
","One can hope for good films. When preparing for the journey, one communicates with one's self about what to expect. If the construction is like this, a 'puzzle film,' then the conversation continues through the film as it sustains two souls watching. Often, those souls can be sent down parallel paths in so-called narrative folds.But sometimes, one of those souls jumps out of the path determined by the writer and 'solves the puzzle' in ways never imagined before the encounter. That happened to one of me in watching this. The determined solution is intended to be rather Russian: a tool operator is fishing with his buddy, is tired on the way home. At 1:30 pm he kills a child crossing the street and runs away. We meet him a year later when he is fully split, having not slept or eaten much that entire year. The art here is in how his interaction with his second self is mapped onto the telling of the story: with parallel mothers, wives, children, cars arms and fish. There is a situational confusion that the film harmonizes by collapsing selves. Unfortunately, the puzzle is too rich for this simple solution, and an attentive watcher splits and finds other more rewarding interpretations.The one my other self prefers is: a factory worker named Reynolds goes fishing with a coworker. That coworker, Reznik, has serious mental problems and projects them onto his relationship with Reynolds. Reynolds has previously been traumatized by an industrial accident damaging his arm. The two disturbed men argue, one trying to be the son of the other. Reznick is killed and dumped in the lake.On the way home in his flashy car, disturbed Reynolds has an accident and is thrown into a coma. We meet him after a year of being asleep, hallucinating himself into the emaciated body of the man he killed whose sleep he has stolen. This dream world is cornered in four directions by women: whore, mother, companion, nourisher. Reynolds dies without waking, but only after he has 'confessed' and redeemed himself.

The `Lord of the Rings' films were all of a single whole, while these Harry Potter movies are each cognizant of what went before, changing and maturing just as would an adolescent.It has little to do with the story, of course and even less with the insipid monsters and threats. It instead has everything to do with the philosophy of the implied narrator. In the first film, that narrator was without grounding.The second film showed a remarkable (for Hollywood) artistic sensibility in rooting the world of what we see in space. All the important shots were a matter of registration with the buildings around us, mostly the academy. All of a sudden we were aware that someone is actually paying attention to how we see what we see.The jazz in the movie world is now centered on Spanish-speaking fiilmmakers. They alone seem to have a handle on new ways of introspective folding. So the search was on to get the best Hispanic they could. This director was their third choice, but still a good one.In this case, they rooted the narrator in folded time, and here the story helps a bit. The subtle suggestion is that we the viewers are the `dementors,' who hover about and move much like the camera does.

Ratatouille," Hyper Reality
","Its easy to see how this story came about. Animators are puppeteers first. So if you asked an animator to come up with a story, naturally you will find two features: one would involve two on-screen characters, one the animator of the other. We have many jokes associated with how imperfectly the on-screen animator (our hero) works his puppet at first. Incidentally, this movie is preceded in the theater by a short: 'Lifting.' It features a novice 'animator' of precisely this type, being graded. Notice the infinite panel of switches in that short.Count on Pixar to find yet another way to fold introspection into the form. This is elaborated by the character of a critic. We see him first in a coffin-like office. He's only capable of destruction it seems. Voiced by Peter O'Toole in a stentorian voice-about-theater, he likes what he sees (tastes). Its a great trick you see. Usually this trick is in the form of an on screen audience watching some sort of climactic performance. When they cheer, we do too, as we become folded into the story.In this case, that is handled by a place made for us and occupied by 'the critic.' So we have a place in the story for the animator and the viewer. What else? We'll need a place for the animation, right? And we have it.It appears first as a book by a now dead, corpulent chef. This book, natch, comes alive. Look how 'Ted's law' is followed: the distance between the 'real' world of ourselves and the animated movie is the same as that from the animated movie and the 'living cartoon' within. Its an explicit fold. And the fact that the inner cartoon has an open, personal feel to it conveys to the personal feel we are intended to have with the Pixar movie.So these three folds: in the story is the story, the animator and the viewer. And the introductory short sets this up too.Having said that, there are a couple noteworthy segments. In terms of the actual craft, Pixar has two areas in which it innovates.One of these in how space is handled. The Pixar guys realized early on that if the three dimensions are going to be modeled anyway, you can zip the camera around in new ways. Early in the game they did this in an overt way. That's been picked up by the summer action films, the best of them, including the Depp pirate business. (Another Disney project benefiting from the eye motion lab.)You can see this throughout the project: there are both all sorts of well managed, unusual perspectives, and a constant overlay of new shots. By this I mean that every shot is just a little different than what you've seen. Just a little canted. A little closer perhaps. A little movement that a physical camera cannot do well.But there are some big production sequences as well. I'm particularly interested in architectural water. Its a unique cinematic challenge. Its not one done well in animation because the mathematics of simply making water look real is daunting. Pixar has done what needs to be done: they have made water hyper-real, dramatic. There's a sequence here that is something like that Pinnochio sequence of 67 years ago with the whale. But its so new and fresh and exciting. Look at the water and see that it has a million tiny agents all seeking to be angry  to do damage but never reaching consensus on just how to attack. This alone is worth the admission.There's another thing that is uniquely Pixar: how characters move. Its a tricky thing, that. As with the water, it is not ever enough that they move realistically. You can make realistic movements by outfitting actors with sensors and translating that to the created beings. It captures nuance. And if you have a particularly skilled source actor, he or she will move not as a real person would, but as an actor would to convey reality. Real isn't real. We need hyperreal in special ways to get- read the reality.The credits of this movie ostentatiously say that ''Our Quality Assurance Guarantee: 100% Genuine Animation! No motion capture or any other performance shortcuts were used in the production of this film.' You can see it. We are entering a new era where both the cameras and the characters can use dramatic motions not possible with human eyes and bodies.Its a challenge for viewers. What do we accept as embodiment? So far, the answer is that the non-natural movements must always be in the service of conveying or seeming natural. But I imagine at the speed this is developing, we may soon see something more.One character note: Colette is voiced by the remarkable Janeane Garofalo. As with our hero, she has that French nose. As the love develops between these two, she becomes decidedly more sexy, both in voice and appearance. Its the appearance that I remark on here. Its all done with postures and a motorcycle. That motorcycle is there in part to allow her to bend forward, and change her lower anatomy. These folks at Pixar are good. Darn good.

","Watching this after 'Dark Knight Rises' is like moving from Saudi Arabia to Monaco.One is the vision of one man through close, very close collaborators. It takes chances, risks darkness.

No one wants to do anything that matters; the goal is to have a the tastiest candy on the block. It takes no chances. It has noise and motion not because of the world we visit, but because the channel we see that world through imposes it on us. The colors are primary.

They both kill all the fathers. But Batman peppers the world with adult sex of a few different kinds. The way this is woven (the sex and the fathers) is how we encounter the weave in real lives: confusingly entangled. Sure, the Catgirl suit and its corset registered in one familiar way, but the manner of the girl was hardly the conventional model (waif or seductress).On the other hand, Stan Lee's girl was about as sexless as possible. The fatherlessness in this case drives the superhero's soul into a different type of emptiness than Bruce Wayne's condition does, one more monastic. I believe that the world of viewers may be equally divided on which is the more superficial.The other thing concerns a criticism I have noted in many previous Marvel films, but especially the Raimi projects. They just don't understand how to use the third dimension. The first three were lost opportunities to spatially thrill. Now, well after some exciting techniques have appeared in big films, they finally capitulate and use state of the art dimensional flight. I believe the problem was the the original comics did not understand this either all Marvel worlds are flat, and fidelity to the comic vision was paramount.But here they do what everyone else is. And that is the problem. They parceled action scenes out to different effects houses and bought every motion technique on the shelf. So we get a hodgepodge of space, depending on who the production crew was for each segment. I saw this in IMAX 3d. The whiplash was extreme, not from the spatial effects — many of which were fine. But from the shifts in how the space was constructed.Like eating ice cream and tasting steak, then coconut, then tar.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",Null,5,9,7 August 2012
The Lego Movie," Gamer Gate
","The outer story is about a kid and his dad who doesn't understand play. An inner story has tokens that elaborate on this, a story that is mostly flashiness. The animation is based on Lego and I am sure there is a large franchise in the works. An inner, inner story is about an intrepid girl who doggedly searches for the legendary special piece. She is a master builder and it is she that repeatedly saves the day and pulls the hapless hero through the story. This character is sadly drawn. She has identity issues, picks her men unwisely and is disappointed in not being the chosen one.At the end of the movie, when all else is reconciled, her agency is removed as she becomes 'the girlfriend.' That agency is insultingly replaced by the boy's little sister. I think we need to see her again, and see her master her situation.",Null,3,5,13 February 2015
Aliens," Different Worlds
","Different WorldsSpoilers herein.I've just rewatched `Alien,' `Aliens' and `Alien Resurrection.' Considered simply as films, each is a fine film but they come from worlds that are more different from each other than the normative world of now is to the world of any of them. Just viewing them is a course in filmmaking.Ridley Scott's `Alien' is the most impressive, knowing that it was only his second film, that every effect is physical, and that the budget was so low the spacecraft is cobbled together from used aircraft parts. Even at this early point, Scott has the ability to create a unique look and has the mastery of craft to coordinate every element (acting, score, movement) to reinforce that look. That he chose Giger to base the look on was brilliant. Organic darkness -- evil embodied in living things. The alien ship, though only briefly shown, is a sequence that will live way past the time that the monsters of the series are forgotten; that blending of beast, environment and narrative is unique in all filmdom. Really amazing that the sequels didn't go back to that ship. Scott has grown to be one of our best and most original filmmakers -- Alien and `Blade Runner' (with `Forbidden Planet') are the very best `real' scifi films we have, meaning films that are not just adventure films.Where `Alien' is scifi in the service of horror, `Aliens' is scifi in the service of action. Aliens is a war film, and equally impressive as one of Cameron's earliest. Movement and conflict. More emphasis on the familiar is necessary for this approach, so we see the sets and costumes less adventuresome. This is a thrill which uses the trappings of scifi only as another thing with which to impress. The mood created is projected not into the image as with Scott, but into the theater as something to amaze. Cameron hasn't evolved at all from this film, only been given ever bigger effects with which to amaze. So one might consider this his most `genuine' film.`Resurrection' seems to not be as admired by the fan base. But I think it every bit the equal of the other two. In this case, we also have a new director, a European with two fantasy tales under his belt. But those set a tone that is strikingly weird: the tone not in the setting, but in the psychological space in the story. And that's what we have here. In Cameron's film, every character is a stereotype. Here, every character is an anti-stereotype: the black guy isn't jive; the cripple is the toughest; the sex kitten is a robot... even the hero isn't really. This is also the most cinematic use of the camera, using the psychological eye. Scott dwells, Cameron moves, Jeunet examines. He doesn't mind annotating the past films (rather like Van Sant's `Psycho' annotates Hitchcock's).The only negative thing I note in the sequels is that Weaver isn't adaptable enough to understand and get behind these diverse visions. She understands Scott. Cameron doesn't really care, but she is outclassed by Jeunet.Seeing any one of these enhances the appreciation for the other two.",Null,12,21,27 June 2001
The Fast and the Furious," Corybantic
","Spoilers herein.Emphasis on the Furious.My ideal movie will take me to unknown places, ideally through new visual experiences. This film tries twice to do so. On one of these accounts, it fails, but the other really impressed me. And I'm a hard case.The failure was that the filmmaker thought he discovered a new counterculture worth exploring. As with all such, it is illegal, costly, dangerous, urban and youth-centered. But this is rooted in asian-influenced techno and has an appearance that is unique. The writers (were there any?) weren't good enough to capture any of this beyond showing us the cars. A failure.The success was in extending the visual grammar. Nothing revolutionary or original here. But the visual effect does push the experience to a new level. I believe it does so by relying on Manga, which is the art of this same counterculture. I'm pretty shocked that no one here has compared the essential style to `Akira.'",Null,3,6,9 March 2002
The Exorcist," Deep Archetypical Contrasts
","In the documentary on the DVD, von Sydow says that if you are open to it, this film will scare you and perhaps affect you spiritually. Certainly true. Why this and not the many other similar films? Keep in mind that essentially all the rest of Friedkin's work is mundane, worthless.A large part of the question, I think, is that the creators of the film have stumbled into a rich field of archetypal conflicts, stuff deeper than just a sweet kid cursing and masturbating.The film is set in a Jesuit University. Even today, if you go there, you find a very strange vibe. The notion of authoritarian faith being crammed down from above certainly has a place in society, but such a brotherhood running an academy of open inquiry is a puzzling, disturbing mix. And that's underscored and mirrored by a similar (though less militant) conflict around psychiatry. Here we have the priests of `medicine' torturing this little girl to confirm their theories.The priest is the center of the film, and embodies all this: Arcane `faith' versus modern inquiry; Taking direction blindly rather than acting on knowledge; Understanding the mind versus understanding the soul; Serving the weak (his mother) versus battling powerful evil. Friedkin increased these ambiguities wherever he found them, usually against the positivist stance of Blatty.Interesting in this context are two tricks, one conscious, the other I suspect not.The conscious one is the self-referential wrapper. This is film about a film star, making a film. What triggers the possession are the visits by the director who probably had some deviant intent or action. He is the first victim. Thus, Friedkin places himself in the action and himself openly exploits Linda Blair. Meanwhile the actor playing the director dies in real life.The unconscious one is the Persian reference. Best scholarship has Judaism coming from Zoroastrianism flavored by Egyptian superficialities. A lower form of Zoroastrianism devolved into the much more widely adopted Mithraism, characterized by the warring of good and evil. This is sort of the professional wrestling of religious belief, both in style and substance, and continues today to be the root of `fundamentalism.' So in a very real way, Satan was invented in northern Iran, and any student of religion will end up `digging' around there.How sad and strange that this film seems to have bolstered the Catholic church.",Null,19,33,30 November 2000
American History X," Clumsy Term Paper
","Spoilers herein.I found Ed Norton to be a plausible foil in `Fight Club,' but a simple mugger in `The Score.' I sought this out to discover whether he should be on a list to watch or not -- this being a picture he influenced heavily.It is a mess. It is a mess because the director was too callow to have and impose a vision. So we get lots of different visions depending on the composition of the moment and the elements involved. One of those elements is Norton himself. I continue to maintain that the actor should never be in charge of the vision: he just has an entirely different set of concerns. One can see the scenes that Norton rips away from the director and sets up as billboards for himself.There are times when this can work. Scorsese seems to have explored more than all of them. It doesn't work here. This material demands that it be centered in large numbers of `ordinary' people. The impact is that this could be widespread, not just isolated to one movieland character. But Norton sucks all the attention out of the story.The material demands ambiguity. But the center is an unwaveringly decent black schoolteacher, as artificial a character as Norton's.The material attempts some sort of reflection through the term paper/diary reflections of the brother. But this is clumsily written and ends up as simple narration, usually the sign of poor visual storytelling.There is self-reference of sorts between Norton and his character. The character is playing a role that allows for one-dimensional excess. This role is widely respected because of the matter he preaches. So too with Norton himself.",Null,24,42,3 July 2002
Ocean's Eleven," Eleven Samuri
","Spoilers herein.Ridley Scott's attention is focused on projecting each scene into the future; Soderbergh's is on the present, the zen of forgetting what's next. He pulls this off by immersion in the craft. Alone among major directors, he is a triple threat: he lives through the actor's eye; he works the director's end (as the variety of director that is storypuller); and he literally is the cameraman.This last is the special skill, because he seems able to accomplish this zen thing by making the camera flow. It is almost always godlike -- never taking a position or focal stance that a human would; but flowing like an invisible human observer might. The trick is that it is not just within a shot, as others would have, but seamlessly across great phrases of shots. This is architecture in the master builder sense.The story is throwaway except for two elements:--The method of shooting noted above is pure Kurosawa, and in particular `Seven Samuri.' And the story reflects it, with all the mechanics of collecting the team. Kurosawa himself collected actors from a single acting tradition and had them act as discrete characters. Soderbergh understands actors well enough to select actors from different traditions to act different types of characters. So we get a richer ensemble: Reiner's style is all timing; Clooney's all body; Pitt's heavily eye's; Julia's all mouth; Cheadle is a nervous projector; Garcia resolutely quite. (Pitt is the anchor of this film. He's really growing.)--As with all purely modern, postironic film, there is a film within, around which all things revolve. This film within the film is a carefully produced set piece where they fool the viewer. As with several other `casino' films -- particularly the self-referential `Snake Eyes' which is quoted here, there is a constant camera eye.It's very competent, cinematic storytelling. Someday soon, he'll do something important. And with his growing skill, it will alter lives.",Null,11,14,10 December 2001

My mother was on the floor of Congress when war was declared.My Dad was killed on duty in 1960 and I am glad he is not here to witness this sad, even vile exploitation: these events romanticized to thrill and amuse us. God help us if we do the same to the Sept 11 attack.I am a big believer in the power of film, its evolving ability to be the real language of the future.

Tropic Thunder," Three, Five, Eight
","There seen to be only eight ways for humans to reference themselves. Only 5 are considered possible though I have encountered six I believe. Rarely, three are present here.Robert Downey Jr is an actor on-screen. We never lose sight that it is he. He plays an Australian actor, loosely based on Heath Ledger. Postproduction took out some of the more obvious references to Ledger after his death and to point more to Russell Crowe, but it is clear that the transforms noted here are of the type encouraged in Australians and practiced in Batman.That character, surgically transformed, plays an African American. But it doesn't stop there. Like many black men, this one plays a character, a role. Some jokes with the 'real' black man (who has done something similar) highlight this.Since this inner, inner, inner, inner, inner man is selfconsciously in a film, he mugs. That's five layers of identity, three of them abstractions. No one alive today could pull this off I am sure. Depp probably when he was younger. A few actresses alive could, but even they have been lazy recently. So this is something of a special experience for me.Stiller, who wrote this, creates a simpler set of folds for himself, just so that we don't miss what this is all about. We will be aware of the by now common layering of writing, directing and starring, but Stiller is the first that I know to do it like Woody does, backwards, with the character creating the writer instead of the other way. Once in the movie proper, he adopts a role of a simpleton, something he is forced into but anchors the same way that Downey's character to the fifth does.The encounter between these two quantum logical persons isn't written as cleverly as we wish  how could it be?As an incidental effect, Tom Cruise gives us a character that nearly redeems a career of energetic inadequacy. That alone might have been worth it, especially given the religious contexts. But Downey? A prince. A prince.I had dinner with a regular reader last night.

Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Sparkles after Hitting
","This is the most fun I've had at the movies for a while. I believe is it because it is inventive in several ways and the inventiveness is coherent through the thing and across the narrative pathways (cinematic effects, narrative rhythm, character reactions). It is not difficult to push the envelope in any one of these, in fact I see it done even accidentally because film conventions form such narrow roads.But it seems difficult as getout to control it well enough that it emanates from a coherent world, to make a long form project that lives in the inventiveness rather than just sees it from time to time. Much of this is credited to the filmmaker, and how he can focus his team. Since there is very little motion capture, the effects did not have to be planned in advance and I imagine there was a lot of tinkering.Some of the credit has to go to the source, which I understand is a comic. I have not seen it but I imagine the overall shape was set and refined there. But we have to give the key actor credit too. He has to understand the cosmology of the thing well enough to convincingly inhabit it. This is a difficult acting challenge. Remember Bill Murray? It was his gift I believe to anticipate the finished tone of the film and place himself square within it. 'Groundhog Day' depended on us seeing that it made sense to him.I have to admit to a generational deficiency that made this even better for me. The girls were unattractive, excepting the redhead drummer who is shunted to buddy status. They were emotionally damaged, intellectual nitwits and not physically desirable. In the story of course, they are all a guy lives for, literally. I am imagining that it made sense to the young audience that these trivial beings mattered. But for me, it increased the weirdness and otherworldliness of the thing.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,17,37,23 August 2010
Enchanted," Inner Love
","What is a film studio to do? Romance movies make money, so you've got to keep making them. This and the beat-up genre are the foundation of the industry, and the product has to keep flowing.But at the same time, the audience is not only becoming more and more hardened, they like to see this represented in their film product which is the one place in their lives where most do sophisticated abstract reasoning. What do you do? Well, if you are the world's most mature studio in terms of narrative engineering, you'll try something like this.Its a romance movie that first tells you what the formula is, shows it to be a cartoon of life. Then it layers 'real life'  what I call folding  on it. There's a character that is told by our fantasy girl about movie love and expresses shock that such love is expressed 'without irony.' The idea is that somehow this fantasy world of movie love penetrates into our real world of rude New Yorkers and bad marriages. The roughness of the real world isn't all that rough though, and our visitor from a pure land does in the end change those around her. There's a child involved but her agency in the business is downplayed; she's less important than the curtains. So the formula is to first make fun of the formula by putting it in the first movie, the one within, and then let it seep into the outer movie, the one we are presumed to inhabit. At the end, we more consciously buy into the notion of movie romance.It didn't work so well for me because the 'real' world was presented in an inadequately real way. There were construction workers, a rough bus driver, a homeless thief, rude passersby. But none of them had enough edge to count as real. The real world, in fact, was nearly as pretend as the cartoon world. So this breaks Ted's law which states that in order for these nested constructions to work, the distance between us and the outer world has to be the same as that between the outer world and the inner one, here, Andelasia.In keeping with best character engineering tradition, the girl here is redheaded.

I admit that of the exclusively action directors, Renny strikes me well. He insists on lightness in the characters. No actor plays straight. All have a brightness. Decidedly lowbrow, but easy to read, almost incidental. The stunts are each directed as an arc, each pretty well unified. Lots of fireballs. Lots of vertical space. Pretty good variety in camera coverage.This is the airplane one, the one with the fax joke.I suspect that everyone will find either this or the first their favorite, depending on their philosophy of film.

Flashdance," Thugs do Pretty
","There are dirty, moneygrubbing thugs in this movie, not ashamed to make money from sex. They operate a strip club, from which one of the characters is 'rescued.' This movie is made by the same sort of moneygrubbing thugs (Gruber, Peters, Bruckheimer) , and there's no doubt that sex is at the top of its values. It has essentially no story, only a series of setups. Its clearly designed to sell music, which then was LPs.And yet it works for me. The reason is that its cinematic, a and finely so. I'm usually pretty tough on films that feature dance, unless the camera itself dances. This one doesn't. But what it does have is crisp editing and superb, absolutely superb lighting.I think dePalma started this and did the stuff that works, the storyboards, the lighting design. I imagine he supervised the scouting of the dirty sets where we see smoke, glow and sparks. I imagine he worked out the tricks where the face is occluded so that we can swap our actress with real dancers, several of them.So you can find three things to like here: the fold where the smarmy guys are in the movie, the fantastic lighting, beginning with the very fist shots, and the dancing. It almost seems as if the dancing came after the major cinematic decisions. It was unusual for the time: more energetically sensual. Tight in energy but lose in inspiration. All of the dances have an on screen audience, but one: the 'manic' dance. That lack of on screen audience after the deliberate inclusion of one invites us in. And this dance is photographed differently. We don't see the whole body: we see parts, and while the camera doesn't spatially move, it does temporally. The editors dance. The visual rhythm invokes voyeurism, identification and syncopation all at the same time. This is significant movie-making, hidden in a rather trivial-seeming wrapper. Gruber at the time advertised this as 'Rocky with a woman,' but there's no resemblance story-wise. There is with the energy though.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,5,11,26 September 2007
Resident Evil," The Borrowers
","Spoilers herein.Video gaming is bigger business than movies! But movies innovate and create society where games borrow from and reflect elements of society. So its quite an interesting challenge in putting together a film project on a video game.First: you cannot, must not innovate. To emulate a video game you have to aggressively steal from other projects. You have to exclusively rely on stereotypes. That's because games have to have a passive imagination in the world: you have to not think about what it is or how it is put together so you can focus on the problem at hand. Films are all about creating a world in such a way that the registration of that world is the whole point; it should be engaging work.So here we have borrowing from `Alice in Wonderland,' `2001,' the zombie films, the Alien films and on and on.It is about fighting the building like so many haunted house films (and `Cube'). It is also about fighting zombies. No, you have to fight an alien creature (sexy girl losing her military companions). No, that's not right, you have to fight the selfinterested supercomputer. Oops, the real threat is doublecrossed conspiracy. Wrong again: the battle is the `the man.' Another twist: none of that matters since some combination of all the above has destroyed Toronto.This could have been really, really cool. It could even have been fun as we are buffeted among all these different types of films, each a discrete genre in itself. But no one involved has a smidgin of cleverness. Just one art director would have made all the difference. All we get is a map of the hive that doesn't correlate.Obviously, all the bucks were put on Milla. But she is as dumb as they come, so what you really need is someone who can photograph her well. She knows how to relate to that. But watch closely: no one did during regular filming. The studio went into remedial mode so added a lot of closeups that are distributed throughout. These are photographed with a fashion magazine sensibility with entirely different makeup and lighting than the surrounding scenes. Gives us good face, but sort of chops things up. That is to say: this was not done in the style of `Fifth Element' and `Joan' which was made by someone who knew how to photograph a face amidst action and who was smitten by that face.Maybe next time some better talent will be brought in.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 4: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",Null,7,15,9 September 2002
Dirty Dancing," Goyim on the West Side
","Watching 'Ice Castles' reminded me of this, so I revisited it.Two things: The first is the modern problem of how to incorporate dance in a story. In the 30s you could just pretend the movie was a stage show with the players doing their entertainment thing. Coming out of that was a long tradition of movies where the characters were in show business, so we'd have some usually trivial story wrapping the shows.Over time, the interplay between the inner show and the outer became important and nuanced. At one end is the play reflecting some larger insight into the 'real' life that surrounds it. By merging the audience within with the audience in the movie theater, the story becomes more real.In modern times, the screenwriter's problem -- when they want to have dance -- is how to incorporate it into the story. It isn't easy at all, unless you turn it into a sports movie where the dance (or singing) sequences are part of some grand competition that is also a make it or break it life test. That's lazy. Just lazy.Dirty Dancing was a clever solution, since become something of a formula. Dancing is sex, pure and simple. Dance as a seduction, paired dancing that is. There is the slightest hint of a test here, where our little baby has to fill in for the regular partner. (She has to fill in because that partner is pregnant, as if we needed yet another reminder what it is all about.) But that event isn't so much a test as a gift, a gift of her body.All in all, seeing this again after 20 years, it doesn't seem all that dirty now even though the youth and plainness of our girl is still striking.The second interesting thing about this was remarked on when new. But it is so much more obvious when browsing the DVD extras. Baby is a Jew, as is her family and all the guests. The writer was trying to evoke her own memories of a lost era (the hotelier bemoans that loss at the end of the movie).The setting is a Jewish resort in the Catskills where the owner brings in the right kind of boys for waitstaff in order to screw the patron's daughters. There's a longstanding joke in the Jewish community about how tepid and joyless they are, and that's pinged often here.Meanwhile, some of the lower class staff, goyim, have a West Side Story sort of existence, endlessly rutting and dancing. Joy and whooping.Our Baby is the daughter of the doctor who saved the owner's life, so he has blessed her by providing his own blood to awaken her. This poor kid is played by someone who had a name for himself playing stereotypical Jews. Large noses play an embarrassing part here in identifying key characters and this kid has a comically prosthetic one.No surprise that she prefers the 'other' class, and much is made of her father's disapproval. It is because he is not a Jew, like the boy designated for the other daughter (who dutifully plans her deflowering).No one doubts that Baby will never see Johnny again, will join the Peace corps, fix her nose (as Jennifer has) and be happy in some conventional future after having her two flings.Its a sad movie in many ways, but if you want an old dance movie, please choose this one over 'Flashdance' and 'Saturday Night Fever.'

Quantum of Solace," Discrete Movements
","In a way, this is disappointing. Its seems to have simply taken from the Bond story grab bag, giving us nothing new. Last time had that amazing opening chase sequence. And to my mind a novel spectacle at the end. This has nothing like that. It also lacks the grit and pain of the first; we are back to a glossy magazine of spyworld, not its catacombs. Unfortunately, I just have seen 'The Fall,' and it is unlikely that a different 'around the world' could impress me. But it has something endearing in the editing. The shots of the action scenes are along the lines of what we saw in 'Transformers' where the camera does not fully show us the action. This is an experiment, I think, and may fade, Also this is greatly toned down, but it is edited so expertly that it has a greater sustained effect.One sequence in particular is worth the price. It is near the beginning and finishes a rather boring chase. There are collapsing scaffolds and swinging gantries. The setup is not so original, but the way it is shot and edited is. It must have been done by a second crew, because it stands out in tone as unique, extreme.We have our office redhead back. That's a big deal.

There are many such films, but they get fewer, the more special effects are involved.That's because so many of the key elements of the vision and narrative are delegated to others, all over the planet, with different design sensibilities and philosophies. Here, that problem is immense, and we have enough experience with this filmmaker on prior projects to know he cannot control a smaller hive.Add to this minor incompetences of minor lives (Smith, Goldblum and so on) and a script literally borrowed from the prior catalog.

The Dirty Dozen," Magnificent Seven Meets Great Escape Meets Catch 22
","Spoilers herein.Most films are not about life, but about other films. Sometimes you get one that recasts old forms and sets new cultural milestones.Just a couple years before, Bronson was a part of a rag-tag group in the US remake of 'The Magnificent 7.' Then, that same ethos of inventive rebel was recast into patriotic honor with the Americans in the 'Great Escape.' This was one of the defining archetypes of the culture, just in time to catch and influence the Vietnam era. Now, the idea is brought home more clearly: rank criminals with defining but limited honor.What's unique about this film: the bad guys aren't the Nazis -- it is them, their servants and women, the whole complicit people. Behind the humor of the middle part is a more harrowing reality of that war than seen in 'Private Ryan' and the ilk: the war was brought by and fought against the German people. No honor on either side, only film justice.++++ Added later:Sometimes distance sharpens the politics of the thing. At the time, the U.S. was conducting an immoral war in Vietnam. The Army was aggregated from conscripts most against their will; some significant portion were sent from the judicial system. The rules were brutal on civilians. It would be some time before the extent would become known, but war crimes were common. I think when this film came out few would have mourned the loss of a few French prostitutes and wives. This was far closer to WWII than to the current time, and the image of stereotypical German generals being taken from lavish pleasures and incinerated in a cave would have evoked notions of justice for the holocaust.

This is a pessimistic world where damaged goods never go away, they just keep coming back in new forms. Easy to see in the arrogant South (where everyone is portrayed as a nitwit to boot). Easy to see in Scarlet herself.Only a little harder to see in the other target of the book: Catholicism. Melanie as Madonna. The Klan was anti Jew and Black, but moreso anti Catholic. And especially Irish Catholic as a remnant of English bigotry. That's glossed over more here than in the book but the institution of the Church is metaphorically overlain on that of the South: A huge, arrogant institution, highly socialized, economically strong, conservative, arrogant, subjects millions and so on. Such institutions always collapse locally but have the remarkable ability to reinvent themselves.So we have Scarlet, the South, the Church and an addition, unintentional layer: Hollywood. This film redefined Hollywood by borrowing the same qualities noted in the film: if you reach critical mass, you can invent your own reality -- if you get that reality wrong (a certainty) then you'll have the collaborative mechanisms required to make it right. In other words, if you have a good hook, and grand enough scope, you will succeed in creating a world. The South, The Church, Hollywood.And one can see this here. This project is not good, and by no stretch can it be judged -- on its merits -- the most successful movie of all time in terms of both dollars and viewings. Selznick was a genius: he realized that if you make a big enough fuss and made no huge errors, a film becomes an event. That event redefines film. So, for example people will flock to see `Spiderman' because several hundred million dollars was spent on promotion. They will `use' this film and reinvent their memory to recall it as `good.' Same as the Church.And the same, incidentally, as Microsoft. Their products follow the same world-creation event model. Take no changes with the product, just avoid known errors. Tout it loudly enough (Microsoft's promotion to development ratio is precisely that of Hollywood's and uses the same firms), and people will adjust their reality to one you create. Or recreate because you got it wrong the first time.Gone with the Wind is actually not about going, but sticking around. Which brings us to the second interesting element: Leigh. She's a sleight actress here -- projects like this don't work if the actor is truly gifted. But then she went on to be in the landmark `Streetcar.' These two projects are essentially the whole of her life. But by Streetcar, she had taken the jumble of damaged components that compose her and learned to wear them outside, so we can see. It is a remarkable transformation that Brando exploits. It makes her life worth living (pain and all) and Hollywood worth tolerating (event films and all).",Null,13,24,25 June 2002
The Butterfly Effect," Away from the Flame
","Things like this depress me. It panders; its stupid; it treats us like children.This comes from the tradition of folding the narrative by reinventing things we have seen. Probably the most celebrated of these is 'Rashomon,' and the most famous 'Groundhog Day.' The idea is usually one of untrusted narrators through whose minds different realities flow. Sometimes the rewriting only happens after we leave the theater having seen something that reinvents what we've seen inside.It has to be clever. It has to be bold to engage us. 'The I Inside' and 'Primer' are so much more intelligent than this (and harder to figure out), so they actually engage.So I will advise you to stay away from this because of how dumb the writers believed you to be. But there's probably a more fundamental reason. You can be outside a story, or inside. Or you can be both, but it always starts with the outside because that's where you naturally start, even with your own life. The artists involved have to help you in. That's job number one. They can't do it by assuming you in, as is done here. Its lazy and it doesn't work.

Alien vs. Predator," Pyramidal
","Spoilers herein.I've made a study of what differentiates the Alien films. Their differences are a concise film school. Now this here is a different beast. It is a simple essay, not an ordinary long form film. You might like it because of the very idea, or the plot device of switching the ordinarily hunted into a trusted partner of the hunter. The previous films form the foundation for this one which must become smaller.That `pyramidal' notion is behind the one thing that did interest me here. Once you become familiar with the monsters (as we all are), and you know that the human situation must stay in the expected rut, then the only way to innovate is in the novel setting.What we have here is an alien pyramid that is part `Cube' part `Thirteen Ghosts,' something that mechanically resembles an orrery. We're even told about it being a synthesis of three 'races' of pyramids.  A good idea, down to the allusion to the shaft as one of the mysterious `air shafts' of the Cheops pyramid.

No Country for Old Men," The Clean Dirty
","How can I be disappointed by a good movie?I suppose I should say at the outset that this IS a good movie. You should see it. Its all about the writing, though.McCarthy's writing style comes after the Clancy/Ludlum model where things are diced into parallel episodes but unified in a grand arc driven by the cosmic principle that good triumphs and the bad guys get punished. This has become the cinematic norm, so whenever we pass through a scene-story, we know how it fits in a universe powered by a machine of justice.McCarthy has the intelligence to open the world, introducing into his novels the notion of apparently unraveled justice. We do have episodes. We do cling to some of the traditional formula: drugs, mob boss, the hunted, the west, the champion of justice. Each of these is used conventionally. Its no accident that Tommy Lee was selected to play the part, because we assume he will be the hunter from Fugitive, the agent who adjusts things to their proper order. Its no accident that all the ordinary pieces of this are made from the same stuff we'd find in airport books and their coincident movies.But its also no accident that McCarthy's books draw on the cinematic revolution. His images assume that you can see, not imagine. That way he can do two novel things. One is that he can show by not showing, for instance Moss's actual death. This separation between the imagined and the shown also allows him to elevate the imagined into substance. This film, for instance, starts and ends with annotative stories. They aren't directly linked to the action we see, but they have agency, power and they come close enough to being parallel episodes that we accept them as relevant.The other cinematic notion that McCarthy uses is noir, and I am certain that it is what attracted the Coens. They've spent their entire careers surrounding this notion, probing it from all directions. In absolute terms, what defines noir is the notion that the machinery of the universe is arbitrary and linked to the act of viewing. That 'viewing' piece has stickiness, because it involves us in what happens to the characters in the world we witness. McCarthy makes us explicitly complicit in the unraveling of ordinary, even expected justice. Its all wonderful. Its all perfectly comprehended and presented by the Coens. Its clean. It works. Its poetic and deserves to be near the top of anyone's list. If nothing else, the Coens know how to end a movie, probably the most elusive element of narrative skillcraft.So why am I unhappy?Because the Coens play a special role in my film life. They are the folks who play games, who explore, who tease and question. They are the Bob Dylans of film. When they create something it has all sorts of extra annotative froth in it, usually cinematic in nature. Its baroque introspection where they pile twisted ironies on top of dishonest self-reference. They are the master of woven layers, of meandering narrative stance. They break where breaks are needed and not expected. They write their own vision, and clearly have that vision first.Here, they start with someone else's vision already written. Here they stick to the clean, the bones not the coral. Here they deliver directness. Their ambiguity is direct, not tangled. Yes, I can celebrate what they've done here. And sure I can say that they did well. But isn't that what we have Ang Lee for? PT Andersen? Sean Penn? When the Coens simply rely on their competence, they steal from us the things that they uniquely can do: confabulate and confuse reality.

District 9," Bean Encounters
","This was on the positive side of science fiction for me, if only because not everything was extreme. There was no flawless babe, no effortless superhero nonsense. It was obvious that there were efforts to have some distinction.But we are still stuck with your run of the mill evil megaweapons corporation with secret labs and thoroughly compliant technicians. An alien society that has superior technology but all of which looks like something we already have or have 'invented' for our prior movies. A set of social and human commentaries that I encountered in pulps fifty years ago. And gosh, we must, must, must have anthropomorphic aliens, right? With nerdy, precocious kids?The narrative stance was strange. It is cast in the form of an investigative journalism report about two years after the events. Much of it is clearly meant to be read as found or stolen footage from surveillance cameras. Some of the scenes which clearly cannot be, are still treated as if they were with annotations. Interwoven with this is conventional observation, though often with human or creature blood spattered on 'lenses.' I assumed that with Jackson's sponsorship, WETA would do its most amazing stuff. They did not. The compositing and creature animation is fine, but that WETA ethic of advanced spatial camera movement is gone. Perhaps it was just too hard with all the production players. That's the usual barrier. But it may also have been the knowledge that too novel a camera would have messed with the faux documentary feel. So we are left with holding tight to a few of the amplified strokes. The main character is true enough, ordinary and klutzy in a way that works. It would have been better for me if we had been given more than the trivial connections he has with his environment. The wife, father in law, coworkers are stereotypes albeit with a South Africa twist. The technology is highlighted, but never explored. There is a balance among mystery, novelty and comprehension that 'Alien' got so right they defined that balance. A new balance is not justified here and I am left unsatisfied. In particular: the heads up computer displays were pretty cool animations. But here was the place where we could have had some hints of organization, some coherence. This, I believe, if done well could have spawned a subculture of fans, like those who pore over plans of the Enterprise, or who map plot implications of Memento. What we get is what we have seen before and roughly promised from lumbering technology companies like MNU.So like the hero, it is good enough, but it leaves us on Earth while the interesting promise sails away.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,10,18,17 August 2009

No Julie Taymor here: her stage skills do not translate well to the screen and in fact every single cinematic device here is borrowed, many even from 'Sound of Music.'But its still an enjoyable experience. The girl is pretty and there are is a staging of a wedding that will color fantasies for a hundred years. The songs, even in their versions here, are gloriously catching. They all seem to have been designed to walk, walk, walk, hold, so even by listening you are dancing; the prancing we see is only a reminder, clothes exaggerated to highlight the important parts.The only affecting thing in the performances is that Meryl gives the impression that she is having fun. And we enjoy that, especially a bit after the credits start. She's near sixty and I imagine has a long life yet.

The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," The Source of the Imagining
","I read many criticisms of this. Apparently, there is a fundamentalist Tolkien fan club that rivals the Austen group in assailing anyone that deviates from the written word; by this I mean the last rewrite of Tolkien'sI never could finish any of the books. What enthusiasts claim as masterful world-making, I saw as a description of different types of beings with ordinary politics behind unexplained excuses for repetitive quests. So take this comment as one from someone looking for a good film experience rather than for allegiance to the books.I think Peter Jackson is important in the world of film. Yes, not a showman or an exploiter. Not even particularly a storyteller but a film visionary.Look at this and think about how the space is rendered. The dimensionality of it is striking, in places unique and generally it advances the state of epic cinematography.When you make a work of art, you at least have to have a central organizing mind to make the world and its presentation coherent. It is not sufficient to borrow the mind of the writer, who is basically a statistician of emotion. Instead, Jackson has given us his own spatial organization, around which this is built. In fact, where Lucas built his own special effects company to render objects, Jackson has created his own, WETA, to render space.We've known the influence of his introduction of dimension in the earlier films. By this I mean both the way depth is used in staging a scene and how the camera moves within that space. You can see a difference in the early films compared to what came before, and the very quick use of similar techniques in other big budget films. It is extraordinary. We are working on a project to annotate and track just such cinematic influence. Some of these non-Jackson films even used his WETA shop.Here I think they advanced the art in three ways.— Needless to say, we have sets with more vertical dimension and complexity than ever. The final set is amazing, with apparently infinite levels above ground, while simultaneous action is going on in apparently infinite levels underground. The camera seems effortless, but pay a little attention and see that new craft is used in the way the camera is placed and moves to allow us to comprehend where are, where we are going and what is flowing through.— Creating a 3 dimensional movie is still bad business. The biggest challenge is that the stereoscopic projection handles movement with depth well only if it is horizontal. Vertical movement just seems jaggy, especially in comparison to the horizontal movement and most especially so when the movement is along the z-axis. The solution to this is to shoot the whole project at double speed. We don't need the extra frames for the horizontal stuff around which cinema evolved. But we do for all the new dimensions WETA is mastering.— Adding in vertical action scenes is likely harder than you would think. We have two here that qualify, meaning that they are not just action within a dimensional set, but that the causal dynamics of the action are interwoven with the dynamics of the space. So the battle with the dragon doesn't qualify. The fight with the spiders does, but I believe that uses the paradigm we saw in 'King Kong.' I cannot check it but I think one of the falls through the trees was blocked quoting a fall by the ape. The new paradigm is the barrel fight; you know they have mastered this when they can insert humor that works.I am okay with the inserted love story because it is so pure, archetypal in most ways. The only real problem I have with this visual thrill ride is the way the gold coins were handled. The basic idea is great: merge a complex threatening environment with the complex kinematics of a serpentine being. This is done by merging the flows of the coins with the flows of the dragon. Only WETA would have such an ambitious goal. You can see how they changed story elements around to have Smaug be gold coated toward the end of the sequence and have gold flow from scales. They obviously did not have time to have the gold slake off as flat elements. But long before that they compromised.The way the scales on the dragon move through the sequence is precise, just as plates would. But the way the coins move as objects is not. Coins are disks and packings of coins will have internal alignments making feet shift randomly. The coins when they flow down slopes will combine tumbling with sliding as both sliding and lower locations are lower energies.The point is that we can see that WETA wanted to do something advanced and clever here. But the costs would have been high and the funders didn't see the value. Shucks. Instead we get the coins and random objects rendered using ordinary particle physics — as if they were sand. This is the second major failure in this vein, since the original visionary of 'Brave' was fired over the rendering of snow as hair.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,15,23,4 January 2014
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Place
","I've seen two modern westerns in close proximity: this and '3:10 to Yuma.'The main thing that defines the western is the notion of the western grand spaces on men, always men, purifying certain traits and dynamics. From that you get specialized versions of the usual stories, often about honor and revenge.Within that there are few decisions to be made: which story, how pure, how close to cling to cliché (not necessarily bad), and most importantly what balance to put on the man versus the place.Usually the decision is to focus on the man. That's served the Hollywood fame machine well for almost a century now. Its the choice made by the 'Yuma' folks, and its pretty ordinary; the only difference is in this guy (Crowe) versus that one, say Wayne.The choice that was made here is far better. Its more abstract than usual. It pretends to be more focused on men than usual, two men as is the case with 'Yuma.' But in fact the emphasis here is on the place. Its the place, the spaces and visions that define the urges and qualities that these men absorb. It allows for the thing to be visually oriented and Deakins is up to the job. He learned this working for the Coens.The way this emerges is about story, Jesse (like Clyde Barrow) having become a legend through media exposure. The perspective is folded: we see a man who is cursed by what he sees of how others see him. (His undoing even leverages this: the historically accurate scene of him admiring a train picture and exposing his back.)The characters work, and the best we've seen Pitt in eons. But its the presentation of the world through what we see that matters. We enter the story not by getting the world by observing men and deducing the world; we see the world as they do and can see how it shapes them, and the tragedy we see unravel. Both this and 'Yuma' celebrate the kernel of honor in an extraordinary thief. But here you are in on the shaping. Its a noir idea, and much more welcome than mugging in chaps.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,9,17,2 March 2008
Remember the Titans," Top Gun meets the Mighty Ducks but avoids Dr King
","Spoilers herein.A travesty.Sports thrive because they simplify reality. Anyone who believes they can learn important life lessons from sports doesn't know much about life. (Sports can be readily justified by other means.)Films thrive because they simplify reality -- unlike books which can amplify reality. It is in the very nature of film (quite apart from the Hollywood machine) to abstract, simplify and theatrically enhance for effect.This is all well and good -- films and sports -- when we want to exercise our minds and bodies. But when we cast the huge truth of the world in these simple terms and call it truth, well there's a big problem. Just think, there are millions and millions of people for whom this film (and many like it) will convey the reality of what racial struggle was all about in the sixties and seventies.Here, all the whites (except the dumb fat kid who clearly doesn't know better) are ignorant racists. All the blacks are noble victims. All it takes to solve the problem is some Marine Corps discipline to get these kids to know each other. If it were that simple, we would have shed the problem long, long ago. It wouldn't bother me if this were a cartoon, or a simple morality play (like say `the Contender'). But this is represented as REAL.

Batman Begins," Mildly Psychotropic
","Those expecting a fine experience based on prior Nolan projects, even Bale ones, are bound to be disappointed. I was.There are only two redeeming elements here. The first is the mildly radical cutting of the action scenes, at least those involving fights. This technique is usually used when the budget requires confusion in details. Here it to underscore the psychotropic nature of the whole film experience.And the second pleasure is the folding of that psychotropic notion: the hero faces his fears through a hallucinogen; the plot revolves around loosing that hallucinogen to the public at large (the Batman comics always has Gotham stand for all of the world) inexplicably causing them to kill each other rather than just blissing out or having a bad day. Don't they know that about 30% of all urban livers do this anyway?And the third fold is the notion that we the viewers are partaking of that same substance. At least that's the way Nolan's sketch stood when he committed to the film. And it is the way the thing begins, until into the story creep Hollywoodisms: the first is Bruce falling into the ice as consequence of 'losing situational awareness.'Caine was once a fine actor, but since coming out of retirement, his edge is gone. Freeman was never an actor, just a friendly prop. But as the movie becomes more and more 'Goldfinger'-like, the real miscue as an actor is Katie Holmes. She has no presence at all.And try the Harrison Ford acting test on her. This is a well known problem with people that cannot act. They try so hard that their conscious mind does all the work, but their inner self just doesn't believe it. So you get the right side of the face going through all the motions and the left side remaining placid, as if it were in suspended animation.Look at Katie's face, especially at the end. Notice how Katie's dead face is on her left, asleep and her character's lines are spoken only on the right. And those lines! They concern identity: you aren't who's inside you, you are how you act.The Coens actually put actors like this in positions so they can dump on them. Nolan isn't so clever or cruel. I guess he thought he was getting the actress of 'Pieces of April,' someone larger than the role.

Blue Crush," Cinematic Water
","Spoilers herein.I was blown away by this little gem, because of how purely cinematic it is.All the good parts are framed by a weak story that started out at least competently formulaic but has been so sliced and diced by the producers that none of it makes sense. No matter. Really, no matter because the water scenes make the time more than worth the effort. But it must be noted that while the story (and acting and dialog) is all disposable, it respects the sexuality of the girls. They are in bathing suits, and look nice but not even once is there a prurient shot. Not once is there an attempt to slip into a coy, seductive wiggle. And that's remarkable indeed.But it is not the thing that makes this trip worthwhile.
Not all of life does well in translating to cinema. Some things are inherently more cinematic than others, and the stuff that is (and is easy to do) comes pouring over the hapless moviewatcher: explosions, car chases, macho strutting and the related violence. And of course a specific type of sexual, cool open (usually submissive) femininity. In fact, because that sexual presence is so cinematically effective, it has defined societal types and expectations. That's another story, one we will avoid here except to already have noted that this film made a deliberate effort to steer away from sex in order to only have one cinematic center.And that's the architectural water. Structured, moving water is the most cinematic thing in existence. It is also an incredible challenge to film, but the few times it has been explored, the results have sometimes been striking. Even in the otherwise horrible `Hard Rain,' even in the deeply flawed `In Dreams,' even in the melodramatic `Titanic,' the movement of camera with water comes close to a visually spiritual experience.I live in a surfing town, and in 1967 saw `Endless Summer.' But in that and all subsequent surf movies, what you get are moving portraits, not cinema. Here, we move to a whole nother level. The camera is above us, it is under us, it is _us_, it chases us, it anticipates us. I have made a minor study of how different projects move the camera within dancing (and in Ang Lee's case, within fights). The same techniques are used here as we participate in the dance between this athletic girl and these immense hydraulic beings.I do not know for sure who did what, but I confidently surmise that this achievement is the result of a true story of girl power in Hollywood. The editor in this case is Emma Hickox. Aside from what we see on the screen, we know she is a remarkable cinematic mind if only because of her parents. Her mother is the still working (at 85!) editor who changed the world of visual imagination with `Laurence of Arabia.' Her father is the fellow that made one of the most intelligent films about films ever (`Theater of Blood'), but sadly unrecognized as such.Watch what Ms Hickox does with the compositions of the eye as we envelop the enveloping water. Watch how cleverly she establishes our place with our ear at the beginning of these sequences and keeps us aurally, mentally stabilized while the eye dances. Amazing, simply amazing.My only criticism is probably something beyond her control. We only needed to see the flashback sequence of the younger Anne getting her head bumped once. It must appear eight or ten times, every moment we have to be bludgeoned into recalling that she is frightened.See this film. It advances your visual imagination far beyond what `Perfect Storm' ever could.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.",Null,11,17,16 August 2002
Before Sunset," Reluctance
","Finally, Linklater does something with his talent. His strength in the past has been to shape the form of his films to match the subject. At least that's been true when the subject is the tentativeness of existence.He's done well enough in the past, but since his characters were aimless his projects inherited a meaninglessness. Where he tried to impart introspective layers with 'Waking Life,' those layers were trite threads of fake profundities. Well, never mind. Artists aren't required to be particularly smart  even about who they are and what they do.What is required is the ability to discover and convey something that resonates. Usually in films the resonance is a sort of nervous recognition in the characters and situation. Sometimes, the manner of the film, the nature of the world presented is enough to engage. Such is the value of Kieslowski  and how he managed Delpy.This film tries something different, something commonly attempted and almost never achieved: the direct drama of discovery between two people. This hosts the construction not in any story or setting or even situation, though they are all employed in the service of the goals. Instead, the whole thing revolves around the tentative motions toward intimacy between two people.Why this usually fails is because of the unwieldy mechanics. In order to seem real (most reviewers call this film 'veristic') the dramatic projection has to be hyperreal, but not so much that it appears artificial. So how do you dramatically amplify lightly probing intimacies? Its all in the most subtle hesitations of the actors, in that range beyond what 'really' might happen and them forthrightly telling us what's happening.The construction is perfect: all movies are about other movies. In this case, we literally have the last chapter of the romance as a movie with movie values and memories. More, those are romantically captured in a book that one character carries from the previous movie into this one. Thus, all their discussion, all their reluctances are about having the present film approach the previous one.I'm astonished at the perfection of the idea, as astonished as I am about how well the two, especially Delpy, support it.

Saving Private Ryan," Littoral
","Every once in a while, I go back to watch films that were celebrated in their time. These have to be films I saw when they were newly nested in their warm buzz, and which were conveyed as if they were a privilege. This is such a film, one that can perhaps serve even as the exemplar. It was touted as (at last) a serious film by Spielberg, chapter two of his 'real' film which marketed the holocaust. It had Hanks, who it should be recalled was more uniquely respected then than now. It dealt with a sort of real history with direct pulls on patriotism and something called valor, in a way that would make Sinatra and Wayne blush (or at least hiccup). And its first 20 minutes was chocked full of effects that worked and conveyed a meaning of confused dread. It moved us all  how could it not?  and allowed the filmmaker to lazily move through an ordinary story, staged as if it had a different production crew.Seeing this again in my own context and with the objectiveness of distance, I am amazed at how effective that opening section is, and how typically bad Steven the rest is. That first part is tense, tight and close. It is horrible without forcing us so close that we recoil. You know, one of the biggest challenges in film-making is to introduce the audience to the world they will live in for perhaps a few hours  the film and the long tail of recalled experience afterward. Usually the filmmaker has only a few minutes. Some  especially when a strict genre film is coming  can even do it during the title sequence. We are prepared for this entry voyage; it is part of the contract we make when allowing a filmmaker to transport us. I cannot recall a film that took this much time to prepare us. Perhaps 'Pan's Labyrinth,' but that setup was disjointed. So I have to admire Spielberg's craft in putting together a session that has impact, though it is all tone and no narrative. And I have to admire his ability to understand and exploit that twilight area where we are primed for such a thing. And then 20 minutes in, we start to ask why, why engage us? Why open us to be ready for something that matters and serve us bread?Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",Null,13,23,16 November 2008
The Pianist," Film and Music, Pain and Fire
","Spoilers herein.Nearly any film is for me a double experience: the watching and the post-coital rumination. That second phase can make the experience worthwhile even when the film itself is ordinary or poorly done.But it works the other way as well, especially when a film is designed for discussion: the film delivered with so many opinions that themselves are ordinary or poorly done. This film comes so charged. Szpilman wasn't `Jewish enough' to be the center of an important holocaust film, goes the most ordinary and loudest of them. I suppose there are some things about the commingling of descriptive art and definitive life to be said there. But one likes to have more freedom in post-film thoughts and that whole topic is dominated by the sorts of reflexive responses manipulated by film.There's a second prepackaged topic concerning whether `Schindler' was better or `worse.' I don't consider Spielberg's film a holocaust film at all: he lives in a happy world, where justice and right (and lots of other happy values) always triumph. His observations are always external. His goal is always to tell a story, a stance that furthers the distance between his films and reality. Polanski's project has no story at all, merely a life of accidents. His camera is within the artist's personal space. His own mannerisms are Eastern European and depressed, congruent with what he shows. (Speilberg's Schindler really did have the silk unctuousness of the East, but as observed from California.) So I credit Polanski's vision as having more historical credibility than Speilberg's, knowing that despite the best efforts of us all to avoid having practical history made by the movie marketplace.(One exception, where Polanksi is offensively theatrical: when Szpliman runs from the destroyed hospital, he faces a street of desolation as far as one can see, `High Noon'-wise.)Much more interesting to my mind is the portrayal of an artist. Polanski has always been deeply self-referential in his work: always there is an examination of the artist within the art. And I make a minor hobby out of collecting film experiences that do this with music and mathematics because I have some personal experience to work with. For those who don't know: Polands pride is Chopin, who invented a relationship to the piano that not only defined modernity but reinvented everything about musical performance. (Film would follow this lead in 1941.) Chopin built pieces designed to be bent in performance, designed with empty rooms that a pianist could explore. Unlike, Bach for instance, where the magic of the performance was in attuning to Bach and his intent, the performer of Chopin really could bring his own soul to parity with God. Szpliman was a strong pianist, and therefore more than a national character, instead a reflection of the Polish heart.Here, we  watch this man compromise his own pride, eschew his religion, run away from every opportunity for dignity in order to keep his hands warm to play another day; and not just play, but play on the radio for Poles. So during this painful journey, we assume what we are meant to in films about tortured artists: that the pain we are watching will be transmuted by this man into great art that will lift us all. His own personal denigration - what is done to him and the denigrating choices he makes - are worth it overall.This is where the fatal pessimism of Polanski stops, because he doesn't let us know the musical truth. This is not Szpilmans playing of course, but not much unlike him. Szpilman was a `safe' player, one who never had the strength or desire to add much to Chopin. That's why he was on the radio: his `interpretations' were unchallenging and palatable. But he would never have been considered an artist of note at all if he had not survived the perfect brutality of the Germans, whose own music, though sentimental was constrained in ways that Chopin's never was. The payoff is supposed to be that after his trials, the artist is now - theoretically - capable of expressing the pain and yearning of the world. That we are meant to so think is clear from the end, where he plays with the glow of Dreyfuss from `Music of the Heart.'Ah, but not so. The sound we actually hear throughout is by Olejniczak, a similarly ordinary man. Szpilman did not in fact come through a better artist, but much worse: a meek pianist. `Shellshocked,' postwar contemporaries would say. Contrast this with Artur Rubinstein. Jewish Pole of the previous generation, and the first giant to explore Chopin's rubato. He had his own dark nights, but not because the world was inhospitable. Listen to his recordings (freely available) compared to Szpilmans (hard to get) or even Olejniczaks on the soundtrack. These are two different universes. One is merely pleasant, the other life-altering.Polanski has made some great films (including the under-appreciated `Ninth Gate'), and his thinking through of the intellectual reach of a project is extensive but he has ultimately let us down here. Implicit in much of modern Jewishness is the triumph of enrichment of the people through their tribulation. Perhaps that is true, but this film undermines the idea when selecting Szpilman as metaphor.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.",Null,13,24,21 April 2003

Seabiscuit," Pairs
","Spoilers herein.Post 9-11 effects are nowhere as profound as in the wave of movies just hitting the theaters. This week, I have seen two films whose foundations are the upswelling of national identity since the attacks. But they are quite different. The first was 'Red, White and Blond' which is lightweight, celebrates the simple platitude as truth, and has that respect for the stupid but well-meaning that characterizes Republican strategy. Enormously endearing, and I cried at all the patriotic parts.And then there's this. Strong metaphors for a broken country given a second chance. A morality tale about the little guy against moneyed interests, about healing, about real compassion. In this case, the metaphor is made plain: history's popularizer David McCullough does a faux 'Ken Burns' documentary within which we peer into this story of America revitalization from the destruction of greed. This is the other side of the patriotic coin, and we all cried at the patriotic parts here too.Both of these are extremely well engineered, almost overengineered. In this one we have one of the simplest devices in the book, the rule of twos:We have two men in whose hands this healing is wrought. The heart of the project is the heart of these two characters. They sought out two of the three male actors capable of a certain technique for this: the ability to anticipate the next scene. Acting is not the challenge of creating a character at all, it is the challenge of doing things that induce you as the viewer to create a character. That means that the actor has to create and maintain a channel between himself and the viewer; there are different styles, techniques and philosophies to do this. One -- rare but effective -- technique is to anticipate the future; it is what Chris and Jeff know how to do.In this game, they each create two persons, the character who lives in the now of the story and the actor who knows that something is coming -- that it will all turn out all right if only the being of the actor can get past the flaws in the being of the character. They expose both of these beings to us and we watch them both. When we see Jeff's face in closeup -- and he literally tells us its all about the future -- we see half of him really does live in the future. These are superb actors, chosen because they each bring this linkage to the next scene. Cinematic storytelling, folks. Which, it must be said, has something to do with the strategy of racing that is described in redundant detail: let him see the partner so that he can race ahead.Pairs throughout: we have the pair of the damaged: horse and rider, both as metaphor for the nation. This is so heavily and obviously pounded in, that it threatens the movie and only by repeated tests did they fine tune it: pushed only precisely so far and no further. 'Bagger Vance' is an example of one that went over the line. Robert Redford.The viewers have to be represented: here we have a pair of designated viewers -- standing in for us of course. The wife and the radio announcer. The wife duly soaks in the sweet platitudes and the radio guy (in addition to providing comic relief) provides an equally heavy metaphor for our own voyeurism. These bookends define the space for us to feel comfortable in. This announcer bit is also an example of repeated audience testing. It derives from the reporter-voyeur of the screwball comedy era, filtered through dozens of comedic versions in mostly baseball movies -- but with defining bumps in 'Best in Show' and 'Major League.' Again it was pushed precisely as far as audiences could take before they had a reaction. An example of too far is Jennifer Leigh's reporter in 'Hudsucker.Pairs: the pair of patriotic approaches, the pair for us as Americans, the pair for us as patient husbanders of the good (each as the actor/character pair), the pair for us as moviegoers.

1941," Fascinating Disaster
","Spoilers herein.Comedy is hard. When someone can't do it, it indicates that they are not really masters of their craft. Some of the bastions of Hollywood are embarrassed by this. Harrison Ford for instance, and here the widely worshiped Spielberg. Most of the failures at comedy are simple failures -- uninteresting. (Or they just work with an adolescent audience.) But this one is interesting.Spielberg is famous for his notion that films are not like books. They are not supposed to be intelligent and complex, but simple. He promotes the much studied theory of `high concept.' The idea is that any film should be comprehensibly described in 25 words. Further, in his own version of HC, the film is not only storyboarded, but is EXPLICABLE by the storyboards. In other words, the film exists first as a comic book, so MUST be without depth.The good news is that he can focus, focus, focus, and the product is heavily cinematic. You can understand his successes in these terms: `Jaws,' `Close Encounters,' `Raiders,' `Jurassic,' even his so-called `serious' films: `Schindler,' `Amistad,' the first 20 minutes of `Ryan.' I appreciate the fact that he can create a single vision and sustain it through the work in terms of an image vocabulary. So many directors seem to lack this skill. But his effect is always cheap, and its success in implanting itself in our minds and culture cheapens us.It is harder to see this flaw with films that we like, for instance the Indiana films. That's why failures like this and `Hook' are so important. It helps to remind us why we like stupid stuff when we think we are being serious. But most of us -- if the thing is at root supposed to be funny -- it has to be smart underneath. And it is why Spielberg isn't important to the history of film, except in adding some visual slang. Zemekis, the collector of the gags which comprise this film, is a lesser Spielberg. This same mentality is the core of `Gump.'John Williams does another of his shameless ripoffs of Bernstein, specifically `The Great Escape.'",Null,5,10,8 March 2001
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," The Unused Helo
","I saw this close to seeing the third Transformer movie, and the lessons are clear.That other film was unconstrained, had no coherence other than the external reference to the world order established by the toy manufacturer. This film in contrast is shaped, pruned from a single vision. Oh, the basic ideas are the same, though this subgenre involves some mental exercises of the audience to interpret what is going on. No matter what a nitwit Cruise is otherwise, he gets the value of control and within a narrow range can support it.That's why Brad Bird was the ideal man for the job. There are other paths to understanding the challenges of constraining the the world than an apprenticeship in fantasy animation, but that will do. The result is that this does the job of competently filling a couple hours in an empty life, without giving any sustaining value. But suppose you do want to watch this for lessons on constraint.The final fight, as the genre demands, is a monumental battle between two men with the fate of an entire world in the balance. It has to be brutal, and involve (at this point in the evolution) lots of third dimension action. (Third dimension here means height in the world of the movie.) It has to go on so long, have variety and such and such.In Michael Bay's hands, this would have involved every excess available. (I am thinking particularly of Arnold jumping onto and wrestling a Harrier.) You can clearly see that the special effects lab brought such a possibility to the production. At the beginning of the fight scene our small guy Tom chases the evil scientist into a parking garage with elevators. Everything about this is designed for the fight: there are no people and elevators go up and down with noir caprice. The thing is open and superbly lit. This is clearly what the CGI guys like and I'm sure what they brought to the project.But look just as our guys are approaching the garage, the helicopter that we have briefly seen earlier is landing on top of the structure. I have no doubt that storyboards had Tom elevating over the structure after we saw some ups and downs within. Likely, the ultimate drop (which wrecks a car) as proposed would have involved this device.What we have instead is still pretty silly as reality goes, but it is constrained within a single structure, whose behavior we understand and accept. It is all about decisions my friends, and when there is a steady hand and some conscious steering, we should applaud.+++I hate to point this out (because of the hate mail I will get), but this is the difference between Apple products and those of others. Others sell devices based on specs: bigger, faster, cheaper. More, more, more. And people buy those devices because who wouldn't want more? People go to Michael Bay movies because he'll just be more excessive than the last guy.Apple is all about delighting customers with a well designed experience. A bit slower for massive improvements in battery life? A bit smaller so it can be operated one-handed? Thousands of tiny decisions all guided by a single philosophy, all intended to add something to the richness of the experience.Is it an accident that Apple products are featured in the Bird movie while commodity electronics firms are featured in the Bay one?Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",Null,8,14,1 January 2012

What did you expect to happen? How did you expect to affect me?By then I was well into wondering why this movie was made. What did they think would happen? What did they expect to change in us?I ask because I use films in building a life, examining a self, exploring a mindworld. But I just could not see how this could be used for any of those purposes. It has one of my most valued performers, Kate. Her strength is in characters whose presentation she can comment on in the performance. Here, she is clearly trying to stretch into playing the precise opposite, a character that has NO external view, in fact no introspection at all. Its an interesting story what an actor believes acting is all about, but not enough to create real value.Unlike 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' this does not reveal a soul. It does not 'study' a character. Like 'Woolf' it has actorly pyrotechnics, but without the intended value, its nothing but a circus act, to show that something hard can indeed be done. It is deliberate I think, a film that you cannot find a purpose for about a life that is the same.It is interesting however as another example of husbands directing women they are in love with.

","I expect I will stick with Danny Boyle no matter what, because 'Sunshine' has changed me. I like what he does, circumnavigating zones of cinematic expression. He does it in the jumps from project to project, seemingly exploring both the depth at the center of each lake and its bounds.But he does it within each project as well, working the overlay among what we seem to need to keep straight as separate genres. I'm not sure I really understand much about the necessity of genres. Surely they are a narrative necessity: a film only lasts a short while and you have to insert yourself into it quickly, filling in all sorts of context along the way based on established assumptions. But there's also the familiarity of stories that goes beyond film, indeed beyond all art and forms the basis of action in life. Art merely acknowledges these stories and is allowed to play with them a bit. Not too much, mind you, which is why combining and overlaying stories is so effective. And that's what Boyle seems to understand so well. Its more than just being capable cinematically. He seems to find cinematic means in the overlap of these genre inspired strokes. In this case, its literally three genre-strokes in three acts. It isn't life-changing, but it is a bit exciting seeing how he can shift us from thrill to adventure to revenge to romance without too many bumps. Well, maybe that last one was a bit rough.But he takes chances. And he enlists his actors in them, so there is an overlap as well among himself, his actors and their characters.There was only one annoying thing here. When a character knows he is being stalked, and the stalker passes quickly in front of the camera so we know he is there but the character does not, there's this swoosh that first appeared in slasher films and is just lazy.(The shopping scene references 'They Might Be Giants.')Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,9,14,5 January 2008
Lawrence of Arabia," A Vision that Defines Itself
","A man has an inner drive that makes him peculiar and intense. He goes to the desert and falls in love with it and its people. Gaining powerful sponsors, he has a grand vision that he accomplishes by inspiring and directing thousands. But in a very short time, that grand work is compromised and disassembled by fat cats in offices who are concerned with different values.True of both Lawrence and Lean. The legacy of Lawrence is still in violent disarray (I write this a short time after the Sept 11 attacks on New York). But Lean's vision was saved, and what a vision! Of this picture, it can be said that it is perfect if only because it is so visionary that it defines its own rules.Lean's vision is also lean, with vast zones of sonic and visual silence -- several meditations on the unperceived. Though there is a story (who are you?) this is really a film of TE's 'Seven Pillars,' which creates a romantic vision of sculpted natural forces. So powerful a depiction that Islam experienced a faddish attraction in the West, a place now enjoyed by Tibetan Buddhism. That was before.See here the original Obiwan, every intonation, movement and dress. See here Peter O'Toole's personality become completely entwined with the character, who is as fictionalized by our eye as by Lowell's. See the most expressive, anthropomorphic train wreck in history.Watch a particularly interesting brand of acting by the 'Arabs.' Macho men are acting anyway, so an actor can play an actor when he lands such a role.The star of the film is the clever eye of God, not the clockmaker or judge of the west but the chess player of the mirage. Its face is clearest in my mind when the Turk holds TE down for torture and smiles. Its hand in the creaking of Feisal's tent -- who would ever imagine the wind acting?

City of God," The Three-Body Problem
","Spoilers herein.The first choice a modern filmmaker has to make is deciding who is the camera. Everything flows from that decision, inheriting already maturing visual vocabularies for each path chosen. It's very hard to be novel today: most interesting projects come from careful integration of a novel eye with a novel narrative stance - parallels, time reversals, untrusted narrators, etc. But here is something new, thanks to the creative incubator of Brazilian TeeVee commercials, one of the more vital pockets of popular art around.In this case, we have three characters: a narrator/photographer, a dancer, and a `pusher' who literally pushes the linear logic each step at a time. Each of these is represented by a camera philosophy (and accompanying editing style) which are mixed up helter-skelter. The most obvious is the notion of the `running camera' which sometimes looks at the road or away as it moves in frenzy.This is interspersed with a rhythmic camera. This camera (Benny's eye) is the one that permeated most: it is reasonable yet hedonistic. In the first few seconds, we are introduced to these two in masterful composition: the observing, recording chicken who subsequently runs with a following POV. This is mixed with the aggressive logic of rhythm. If opening shots are promises, this is a strong promise. Over time, the third eye is folded in, literally a folding of linear stories. Each is tightly linear until it hits a node, then goes off on a tangent or a new direction usually paralleling something already seen. Garrison Keiller is the master practitioner of this sort of storytelling; not chopped Clancey-style; not shuffled Tarantino-like; but direct until hitting a capricious nexus, then direct again.All three are shooters. The story is irrelevant: kids killing kids, albeit sometimes viscerally. The characters are literally disposable. The experience is nominally about the place, but it is really about how we are shown the place. I do not think this will reinvent film like a few projects have (from Welles, Tarkovsky, Greenaway, Kurosawa, even recently Luhrmann) but it is a visual adventure worth taking and a fresh experience.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.",Null,14,25,9 March 2003

","Steve Jobs, we're gonna miss you in the movie creation business.Of all the things that Jobs is credited with, the one that matters in the creative process is the notion of parallel metrics. In the computer business, he'd (with much advice) draw up a set of traits for a product and then independently seek excellence according to each list. It sounds obvious but this isn't the way it is normally done; usually you have one trait you sell and you attach others done well enough to not ruin the mix. So in computers, consumer electronics and films.Ah, in films. Within the first few minutes of a film, you can pinpoint the one thing the filmmaker is trying to do, the one value around which everything else is assembled, often with just passable competence. Pixar is different. They have several lists, several things that need to be as perfect as possible.So its an odd thing, reading reviews of Pixar projects. The movie press is set up to address one value per film, and we as readers of this material have come to limit the way we actually see. And not just in the theater, but in elements of life as well. So thanks, Steve, for adding some dimension to the mix.I don't write reviews, only comments, so I don't feel obliged to run down each of the Pixar lists. Do it yourself, recognizing the obvious: story and character of course, nesting in values, rhythm, dialog and how it settles in the music and all that. Ordinary stuff.I focus on space and what I call folding. 'Folding' is the engineering of how the viewer is placed in the narrative and often it is a matter of careful engineering. The folding here is how two movie genres are mixed: one is the spectator sport where the spectators (with us included) are explicit. What the 'people' in the stands value is what we do, the excitement, the sportsmanship. The other movie is the one about city visitor to hick town and each changes the other. Its a rewarding enough formula, which I like best in the Swayze/Newmar 'Wong Foo' version.So the folding, while expert and lucid is a bit obvious.Its the use of space that blows me away in these things. How the dimensions are exploited. I've heard Lasseter talk about this. The thing that modern animation gives us is not that we can have talking cars, that's about 85 years old now. It is that once you design a scene, the camera can be anywhere and move in any manner.Pixar has a group that concerns itself with the visual excitement of such things. Its both a matter of excellence and novelty but the novelty cannot be too extreme or we reject the thing. Look at the shorts Pixar presents, in particular the one coupled with 'Cars,' 'One Man Band,' to see experiments in spatial adventure.Prior projects have been designed in some ways to exploit this dimensionality, especially 'Nemo' which doesn't have a surface, a horizon or much gravity. When you do these things, you can exploit space in only a few ways. You can use architecture, a technique that is challenging, rare and uniquely rewarding. You can have the action be the center of the dance. Or you can center the dance on the camera. Its the latter that is done here.You should watch it just for that, just for the way your mind's eye can be stretched. The group responsible for this list, these values did well, better than anyone else in animation for sure.

"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," An Ambitious Attempt, Not Consummated
","Spoilers herein.Ang Lee is one of two best mainstream directors working today who has deliberately worked in different styles, genres, artistic philosophies even. (The other is Ridley Scott.) Here he tries to inject art and majesty in a common vehicle. To remain true to the vehicle, he must use a thin story (though with numerous threads) and an understated acting style. I think this understated focus on faces helps make the subtitles more palatable than they would be otherwise. They are also larger and higher than normal, so one's eye doesn't have to jump so much from face to word. There's no question that this film was conceived with the western reading eye in mind.Lee pumps up the skeleton well enough with grand vistas and wonderful sets. The vision is surreal, which befits the mythical drama. In this and several other ways, he greatly surpasses the `Star Wars' feel. I must say that the final cave/warehouse was too theatrical -- it just didn't fit the rest. Some of the mattes are annoyingly fakey. The bambootop fight was ungraceful. But those are relative nits.What I wanted in this film was a whole new level in choreographing the CAMERA during fight scenes. I know this is a hot topic among directors just now, and think he is quite up to the challenge. He has already shown mastery of the inside, emotional camera, and the notion of bringing this to dance excited me. He teases with some spectacular camera movement, but it is always in a conventional frame. Guess he wanted to sell a lot of tickets instead of reinvent the medium.What I mean: with the fights, you have several characters, the two (or howevermany) fighters, the swords, the viewer and the camera. In a good film, some of these will merge. In a masterful production that merger will shift so that the camera is the sword, the viewer, then the fighter. (Here, the green sword IS a central fighter.) But add to that the complication of the idiom: each fighter and weapon is actually just a token for the master. Each fight is a battle between invisible characters, whose perspective the camera can also take.Lee plays these fights too safe, and it really annoys because he shows us ever so fleetingly what he can do. Sometimes, the camera is the sword, sometimes the master, but in teasing glimpses only. He's concerned with making sense, and that requires sticking to convention. Maybe as he gets older, he'll do this again, but with more multidimensional vision, more enlightenment, less concern for the general viewer.But check out the fight scores. This drummer knows the dimensions we're talking about, because he follows Lee's camera when it leaves the body. Cool.This film also has the sexiest literary scene I've ever experienced. (And that counts the lush 'Pillow Book.') It will be worth owning for that 15 seconds alone. Watch Jen's calligraphy, obviously done by a master. You won't ever forget it now that I've pointed it out. Watch the subtle camera movement. The whole of `Quills' in a few seconds! That reading eye again.",Null,13,19,17 January 2001
JFK," Cinematic Realities, Lolita's Vision
","Spoilers herein.I have my own theory about film. There is always an explicit acknowledgment that what you are seeing is a film, distinct from reality. Many films incorporate that recognition into their being; the simple ones are just films about films and filmmaking, but there are other sophisticated ways of self-reference.It is my belief that there is a constant `distance' in these matters. So for example when we have a fantasy film like `Spy Kids' that has a film world within it as part of the story, the distance between that inner film world and the film we watch (the distance between the world of Floop and that of the Kids) is the same as the distance between the world of the kids and that of the us, the viewers. I think this is a matter of hardwiring in the mind.So it is no surprise to me to see how Stone has handled the three realities of this project. We have the reality of that day, burned into the memories of those of us that were around. We have a different `reality` that is abstracted from that by the hundreds of assassination investigators of all types. All of these, regardless of their credentials or position seem to have created not a reflection of reality but another reality altogether. Exactly where the line is between lies and wishful invention is lost forever for the thousands of people involved, from the hapless Arlen Spector to many of the witnesses.(Arlen himself would make a career out of cinematically informed faleshoods, most famously in his role in the Clarance Thomas hearings.)Stone has taken those two realities and added a third, an abstraction from both the reality and the hundreds of already abstracted pseudorealities. Stone's abstractions are completely cinematic: the nature of his Garrison has little to with the real guy and everything to do with Gregory Peck's Atticus Finch, down to the unctuous scene with his boy on the porch swing.And it has everything to do with rigid conventions of the film detective story, where `clues' have to be dramatically and visually exaggerated and narrative flow simplified.That's why Stone doesn't mind at all changing things radically from Marr, Garrison and Prouty: here, Ferrie actually confesses (never happened); Shaw really is a spook (we know now he wasn't); Bacon's character is gay and doesn't need hypnosis and drugs to `remember' a mention of the conspiracy. Stone doesn't mind, because his world is cinematic and that is the only way it makes sense in cinematic terms. That he really believes this himself (as opposed to the makers of `Forgotten Silver') is the really fascinating thing, but it makes sense because the world of film IS different.And it does work as a film. Stone's recognition of shifts in levels of abstraction is reflected in the variety of camera types, film media, camera positions and motions, narrative perspectives, even battling editing rhythms. It is a masterpiece of filmmaking, very much along the lines of `Citizen Kane' which dealt with the same issues of reality, invention and mixed cinematic narrative.Depending on what else I find from that year, I may put it on my list of the two `must see for cineliteracy' films of that year.Even though Stone really believes this stuff and takes it dead seriously, his intuitions still rule. So he selects one of the fakest actors available to play his narrator. To emphasize the fakiness, he uses flat lenses in his glasses. This is one of the biggest no-no's in all filmdom. Every novice knows you do not do this.Real glasses have curved surfaces in their lenses, fake ones are flat. Flat glasses have the disadvantage of reflecting the lights, crew and camera of the filmmaking process, something that Costner's face does hundreds of times. To a moviewatcher, this makes that character more like the figures in the courtroom model of the plaza than like us.In fact, the only realistic acting in the whole project is by Lolita Davidovich. Her piece is great.This film is bound to become famous again when Mel Gibson releases his similar fiction on Jesus, also leveraging conspiracy, also driven by the laws of cinematic narrative in the face of truth if need be.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,11,32,9 October 2003

","I don't know how many more of these kinds of movies I have room for. And how much tolerance I have for expert craft taking me to the edge of insight and stopping. The focus of this film is an aspergers-like solitary young fellow who, when he falls into the noir world, reacts with movie competence. There's more than a little early Clint Eastwood in the episodes, and more than a little later Welles in the noir. We never know whether the two lovers rejoin.What makes this so effective a film is that the manner in which it is put together reflects the character of what is inside. What we see is how we see. The thing is paced in the precisely calibrated slowness in edits to match the slowness of the character's external motions, and presumably his internal processes. Colors are more garish; optics are mixed. The novelty is that our perspective is different than usual. The normal form is that we are given some anchor outside of the poor sap we see buffeted around. Some friend, some deliberate camera persona, some ghostly cadre. Here, we subtly are placed inside the guy.Gasper Noe does this, and honks around with the form of the film to coincide. This captures us in an unprotected way. But when Noe does it, he takes advantage of our weakness and forces us to confront some nasty parts of ourselves.

Bolt," Locked Door
","This is a children's film in the modern mold. That means it has to have cinematic values that effect and impress, and at the same time sport an acceptable message. Usually it about the value of family and finding self; here it is both. That means that these films have a built in bicameral tension, one foot in the future, danger, adventure and the other in manufactured notions of domestic comfort.Regular readers know that I am a student of folded narrative, a simple example being what we have here: a film world within a filmed 'real world.' There are all sorts of narrative advantages that result from this device and they seem to work better when the film is animated. Something about acknowledged abstraction. The tip-off is in the first seconds where you see that the girl is redheaded.Supposing you can tolerate or are immune to the dangerous 'message,' this will be great fun.There's a sort of metastory here, like that one of fifty years ago when Disney changed the nature of cinema everywhere. Here it is Pixar  and specifically John Lassiter, changing film AND Disney.Pixar has three signatures; you can see them all here plus a quote.The first is the obvious: the ability to render and move three dimensional characters in ways that more acutely convey the dramatic effects. All of these ways have their origin in ordinary theater well before film. But here they are engineered to be conveyed in ways impossible with real humans.Pixar was the first and for a long time the only animation studio to actually worry about the story. Disney now in this does as well.Pixar still is the gold standard for experimenting with the use of space. I mean that both in the sense of framing the scene physically and with the camera. The combination of the two is especially advanced. As with the acting, the goal is to do things that work and enhance the goals of the narrative, but which are not physically possible with 'real' sets and cameras. You can see that used here, especially in the movie-within chase scenes at the beginning, which notably are more extreme than the rest in all three of these values.Quite apart from the general Pixar influence, you can see it in each of the three script teams.The basic script team owns the story with the pretty sophisticated notions of folding and redheads.The comic script team owns the gerbil. He's probably a quarter of the film and 80% of the laughs. You can see his importance in the folding as well: when you do something as here (where one character is 'bolted' in/into two folds), you need to have an observer who similarly spans the two. Hence the gerbil. But then he was turned over to the comic team.You can also see the influence of a third team, which I am sure came from Pixar. They own the pigeons. There are three main groups of three, plus others scattered around. Their rendering and motion can be traced all the way back to 'For the Birds.' All their jokes are Pixar in-jokes. All their mannerisms are more nuanced, and I imagine that they were actually used in educating the Disney crowd. In true selfreferential style, they left references in.For instance, when we first meet some pigeons we see the theatrical personalities in their head cocking. Then they talk about it and instruct Bolt in how to hold his head (to extricate from a fence). Later, we see a similar tutorial from the cat to the same character for begging. Students of animation will know this as an exercise to move Disney away from their similar keynote scene in 'Lady and the Tranp' of 50 years ago.There's the Nemo joke, tied to aliens and when we first see aliens in the 'new' film within, it uses a shot taken, yes, from Nemo which in turn is patterned after Ridley Scott's film. Not 'Alien' exactly but 'Bladerunner.'Check out how the 'moviewriter' pigeons send one off to get whole grain (which is not whole wheat) and how that is mirrored in the all-important introduction of Mittens.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,9,15,11 January 2009
2012," Foreground - Background
","When you make a film that is nothing but flavored special effects, when you make the matter of those effects into a character, you have two decisions to make.The first is whether you are dealing with object or environment. This is a fairly significant decision because two different technologies and craft communities are involved. If you choose to combine both, as in the Depp pirate comedies, they co-exist side by side with no narrative or conceptual link.I was impressed by the Transformers movies because they solved this integration problem in a clever way. They invested in objects but moved the camera so close to the objects and inquired so tentatively that the motion and metamorphosis seemed environmental. Here in this film we have the solution from the other end. The environment is animated. There are no special objects or entities, but there is a merger of foreground and background in that the environment is given agency. Many times, buildings or flying objects threaten our hapless but earnest fleeing humans. They don't emerge from the background to stand alone; they are simply the background interceding in the narrative.It is even the case that anti-objects have this behavior, specifically cracks and voids. In an early scene, a crack in the Earth just happens to find and separate a couple, starting a project in romance that the forces resolve just in time for the credits.This background-as-foreground is unique in my experience, is a deeply cinematic decision, and is an important advance in the art of imagination. That the story is dumb, even offensive is irrelevant. What's happened here is something that matters. It is as important as the dimensional advances Pixar and WETA have made.It is the beginning of a new world. In fact, as the survivors settle in Africa, they mirror a recovery of African ethnomathematics which also uniquely gives background structures agency, just as the Ishango bone indicatesThe other key decision the filmmaker must make has to do with the nature of the agency the threat has. This boils down to whether you go with the noir tradition or not. That tradition has a hapless, apparently random guy threatened by acts of fate that are coordinated by the existence and needs of the viewer. The threat, in other words, is the actual world. It is uniquely both American and cinematic.The choice was made here to stick closely to this tradition. It allows the narrative flow to be coordinated with the visual agency. Our random guy - played by random guy specialist Cusack - is literally chased by the hostile forces of nature for over two hours. It has all of the incidental trappings of traditional noir as well: he has written the provocation of fate that subliminally drives both the threat and the human response. 'By the book' as it were.We even have an expert in fate, a tulku Rimpoche (one of whom I have met), as a character blessing the celestial mechanics. The ringing of the bell as he encounters it is pretty powerful and is the scene that will stick with me.Those are the two big things to say about this. I noticed two smaller bits worthy of annotative comment.One was the explicit reference to 'Titanic.' It is there in dozens of ways. We have every effect from that film copied here and ostentatiously outdone. People sliding off a deck? How about people sliding off dozens of floors as buildings collapse? Ships turning as they sink? How about three: a cruise ship that bests 'Titanic' by quoting 'Poseidon .' Then an aircraft carrier that flattens the White House (at the same time outdoing 'Independence Day'), followed by an elaborate Ark that offers the obligatory drowning-in-flooding-compartment scenes. Lest we miss the reference, we see that Arc scrape another in precisely a Titanic way. We even have a literal poke in the eye at the studio which released 'Titanic.' The ark pokes Mount Everest, using the view from the Paramount icon.The last thing worth noting here is a small story weave. We have an obnoxious Russian oligarchist. He has left his babuska wife for a sexy blond, who we learn has been extensively modified by a surgeon we meet and who is engaged in his own triangle. This blond's triangle is formed by her relationship to Sasha, the rich brute's noble and handsome pilot.The joke is that the blond loves Sasha and regrets having been bodily modified by the sugardaddy. Presumably, she was on the path to traditional Russian matronhood. As Sasha fights to control the profoundly ugly Russian plane he mentions a movement; only later are we given the information that allows us to connect this sexually.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",Null,12,19,24 November 2009
The Number 23," The Hinge Between 2s and 3s
","You know sometimes when you see a movie, and you see the beautiful movie inside swimming to get out and probably drowning? I see this a lot with children: beautiful rich souls, with depth and insight who unwittingly are building barriers between their lives and themselves.This is really a good project, in the sense that it has a good soul, one worth spending time with. Its more than just the idea of the thing, or the rough outline. Its the way it seems to have been born, outside of the factory. That it has a poor expression shouldn't be counted against it. Really, would you rather have a stylish, amusing film with no soul, or the other way around? Films are little loves; the depth of commitment matters.The story here starts with a man and a book. The book is engaging. Over the course of the story in the movie, the story in the book creeps out of the book and overlaps with the man's life. Now this is a narrative device I call 'folding,' as it merges the world of the reader with that of the viewer and sweeps us into what we see.The idea behind this is that the work of art  the book or movie  can change the viewer or reader. Not just color or educate, but fundamentally alter the fabric of being and thence the fabric of the world. It can change fate, perturb the laws of the universe, transmute.What makes this an unsatisfying movie is that it appears about 2/3s of the way through that this is not the case. The story seems to imply  and uncareful viewers will believe  that there is an ordinary explanation, that the way things are isn't because a transmutation has occurred, but that a set of causes in the past is discovered. They were there all along, before encountering the book; the book has no agency in the world. At the end, that uncareful viewer will be unhappy. Perhaps even, this is what the director and actors believed the story to be.But pay attention to the way it is written, and by that I mean both the story and the film.Its entirely possible to see this movie as the story of the book changing this man's reality. And not in the simple way that he believes he is in the book, but in the magical way that his being  and entire past  is changed by it. There's a sort of superpowerful story that can do this.Yes, it will have some universal structure, some family of hinges, that it leverages because it has to expose the bones of the world in order to reshape them. Here, its a number hinge. I suppose that's a good choice, given what the viewing public thinks about the structure of the world: I saw this together with 'The Last Mimsy' which used visual faceted vision in the same way. And 'Pi,' 'Proof' and that mathematical excrescence 'Beautiful Mind.' All of these like numeric structure or pattern as illuminative of a worldly structure that we can grab.Tellingly, they always accompany this with massive writing, often on walls. Its the writing that makes the handles, you see.Here, its done with no sensitivity to delivered narrative, that connection to us. Blame the filmmaker. Its not as effective as 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang' or 'Singing Detective,' but as a structure, its pretty darn intelligent.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",Null,6,10,26 August 2007

Ghost Rider," Burned Out
","Superficially, this is yet another mildly interesting Marvel comic turned into an excruciating movie. When will these guys learn? When we stop buying tickets I suppose.The comic is mildly interesting for the way it targets a certain demographic. As a matter of mere accident, the devil, skulls and motorcycles have become associated with each other. Separately, power and flames. These by themselves, just the symbols alone, are enough to define a life for some people, so strong is the semiotic power they have accumulated. In a sense, this meme is the demon.The interesting thing about this is how that meme is coming home to cinema.The modern motorcycle gang was an invention of the movies, pure and simple. The history of the Hells Angels, name, style, leather jackets, even the type of bike (war surplus), is all from movies. (A similar thing had happened earlier with American gangsters emulating their film types.)Then that meme was colored by Peter Fonda's 'Easy Rider,' which overlaid an excuse, even a noble one, beyond a simply justified one, on the 'motorcycle culture.'From that movie manger, this sprung forth into tattooland and eventually into Marvel's marketing department. And now it comes back, Peter Fonda, his Captain America bike and all. The interesting thing is that it is all symbols and no narrative.That's the danger with comics in the first place that the temptation is to go with icons. The tradition is from stained glass and the role it played when people couldn't be bothered by words. Icons first, generating stories, rather than the way it usually is in film: the two coweaving each other.So we shouldn't be amazed that this taxi with one wheel goes only in circles.

X-Men: The Last Stand," In Need of the Cure
","I have the luxury of not being a fan of the comics, so I find no offense when some character's superpowers or origin don't match the 'book.' Also, I have seen enough Marvel-licensed projects to set my expectations low. In short, I was expecting almost nothing.The first two X-men were poor projects, but at least had *some* imagination. Sadly, it wasn't visual or cinematic. This lacks everything, but you can read all about that elsewhere. Here, all you'll find is some speculation about the root of thing: why it is rotten and probably unfixable at the core.The book depended on a the universality of differentness. The idea behind the notion of 'mutant' was that there were perhaps tens of millions of mutants including nearly every reader. Different, strange but talented beyond the norm in some usually unappreciated way. Spurned or at least misunderstood by parents and bosses.In this cosmology, we all live in a modified noir world, one that toys with the fate of a whole class rather than a single, accidentally selected individual (and his girl). When we see higher level mutants behaving heroically, they do it as representatives of us, or so the comics go.That's turned on its head here: lower level mutants are innocent pawns just as all the other types of people, soldiers, random motorists  whose idea was it to show that every car had children in it, then use those occupied cars as firebombs?And if the target demographic is 14 year old boys and those who wish they were, why use 40 year old women? Or is it not supposed to matter? Well, it didn't to me, but the complete lack of cinematic imagination says this needs to go away.The anti-mutating mutant was apt, though.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",Null,8,13,4 June 2006
The Lives of Others," Nests
","Regular readers of my comments know I go on and on about noir and folding. When I see these narrative techniques used, I often remark that the technique is wasted, because the film has no heft once it has charmed us into investing in it.Not so here. The thing we get from this is simple, the value of passion in art. We get it viscerally and it matters. The basic device is as usual, commitment to art as a commitment to a lover. We also get the common technique of mapping personal challenge into political challenge because you can 'show' it.The folding here is complex. Our watcher in the story is literally a watcher. We are getting a film written by the filmmaker that features a play and ultimately a book by the main character. The watcher and writer have other watchers, and indeed the woman has other attention concerning performance. We have writing or performing (in life, in sex, piano, play...) at every fold. Its very tight in its construction and effective at what it sets out to do. Quite apart from that, its timeliness in the US is apt. The subtitles I saw translated the spies as 'National Security Agency,' which as every American now knows performs very similar surveillance on its citizens, also without controls, and also for political purpose.

Good Will Hunting," Snark Hunting
","I admire films that shoot high and miss. But it really rankles me when a film pretends to shoot high, avoids doing so because of lack of talent, and lies to us in the process.There's great drama in the mere existence of an idiot savant. These are people who often are intolerable socially, inadequate in common thinking skills, and generally lead a cursed `elephantman' life, except for their celebration as (in this case) mathematicians. Instead, we're given a watered down likeable homeboy who has been abused. Oh and he has a photographic memory which is a separate pathology (the two never coincide). Depth discarded.There's truly deep drama in the mathematical problems good Will would be dealing with. But this would require a Nabokov, and his mastery of metaphor. Instead we get the koolaid version for dummies in some (as it turns out) meaningless scribbles and a bubble diagram. Depth is twice discarded. Believe me, this could be played up big; the power of a christ in some of the insights that are speculated -- the voice and eye of God.There's also common, but good drama in the dedicating of one's life to their gift at great personal sacrifice. We actually have some good films in this regard concerning musicians. Math is better since you don't even get the applause. Here the guy with the insights but lack of language would be codependent martyr with the expert in the formalisms but no vision. But too hard, so pass.I can attest that there are cinematic depths to be mined at NSA, MIT, even Southie in terms of the absolutely unique and strange feel of the places. How could this film have missed those dark assets and end up so totally without atmosphere?This movie got made for one reason only: Robin Williams saw a part for himself. Therefore, the previously described  ignorances are filled by an amplified  backstory so Williams can find himself after losing his wife. Pretty damned offensive given the possibilities.

The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Is It Magical?
","Spoilers herein.One hallmark of science fiction and fantasy is the creation of a world that includes to some extent the creator. That way, instead of inhabitants bumping around in a world, we get a complex set of interactions: some as a result of the world affecting the players, and some the other way around. Tolkien's work fits well within this tradition, in fact why it was so successful I think is the thoroughness with which he developed the magical laws. The reader not only understood that the magic had power, but had some notion of how it worked. That allowed the reader to exist both at the level of Frodo and the magical level of the wizards and demigods.That's the soul of the books; not any episode, not any `theme' about brotherhood or hope or any such sodapop.The first film of this saga impressed purely with the sheer ambition of the project, and we now have the second one. It is fun watching, just like `Speed' was in its day, but I'm unhappy with some of the choices that were made.With film, there are specific ways to span the two worlds, ways which a few filmmakers have been exploiting for a long time -- long enough for some of them to appear in mainstream films. Almost none of those techniques were used here. Nearly all the choices were ones that plant us firmly in the world of the inhabitants who are buffeted by the world's forces just like we as people are. This literally boils all the magic out of the books, and we are left with `Braveheart' meets `The Black Cauldron' except slightly more expensively done and with some monsters.The travesty is not that these choices were made to protect the investment in the films, but that so many Tolkien enthusiasts miss the point and argue about whether elves appear in the wrong scenes.Further to the philosophy of the film: the manner in which the characters deal with the camera is roughly equivalent to the relationship the readers' imaginative `eye' has with the text. In addition to being cast at the level of the adventures and not the magic, there are other problems. That stance is inconsistent -- the greatest offense comes in the middle of the great battle. Until then, the players have been dead serious. They've been in their lives, not characters in a movie that wink at us. But all of a sudden, we have a barrage of winking: the `surfing' move, the dwarf-tossing joke, the 007-like standoff on the bridge. All of these depend on us knowing it is a movie and the characters leaving their lives and knowingly entering the movie.Other problems with that stance. The various technologies used each have their own way the camera must be used. The two perspectives that impressed me were the handling of the fight between Gandolf and the balrog and the relationship we have with Gollum. In the first, our eye IS magical as it swoops around sometimes watching the fight, sometimes IN the fight. This use of the camera is new -- I noticed it also last week in `Treasure Planet' when encountering the black hole. But it entirely different than the soliloquies Gollum (and several others) have. Under the guise of talking to themselves, they are really talking to us, nearly looking at the camera. All of the camera engagement is from Bergman, and is his well-studied solution to the Shakespearean stage technique.I liked both of these, but they are inconsistent with each other, inconsistent with Tolkien's magic as noted and inconsistent with the movieland jokes. But there are even more diverse perspectives. We have the helicopter shots (again from `Braveheart'), and a few similar shots of virtual sets. We could have had some new movement (like the balrog fight), but we are supposed to recall similar shots.And then there are the Ents, animation straight out of `Poltergeist.' It is another set of views determined by the technology rather the story. Shifting among the bluescreen of hobbits in Ents, to the humanistic CGI Gollum, to the video game animation of the battle was jarring. We never were in Tolkien's world, just browsing through the aisles of your video store, shifting about.LOTR was written with specific notions of reading in mind and is bound to them. But `Dune' was not. Imagine a film of Dune with this budget and Lynch's originality instead of Jackson's `me-too-isms.'

Across the Universe," Entering the Mask
","I'll say up front that this film will almost certainly go on my list of films to see before you die, only one of two that I allow from each year.Let's get the problems out of the way first. The overall container of this is a date movie. Boy meets girl. Boy loses girl. Boy gets girl back by professing love in a public venue. Its about as tired a formula as there is.The songs are produced by T-Bone Burnett, a sort of reliable movieworld musical handyman. He's probably a nice man who once knew what it meant to have soul, but now he's a factory man. These songs are performed by the actors you see, and while admirable, it further diminishes the power compared to the originals. Also, I saw this in a multicinema, and they tend to turn the speakers down because of leakage into other spaces. So the songs here don't have the power we know they do.Neither does the girl. In other date movies, we are supposed to fall in love a little ourselves, or at least see why she's the object at the center of everything. This actress doesn't have what it takes, and I suppose that's a result of the filmmaker being a woman and openly against objectifying women in this way. So its a bit schizo in that the form the woman chose demands something the woman won't give.The thing gets off to a slow start. Its probably necessary for the strategy for most of the movie, which depends on growing extremes in cinematic fantasy. But you will probably go through what I did, think during the first 25-20 minutes that I had made a great mistake.Additionally, there's some bad history in here. Its probably excusable if you consider it all just a shorthand to indicate context. But if you were there and depending on that real context to enrich your experience, you'll be a bit annoyed.But with those shortcomings (and I'll mention some others), even in spite of them, you'll find this to be one of your deepest cinematic experiences.Taymor isn't quite old enough to have experienced all this first hand. But she and her team do seem to have gotten the tone right. The world was turning against its inhabitants in a way completely unknown. The youth in the US responded in a way that was deeply moral and committed in a way unknown before or sadly since. This truly was the greatest generation. Think of it: we got rid of a lying scoundrel of a president, despite his best use of unconstitutional force!Everything was up for re-examination and reinvention. Sure some of this -- most perhaps -- was stupid, opportunistic and damaging. But the imperative to re-invent wholesale was there, however colored by idealism. And this was led by the Beatles. If it hadn't been in the context of reinvention -- if religion in its old form wasn't part of what was tossed -- then surely these guys would have been the core of a new religion. One of their hangers on actually is.What Taymor is about is a similar reinvention of cinema. She's a risk-taker. She knows her stuff, and she's willing to place it right in that sweet spot between the commercially viable and the imaginatively provocative. Her tools are derived from Japanese and Indonesian masks, outsized intrusions and a notion of space that prefers enveloping. These three combine to create some amazing achievements in stagecraft. That's what this is all about, stagecraft and the yearning of characters to place themselves in context at the same time the filmmaker (and explicit external world forces) set context boundaries, mostly denoted by uniforms.The first of these is the most apparent, the first time you'll see this. There are some absolutely amazing experiences in store for you just on this score. The large and small are manipulated and bent to an extreme I have only seen in small bits of Tarkovsky. She knows how and when to combine this with confinement and openness, and often when she does you'll have play with matters of scale that are unique. And its not just one device, but many, never repeated. Its as if a whole life of imagining what to do were collected in one place.If these were songs by the Mamas and Papas, I'd still be blown away. If it were Robert Stigwood's script maybe even. But those Beatles songs....With 'Rubber Soul,' the Beatles started their program to actually write songs that collectively built narratives. John and Paul were obsessed with the power of words that aggregate, and some of their projects really do have a narrative coherence similar to what we can read here, but much deeper than a date movie and a sketch of oppression. So in a way, its a weakness of what she's done to mix songs before that commitment (1966) with those done within it. It fights the DNA of what they created. And some of the songs carry immediate narrative. 'Sexy Sadie' was about the falsity of religion. Here, Sadie is a redheaded Janis Joplin gal. What?But still, its the stagecraft, and the cosmic placing she's found.

The Incredibles," Pixar is Invincible
","Spoilers herein.All movies are about other movies. Most simply quote them, and most of these are bad. Some are very clever quoters, like Tarantino. But still mere quoters. A few weeks ago, I saw 'Van Helsing' which impressed the daylights out of me. It was all about transmutation at many levels including transmuting itself through several other movie identities.Meanwhile, I've been impressed by Pixar for other reasons. They've always been the leaders in folding and introspective dimensionality. Their logo even shows it: an illuminator jumps on the 'i', replaces it, looks around and then looks directly at you.In this film, their introspective experiments extend to quoting other films. But instead of the simple shopkeeping of Tarantino, we have appearances of other films but instead of being quoted they are re-imagined. Each transmutation is better than the original: This is better Bond than Bond, better Spy Kids than Spy Kids, better family drama than any recent experience. Better through-the-trees chase than Star Wars. Much, much better than 'Spiderman' and its ilk because it really understands pacing and manages ever-more unseen camera swoops.And it does everything it does with familiar images. For instance, the scene where Bob smacks his boss through several walls and he ends up wrapped in bandages and in traction is a collection of classic images from old cartoons, starting with the big guy grabbing the little guy. Except you don't notice that the big guy is the good guy. Never happens in the classics.There are two interesting folds here: the one that folds many movies genres as we mentioned and the one that conflates the folds of reality. Here's how this works: Usually there are two layers of a folded movie: the movie and some more abstract story within the movie. Spoofs depend on you knowing the layers, even if a layer isn't shown. So 'Austin Powers' has the intermediate level of Bond, even though it doesn't have an explicit segment that exists in the world of Bond. Ted's law says the folding distance must be equal, so the abstraction between the real world and that of Bond is exactly the same as that between Powers and Bond, extra cartoonishness if you wish.This Pixar project has two levels squashed into the same world. One level is the very realistically abstracted story between Bob and Helen. This isn't very cartoonish at all compared the regular world of cartoons. Then you have the superhero world which Bob and later Helen dive into; this is the most extremely abstract world of cartoons. Three levels, us, Bob and Helen as people (and they seem more real in this mode than most 'real' characters) and Bob and Helen and kids as superheros.The novelty of the fold is that these are squashed together as if there is no distance. That (plus some very human-like camera angles and the 'interview' footage at the beginning) squashes the world of the viewer into what we see. Its the kind of brilliant novelty that can only be done by close students of the art.A side comment that follows: the standard Disney cartoon has to have an obvious moral. Parents enthusiastically use this as a sad excuse for parenting. This film puts the moral in the spoof level. That means, folks, that it is equating it to the mediocre fictions Bob berates at the beginning. To distract the dopes in the audience, they do damage control by splicing an 'ordinary' moralistic dippy thing at the beginning.The real moral is that most movie houses have 'insurance:' they test their films into mediocrity. Pixar does no testing. They figure it out and trust their geniuses. Along the way, they take two heavy hits in the story at insurance companies who literally put superstars out of business, and incidentally steal from the worthy.

Stardust," Dusty Song
","Don't see this.I don't know the children's' book from which the scenes were stolen. I assume it is successful in the sense of giving the reader channels to be transported to a world that matters.But I do know what works with movies, and not just for myself. The business is all about creating worlds, weaving realities. The big challenge is getting us into a world that makes enough sense for us to rattle around in it, and perhaps be manipulated using its laws. If we are lucky, those manipulations will matter and the film will be worth watching. But that first hurdle is helping us to enter the world.This fails at that front door. Like many other big budget productions with a weak creative coordinator, different bits have been parceled out to creative teams all over the world, and each has created their own miniworlds whose only commonality is that they are 'inspired' by the book.But they are also inspired by other movies too. The problem is that each team used a different set of movies and thence different worlds, with different symmetries and hinges and refractions. Its incoherent.One single thing could have helped. Nothing ties bits of a movie together like the score, especially when it is heavy like this one. The problem is that the composer used a Wagnerian approach. Now, you don't have to be very knowledgeable about music to have strong opinions about whether Wagner is a burden on or wings for our souls. But either way, it implies a world of its own, a world of Olympian lusts, of simple honor and vast battles. Love isn't a basic force in Wagner's world, its a prize. In the simple story we have here, it is the unified force of everything that happens, a sort of light that affects everything. (The metaphor here is the stars as gods.)So every time something happens in this movie, they turn on this music machine that snaps the world away from any of the worlds we see. Its schizophrenic, like a TeeVee laugh track over Hamlet.It would have helped if they had gotten real actors, too.There are two scenes that are okay. One is the incidental bargaining over a chest full of lightning. Another is the 'landing' of the ship in water that DeNiro's character pilots. All else is failure.Oh.

Driven," Sly Conception
","Spoilers herein.I must confess, I do not like Renny, or Sly or racing at all. But Stallone's last outing `Get Carter,' surprised me in being visually intelligent. Harlin did well I think with the humorous `Pirate's Cove,' with his wife. He seemed centered, sure. And though racing is rather like `professional' wrestling (but with more stickers and girls), I think it has great cinematic possibilities.Alas, the breakthrough racing film has yet to be made. What we have here is the same editing and camera placement we have seen in many, many films. What this genre needs is to be shaken up, like a `Moulin Rouge' or a `Blair Witch.'",Null,2,5,22 January 2002
The Elephant Man," The Elephant's Memory
","Spoilers herein.Some films are effective because they competently push all the buttons. Some work because they effectively transport you an unfamiliar place. And some reveal some new way of folding your imagination. This film shifts among these three excellent qualities, depending who is making the decisions.Of these three, only the last really matters. Oh, a good empathetic cry is worthwhile, especially if I can congratulate myself on my understanding, charitable nature. But that's cheap. What really matters in this film are the few places where the producers let David Lynch do his thing. There are two:--The first is the sequence in France where Bytes has taken up with the freak show that seemingly is the original one visited by Treves. This sequence is clearly patterned on the amazing `Freaks,' elaborating and extending many of the images first invented there. Leading up to the escape by the edge of the water, which is the single image that permanently rests in mind and anchors this whole film. Lynch (and most other intelligent filmmakers) is obsessed with what it means to make a show. Except for the obvious (Trevers is much like Bytes but with clean sheets), there isn't much exploration of what society accepts as a `show' except for this and the next mentioned:--The freak show is mirrored by the other show Lynch is allowed to mess with, the play. This is also a show, but this time Merrick is a spectator. There are also wonders; also natural and societal forces at play; also an imprisoned ogre who presumably is shown to have a heart of gold. By 1980, it is already a hard rule that the abstraction `distance' between a film and the film or play within the film must be the same as between the film and `real' life. And so it is here.These two sequences of the freak show and the play, clearly siblings, are the two places Lynch has been allowed to be Lynch, and they are inventive, trenchant and lasting. But where Brooks and company constrained Lynch, we have a failure: all that stuff about clouds and smoke and boilers. I suppose (knowing his later work) that he was going for the industrialization as a Victorian template (mapped to the hospital's rigid rules: `we only help patients who can be cured'). Going for the `hey, that's me struggling against the machine of society,' and linking that machine to machine of show business. (The name : `Bytes' was designed to further that notion.) Constraining him thus certainly was a wise decision given the goals of the film, and the emphasis on the actors. But I dare say that it would have been a better, more important and visceral experience if there had been less mawkish sentimentality and more image; fewer gems of actors' effects and more cinematic structure.Lynch and Freddy Francis were to team up again for `The Straight Story' where it is all about what they couldn't do here.Elsewhere, I have come down pretty hard on Anthony Hopkins' acting style, which is mannered, lazy, and completely uninterested in the director's intent. That comes from being constantly celebrated. But here, we have none of that. He is focused, committed, new in the character's skin. It is not really fine acting, where the doctor's skin itself would be worn and mannered, but there is no room in this film for such stuff. All the actors have to be abstractly sharp, and they are (except the boss's wife, who is dreadful). And he is the sharpest.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.",Null,11,17,21 August 2002

But enjoyable.Lumet scalpeled himself to the world class with `12 Angry Men,' where his camera breathed with the same rhythm of the ensemble. Here, he generally lacks that magic, and the writing isn't very tight either.But one scene is immortal, on my list of the best 50 scenes in not-excellent films. The phone conversation between Sonny and `wife' Leon is great naturalism. This is Lumet and company at their very best. Watch how the framing moves, the conversation unfolds, how we are drawn into the most intimate pathos -- how they help us escape the voyerism of the crowds right outside, and the many others listening in.This was Sarandon's first film.

School of Rock," Virginia Beach
","The Death of RockSpoilers herein.Yet another funny man with a limited vocabulary searching for that one perfect vehicle, by trying a formula. Its getting pretty tiresome.Let's see: Jack was terrific in `High Fidelity,' an original notion cleverly pulled off. He is also in a rock band. So, (we can see the creative team around Rudin saying) let's just let him be funny doing his rock faces, in a `Mighty Ducks' deal.
And why should I object to that? Because, friends, I am sick of films that preach one thing and themselves contradict that thing. Usually these are movies about being individual and not a copy, but everything about the movie is cookiecutter. In this case, we are talking about a culture of energy that is de-energized..All movies are about other movies, never life. Music is similarly always about other music as well, but has the advantage that for us to connect it to life, we have to invent a cultural container. Rock isn't music at all, but the container we made up to contain some music made by folks we think fit the template. Rock music is what rock stars do, not the other way around.The vehicle here is that large formula that has an unlikely bunch (often kids) excelling in a performance. Sometimes it is a sporting performance, otherwise - as here - it is a stage performance. Usually there is an unlikely mentor. Ho hum, push those buttons, connect the dots and we get ersatz rock and just the kind of movie which rock is against.`Spinal Tap' was an ode to rock disguised as a satire, and funny as all getout.

Here's how to tell in films: no chances are taken -- no experiments are made -- everything is extremely competent, but in following rules established by others.That's this film, and it is ironic that it is its own damnation. It is unelaborate, too few notes. Each character can be fully described in one sentence. Every situation as well.Mozart's genius was in creating depth in the music -- music which commented on itself by elaborating itself. The phrases were novel, but tricky -- after hearing them you believed you knew them all along but were wiser because of it. Not so this film, which is lush but unrewarding.So why is it well-received? Because it has costumes, is easy to read, has pleasant music. And -- I believe -- because it has the required self-referential `play with the play.'",Null,10,19,14 July 2002
The Game," Narrative Shuffling
","Spoilers herein.Fincher has discovered a specific technique: to attach a studied noir style to an unexpectedly folded narrative.In ÒSe7en,Ó the folding was simple. A simple detective story with a deliberate logic, usually means the audience gets it, and the detective does too. The game is to foil the bad guy. Here the bad guy wins, defeating us both. A simple trick.In ÒFight Club,Ó the fold was much more clever, turning the usually trusted narrative into an inventive fantasy.This is in between the two in sequence and sophistication. It has the same attachment of style to narrative, which is rare in cinematic vision. But as with Se7en, the effort isnÕt worth it because the narrative folding isnÕt all that profound.Here we have the triplecross scam which in its final twist is not a scam. The folding is simply the tricking of the viewer in precise lockstep with that of the hapless target, Douglas. Another device is old but still has weight: the actors are playing actors putting on a show, simple self-reference. The pretended love could become real. ÒFrench LieutenantÕs WomanÓ did this so much better.Fincher is evolving.

Kick-Ass," Drawing One's Self
","I saw this fellow's last movie. 'Stardust.' It was an idea full of potential but lacked coherence, soul. It took you a world (two worlds) that were puddles created by each craft. This is less incoherent, but still has no intent, no imperative in the world. Imagine a world in which imagination has no force. The irony is that the story is about a kid who simply by wishing made a world that would have him in it as a superhero.So as a movie, leave it alone. But as an example of what I call clever folds, it is a gold mine. Take the effect I just mentioned: dorky kid sits in front of a computer and masturbates every night. We are told that his fantasies can get pretty rich, and the we — maybe — enter one of those fantasies. Just so this particular device doesn't get old, we have him occasionally give us a voice over talking about the nature of the superhero and the unlikeliness of the fantasies.Mixed into this fantasy are two standard movie devices that often host inner folds: the boy is dying and imagines his life as it might have been. In that future, he has a comic named after him, that his friends (and girlfriend) read in a comic store. The story then emerges from the pages.Oh yeah. The big fold can come from that thread; the kid imagining a world, wherein he is dying and further imagines success, wherein a comic exists that drives his actions. Or alternatively, we have a meek man, a cartoonist who is making a comic that has the story that impinges on our kid's world. We can have each of the comics generating the other, or both. In this second comic we have our impossibly rich and powerful villain, surrounded by dozens of cartoon guards, fodder for the ten year old. This is a powerful idea, a story, and better a cartoon being created in the story and governing part or all of the story. Here we even have the cartoon 'come to life' to give us some backstory. It is all powerful stuff, and could have been pulled off with a director that understood the nature of worlds. You have to have forces that drive things; otherwise it is all just a bunch of scenes that involve the same people.It is probably impolite to mention the fact that the star of the fantasy is a ten year old girl with the biggest body count, most bloody deaths and foulest mouth. There is some dangerous and uncomfortable stuff here in terms of sexual tropes draped over this kid. The impolite mention is to notice that this is in the context of a teen body creating a sexual fantasy. We see tissues flying into a wastebasket. Definitely squirm material.I have never seen a Marvel production that was worthy of recommendation. They just have this uncinematic, oppressive notion of how worlds work.

The Man Who Would Be King," God's Own Trousers
","Epic is as epic does, and this really is epic.It starts with a story by a man placed in the midst of empire defined by the notion of savage religion and uncivilized ignorance. Its written by a man who more or less accepted that truth while wondering about its human dynamics. The film is made by a man who is of the same mind as Victoria and not Kipling. There is no questioning at all in his approach: the means to a competent movie is largely a matter of having enough confidence to appear consistent.And its presented by two untrained British actors whose acting technique depends on simply bulling their way personalitywise. (Actually, Connery is a Scot, a distinction he would consider significant now.) The 'pretty girl' here who is the undoing (after signed pledges promising no sex), is Caine's wife. She's a Latin American beauty queen that he fell in love with by seeing her on TeeVee (made beautiful by Ridley Scott, then a director of commercials).So the thing is set up by an unbroken line of bold interlopers with only Kipling having any reflective reservations about the enterprise. It actually works insofar as that matters. I mean its coherent; few large movies are. But its broken in the same way that it portrays cultural brokenness, which I suppose is to be expected.The thing I liked about this was the depth in the images. Its not depth that actually matters, but it shows intent. The business about the compromised sanctity of the Freemasons and how ridiculous it is. Engineered superstitions.The bit about 'God's own Trousers' as the epithet of choice from a person in whose culture trousers are a sign of civilization. The stuff about heads, both literally and as leaders. Even the simple business about temporary bridges. Its high school stuff, but fun to see.

Ghostbusters," The Natural Artificial
","Some movies come with a surrounding story that makes it a richer experience.This one's enriching story is that it is largely accidental. They had a different movie in mind, then changed it in a rush, making changes and inventing every day while shooting. Usually this results in an incoherent mess, but in this case it became ever so MORE coherent.The reason is that all the principles are strongest at improvisational comedy. And they had worked together intensively and knew how to make each other look good. Its a funny thing about acting, especially comedic acting in the long form : you almost never can actually make yourself a success. You have to trust your partners to make you a success.I always enjoy this movie. Like 'Holy Grail' its charm is in referencing a mature world of slightly twisted forces, keeping some constant. Its a familiar place, naturally found. Its that natural access that makes it so endearing. Nothing is forced; no one is trying very hard.

But let's see, the anchor of this thing is Maria Bello. The broad outline is conventional, the tough madam who has 'been around' and cares about her girls.Its a funny thing but where she's been as an actress is places we have encountered her. 'The Cooler' was something transcendental in a way and I will never see her again without knowing how open she was. So she brings a sort of special depth to this pat role here, our personal experience of her own performances before she opened this bar.We can't pretend that the person of the actress and that of the character can be separated.

Gran Torino," Cleaning Up
","I saw this together with the recent Sly Stallone director-actor effort, 'Expendables.' That's because they have similar sensibilities of justice in the world. But Sly is an actor who makes movies. He knows that the effects he is looking for have to come from his face and body: the movie is just the delivery vehicle for his brand. Eastwood on the other hand is a filmmaker. Even in the spaghetti days, he was a collaborator with the director, reaching for an effect rather than a character.He really is quite a filmmaker and just knowing he is still vital at nearly 80 is cause for some pleasure. Never mind that the only reason to make this is to parade that fact. He's colored it with a story about old-school suburban texture because he seems fascinated with what it means to be American and how film defines and reflects that. Never mind that the story arc is as feeble and cheap as 'Million Dollar Baby.'Sly has never made a decent movie and never will. It isn't because he has dumb values. It is because he is an actor. Clint has made one excellent film and several very good ones. All of them are crafted well, coherently envisioned and narratively closed. I think I can summarize the style as economical. I prefer loose ends and open narratives, ones that deal with ambiguities, analogy and sliding truth. Clint instead shows and indicates nothing that does not move the narrative ahead. His shooting style mirrors this; investors love him because he doesn't diddle.One risk he is taking; the use of the muscle car as a symbol of a lost nation may become quickly obsolete, and thus lose much of the punch he built around it.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,2,9,19 August 2010
Hero," Space
","Two things interesting about this project. First, the sad news, at least for the Chinese, that the Japanese have finally won. This is a Japanese film in all important respects: the theming by lush color, the rather modern notion of benevolent conquest (genuinely originating in the Persians but only used since as justification for selfish empire, specifically in this case Japanese conquest - and adopted by the Chinese only since the war) and of course the wholesale swallowing of Kurosawa.Kurosawa is here obviously in the story: it is half 'Rashomon' and half 'Ran.' But more important is Kurosawa's theory of film as a device to capture space. As with Parisian impressionist painters, the thing painted is not the point. It provides an origin only; the painting is about all the magical things that happen in the space between the subject and the viewers eye. The paintings, and Kurosawa's films are about that space.Kurosawa invented the technique of shooting from very far away with a telephoto so as to flatten space, and at the same time creating (usually three) layers of space. Often, he would engage the space directly.This masterful film is obsessive about the point and may be the most lush swim in dimensional space you are likely to find with the technology we have. Every shot is oriented around not the action, but the space that contains the action. Falling water, dust, lots of blown fabric and hair, feathers, arrows, even book tablets and those leaves! With lots of bamboo screens, all these are used to show the space, plus the usual fantastic mountains, clouds and forests - even at the end the Great Wall and of course the moving waves of soldiers and courtiers.Many of the architectural shots are lifted from Welles' 'Othello.'The matter is not lost in the copious allusions to mental space: the game of Go, music, calligraphy, politics, and love. All these are defined, exercised and conflated with one another in terms of space and the intrigue of space with a little more effort in the latter items on the list. Then, waving lamps are used to make 'murderous intent' spatial.Unlike 'Crouching Tiger' which this resembles not at all, the camera is static, not dancing. Where Lee emphasized the ballet of the fight by engaging his camera, Zhang stands back in the space. Where Lee conceives fights not among the participants but their masters, Zhang shows us not the fights, but the battles among the true worlds of the fights - the worlds of different colors.What we see could be the imaged Go game, or the imaged fight within it, or the imaged story Nameless tells, or the one the King tells and on and on with nestings of imaginations. Every nation creates their own movie to explain themselves. We in the US seem to like more militarist stuff. Except for the thuggish motive (my war for my kind of peace), we would do well to have stories about stories like this one through four layers until they reflect back on the origin. Complex story space in rich real space.If you are going to see this, you really must see 'In the Mood for Love,' which features Broken Sword and Flying Snow in something of the same relationship they have here. It is one of the best films ever made and truly spatial in a purely Chinese manner. It will completely transform your enjoyment of this.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,115,203,8 September 2004

","I saw this immediately after 'Avatar.' It broke my heart because it awakened things in my memory of Avatar that I would have noticed and not liked. I'm a cinematic sucker. I am easy to hypnotize and readily fall into the world that the competent filmmaker can shape, just in time for me. I did not need to think about the fake morality, the tired stereotypes, the prefabricated celebration.Here is Cameron's ex-wife. Not for very long, but long enough for me to see that they share values.This here is effective, darn effective. I can taste the dust. My sweat smelled of the same fear as that in the suit. I admired what I was supposed to. But this is about war. Not pretend otherworldly war, but war that is being conducted in my name with my dollars, included in the social contract. Now this filmmaker made two films that were wonderful. 'Weight of Water' was miraculous. 'Strange Days' was strange enough to matter. She knows what she is doing.So here is a choice. War is cinematic. We will always have war movies. Do you make 'Platoon'? Or do you make 'Full Metal Jacket'?This is to say, is it a movie about a man in a war, who bends the war to himself. In this case we will cheer as tides are reversed and the moon flies backwards. We win! Or is is about a war, about the world that grinds us up in spite of ourselves, and incidentally can people flash their eyes in the smoke of the tornado? These are harder to make, and we do not cheer. We only have nightmares and sometimes — too rarely — do something about it.Bigelow goes for the cheap shot. It is excellent and AI would see it again.

K-19: The Widowmaker," Ford versus Trabant
","Spoilers herein.I am not a fan of Harrison Ford. He cannot act, at least according to my understanding of the term. But he often finds vehicles where that doesn't matter, where he can swoop along with events. In fact, his very ordinariness works to his advantage as we literally identify with him. His self-awareness isn't intelligently aware or explicit like Willis', and his appeal is more Cronkitean than Gibson's. But there is a place where he fits in. It isn't here.What we have is a huge machine that is flawed, in fact two huge machines: the submarine and the Soviet Union. The tired gimmick used here is to present Ford's captain as yet a third broken machine, only to have it develop that he is wonderful anchor instead.The picture is so constructed. Attention is given to impress on us the mass and power of the machine. This overlaps with drawn out sequences that show Ford as similarly blunt, powerful and broken. Finally, wrapped in crisis, there is the elevation to sainthood, something usually sauced with rousing music and closeups on earnest, loving faces. Each of these three requirements is trod through inartfully, even incompetently, and since no one cause is clear, one must blame the lack of vision or control of the filmmaker. Almost certainly, this film was produced under the circumstances described in it: ignorant edicts from above, massive expenditures but always shorted, huge expectations beyond the skills of the crew, plans that go awry and are unaddressible. The film is broken, and instead of throwing it to the American audiences (unprotected from the fallout as it were) Hollywood has gathered around in the form of a massive promotional campaign to once again save Ford's biscuits. Incidentally, if you ever have been around submariners, you know it is a crowd-hushing, offensive mistake to pronounce it sub-mar'-iners (emphasis on the second syllable) as opposed to subma-rine'-ers (emphasis on the third). This is such a profound error one need not wonder why so much of the film has an inauthentic feel.

Moulin Rouge!," Glorious Absynthe Prostitution
","This film is crafted of many common narrative elements:--The rich cad versus the poor lad for the girl (with the conceit that love is unavailable to the wealthy 'unreal' class)--The girl who must renounce her love to save her lover (only to lose her own life)--The notion of players as prostitutes (here bohemian dadaists)--The setting of a play within a play (with the everpresent driver that the show must go on)--The extended bracketing (the opening/closing curtain, then the open/closing whiteface observer of the 'mill,' then the retrospective narrator writing what we see, then the initiation of the absinthe vision, all before the inner play -- and that inner play has yet another level: performers in an Indian court -- who are doing a song about a song)It also uses an ordinary convention of embedding songs in the action. Though one must note that absinthe hallucinations are intrinsically musical and similarly embedded. (Don't try this at home: thujone, the active ingredient in absinthe is so pernicious that is the only drug that has been successfully outlawed in the civil world. Think about that. Then imagine an absinthe bar on every corner and in every Parisian artist's life 100 years back.)Having mentioned all the ordinary elements, this film is the most fun I ever remember having in front of a screen. Everything to the smallest element is coordinated to be a single, transporting vision. And what a vision! The camera has character here -- it is a performer, it dances, laughs, cries -- it is detached voyeur, then intimate partner. Everything is so original in vision, and so coherent it amazes. This is close to scifi -- it conveys us to an alternative not-quite-real world we can barely reach.The actors play to a knowing camera-audience. There is an amazing sequence in the elephant when the Duke first interrupts the writer and the inner play's cast makes up and acts out the play in front of us. This of course includes self-reference of the current situation. We are so swept up in the exuberance that we lose our place. What layer where we in?(A talking sitar that can tell no lie? A narcoleptic Argentinian? The dadaist Latrec as the story's stable center? A connubial elephant? -- Glorious prostitution.)The layer shuffling happens again with a more edgy and sinister tone with a Tango to Sting overlain with other music and emotions: the 'real' action with Satine and the Duke. We lose our detachment again because the layers of self-reference are juggled. The finale echos this.Nicole does the best job of her career. She is so totally open here one worries for her -- I suppose this is the Emily Watson effect.Baz is now among my top three directors. This is a near perfect film in execution. The one flaw comes from that perfection. Broadbent is a perfect Zidler. But he has played this same role before -- recently, and in a similarly nested play: 'Topsy Turvey'. It takes a small chip away from the originality if the film.See this.

Meet Joe Black," In Another Body
","Spoilers herein.This film really surprised me because it drew me in, and I'm a pretty hard case. Plus, I really hate heavyhanded direction; Brest and Pacino in `Scent of a Woman' was a sledgehammer.What happened here was a sweet spot in casting. Hopkins is a selfish internal actor. When he acts, he acts alone, working the words not the other actors, the story or the environment. Pitt is the opposite: he works the other actors, tries to extend into the space around him, tries to work the multilayered angle. That multilayering is written into the part: he gets to play Brad Pitt (to get the opening boxoffice) playing an angel, playing a dead guy, playing the original inhabitant of the body. Actors love this stuff, at least the intelligent ones do.So the combo of Hopkins and Pitt works. Everything else is scenery, so much so that when we have the sex scene, the camera stays on Pitt's face! Brad is still not up to the task (as are Penn, Moore, Blanchett) but he is getting there, and taking lots of chances.This risk maps well onto the risk that the angel of death is taking. And the soul-in-body play maps well to us entering the emotional space of the story. That the family was so storybook appealing helped this pull. Also the story being about one film entity 'taking over' another is a clever extra.Any film worth watching is worth watching for a least three hours, so I did not at all mind the meditative approach to watching this develop. All the laborious mechanics of tying up plot ends at the end were a little trying. But I thought the staging was very good, if overly static.The ending was particularly visual and apt. The idea of the presentation up til then is that Pitt's presence is like one of those starbursts -- all tendrils. So the multiply-accelerating explosions were a very effective climax -- possibly the best fireworks display in all filmdom (though there was one firework in `Lord of the Rings' that was tops in that category).Nothing (except perhaps water) is more cinematic than fireworks.",Null,7,12,9 March 2002
Slap Shot," Rollerballs
","Spoilers herein.This is one of the most ill-conceived movies of all time, despite being remade several times: Roy Hill and Newman together after doing Butch Cassidy. It was extreme for its time so far as profanity and violence, though nothing here is remarkable by today's standards.There are a lot of things screwy here: Sometimes it follows a very strict formula, sometimes departing rather radically as if there were two, incompatible scripts tossed together. (The remakes stick to the formula.)Newman never finds his character -- at this point, he's still not a real actor. He only becomes great later. Without an actor to anchor things, everyone goes their own way. Comic and dramatic effects fizzle, except a couple scenes at the beginning that goof on Queebekkers.

Ex Machina," Soft Bits
","This is a superb film. I recommend it. My enjoyment of films is divided between the experience when watching and the much longer incubation time afterward. The success in the former in this case fights the appreciation in the latter.This kind of science fiction is all about abstraction. The world is abstracted away and we are placed in a secluded location where no support people exist; this is familiar from the stage and we readily accept it. Other abstractions are from what great masses believe: — Some billionaires are scientific geniuses. — Great technical work can be done by one guy. — AI is still the notion of a machine that acts like a human, and the Turing test is still relevant. — Successful AI is somehow dependent on successful robotics. — Something like Google collects something like intelligence.When watching this, we willingly allow these things because we want cleanliness, directness and the film rewards by moving. When the end unrolls, it does so with no great surprises of the kind that make us reinterpret what we know. This pleases like an ordinary meal does without challenging.The settling of this in a near perfect center of what has gone before in sci-fi film is also appreciated. There are too many to note here, but I liked the Alphaville reference and the tussle among three beings for control of the movie from 2001. Also, the acting seemed ideal.But afterward, much of the appreciation faded for me. None of the five common assumptions noted above are shared by me. I remember few things fondly that are supposed to be based on science but that don't leverage the reality — instead some trivial fiction that resides beside. My memory wants to complain about a movie that presents novelty but that has none. The god business just was too much mentioned, and the justice too simple. That said, we have the Sunshine factor. That movie hit a sweet spot for me and over time has grown in importance in my world. A reason is the coupling of something like chosen importance (but not quite) with something like valiant loneliness (but not quite that either) pulled by some cosmic force we would see as controlling insight. That movie had story and space ship and all, but the thing it conveyed was a suspended urge, one I might relate to a refined, pure sexual compulsion taken away from sex.Here in this film, we have the same notion from the same writer. Because the filmmaker is less adroit than Boyle, everything else is simplified as well. Also, we have a real sexual object in this case, and it mutes the spell by speaking it. Still, it evokes that urge and we inherit it.If you had limitless money, the technical ability and the opportunity would you not fold all your desires? And would you not drink at night with a combination of fear of yourself and desire to escape them? Would you welcome a death that confirmed you?One plot element captivates. We have evidence of many failed experiments at building attractive women. One of these is used as house mistress. She supposedly does not understand or speak natural language and In the overt story, she is benign. (That story is from Caleb's perspective.)On reflection, she *has* learned language and *does* understand what is going on. Ava is the focus, but Kyoko is suggested as the agent that moves everything and thus is the real AI success.",Null,10,17,21 July 2015

","I enjoy groups of films, in a sort of 'mix tape' way. Of particular interest are sequels and series where different writers and filmmakers are involved. I find the first three Frankenstein films differ in amazing ways for instance, ways that deepen the experience for each film.Here we have Spielberg clone Zemeckis in control of all three in the group. The first was apparently intended as a single project which had a risky creation, involving many changes. Some lack of coherence was introduced because of major changes introduced by the curse of test screenings.The second and third, however were written and filmed together. This was the first big Hollywood project designed in response to questionnaires. You can see it in the recipe. Need more love interest? More actual action? Less Biff? Costumes? Chop, chop, chop.There is a clever thing this movie has that the others did not. It knows it is a movie. It sends our travelers back in time not into an earlier version of their world, but into a movie world. Specifically, it is the most stable genre of all: the western. As soon as Marty arrives, we have the most common trope in westerns: wild Indians yelping as if it were 1955, chased by the cavalry. There are a few jokes about being not in the real world but in a movie world, including the requirements for what happens next.It is not enough.

","Spoilers herein.Scott understood that this was not a film about a simple character, which is why he was attracted to it and others turned it down, unsophisticated actors like John Wayne and Robert Mitchum.He knew that this was an opportunity for an actor to play a man who was playing a role - a role that was foreordained because he had played this role in past lives.He knew that it was not about the man, but most viewers will not. The DVD has a commentary, in fact, by the president of some Patton appreciation society who fawningly prattles on in a parody of patriotism.Scott knew that is was not even about himself as an actor, which is why he refused his Oscar. It was about stepping into the cloak of echos, of animistic determinism, of Persian notions of self. It was about visiting borrowed beings and using them to destroy borrowers of lesser beings. It was about acting as life and life as a command performance. That?s why we first see him performing on a stage.Jerry Goldsmith, who did the score, was also tuned in to this.

","We know what's coming with this and we even know how. At least I think most viewers will.Its a con movie, but with more explicit folding. In the usual con genre, there is a mark who is fooled along with us the viewers. In this version, the con is literally a show on stage, a device that makes the con more folded: we watch a show (the movie) with a rapt audience (who we join and emulate) who watch the show that contains the con.At the end, we are satisfied. The con genre is something that spun out of noir, the unique invention of cinema, actually American cinema as a sort of innovation on the order of jazz in its place in music.In noir, there are two worlds, one being the world of the folks we watch. These poor folks are visited by amazing coincidences and odd causal mechanics. There is a capricious fate that seems to bend the world  the actual way the world works  in order for there to be an engaging story.The other world of course is the world of the fate, the gods and goddesses whose presence implicitly makes those bends. The world we watch is bent because we watch it. Twist and turns are there not because they make sense or reward the people they happen to, but to us. Into this world we slide, lubricated by our curious eye, teased a bit by exaggerated photography.The con movie is also an American invention, I think, a child of noir. In this derivative, some of the characters become gods, sitting on our side, in our world. The other world remains haplessly manipulated. In the best of the con movie, it is doubly folded where we find at the end that we have been fooled ourselves, that we are in the watched world.Now back to this. Here come the spoilers.If you watch it without paying attention, you will see a teen love affair. During a rendezvous they are interrupted and the girl beseeches her lover to 'make them disappear.' She is dragged away and he watches helplessly. Then the story proper begins. We see him re-encounter his lost Sophie and through time rekindle the love, then plan an escape. That plan is an elaborate con, complete with a mark and a designated watcher to whom the con is revealed at the end. Happy happy are our couple and the gauzy ending leaves us with a smile.But there's a strong suggestion that real magic is involved here. Real magic.In an ordinary con movie, you go back through the events you see and re-register them. In fact, our designated viewer  a police chief  does this before our eyes. In a regular con movie, all these line up, they make sense in our new context.But if you see this, you will see that they do not. There is a double con at work here. Our illusionist stages a version of the killing (in the mirror, on stage) before he is reacquainted with his love, just after he asks for a volunteer and she surprisingly is volunteered.Hmm. If there was a con, it started here, or before here. Follow that thought back to the teens in peril and imagine what we see as a movie as the enclosing illusion of the movie. Then it makes sense that as the girl, they chose to make Biel up and light her to look uncannily like a young Cate Blanchett, playing a young Elizabeth to a young magical writer.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,5,9,6 September 2006

","There isn't a single thing to like in this project. No appealing, interesting or attractive characters. No jokes. No cool effects. No engaging story. Nothing.I think I am giving up on the Marvel producers. They don't seem to know much about making a movie. I'm writing this as it is freshly in theaters and the competition is so strong I do not expect this to last a week. Rottentomatoes has this at severely rotten. So for once, my values overlap with most other folks. Hooray.I think the problem is simple. If this had appeared 8 years ago, it would be a hit. The way they make these things is to start from a comic notion. Then derive a comic-like storyboard, after having some high school make a story of course, but stories don't matter in these things. The point is that there's a comic book, flat perspective, key frame oriented perspective in how this is imagined.But the competition has evolved. Now we have flitting cameras, three dimensional action, overt introspection, occasionally some effective drama. And the competition is created first as a film, and then brought to us through production techniques (like preanimation) that de- emphasize the two dimensional eye.This form is dead. I suppose it will live for a while in anime, where two dimensions leverages some Japanese pictorial techniques that work. But marvel is dead until they reinvent themselves in film.

The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Clockworks
","Fincher understands cinematic narrative construction and has the craft to match. I fell under his spell during 'Fight Club.'The idea there was to play a game with inner narrative. It was, I think when Pitt first found his way into full collaboration with a director's adventure with the shifting of watcher and writer. That made Pit a real actor in my book. Fincher has played with other devices since. 'Panic Room' was architectural, at least to begin. 'Zodiac' twisted the detective story in odd ways. Here he works with one of the most basic challenges in film: how to show the internal workings of a mind in emotional seas. The conventional way in literature is easy enough for us now: we read about what we believe are the inner ruminations and remembrances of a mind. But that makes for bad films -- where we have all sorts of talk, explanations in words instead of immersion in experience through the visual grammar. These are the worst.But what if you want to tell a real love story? One of real love, deep love, impossible love? What if you want it directly from the lover's hearts and don't want some metaphoric overlay, some watered down convention? Well, you might try this collection of devices, these two.First there is the inter-nested story. We have the framing narrative of the clockmaker and his love. (This, incidentally, is one way to show love, to conflate it with something visual, like clocks, stations, hurricanes, lightning.) We leave that and come to an inner framing story, a dying woman still calculating, revealing secrets to a daughter. This is actually a pretty conventional setting as well. We revisit it enough to allow for an excuse for her to 'read' from a diary, the excuse for us to hear the inner thoughts and emotions of Benjamin. This one device gives blanket allowance, and the casual viewer will scarcely notice that we get the inner beats of the woman's heart as well, in her own 'words.'This is combined with the more visible device of two lover's lives running in opposite directions. We go forward while the story is recalled as double memory, triple if we credit Ormand's character (the daughter) as the one going in reverse. And this IS conveyed cinematically by the somewhat hypnotic device of seeing the familiar face of Brad Pitt reverse age. It sounds simple, this concoction, but I imagine it to take the focused efforts of all involved, including the two women: our most talented folding actors (both redheads here) Cate Blanchett and Tilda Swinton. Along the way, Fincher almost teases us with what he does not do. There is the 'Doctor Zhivago' route not taken, the war movie route, the dancer (performance as love), the Ron Howard play ('Cocoon'), the Spielberg play, in fact all the possible ratholes that all the possible directors who were once attached would have gone down. Yes, it is slow. Love is. Yes, it is difficult, but this love is -- all deep love is. All lasting love is a passing moment, captured and nurtured internally while it tries its best to vanish. Is this the best, truest love story in ages? Yes, probably. Will it change you? Possibly, depending on where your heart passes.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,19,30,25 December 2008
Transformers," Spatial Flitting
","For once, what I see in a film is what most others do. So unlike most comments I write, this one will be 'mainstream.'The way this is put together is based on fractional narrative. Its the notion that if you leave big holes in the story, things are stronger than if you seek to explain and fully reveal everything. Its a solid technique, often used in the story itself. Its used that way here, almost automatically as the cosmology invented here was devised for what, 8 year old toy consumers. But its extended. One extension may be an accident: characters appear and disappear at random with none of the completion or agency that we expect. I believe that's because Bay is a nitwit in this department and the guys in the front office thought it wouldn't matter. Also, its likely that Bay shot a 6 hour movie that makes some sense storywise and then he took out all the parts that got in the way of the 'value.'But there's another 'incomplete narrative' element that I think was by design. The camera sees and understands very little of what is going on in the battles. The camera is looking in the wrong directions, is too close, shifts in panic and jumps from view to view (when close in) as if it didn't actually know what was to happen next. So you don't actually 'see' a full transformation, or a battle event. Often you can't tell who are the good and bad robots. Often you cannot tell actually who's up and who's down as you could, say in your classical fight, all of which it seems come from that 1938 'Robin Hood' sword fight at the end.This cinematic technique is not new or novel. Its the first resort of filmmakers whose CGI aspirations outstrip the budget. But this is a whole new reason: that business of what you don't actually see is always grander than what you do.Combined with this is a second phenomenon, and here it fits perfectly. Its the use of the dimensional camera. In this case, sometimes the camera is as a human would act. Sometimes it is disembodied, but there's a very strict vocabulary here too, determined by the restrictions of cranes and helicopters. What we have now is something new, the camera that flits, that moves in all three dimensions. We saw it first on 100% animated cartoons. I think 'Treasure Planet' was made just to test this. Pixar created a whole philosophy and took over Disney based on it.Then we saw it in CGI-heavy films. It was thrilling in 'Van Helsing,' and there a new convention was tried: show something on screen that has similar behavior to the eye we will shift into. In Van Helsing's case, it was the three flying harpies, in particular (of course) the redheaded one. She flits with precisely the same gestures as the camera.Then we saw it full bore in 'Pirates of the Caribbean,' and 'Kong Kong.' In the former it was architectural, and the latter fully integrated into the action. WETA led the way on this. There's a new technology that makes this within reach of even dopes like Bay. Its called preanimation, and what it does is completely model the scene before any work starts so that the camera has absolute freedom and isn't static as storyboards would have it. Then the virtual worlds and real shots are just busy work, all the creativity is in the design at this stage.You can see precisely which sequences were done by the preamination 'director,' and which by Bay. The new 'law' is followed in the sense that we have an on-screen avatar as exemplar of the flitting eye movements. Its a hypercaffeinated skeletal robot. It helps us understand how the eye moves and why it sees incompletely.Oh, and its not an offhand thing that the central goal of the plot is a search for 'spectacles.'So when you see this, and you wonder about whether we are worth saving as a people (which is the reason for the story), and you seriously do teeter on indecision, consider this: we are evolving very quickly in the way we see, the way we model things visually and the way introspective representations are internalized. For that alone, we deserve a chance at survival.Until next summer.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,33,63,4 July 2007

Wimbledon," Ping Pong
","When you watch so-called date movies, its often more fun to pay attention to how the writer solves the challenge of the genre. After all, movie love is pretty thin stuff when you boil it down. So about a decade ago, date movie scripts started borrowing from other genres. In particular the writers borrowed the trick of focusing on the audience instead of the couple in question. The reason is that you can only go so far in making the couple appealing and attractive. So if you want to make the audience closer to caring, well you just relocate the audience.Therefore, we have a slew of date movies set in public arenas so that the audience can have a clear surrogate on screen. Usually this is done by setting the movie in movieland. This way we can have a movie audience watching a movie/TeeVee audience watching the couple. When they cheer, we cheer.Perhaps the most closely engineered of these was 'Notting Hill.' In that case a popular actress plays a popular actress. She has a constant on-screen audience not unlike the audience in the theater who were drawn to the film because of Ms Roberts.These projects must have a climax where the love (after some screwup) is proclaimed to the on screen audience. They clap and cheer. We clap and cheer. We've had these with Meg, Julia, Sandra, Catherine and so on, each in turn.Okay. Here we have the latest refinement. They are not about to play with the general shape: two people fall in love in instant movie fashion; they are pulled apart by some events; he announces his love in a very public manner to an on-screen audience thereby making it 'real.' The boundary between movie love and real love is crossed and we leave the theater feeling happy.The innovation here is the crossing with a sports film using an internal narrative. You can just hear the machinery dropping into place as the screenwriter thought of the formula. Or perhaps he just went to one of the several consultants (like myself) who come up with these schemes.The internal narrative is clever indeed. Usually in a sports movie we (and our screen surrogates) watch the performer, only inferring what is going on in his (usually his) mind. The less we know explicitly the better because our imagination is usually stronger than what they can display. Think of 'Bull Durham.'But here, we are sometimes in the male's mind (literally hearing his thoughts), sometimes in the normal audience's and sometimes in the on-screen audience's (including the hackneyed announcers-in-the-booth). Shifting back and forth (mirrored by the back and forth of the ball) and adding the idea that he himself is a watcher and wonderer is pretty clever.But the whole thing falls apart at the production level. There's some stuff about a dysfunctional family (or two) that falls flat. Dunst is no longer pert and charming.

Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," Condiment Complement
","This comment is on the IMAX 3D version.This is superficially another lame morality play, with a childishly simple set of coordinated arcs: temptations, love and family. It features inventiveness as the talent, and I suppose we should be thankful it isn't sports.But I found two things to really like about this, like enough to recommend it.The first is that of the IMAX 3d animated films, it is the first I recall that used the expanded dimensionality in a way that was natural. It expanded the cinematic vocabulary and wasn't gimmicky. A word about the balance: when you have something new, the first goal is to make it seem as if it were always there, I think. Only then can you start to exploit what it offers in communicative power. It has taken us years to get here. Pixar couldn't. WETA couldn't, nor any of the SKG projects. It took Sony, who may actually be developing some skills. I was impressed by how they handled space as a narrative device in their first production: 'Monster House.' Here, they simply enfold space as if you naturally were there, including emulating shots from many, many other movies — the ones we have seen so many times that we accept them as natural. Star Wars space navigation for instance.That takes me to the second really wonderful thing. The people who made this know and love movies. There are scores of direct references: obvious ones from space and alien movies of course. Nice, esoteric ones as well, like the passing reference to 'Eat, Drink, Man, Woman.' There were as many of those as my mind could collect, probably one every couple minutes, every setup. But it seemed as well that even framing, lighting, color balance and movements of different kinds were references as well.We will have to wait for some clever entrepreneur to make a movie annotation site where you can enter a scene's framing and search the corpus of movies to see where it came from, possibly intuitively. But they are there. This is a cinephile's cartoon. The 'girl' is a redhead of course. Of passing interest is the way that the acceptable shape of female bodies has evolved in this sort of manufactured world. Characters are an engineered mix of suppressing and exaggerating in some coordinated way, so that the backstory of the person can be read from the form of their body shape. In films made with living actresses, the form is in the motion, carriage, dance. Here it can literally be in the shape, those subtle movements still being beyond the technology. Here, she is all pelvis and thighs. Now this is no small matter because these simple forms will affect a whole generation of desires and the pattern of caresses. These forms matter, and it is remarkable that Sony has these skills.Watch them. Its exciting to see spatially cinematic competence. The jello scene must have been the first conceived.

","I finished the year is despair, because though I've seen many good films this year, I've seen very few actually released in 2006. What a surprise to discover some late in the game.This is one, and it really surprised me. That's because though I generally regard Hispanic filmmakers as the vanguard, he hasn't really impressed  not as a major talent. My how he impresses now. This isn't just an effective film, its effective in ways that show he really understands some of the theoretical mechanics.Here's what I mean. I was greatly impressed by the opening scene of 'Casino Royale.' But if you look at it closely, you'll see that someone could have produced it by mere extrapolation. All they have to do is look at examples of things that are exciting in current movies and do the same, except a little more intensively.But what Cuaron has done is go back to first principles. He knows how Welles redefined space. He knows how Tarkovsky created a whole new sort of eye by making the camera drift. He knows how Kirosawa invented the notion of layered planes. He's synthesized these in a new way, it seems to me. It isn't radical enough to not be readily digestible to a modern film-goer. But it also isn't much like what we had before, which I may typify with Ridly Scott's 'Blackhawk Down.' There's a scene toward the end which I imagine was where he started to imagine this project. Our escaping couple are detailed on the street by those who have been chasing them. This group is ambiguously evil, perhaps even the good guys. They prepare to kill Owen's character and perhaps do. From that point until near the end that seems to be one continuous shot. It isn't, but it seems to be, 'Rope' -like.He runs down the street and around a corner, being shot at. He runs into a bus and out. Then across the street in the middle of heavy combat where a building is under attack. All this is hand-held using a partially-stabilized camera, halfway between a documentarian's camera (at this point blood is spattered on the lens), and the other way toward stylized distance that surveys the planes of the spaces while they are animated with bullet hits.We then follow him into the building, up several flights and down hallways to retrieve his 'family,' then on out again. At this point he becomes 'seen' by those around him. Before, he was more like us, there but disembodied, in a die hard sense. Now he becomes part of the texture and we later discover, wounded.So on down and out of the building to be adored, as Joseph the partner of the Maddona and then a tank explodes and we are back into the space, leading to a tunnel, an expanse of water, and then something else.Its so wonderfully choreographed, the camera, the narrator's stance, the dancing walls, the object that appear and vaporize, the shifting types of engagement among us, characters and place...We know we are being set up. This is no Terry Gilliam who basically intuits. Before this scene we see all the bits from the other masters presented separately. The Tarkovsky bits were perhaps less meditative that I would have liked. One was a visit to an abandoned school where we see our mother outside through a hole in the window, and encounters happen that 'break emotional walls.' The other is the presence of a profoundly senile old woman, and how she is included.You walk through other basic film vocabularies elsewhere until they all combine in this last sequence. A Kurosawa episode on a bus when the midwife is taken to meet her fate.Quite apart from the visual vocabulary, he's done well with complementary notions of story. Its science fiction but without tedious explanations. The world just is. There's brutality as in the future of 'Vendetta,' but one can see it isn't religious wars or jingoism that fuels it, but a far deeper existential concern. Julianne's character is the grand motivator, though wonderfully (in terms of story mechanics) she disappears early, effectively launching the real story: our hero is a storymaker.Noir. Regular readers know I define noir a bit different than ordinarily. It has to do with ordinary folks thrust into extraordinary situations as if the existence of the viewer motivates a capricious fate that weaves and frames a story for our eye.

Often they'll fail but thats a small cost in an otherwise rewarding life of trust. There are only a few actors on this list, some writers of course and directors.And there's another list of people to avoid, people who have damaged my soul and compromised my world, folks who require you to repair your encounter with them. I avoided this project until now because it has both types. Swank is an earnest actor not on either list.Eastwood is someone who has earned my trust because of one amazing project, 'Mystic River.' Quite apart from the story, it is about direction, a melding of forces. All the major actors in the thing are actors who also direct. All of them understand to a significant degree what most actors don't, that a performance has both inside and outside compositional values. What Eastwood wrangled in that little film was an encounter not only among characters as scripted, and among acting philosophies as often happens, but also among actors situation in what they see as the directorial situation the local composition. And we also have the interaction of all layers with the others. Marvelous, and worthy of trust.Plus the man is so economical. Economy by itself isn't worth much; Bresson chafes me. But Eastwood can focus and pare so that even the most ordinary effect can seem purposeful. And that's what happens here. This is such an ordinary, derivative, spitefully mundane and worthless script, it says something that he has given it dignity. But that's all it is, tripe with a clean wrapper.The two men on my list that do not deserve a place in my pantheon of film friends: Freeman and Haggis.Haggis is a hack, a machine, a cut and paste expert in appealing to the lowest and most uncomplicated sentimentalites. That's allowable in my book so long as there's some novelty, some new handle on life some new angle, something that pulls us up with tools for seeing. Never.Freeman is simply an annoyance. He's an arrogant actor exploiting black avuncular type. He decided long ago and has often said that he will just be himself, regardless of what the role requires. But that never comes up because he only chooses roles that match what he has chosen to invent himself as a person. Its a fake racist nobility, made ever so more offensive with the fake wisdom that accompanies it.I'll take a hundred Eddie Murphys exploring the limits of race over one who safely cashes in on it.

Casualties of War," The Layers of the Scarf
","Spoilers herein.With Kubrick and de Palma, the image comes first. The script is an excuse, and the actors are either collaborators or unwitting victims. Fox is a victim here. He was chosen precisely because he is clueless.With de Palma it is the eye, always the eye. But here he lets the story frame the eye more than in the past. He had just come off the Mamet-authored `Untouchables' to acclaim (lines like `stinks like a whorehouse at low tide') and was to disasterously rely more heavily on the text in `Vanities.' This is between the two, also by a celebrated playwrite. Framed by the bus, with inner framing of the tunnel scene and the bridge scene.
These two scenes are the backbone of the vision. de Palma likes the notion of worlds under and over worlds. The tunnel world gives no contribution to the story per se, it is the filmmaker's statement of the cherry's entry into unknown levels. Later, the levels are the bridge and river, where his real story ends. In between the camera is constantly moving up and down, often beginning or ending completely out of frame. If you love visual narrative, you gotta love that.Also the four-house deal: how the camera lives in these four spaces: the hooch of the abduction, the hooch of the rape and later the assistance, the destroyed temple of the interview with the Captain and the `courtroom.' The camera knows these spaces -- they have character, which are defined first and then only reflecting on the persons within. This is a Welles trick, one which de Palma does more subtly and effectively I think.de Palma has chosen to make an anti-war film. And he is intelligent enough to know this means making an anti war-film. War-films are by their nature reductionist. You need to not only undercut war (a trivial job for an artist) but the simplicity implied in the genre. Malick was to do this better, but by recourse to a philosophy probably not reachable by most (additive abstraction). de Palma's solution is less intellectual, and as with Malick relies on collaboration with Penn.This is Penn's first truly multidimensional role, where he plays several characters at once. Here he plays the Sgt., as John Wayne would. But he also plays the playwrite/filmmaker and the actor playing the filmmaker. It is his birth as an artist, and one not missed by screenwriter Rabe. He would rewrite his `HurlyBurly' as a more multileveled project and similarly collaborate.",Null,9,14,26 February 2002
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Tattooed Mist
","Somewhere along the way, the detective genre in both books and movies has drifted. In the formative period where the form was strong enough to stick, the idea was a to create an engaging puzzle. The narrative was the thing and the game was to sort out the causal agency among possibilities in a sort of quantum logic. Other than the recurring detective, characters and settings were there to color the puzzle. In fact, filling them out would reveal their inner motivations, and that had to be kept hidden.Then I suppose in the late 70s, detective fiction became what the publicists called 'psychological.' The genre bumped up against the procedural. Readers lost the desires and skills required to play the simple game, so the game evolved into what I call a vocabulary of folding devices. In the process, detective storytelling started getting judged by the same rules as ordinary drama, for better or worse.Those rules may overemphasize character definition. We have to have an absurdly sharp but easily described set of ghosts that haunt every character that matters. Mix that with Lutheran Swedish filmmaking and you end up with something like this. The mood is refined and disturbing. The camera does not probe because we expect the characters to project to us. People are damaged, seriously damaged and they spread it around themselves. Cold is the same as gloom.I have not read the book. It is possible that the language used there is able to bridge the inner cosmos of our two detectives and the world they are discovering. Surely the matter is the same: sexual violence. (Blomkvist's situation here is not quite clear; a lover at work may have helped frame him.)Anyway, you get two movies. Visually and tone-wise you have the heavy Bergman. There is no mystery or coherent story outside the characters. The characters are cartoons, so outside our experience that they cannot connect, only display.The only engaging things were the stories within: the photos primarily.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",Null,10,20,1 August 2010
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," The Camera
","Rarely when an actor tries to direct does it work, and when it does you get 'character study' without all the supporting scaffold a real filmmaker would provide.Clooney is a smart man who knows this. So he structures his projects in ways that are well serviced by what he has to give. The last one was an actor playing a character who created a character within. The structure of the thing was all focused on building and exploiting those ambiguities. Especially clever were the staging devices. Many were novel and a few were particularly striking.Now this is a more serious, but has the same values. It is after all a character study, and one that deals with these same two worlds. The man when off the camera, and the man on. Fabricated truth as an act by politicians. 'Journalism' as way of piercing through those layers.Two evils, McCarthy and Paley. Clooney's point is that control over the pipeline is what matters in delivering the 'real.' So he works with some very studied staging. This movie has some of the best staging in recent memory. It must have taken forever to set the angles and lighting. Fortunately these are so powerful that no scene needs more than two setups. This is the way this cinematographer works for PT Andersen too.The switch in lighting from when Murrow is on the air to just after he goes off is rather thrilling: both are intense, in fact the on-air lighting is stark. But there is a powerful and visible shift from external to internal energy.If you just saw the script as words on a page, it would seem boring and preachy. It is the staging that makes this thing come alive, that gives a container for the great acting. The only actor who seems off is McCarthy, which is telling.I have the book Clooney's dad wrote about movies. Fortunately the son has better insights into what works and what doesn't, and has good intuitions about what to attempt.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,20,29,25 November 2005

","Spoilers herein.I like this kind of thing... not because it is in any way good, but because it fails in such interesting ways.That's because the original was strongly influenced by the Alice in Wonderland stories. Its a very solid structural framework, on which a zombie framework was overlain. Milla is an extremely limited actress, but is an apt Alice in an Eastern European Svankmajer/Kinski sort of way. The actors are in a world layered between our world and a subterranean world of zombies, so they have some degree of control over the undermovie.This sequel reverses it all. Here, the zombie movie is in control, including the zombies that are the corporate bosses. The characters we see and follow are the background, the manipulated. In fact, every action is manipulated. Milla's charm vanishes in this situation and we are left with something that can only be judged on its merits as an action picture.

Mulholland Drive," Time, Times and HalfTimes
","Marienbad meets Timecode.Spoilers herein.Here, we have lots of elements found in other intelligent films:-- A film about a film. (The opening scene of this, the outer movie -- a sock hop -- is part of the content of the inner movie the director is making. That only a few dancing couples are present but in multiple copies is our tipoff of things to come.)-- An actress playing a character who is an actress who creates an actress.-- A relatively fresh story built entirely of cliches from film history, including some from Lynch's own-- A lush, languid, meditative camera with many POVs, clearly letting us know this is a character's vision. --Time shuffling, time folding and parallel universes; a by now common convention that late narrative revelations reinvent the earlier narration.--A traditional chorus, here in three forms -- all imagined jointly by the characters and you (which is the standard approach, only these chori wear masks, shrink bodily and participate in background conspiracies).--Movie sex: real, imagined and acted, consisting exclusively of facial intercourse superficially annotated by breast exposure (which makes it as much sex with the viewer).Usually, a critical mass of these makes a film worth watching regardless of whether it is particularly artful or effective. This film is slightly artful, though obviously that's subjective. But it IS a very effective mystery, and that's the real hook. There has long been a problem with transforming the literary mystery to cinema. The written mystery depends on the wandering mind, loose control of the writer over the reader's digestion of the narrative. The game is one in which the writer (tries to) manage the leash and the reader (tries to) outwit the incomplete history by filling things in. Because with reading you create your own images, you are already in control of the world.Cinema is different. You don't control the images, only the recognition and registration. The writer/reader leash is short. So we are still seeing experiments in how this can be expressed in film. Mulholland is a drive through one approach, literally sketched by the drive: a ride to a party which stops midway and takes a shortcut, a shortcut which reconstructs the drive as interrupted in a different way, an interruption that is `explained' several times.The key forms of the mystery remain, starting with a setup establishing an apparent question. One finds later that the question is of course the wrong one. Some dueling among the writer, viewer and characters occurs (adding the characters to this mix is generally limited to film). Then everything is explained. The value in this film is the duel, and how it is shaped. Terrific stuff in conception.My only real problem was how clean was the resolution -- was wrapped up with a little too much order for me. A tough call: a clear solution is required for the mystery form but some greater chaos is required for the art. (But I still worry about that third call.)",Null,21,39,26 October 2001
Brave," Engineering
","Steve Jobs remade Apple, embedding a very specific philosophy. Usually called 'design,' the idea is simple and the goal is simple. Have a vision of what you want to accomplish, a clear vision. Then engineer to that vision, ruthlessly eliminating all else. It sounds simple, but no Apple competitor has been able to emulate the approach; it is usual to start with a list of features and jam as many in as you can.Jobs had far less work to do with Pixar because they started as an engineering shop and ended up making movies. The stories are effective because they are carefully engineered, based not initially on intuition, but on the science (such as it is) of narrative dynamics. As Pixar matured, they started to engineer the cinematic techniques as well.Now Pixar is part of the Disney machine, and Disney has a princess franchise to feed, and I am sure that a very specific set of goals was supplied to Pixar to engineer to. So we have the story and the rather blunt girl-mother issues that apparently have market traction. You, dear viewer, will be in their scope and satisfied with the engineered results or not. I don't care much about that.What I do appreciate is the parallel engineering, the cinematic engineering. Pixar in the past has been experimenting with space, particularly the position occupied by the camera and the space that is defined around it. Lots of consideration of dimension that gives something like a visual score. Sometimes it directly supports the goals of the story; sometimes it does so indirectly by just making the images more enticing.I think what they did here is fascinating. The spatial experiments are muted, at least the space occupied by the action. Instead, the space around the chief character's head is engineered, no doubt using proprietary motion technology. You can see it in two recent Pixar patent applications (12/717,530 and 12/717,540) with the implementation here using NURBS rather than polygons. As a matter of hidden history, the technique of using linear NURBS to define things like hair came directly from military aircraft radiation modeling for stealth.But that is another story. What interests us here is the ability to both *realistically* emulate the effect that curls of hair have in gravity, wind jostling and rubbing up against each other, *and* the agent system where tufts to have some individual character and personality within the assembly. They are characters in their own filmworld. The more glum I got over the story-in- front, the more joy I was able to find in what they did with this hair. Some of the 1500 individual curls work against the assembly just as Merida works against her constraints.The personality of each of the tufts remains the same throughout the film, but the nature of the agentworld of the tufts develops.Because they have to emphasize the hair, they de-emphasize hair elsewhere. For instance, the bearhides are from a bygone technology. The snow that originally would have used the same technology and echoed the hair dynamics would have made a great film. But 'creative differences' and a shift in the director killed this.Red hair in cinema has a long history, and it can be said that film at least clarified certain stereotypes. I have a small project tracing the development from 'It!' and following black and white films where the red was known from tinted fan magazines, through Technicolor. Many actresses were forced to dye their hair just so the filmstock would register their skin properly. By then we had the three main archetypes.Merida has a rare double swirl. Fantastic research on that account.So, an engineered hairworld, as a collection of characters, acting as a character to subvert the Disney constraints. Too bad about the original visionary leaving. Jobs would not have allowed it.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,9,15,16 September 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy," Buckaroo Steals from Marvel
","I don't know where this came from, whether it incubated in this form in comics for years. Or whether someone at the Studio hired someone else smart. What I do know is that Marvel is playing with fire with this. They know how to make roller coasters. They know how to seem profound to teenagers. And they know how to frame a shot. But now, what? Will we expect all of their films to make fun of the Marvel empire? Will this last bastion of non-ironic teen juice dissolve like westerns did after Leone? Is it impossible now to have a Star Wars with no snickering?With millions of others, I liked this in many ways. Seemingly alone, I find the other Marvel projects unbearable, uncinematic, solipsistic. If I could tease out one thing to celebrate in this, it would be the tree. It is a character that becomes an environment. Twice. It is a character that contradicts the standard Marvel speechifying. Most striking of all, it is the only character to break the fourth wall. In the middle of the ultimate battle, it performs a fight move typical of Marvel: performance fighting, the kind that assumes there is a viewer to admire the silliness.

Shrek 2," Muppet Movie 2
","Spoilers herein.Gadzooks, another movie about movies. The first time around, the story was simple: Disney had invented the medium of animated features but had lost their moxie. Then, under the oaf Eisner Disney made a deal with Pixar (which had been cast off by George Lucas and revived by Steve Jobs), and all of a sudden had completely dominated the genre.
Eisner rival Katzenberg resolves to best Eisner, after all he just doesn't deserve it. You should also know that the first battle was long before. When Pixar was preparing `Bugs,' Katzenberg rushed together `Ants' to open earlier just to steal their thunder.So then Katzenberg makes `Shrek' with a farting character and story intended to spoof the Disney model. And it is set in Hollywood and features a dwarfish `king' modeled after Eisner.Now along comes the sequel. Again, we poke fun at Eisner who is revealed to be a frog. Incidentally, Disney just picked up rights to the last Henson character: Kermit. The model for the story this time is `The Muppet Movie' which is about the making of itself by coming to that far far away place, Hollywood, and dealing with the fact of who you are.Along the way, it would be good for you to know that Disney has the world's most advanced character lab, a place that invented the Irish redheaded female character that is portrayed here, as well as the whole notion of animated fairy godmothers.

Kill Bill: Vol. 1," God Gets Cut
","Spoilers herein.The title of the comment is from the ersatz master who makes a new sword for our avenger. This denotes what is wrong about this film, indeed why Tarantino is to film as Brittany Spears is to music.Martial arts are about generational wisdom, about the rigidity of the masters all the way back empowering new freedom all the way forward. When a fight occurs, it is not the weapons that are in combat, not even the combatants: it is the respective masters who operate through time and space. Ang Lee understood this when he made his film, one that could reliably called an homage.This is something else, wholly Americanized. Here we have a setup that is from cold war 60's culture, a themed assassination squad. The focus is on the individual. When Uma's character fights, it is in the Eastwood/Segal tradition. This is Yankee individualism filtered through episodic TeeVee and only then cloaked in B-movie style.
For all this to work, we have to have a God. Can be the noir god of detached fate; can be the Hitchcock/dePalma god of the camera; can be the Lynch god of the filmmaker's angst; can be the Leone god of irony, or the Fellini god of parallel dreams, or Medem of animated orgasm, or Bergman of the Judge. Our man Q wants them all, and has to cut each of them to make room for the others. He is not clean and focused like Kurosawa, but jumbled like Rob Zombie.`Once Upon a Time in Mexico' has identical aspirations, but Rodriguez steeps us in something he actually knows, leverages an actor that actually understands irony (not some second rater; remember Mrs Peel and Poison Ivy?), clearly identifies his god/ observer (Depp), and does it all himself: writing, directing, shooting, editing, composing. In comparison, Quentin is a novice and this is a dim conversation in a lonely corner of an effete Hollywood party.As in all of life, there are two kinds of people in film. I'll call them engineers and scientists. Engineers work with known vocabularies and principles. They take insights of others and tinker about with different combinations to accomplish certain practical goals. There is an imagination of sorts, but it extends only so far as understanding the storehouse of components supplied by others. The scientists go where no one else has ever gone, into the void and bring back new reality that they convince us to accept. Which of these you choose for your life in film could determine everything about you, because you live in your imagination. Compare `Ghost Dog' (or even `Pillow Book') to `Kill Bill.' Both are about themselves, cast in terms of what went before. One is subtle, even elusive in its truths. Possibly, it is only one of many stories it is about as the little girl within it reads. The other, `Bill' is already chewed for you. Brittany Spears. They even use the same musician as composer. One is subtle and rich, the other a jukebox.Kurosawa is a scientist; Tarantino a shopkeeper, and that brings me to my final point. Quentin does have terrific storytelling skills. But look at how they are used. All of his attention goes to explaining what happened before, including the trademarkedtimefolds. This is very well done and completely comprehendible. But good storytelling, the really good stuff, is about what happens NEXT.

The Last Emperor," Lush Life
","Spoilers herein.These films always tear me. This is worth watching because it is so lush. The camera is rich in every element: framing, lighting, color, movement, composition are all almost elaborately designed. The effect is overwhelming lushness. The place looks far better here than it ever did in real life. In fact, the container is so incredibly rich, one wonders why the contents are so thin.And the reason I think is simply Italian filmmaking sensibilities. Beautiful is enough. The actors themselves are beautiful, and the idea of the historical sweep has a sort of beauty. But the actual story makes one wonder what was the point. Did anyone really care about it? The same thing can be said of `Kundun,' and that's clearly an artifact of Italian storytelling. The result is beautifully boring. When O'Toole is on stage. our eyes rest a bit and our souls get engaged. But he is already emaciated and a walking tragedy of waste, his own tragedy more hypnotizing in his brief moments than all the other character movements combined.(Quite possibly, the story is weaker here than in most Bertolucci films because of Chinese sensitivities. Why was the ten years in the prison camp not shown as the grueling hard labor it was? Why was the treachery of Mao not mentioned.)There's some slight self-reference when the `invasion' occurs: the invaders bring still and movie cameras.There's one scene that has stuck in my mind for 15 years, when Lone is in bed with his two very lovely wives, covered with an opulent cloth sensually undulating. One of the loveliest and most memorable moments in film. You get mesmerized by the shifting, polychromatic tones and shadows.

If there was ever a lesson in the importance of a director, compare how goofy Sam Worthington looks here compared to his doing the same action moves in Pandora. Or for that matter Fiennes and Neeson. This is bad enough to qualify as a Marvel noisefest with images-developed-elsewhere.But they did one thing well I think: the women. I know this will be more individual than most film opinions, and my demographic and sexual history may be different than most, but these women lit up the screen whenever they appeared.As the queen whose heretical indiscretions are behind the curse of Argos, we have Polly Walker. She, who in the past has leveraged proud, liquid beauty, (especially in '8 ½ Women') has earned her way in our memory. We can easily believe she would taunt the gods just for the hell of it. (Heh.) And believe she deserves to.The princess is who we initially expect is going to be the love interest. That she proves not to be is the only narrative surprise in this drudge. She is not the busty, snarling fish filmmakers often put in these films. She is an ordinary girl, who looks ordinary, like she was picked out while waitressing. Yes, I know she is a model, but her appeal is that she does not seem so.There is even care in minor women: Elizabeth McGovern as the adoptive mother. Tine Stapelfeldt as the mother of Perseus by rape tells volumes in the seconds we see her dead. That's acting. You even have Jane March in the background of Olympus!But the female anchor of this thing is a remarkable presence. We saw her in her natural redheaded state in the last James Bond Adventure. She dies of course. She impressed, and was able to keep the first part of that film alive in spite of itself. Here she has a balance between innocent devotion and willing adventuress. Made up more than the other women, they've artificially made her luminous, like Zeus. In the actual myth, she has an extraordinary role not shown here, as mistress to Zeus.

For Gilliam, that was 'Fear and Loathing.' Burton last was in his element with the second Batman.For my taste, this was all wrong for him. His talent is the ability to separate layers of reality cleanly and then playing with the dissonance between those layers, often humorously.This story has only one layer. It is along the lines of a Suess, and may be the best Suess on film. As a Suess, it has some charm, but why settle for seconds? Bad script.But this has one cool moment where Burton leaves his Burton-dom and enters the world of Rodriguez. Its a twist on the film within. Wonka transfers a chocolate bar through the TeeVee. It is a many layered reference to 2001, which itself is about conflicting generation of reality. The scene features the white room, the eye, the music, the chair, the apes, and the chocolate bar as the monolith. What's on the TeeVee and movie screen are overlapped as our hero can reach in and grab the bar.This segues into a sequence populated by rock band parodies, including The Beatles.

Also, I'm normally no fan of Cruise: his instrument is puggish with a big nose and squeeky voice -- he struts too much for me. And summer movies normally bore me with all their me-tooisms,But here (as with `Gladiator') is great understanding and control of the motion on the screen, of the anticipation of the movement of the eye, of the mastery of sequenced colors.

It is a world of rote mechanics and faux imagination. That first world is the world of Phil Dick, something I value and experienced relatively firsthand. The man was a genius. With Agatha Christie, he has had more influence on contemporary, imaginative fiction than any other. One of his minor but still excellent short stories is the inspiration for this. The other world is the world of bad filmmakers. Formulas where artists follow a rulebook and we as viewers respond as we are programmed to. Participants in art that dulls rather than sharpens, that puts us more in the groove than out of it. I recently rewatched Damon in Hereafter.

Black Snake Moan," Too Costly
","All films cost the viewer something. We have to relinquish certain core parts of ourselves in a negotiation with the filmmaker, as a contract to collaborate with him/her in a shared adventure. Never, ever is this cost slight; in fact the ability to place a substantial part of one's life in the hands of another is pretty dangerous stuff.We don't see the magnitude of this commitment, because usually the bargain is a wash. You commit, go for the ride and come out slightly ahead, with a balance we call 'entertainment.' Sometimes we encounter something that changes us profoundly. This vulnerability and ability to be transformed is the curse and blessing of being human.But what if the experience is a net loss? What if we give too much of the most valuable parts of ourselves, some of the essence, and get little back? I think that is what has happened here, at least with me.The story is a typical redemption story: three people redeemed. It has an atypically unrealistic happy ending, but we often overlook that offense. It has a twist in that it is reverse stereotyped: the African-Americans are human and wise, with the white characters drawn from a comic strip. There are possibilities, but there are risks as well, because when you invert things to make them visible, you have to do more than simply follow the flawed model you are inverting. Science fiction often does this: pulls some dynamic out of the background for attention, then provides insight by manipulation.Not so here. The story follows the tritest of paths. The innovation is that we are not just tied to the Bagger Vance notion of the inherent wisdom of the Black man (or Indian), but we do so via the route of blues music.This is where it becomes costly, because music is so viscerally connected to us. It is so much so that we have to build stories to even talk to ourselves about it. Thus, 'country' reflects rugged individuals, directly inherited from cinema, 'rock' has that story of extreme commitment drawn from our narratives of drug martyrs, and 'blues'? Well, we put a story of tragedy on it. And not just any tragedy, but the deepest we can imagine and impose on the music when listening.Said another way, a blues song touches us because it gives us an excuse to replay our own most costly movie. We speak of soul and personal anxieties. We raise it all and because of the contract, we raise it all the way. So this film asks us to spend a lot, to put a lot on the line.

It has key actors who understand folding: Lange (`Titus' and mate of folder Shepard), McGregor (started with `Pillow Book,' then `Moulin Rouge') and DeVito, the purveyor of comic folding in the tradition of Nabokov, most recently in `Death to Smoochy.'Heaviweights all. The story is a common edition, something between `Baron ` and `Guinevere,' with more than a dollop of Redford's slick, dumb flyfishing-as-life mentality.The intent was surely to have the `stories' and `real life' overlap, affect each other, and merge like the conjoined twins. If this worked, the labored metaphors would have been fine  we could even have tolerated more. After all, we are dealing with Proust here, the notion that a life is defined by memory  an elaborate life by an elaborate `story.'But it doesn't work. I think that is because in film we have such a strong tradition of a framing device. That expectation is so strong that when we have two overlapping stories and one `generates' the other, you have to pull some fancy tricks to avoid it falling into a static frame, like Falk in `Princess Bride.'Burton didn't do this well at all here. This same week, I saw a nearly identically structured project, `Conceiving Ada.' It failed in exactly the same way.

","Two things interesting about this for me. (I'll let others talk about Heath.)One is how much more of a comic book it is than a film. I don't mean that it is sillier or more fantastic, but that the values seem to be based on storyboards as panels. The implications are pretty interesting. All those Marvel productions are pretty much the same: the same level of fantasy, the same vocabulary of cinematic effects. The same slant from 'graphic novel' framing to modern film traditions  which incidentally are less designed than are the accidents of common CGI compositing tools.This on the other hand is not cinematic. It makes it boring for me visually, but there's another result: the story. The story is not your standard long form arc. Its at least four stories concatenated, as if you would read a few pages and come back at the next lunch break. It rambles, it has real comicbook soap opera. I really do think of this as a comic book that accidentally finds itself in a film. That's as opposed to 'Sin City,' which though based on a comic, and supposedly co- directed by the comic artist, is intensely cinematic, so much so you almost drown.The other feature for me: the handling of noir.Noir is all about how the viewer manipulates the action by viewing. It has permeated nearly every corner of film and most intelligent filmmakers try to play with it. It is the primary narrative tool we have to add depth by adding layers. The Nolans are intelligent filmmakers. While the film isn't very cinematic, the script is, in this regard. The novel trick here is the joker. Sure he is played well, and Ledger was becoming one of our foremost folded actors. But the thing works because the role was written to matter, and that's because he introduces a double noir fold. The watcher is in the film, and the watcher is 'writing' the script regardless of any action that anyone in the film can take. Its classic noir doubled. The joker's key speeches even cover all the noir highlights: you have to ruin routine; you have to profoundly affect, even kill random innocents; you have to express an amazingly complex orchestration and make it seem capricious, accidental. You have to deny intent and complexity. You have to pretend to not be amused.All these things are embodied in what Ledger was given. This is very important writing, and if you know 'Prestige' and 'Memento,' even 'Following,' you would have expected something like this. Even if the film isn't good as a film, the writing is, and that allows Heath to make a film within. Its why 'Clockwork Orange' is so important.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,18,39,22 July 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Nothing Up My Sleeve
","There were previous editions of the franchise that I liked. One had a real rhythm; another leveraged architecture in a truly competent way.I suppose if you are invested in the books, this one advances the story a bit: some few revelations; another battle, another death; another new character. But I am not invested in the books. I'm invested in the cinematic adventure that comes from a film that is well made. This one isn't, and it cannot be blamed on the choppy nature of the source material.The effects are decidedly cheaper, and in some spots even bad. There's an encounter between the three 'children' and a giant. Its handled the way it would have been in the fifties or before. Watch as the girl is picked up, then put down; see how awkwardly the camera moves so that it is never looking where you might so that it doesn't have to show something difficult.The effects, by the way are wildly uneven. We all know that projects like this job out scenes to dozens of subcontractors all over the planet. Each one uses a different set of tools, a different notion of how the camera behaves and frames, a different belief in the cosmology of magic and an often radically different set of artistic values. So some special effects scenes are honky bad as mentioned. Some of the better ones (there's a fireworks scene) belong in a different movie and surely a different world.And of course since the director is weak, the older characters played by veteran actors are incoherent. Each is left to create their own character and inhabit their own world. Can anyone believe that the characters played by Helena Bonham Carter and Emma Thompson could exist in the same dramatic world? Can anyone believe that Rickman and Gambon were ever in the same universe in terms of how they were allowed to see themselves?The director is weak because the producers are so frippin rigid and dumb that any talented director refused the offer. Rumors are that a score were approached.So far as the scenes, there were only two that I found tolerable. One was a fireworks scene. It was more cartoonish than we have seen in any Potter movie so far, but at least it was dimensional. The second is a few seconds in the final battle where thirty foot corridors of shelves collapse and the globes on those break and fall, or fall and break. Its a static shot, but well imagined. Except for those moments, you'll be checking your watch. There's no magic, and we just don't care about these now unattractive people.If you get your kicks from making fun at inept governments with a hint that the screwups may be motivated by conspiracy beyond stupidity -- and notions that an assistant (here white) and mouthpiece is a woman who lives in a fantasy world who explains reality away, you'll find that here. But not in an interesting way.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",Null,17,28,20 July 2007
Into the Wild," Interpretation of Words
","I saved this movie for a special occasion, a time when I was sensitive to the written word. Its because I know Sean Penn and his blind spots. Its because I knew that this will appear as a celebration of a special soul who discovers the purity of life through simplicity, or nature, however you handle this sort of sublimeness.And I knew that it would make me unhappy, because it will have been extremely effective at telling that story, but it is one that I will find unsatisfactory.Why isn't important, other than to say that it demeans the human spirit to pretend it is so thin. And if it matters, it isn't fair to any lost, broken soul like this poor dumb kid to turn his pain into something glorious because we are afraid ourselves.Regular readers of mine know that I get frustrated when there exists a fine reading experience, and then it is made into a book and people think somehow that if the events are conveyed that is sufficient. Its because reading is a sacred thing. Cinema, when handled well, is too. And so is that special state where the mind is attuned to whatever elements of nature you see. Its that attunement, that process, that 'shifting into' that matters.Penn understands this. He's a serious artist. He knows that this is a film not a story. And it is about the word, the written word, not some likable runaway. It starts well, and with this notion, us seeing the words from his journal in the foreground, the images mere annotation. One of the hardest things to do in film is to start. You have only a few moments to create a world.Throughout, we have a constant battle, a battle of words with images. The images nearly win, or so it seems. The end has our hero escaping the words of the idealistic books he carts around to see, actually see something transcendent. We are supposed to go along.But here is where the words govern, they shape and control. The first level of course is that this is a movie made from a book. It is a book written by a man whose job is to weave the notion that ascetic communing with nature is the purest of pursuits. Its got enough truth and tradition near it to allow it to create a powerful fiction. This boy's life wasn't important or interesting. What made him the target of Krakauer's book, was because he was a writer, and left documents.Its like the great Antarctic Scott expedition who perished for much the same reason, and were celebrated for precisely the same reason: they left compelling journals until they died. So we have Krakauer's words, fabulated and extending the boy's words. And these are based not on any internal vision, but on the words of others who he not only read, he carried books into the wild instead of food.So three layers of words, each one stepping closer to an idealism of nature while using notions and media further removed.The final irony of course is that he dies because he misread a word in a reference book on edible plants (as it happens in the film).Words matter in this film. They control the story as they run into the wild and incidentally carry this guy and the others he encounters, all obviously written not born. Penn could be a really important filmmaker, and here he comes really close to making a film about the compromises of film. Penn has only a few times where he crosses the line for me. They all have to do with the segments concerning the parents. One is particularly egregious. We are told that his dad was a smart enough man to be hired to engineer communications for NASA satellites. When we are told this, we see a NASA-supplied clip of a rocket being launched. That clip and its cousins have been seen countless times and is semiotically loaded. Its a shorthand for 'high tech' whatever that means. Its a problem for two reasons.One is the simple rule of overshowing. The cinematic effects here depend on the visions coming from the outside, slowly permeating that shell of consciousness. Penn does fairly well on this, avoiding the Carroll Ballard effect of human-manufactured natural ideals. But it depends on consistency, and he breaks it here. It takes a good 20 minutes to recover.But the other problem: the irony is that satellite communications isn't about rockets and power. Its about isolation, desolate vacuums, sterile modes, the inability to touch. It also happens to be cinematically accessible through some other stock footage, and when appropriate, folded into the images of winter and bus... and writing.Emile Hirsh is very good.

Annie Hall," The Story about the Story
","Woody is an intelligent man who worries about the issues of film-making. The primary concern, the very first problem, is always to decide what the relationships are among the audience, the camera, the narrator if any, and the characters.Woody was on his way to making a murder mystery, which is the purest form of messing about with these relationships. In a much studied decision, they decided to cut out all the mystery and just focus on the context. In this case, that context is a richly layered evocation of a relationship. I really wish I could see the original film to discover the mysteries Woody intended to hide in the folds.And the folds are as numerous and complex as they can get. We have a framing device where Woody speaks to us partly as a conversation which blends into a standup, which is mirrored as a part of the story. We have timeshifting where we move back and forth in time in a simple 'Tarantino' way; but we go way past: characters from the 'present' enter the past as Dickensian ghosts, then they talk to characters in the past. we have characters in different pasts talking to each other via split screen. We have a layering of Woody and Diane's relationship in real life, then the film, then TWO films within: a play which is part of the action and a cartoon which is the action itself.More: we have Woody talking to the audience as if we were shifted into the play -- early in that play we are introduced to Bergman and Fellini: in both cases while they are waiting outside. These are the two inventors of folded narrative. Even more: while some bozo perfessor spouts off about Fellini and McLuhan, Woody enlists the audience to challenge him and drags out McLuhan himself! The joke of course is that McLuhan himself was a vapid weaver of lowbrow theories.And more and more with the constant weaving of 'analysis' and other film-like activities: singers, photographers, TeeVee stars, models...This period was when he was first exposed to Wallace Shawn who was hanging out with Terrence Malick, two other innovators in narrative folding. All the 'New Yorker' stuff means more when you know Shawn's father was the long-time editor of that publication and defined the self-absorbed reflection that characterizes the city and this film.Keaton's manner was essential to pulling this off, someone who could pull off the story about her uncle dying while waiting for a Turkey. Watch her.. she is clued in to simultaneously being in herself (Keaton), herself (Hall), inside the story she is telling and inside the story Woody is telling. She shifts and guffaws just as if she were stoned and moving among realities, just as her character.Just amazing and intelligent. Will we ever see this the way it was written and shot? Or is that mystery too intelligent for us, who prefer to think of this as a funny, endearing love story.",Null,75,117,28 June 2002
2001: A Space Odyssey," Dueling Gods
","Spoilers herein.Since the disaster of `Sparticus.' Kubrick has centered each project on the mysteries of the narrative. Each film explores some theory or notion about the paths of storytelling and the fragility of those paths. Some get very abstract, like `Barry Lyndon,' where identities are adopted and plowed into nature. Some are rather simple, like `Shining' where the building is the author and teller of the story. But this is the most fun and in many ways the most interesting.Here we have three warring gods. Each might be the one who has created this reality or part of it. Each might be the liar who is telling the story. None can be trusted, or can they? The three are the `real' reality in which we live, but that of course may be completely unfettered by any logic. In the sequel, Clarke has this reality subject to jingoistic forces. The new gods in the equation are two:An extraterrestrial force. It may have even made us and how we see. It may have made all the reality we see as well. It is incomprehensible and capable folding time and consciousness. It may have made the story we are seeing.Dueling with it are humans and HAL. HAL is a machine with reasoning skills beyond that of humans. Thrust into this aether of creation, it may have gained extra powers over what is real and what is not. It may be at odds with the humans or the aliens. It may not be, in fact the aliens may be machines and see HAL and siblings as the point of their efforts. HAL sometimes seems human, sometimes reason itself (Dr. Spock is the palest of imitations), sometimes in cahoots with either or both camps.HAL might be telling us the story, a point underscored by his camera eye. We can't trust anything we see. But along the way, we see some pretty impressive things. It it hard to describe today when every third movie has a spaceship. But when this appeared, there was nothing at all like it. We were conveyed to a new and unfamiliar world, one created new for us, by whom and for what purpose we did not know.Ted's Evaluation -- 4 of 4: Every visually literate person should experience this.",Null,29,57,29 September 2002
Toy Story," Four Dimensional Toybox
","I see that my previous comment on this film was deleted.This is the thing that started it all: Pixar. Somewhat photorealistic modeling. Deep, deep attention to story dynamics. An animated feature not so polished since 'Snow White.' Something worthy. Something that led to the reinvention of Disney.Its an iconic turning point, like 'Citizen Kane,' '2001,' 'Bonnie and Clyde,' Greenaway's 'Tempest.' (and others) Many things after change. So it should be seen on its historical basis alone. Here already you can see that Pixar decides to combine goals. They want the movie to be just as good as the best non- animated movie. There is the well-documented attention to refining and refining the story dynamics so that the narrative spine simply works. That took years. What I mean by combined goals is that they also realized that they were presenting something relatively new in their three D modeling capability. So they wanted to have that new cinematic vocabulary enhance the narrative dynamics and vice versa. It is subtle here, not fully developed until 'Nemo.' But its plain to see when pointed out: the camera simply moves in ways that a real one does not. There are a broader set of intimate and distanced observer perspectives. These are not overused, lest you notice them, but you can see that out tolerance and viewing skill has slowly evolved from this to the later Pixar projects. (At this writing, that is 'Wall-E.') The business about family and desired roles are not 'the point' as some would say, but strategies to explore this deeper narrative power.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,4,6,16 November 2008

","I watch movies from the 30s set in Africa and cringe. There's a racist/colonialist attitude in nearly every one that overwhelms whatever other merits the thing might have. It embarrasses and troubles me to no end because I wonder about what it means to be complicit.My grandson will look at this movie here and think much the same, I believe. By then its very likely that the internet will have evolved into something where single voices can matter more, and he will wonder where I was in this. I'll tell him now.This is a sad thing. Its basic form is as a manufactured product made by financiers with the intent of increasing their wealth. That's fine, common, normal, healthy even. But what it uses is the grief of a continent. Never mind that it was created by that very act. What's repellent is that it pretends to 'educate,' to champion action to mitigate their plight.But the story is from the 30s. The person who matters, who makes change is a white man. There is a blackie who ends up being celebrated, but by then we know that all he has is commitment to his family. Its an admirable trait by itself, but everything else this man has is given to him by a white man. Sure, the white man is redeemed at the end is a sort of way, but even that is compromised.You may think I am over-reacting, that surely ANY publicity of the plight is a plus, and there IS a pitch to boycott conflict diamonds. I simply ask you to look at old movies like this, and ask yourself: did you enjoy this? Did you buy the story, which means that you bought the characters and their roles?

","I rewatched this recently with 'Ghostbusters.' This did not age well, while the other did.I think the reason has something to do with how it was targeted. In projects like this, you have to decide the lever that is first, with others in support. That primary level is playing with the notion of cool. Its fairly reliable, easy to do and rich with comic possibilities. The monsters and story and all that are merely support. The problem is that coolness gets stale quickly. So while all the secondary machinery here is still working, the core that this depends on has disappeared. The interesting thing in watching this now, is wondering about what has changed. It is that 9-11 has transformed these 'alien threat  government watchdog' has ruined this topic for humor? Torture colors everything.Is it because these two actors have ruined their brand, drifted away from what we need for this?Is it because the expectations for what works is such a quickly evolving target that all the films that have mined this since have made this obsolete?Probably its all of these.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",Null,7,13,22 May 2008
Pride & Prejudice," Juxtapositions
","I'm amazed at how many people think of books as being encompassed by their stories. When that story appears in a film relatively unaltered, purists rejoice.How silly. Stories are there as frames on which all the meaningful stuff is draped. Or so it would be after Jane Austen invented the novel. The way an idea appears has more effect than the idea itself, and so with images as well. Jane had two great inventions.The first was in building two parallel narratives: one of individuals bumping into each other and the other of grander forces of life and society. The two interact at times (and much is made of these turning points) but usually the two are layered one on top of the other, shifting dominance as they go.The other great invention was devising a narrative style that sometimes centered on the people and sometimes on their containing world, using the one to poke sly fun at the other.So converting Austen to film is a challenge, indeed, but only if you want to capture Austen's magic. Past P&P projects have used the Merchant and Ivory approach which just takes the people alone. There is a context, but it is there only to provide lushness and decoration, not fate. Not what would become known as noir.The challenge comes in how to handle the layers. We have already many ways of 'folding' in films, but they mostly require structure in the story itself. How to introduce this notion of a second flowing layer without changing the story? Why you do it cinematically.And that's what we have here. I don't know this director, but he is from TeeVee so obviously is inexperienced in these matters. I credit the producers for specifying the technique.And we have it to glorious excess. Nearly every shot is structured with at least two layers, with things happening both in foreground and background. The opening scene introduces this to us, a wonderful sequence worthy of Welles, as we follow our girl down the road over a bridge behind laundry to the house. Then we leave her and enter the house and noodle around a bit, always still with layers, then wander to a window where we see her passing by behind the house.Any movie only has a few moments to introduce itself and tell you how the visual world will be constructed and this does it well. This layering is kept up throughout, with a tour de force in the ball, where a seemingly seamless eye goes all over the building, capturing glances at people we know and those we don't. It isn't that they do it and it is so effective. It is that it goes on so long, layers shifting and receding to be replaced by others in the scores. It is magnificent. The film is worth it for that one scene alone.Oh, the actors are appealing, as we expect. The story is simplified and softened, also as we expect. The father is made less culpable, minor characters are dropped. The visit to the great house adds a sensuality the book lacked. Incidentally, that house is the same one used in 'Draughtsman's Contract' which was specifically about this layering technique.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,93,172,23 November 2005
Singin' in the Rain," Folded Eye Jazz
","Spoilers herein.This is a nearly perfect film from my perspective: It feels naturally improvised. Its episodes are radically discontinuous, but feel like fluid transitions. It has some great numbers, including the incomparable Cyd Charisse.But what really puts this on my `must see' list is the deep self-reference. Superficially, it is a movie about a movie, but actually the folding is a whole lot more complex, even psychedelic. The narrative structure is flashbacks, flashforwards, about the movie, IS the movie, about the fooling behind the movie (oddly, Debbie's non-movie songs were dubbed by someone else!). It has nested abstractions, and encompassing ones. It has several manner of annotative features. And the internal movie itself grows while we watch to have internal nesting of different types: the original costume drama becomes a vision from a modern newcomer whacked on the head. And further, there is the Charisse number which is another abstraction.
There were precessors: `Kane' (41) introduced the use of many parallel narrative devices, `Children of Paradise' (45) had conflated reality and performance: `Red Shoes' (48) took it to dance, and those are must see as well. But here, the technique becomes visual jazz improvisations on reality. Thrilling.None of the people involved ever came close on other projects.

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," The Size of the Brick
","What an exciting time to be alive! We can actually go to our corner theater and participate in the invention of a new medium. Fundamental elements of the vocabulary are still being explored and invented.I knew that I was witnessing something important halfway through. Superficially this is another Kaufman exercise in self-reference. Those are always interesting, he knows how to fold the story with methods of telling the story plus a third story about those methods. There's some of that here, but it is shoehorned into the 'big idea' that wasn't his in the first place. So although you have one of the most powerful folding actors ever (Winslet), the real advance here is in another area.Hundreds of films have tried to portray dreams and visions, folding them into 'reality.' Some are blunt ('What Dreams may Come'), others frantic ('Pi') and puzzling('Mulholland Dr'). No one has yet managed the arbitrary slipperiness of visions as successfully as Tarkovsky in 'Nostalgia.' Part of Tarkovsky's genius is in making ordinary objects exotic by bending the context. But he does his work in large chunks. Any filmmaker, the real ones, make an early decision about the materials of their creation, just as an architect does. In architecture, you can choose to make the structure out of bricks. These things actually hold the building up. Then you have to design the brick. What's the right size?Tarkovsky used large bricks, so we could read them from a distance. Rodriguez , for instance, in his second act of 'Once Upon a Time in Mexico,' used what looks like small bricks, but they are just for show: they carry no narrative.What we have here are small bricks, small minivignettes that come at blinding speed from all tenses and actually hold up the narrative. You need an intelligent actor to help carry this off and in this case we have the redoubtable Kate who is one of our most intelligent masters of this sort of architectural material. After all, her very first film ('heavenly Creatures') was about this same matter: how small a fantasy or memory could be and still create reality.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,13,25,10 April 2004
Alice in Wonderland," Sylvie and Bruno Continued
","I can usually find something to engage with and love in any film. It is a sort of challenge and promise to myself to do so -- as a choice in building a life. But this movie was a nadir in my adventure.The Alice stories are special, special absolutely and special to me.For many people, the stories are simply amusing nonsense for children, something to be fuzzily remembered in the same way as, say, Peter Pan or a Grimm's tale. But it is anything but. Carroll advanced our ability to speak to ourselves when he polished the story and sent it to us. One can hardly expect someone like Burton, or anyone making a big budget Disney- distributed project to understand the material. But if you cannot understand the soul of what you are working with, you cannot leverage or extend it. You will need to count on your own talents instead. But Burton's strength is simple: the imposition of disordered fantasy on relatively ordered reality. He has exhausted this and was finished as an artist long ago.By any measure other than color intensity, this is a failure as a movie. When Depp isn't given a complex structure to support, he can at least be amusing. Here, we have not even that.What is normally considered nonsense sequences in the books are anything but. Dodgson was the foremost theory of logic in Europe at the time. Based in Oxford, he created the story for the child of the Dean, the creator of the then great Greek lexicon. Dodgson/Carroll was a master of the inadequacies of logic within the medium of everyday language. All the 'nonsense' sections are really a catalog of all the strange ways in which logic breaks when it encounters the way we linguistically form thoughts. Many of these parody assumptions Dean Liddell made in his understanding of Greek, mistakes that have saddled us with flawed scholarship on Aristotle and his logic. They are great, great fun: puzzles that even a 6 year old can laugh about.This is where playful narrative originates. Only Shakespeare, Joyce and Lennon-NcCartney have had similar influence on our everyday thought. Karl Rove, for example, stands on the shoulders of Charles Dodgson's trickery.None of this is conveyed. None, even though the Marx brothers made this safe territory for film humor.Even the overall structure of the Alice stories is cool. Dodgson was not a pedophile, nor a drug addict, but he was something more dangerous to his soul. He was a charter member of Oxford's Psychical Society and a student of the inventor of mystical tarot, the self-named Court de Gebelin. The structure of the Alice stories, based on this, is our first structurally folded literature.His ordination ruined by his guilt about this, he spent the remainder of his life writing a C S Lewis-like Christian allegory, Sylvie and Bruno to make amends. It was every bit as tepid and worthless as this. Every bit as wrong, as offensive to reality.The movie also mixes in Jabberwocky. That was a poem written years earlier as a teen, to amuse his crotchety parson father, someone obsessed with the perversion of noble Saxon words by effete French. The poem is about the battle between true (Saxon) language and logical language.(This comment is on the two-dimensional exhibition.

The Mummy Returns," No Soul
","Spoilers herein.My disappointment in this film was profound.Most films are ordinary, and being ordinary are about other films. In this case, the precedent is Indiana Jones which added a comic book perspective to the well-established genre of mummy curse films. The key elements (from both Lucas and Spielberg) were chases and humor. The kernel of the idea comes from an enterprising reporter who formed a cosmic revenge story around the discovery of Tutankamen's undisturbed tomb in the 1922s.That tomb (as all such tombs) cursed the disturbers (`death shall come on swift wings to him who disturbs the peace of the king') and Lord Carnarvon, the first man to enter did indeed perish soon after of a strange malady. There are even fresh arguments concerning mold spores. 11 others also died mysteriously. Around that curse were resurrected cosmic battles about the powers of gods and the nature of the afterlife. (A near contemporary, Akhenaton, lost the battle but won the war on this matter as a tribe of semites later left Egypt and founded the one-god, belief-of-the-book, modern-heaven religion that now permeates the west.) Comic book versions followed.This is great stuff around which one can spin a popular tale of terror from the afterlife. To Indiana, the first Sommers Mummy movie added some novel computer work, which still amazes us. But the core notion of reach from the afterlife was relatively preserved. Here, the same team used the theory of more to produce a mess, preserving nothing.We still have massive computer graphics, and for a year or two more, we will still marvel. But the underlying structure has no soul, it has inexplicably been tossed, leaving us without a footing for our thrills.Simple stuff: Fraser has a greater comedic range than celebrity franchise Harrison Ford, but humor is rare here.Instead of one good guy, we have a whole extended family, plus the `good arab.' The chief guy - we discover - is destined to save the world (as designated by a tattoo). The chief girl is the reincarnated good girl (so she can play both the good daughter and good mom). Its confusing whether the kid is special - tapped by fate - or just stumbles on the bracelet.Instead of one bad guy, we have: the scheming museum curator (and his unexplained sect); the reincarnated (in body only -  whatever that means) bad girl; the bad mummy priest; the more powerful scorpion warrior-king who himself is a hireling of someone we don't meet; the black guy who has some special role; the moriarty gang; and the pygmy demons.Instead of one magic, we have the 12 tribes of  Magi (clearly related to the magic of the word); the magic of the books; the magic of the spear, bracelet, diamond (which will factor in the sequel); the magic of the scorpion curse; the magic ofthe mummy's curse. But despite all this magic, everything revolves around fights with knives. How quaint.Instead of one vision of the underworld, it is: a parking place for demons to be recalled from, sort of a suspended animation zone; or a Dante-like place of eternal torture. Neither is particularly Egyptian.Which brings me to the sense of place. Many of the sets are lush. We are supposed to feel the sense of (in turn) ratty Egypt; lux London; spectacular desert + train; ancient magical Egypt. Think now - were they successful with any location? Did you get any feel of magic, like say even `Stargate' conveyed? Were you awed by the visions the bracelet produced?Worse: the horror was all mouth horror. You know, Disney is accused of his humor (the stuff he wrote) being mostly butt humor. Check out all the `scares' here - they are all open mouths. Does this lack imagination? Worse yet, here we have two pernicious stereotypes of American blacks: the feral, muscular buck (`I's gonna keel you') and the goldtoothed stepinfetchit (`don't shoot me in the butt.') Wasn't anybody checking behind this guy?So no soul. Only two moments of camera art: flashes on Fraser when entering the pyramid, and 20 seconds of stop-blur on Bey during the battle (against a supposedly invincible demon army).The only touch of class was with the closing credits.",Null,11,22,26 May 2001
Avatar," Pocahontas of the Southern Hemisphere
","This comment is on the IMAX 3d version.There aren't many stories, are there? There are not many good storytellers either. Nor, it turns out, many filmmakers who can make even moderately big movies with a single governing imagination. That is the first quality I will report of this: that a single mind governed the creation and dynamics of this world and how we see it. The second quality is the experience of realism in the artificial faces. Both of those are reported by others well enough.What really impressed me was how deeply the philosophy of WETA has penetrated grand film-making. They did the world. Now, the world by itself would be remarkable. But Cameron clearly wanted the dimensionality of 'King Kong' writ large. The thing is dimensional. The camera is placed in positions that no physical camera could; it moves in ways that are distinctly alien in the alien sections of the movie; the sequence of surrounding shots in a scene, particularly an action scene, is more than double what you normally would get and surrounds. The way it surrounds is taken from what WETA did with 'Van Helsing:' the movements are those you see in the flight movements of the flying dragons. So they are of the movie and in the thing as well.There is, therefore, a distinctly Australia-New Zealand flavor to this. That isn't the only nontraditional self-referential bit. Cameron loves these. We have the filmmaker to the film as the same as the otherworld immersion set up and controlled by Weaver's character. And indeed she reports that she modeled her character on Cameron. The bit about the forest as a neuronal net is not entirely unlike what visionaries in the computer graphics world talk about having in the future.A significantly unsettling element is the weaponry. Somebody boot ILM out of the game. It is really likely that a future that can master space travel and DNA remoting is likely to rely on Viet Nam era things-that-shoot? The only reason they are there is so that for the final battle we can have traditional cinematic shootouts overlain on our by then well established dimensional reality. And gosh, have we had enough already of the enhancer suits? Though I cheered and cried with the crowd, I wish I could have left feeling that love story was unpolluted by the ordinary. One thing that I will predict. I trace the use of orreries and global machines in films, because it affects the vocabulary we can use in how we grow the cosmologies behind noir. Here we have the trees. One is huge and helical, a home to a population. It is downed like the World Trade towers by a guy out of central casting that in other theaters we are cheering because he is blowing up terrorists. Here he says he is fighting terror preemptively with terror.The second tree — the tree of souls — is not rendered well visually. But the idea is an amazing advance in film scriptology. It moved me as the guiding principle behind the inevitable love. That it collected the soul of Cameron's avatar was a bit delicious.

Toy Story 2," Battling Films
","Shucks, my original comment for this was deleted. Here is a replacement.My admiration for Pixar to date is significant, on the order of rat filmmakers that seem to care about ideas in film. There aren't enough of these, so if you find one (here a collective) that not only has intelligent notions of cinema but also make successful movies, you have to celebrate.Overall, I think this is the weakest of the Pixar films, because it is the least visually adventuresome. What they did instead was explore what I call folding and did so in the written bits, following a pattern where films include the dynamics of other films in some way. 'Blue Velvet' and '2001' are sort of landmark films along these lines, where film types become actual characters. Here the folding is just as radical, perhaps more so because the story overtly mirrors what they are doing.Here's the setup. Buzz  actually an army of Buzzes  draws his existence from space movies, specifically 'Star Wars.' Woody draws his from cowboy movies (actually TeeVee shows) specifically 'Howdy Doody.' Each prototype 'doll' gets pulled into his original cosmology. That's the background, what usually serves as the establishing world for a movie. Pixar even uses this in the first shots where other movies work to introduce us to a world.Within this movie in the movie context is a foreground story: about the value of 'play' which we are reminded is a re-enacting or borrowing of stories. Its what life is, I think and we are reminded in the script. They'd trade one day of human play (meaning recovered movies) for an eternity in a sterile heaven.I know that there are many in Hollywood who talk about this sort of story dynamic. There are few that would dare to build a film around it, and very, very few who could do it, make it as visible, overt as it is here, and have audiences be happy for such immersion in reflective dynamics. Interestingly, the original comment was tossed by IMDb along with a couple hundred others of mine because I failed in a similar enterprise. Someone complained because the original included an observation about religion being recovered narrative and increasingly recovered cinematic narrative. That reader at least did not like such baptism.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,8,12,10 September 2008

","When I watch these things, I am particularly aware of what is considered scary: slimy, maggoty dead things, particularly if they are in your face; surprises from out of the blue; supernatural forces, always presumed to be evil....But most of all we fear inevitability. It is the most cinematic of horror, because the filmmaker is in control of everything that happens next. We are completely at his mercy. There is — for those of us that are serious — no escape. All he has to do is add an on-screen setup that puts the fate in the story, and a desperate, failing attempt to escape. There can be no escape. This is what film has over books. Books can explore the hidden, the thoughts, the unseen. But film can grind inevitably at a pace that cannot be altered.There is nothing else remarkable here, save the excellent use of a specific effect that always gets me: the inkflow.Yes, I know it is used all over, but we see it here in three different modes, enough to know that the director understood the effect.

Grindhouse," Good and Evil
","I'm commenting on the double feature version of this rather than the separate films. I do have quite separate impressions of these but I do believe that the original intent was that they be seen together, and with all the interstitial matter.When you approach films from certain filmmakers, you do it on a basis of trust. Its a matter of how willing you are to allow yourself to be. Rodriguez has never betrayed my trust, so each time I encounter him, I am willing to play the game by his rules. That allows me to take more chances about the balances he chooses to make. Its a matter of yielding in the collaboration, so when he makes a cinematic joke or comment, I don't fight it. Trust.In this case, its sharpened by this phenomenon I notice a lot: he's directing a lover. It is obvious of course, but even if it weren't, it drives him to make ever stronger chances, on the edge of his emotional horizon.I think these two factors would make me like what he has done here regardless of all other factors. I do see the interior nature of the cinematic world. I do settle into the thick web of narrative threads. I do cheer when his love kicks ass.But the opposite is the case with Quentin. I cannot trust him. It isn't just because he's made some bad films. Its because he sets himself aside. He doesn't include the viewer: he preaches. All of the cinematic effects are delivered as monologues not as a collaboration. So we are never in on the joke, never in on extending the nature of the world. So I truly disliked his film. Sure, there's an empowerment story, and a sort of male's view of female bonding. But its all from the outside: the current of fate, the access to the group, the folding of all the principle characters being in the movie business. The actual camera-work of the stunts is from a discrete viewer, where Rodriguez puts the camera jumping around in the midst of the action and the emotional space.Both films play with the joke of what constitutes good and evil. But they themselves represent this as well.I will give Rodriguez a 3 and Tarantino a 1, but having Tarantino to have to go through increases the value of Rodriguez' effort. Bless him. I hope he does well with this woman.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,9,17,29 March 2008
The Artist," Dustcovers
","I am spending a lot of recent time with my list of essential films, reviewing and enhancing it. Several readers have suggested this film for that list.It has several characteristics that appeal. It is a movie about movies. It is made with movie-making explicit: the thing is black and white, silent, uses lenses and positions from the era (mostly). That era was before Hitchcock and Welles, so the camera has no curiosity. The sets include some that while they depict 'real' life, are clearly stage sets. The acting early in the film, in both the film itself and films within are exaggerated. This and some other effects add up to highly selfaware presentation. Because this is done competently, it becomes attractive to me.Using French actors to portray remote Americans is rather brilliant. That they both are unattractive people who present attractively matters as well.More. Within this context, some rather powerful dramatic effects are woven, the most impressive being a foreboding dream that imposes the inner world on the outer. The effect is repeated later, more weakly. But thrown in are some gratuitous and cheap tricks. His shadow walks away at one point. Miniature characters from one of his movies haunt him while drunk at a bar. They cross well over the silly line.The frame is intended to overlap that of 'Singin in the Rain' and it really would have helped if they had made this more explicit in the middle, so that at the end we would have known where we came from.But doggoneit, with all the power this filmmaker turned on, he went nowhere with it. We do have an acceptable enough love story, but it gives us nothing of love. In fact it is hard to know what is going on between these two, and rather than ambiguity we are forced into disbelief. The love of the chauffeur was more genuine — and strange since it comes from the stereotypical lawyer type.This is worth watching because the machinery is powerful, but the machine doesn't help us do anything with our lives. It should because it could.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,4,10,10 July 2012

","To my mind, this is less about South Africa, sport and Mandela than about another man.Oh, the drama was really there. It doesn't matter that it was not as significant in uniting a nation as depicted. How could it be? How could it?But the dramatic form is there because it works. We like to show the sweep of the large by embossing on an individual. Here at least we don't have love. And we like to illustrate a personal struggle by showing masses in huge movement. Masses and mass excitement are cinematic, and human internals cannot be. So we show internal struggle by external means.What I celebrate is another man, Clint Eastwood. Now here is a man well past the time he could relax, making significant films. This is not complex like 'Mystic River,' nor as cheaply mawkish as 'Million Dollar Baby.' It is in between. But it is — if I recall — the first time Clint has shown mass movement. Here he uses Morgan Freeman in ways that Morgan has a hard time cheapening the thing. Photographing moving team sports like football, soccer and basketball is something of a challenge. You have to make decisions about what role the camera plays. Dance is a similar challenge, but you have more flexibility because the tradition in theater is to break the walls and engage. In sport, the barrier between player and watcher is sacrosanct. The drama depends on you investing in the game; the fiction that the players represent you is tangible.But it equally depends on you being remote, whether in a stadium or in an upholstered chair in your home. That distance makes the business work. It allows representation without inclusion, because the viewer gets the pleasure of having someone else do his work for him. It has to be explicit that it is someone else.So the camera cannot take the viewer into the game as a participant. It has to always be a watcher. But how to do so, staying within the carefully evolved confines of watcherdom and still give us some greater immediacy? Eastwood finds a balance. He relies a bit too much on the camera on the ground, looking into the locked players for me. But he strikes a better balance than say Oliver Stone does in 'Any Given Sunday,' which is basically a war movie without death.Eastwood. Building a legacy, one small but well crafted film at a time.

","Spoilers herein.A de Palma film is always a gas. He cares not at all about the actors. The story is just an excuse for his real work, which concerns the appearance of things. His films are, therefore, purely cinematic, something others have called `sterile.'And so it is here. The story is a trifle, a common bit about duplicity of the spymaster. The acting is deliberately flat, presumably to make producer Cruise not look bad. Each is allowed to find some old character: Reno finds Léon; Emmanuelle her Manon and so on. They rattle about in the past, each playing a role borrowed from another story.The conceit behind the film is a group (in the TeeVee show) who create elaborate scenes that dupe the audience, correcting some deep wrong. No one can be trusted to be what they appear. The goal of the plot is to discover identities of who is who.The film is three set pieces, a remarkably simple construction: Prague, London, Chunnel. The camera differs in each third, each exploring the space in a different way, each fooling us into believing the camera is ordinary. Usually he swoops and zooms are dramatically obvious, and are intended to reveal as in the remarkable `Snake Eyes.' Here, they are concealed, and used to conceal.As an elaboration of the idea, much of the plot revolves around hidden `spectacle' cameras and peeloff masks.",Null,5,11,4 April 2002
Saw," I Know What You Did...
","Genres always exist, become living things, for a reason. A popular genre is the guy (or demon) who has the some omniscience and the ability to either create intricate scenarios which always work flawlessly. Often this is a serial killer.The reason for the genre comes from some unavoidable facts in fiction. You have the writer who _is_ omniscient and _does_ have the capability of creating complex scenarios that do work. It is the writer's world after all. And we have the reader who occupies a place between the characters in the story (with whom we relate) and the writer (because we see and know things the characters cannot).So it is a natural thing to propose a character that also occupies this space. I'm making a study of the complex ways we've evolved to do perform this trick. But one way is very simple: just have a character with these qualities, period. For some reason (an ability to impute Lucifer?), we accept this more readily if the god-like character is 'evil.'Right, them. The game in this genre is one that grew up in the detective genre, indeed, there is often a detective still remaining in most editions of the genre. The game is a struggle among the three: you the viewer, the writer and the god-like demon to outsmart each other in the giving life to the world we see.So, built in to the genre is the final twist. We know it is there, it is a structural necessity. All parties know it is there. An entry in the genre is judge on only one factor: how successfully did the bad guy (not the writer) flummox the viewer? All else is filler, usually noisy or grisly to distract us from the fact that it _is_ filler.So how did this film do? Not well enough to fool me. But then, I know the game.

Super 8," Reborn
","Another primary layering. This time the idea is to start with a horror subgenre and grow inside it. This is virtually set in the fifties (though literally in 1979). It has the military conspiracy, the small town at risk, the alien monster, the lone cop who of course is both the single dad of the child hero and doesn't believe him. We have the world saved by kids. This isn't strictly necessary and is an addition since 'ET.' (Speilberg is a producer.ET is also set in 1979.)All of this is usually dragged up so that we can make fun of it in some way, because it is so obvious and cheesy it just cannot work. But it is taken very seriously here and we are intended to take it seriously. Two tricks are applied. One is obvious: more kick in the kickass effects. The train wreck is orchestrated with flying debris photographed after the fashion of Kurosawa warriors. (Kurosawa again!) The monster is okay. The spaceship more than okay.But the much more interesting device is what I call folding. This is trick to put us in the narrative. It works like this: we have a relationship with the kids in the movie. They in turn are making a movie that has characters with which they have a relationship. The inner movie is a subgenre horror film, a subgenre more overused that the fifties creature feature one. You can say that it is artificial and goofy to the kids as the 50s tropes are to us. This layer of us outside the film and the kids inside, gets 'folded' with the layer of the kids outside their film and the characters inside. (This literally happens with overlapping footage.) The subconscious effect, based on the behavior of mirror neurons, is that we place ourselves in the world of the kids. Abrams then paces the film not for us as passive observers, but us as active participants. Oh, there are some assumptions of external place: we have the macguffin of the white cube. But mostly this is framed as if we were the kids, and we eagerly adopt their attractive personas. (Following current studio wisdom, both have 'father issues' that are resolved by the end of the movie.)Abrams, like Soderbergh, is a narrative experimentalist. Many of the insights on near POV framing we have here were worked out in 'Cloverfield.' Lets hope he works like this for decades.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,6,12,28 June 2011
The Last Samurai," 'Born on the Fourth' tries Kurosawa, gets 'Dances with Wolves'
","Spoilers herein.This film is so ordinary that it immediately elicits all the ordinary responses:<ul><li>it panders to the 'white man's' ego (as in 'Dances with Wolves'), in that only a white man can save the non-whites from evil whites.</li></ul><ul><li>it obsessively collects stereotypes in its quest to be 'accessible' because so much is at stake that every risk must be avoided. Several clichés duke it out for victory: will it be the drunk soldier ashamed of his past? Will it be the woman who cannot help but fall in love? Or perhaps the one man in thousands who is still standing at the end of the day?</li></ul><ul><li>it preaches observance, discipline and respect for the art of life and then in its fabric and execution compromises on every element of those.</li></ul>But you knew that. You probably also knew that the target was Kurosawa: his amazing mass combat choreography (which is more a matter of a sonata of motion than of person killing person), his samurai themes (not at all unique to Kurosawa, but he brought them to the west with '7 Samurai') and even his faces (for instance the 'speechless samurai' strongly resembles the quiet one in '7').What you may not appreciate is that Kurosawa crafted every frame as Japanese painting: many layers with no perspective. He worked hard with his optics and staging to accomplish this, and was so successful that the samurai genre is necessarily tied to this cinematic world.Zwick has none of that. This world is bright and deep. He really does think that the perfect blossom is a matter of physical beauty. He profoundly allies himself with the unknowing American business interests that visit with the intent of exploitation. He solidly equates this rich cinematic culture with Injuns, who he thinks can benefit what we can impose as a world view.(For example, he takes the normally quick bursts of staccato Japanese, and tones them down so they have the languor of Italian. )What he needs is a dose of 'McCabe and Mrs Miller,' in a double bill with 'Rikyu.' It is what you, dear reader, might view instead of this obsession with the mundane.I have come to believe that the big box office stars doom every project they are in. They simply cost so much that each project demands over a hundred million in production and nearly that in promotion. So someone like Cruise automatically ruins a project because they need to water it down so much. That's before the star makes his demands, like the tackedon ending here, designed only for his mugging - and even before intrinsic limits of what the star can do. Cruise had power before, during the 'Color of Money' period. Now he's a star instead of an actor.The best thing of this film to my mind was the wonderful design of the typeface used in the subtitles. It is a 'humanist' face, something between precise calligraphy and mechanical venetian-roman type. It has energy, individuality and soul, just like this film could have. These letters are servants just like the samurai, something that Jarmusch understood with ' Ghost Dog.'Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",Null,8,17,5 December 2003

","Pixar has its first truly Disney project. It has all the hallmarks of the Pixal manual: it is obsessed with exploring the third dimension and it has an extremely refined engineering of story. It touches on thoroughly conventional family values in a slightly new way. And it has a strangely relevant short that precedes it.In this case, the three dimensional explorations that Pixar mastered are rendered in visual three D because Disney's corporate strategy requires it. Its a massive shame. That's because of the unintuitive fact that of all the exploration and innovation that Pixar has done has to do with novelties of the projection into a 2-d screen with a frame. The frame , usually constrained by the physics of the camera, has a broader physics in Pixar-land. But to get audiences to 'read' the 3D, these extended physics are taken away and what we have is ordinary camera movement and framing.I may have a different experience when I see this in 2D, but I think not. All the cinematic fun, the adventure of the Pixar spirit, is missing here.The one thing that is outside the normal Pixar range is the color palette. It much richer here than usual.

This would be a much more powerful story if they stuck to the truth. Carter WAS a thug -- that we couldn't be equally outraged knowing this is patronizing. The other smarmy elements (the relationship with Lisa, the drugs in the commune) would have helped as well.The writing and directing is dreary, and the two and a half hours or so drag. Jewison is not a first-rate director. What's interesting is Denzel. I just hit him hard two days ago for `Titans.' He was mugging not acting, and supporting an irresponsible reduction of truth that I thought reduces society. I do have problems with this story as well, but I have to give Denzel his due as an actor.First, let's note that we have some very fine black actors. There's no lack of appreciation of talent in this regard. Consider (among the younger crowd) Laurence Fishburn, Don Cheatle, Cuba Gooding, Forest Whitaker, Samuel Jackson, Delroy Lindo, Denzel, A few comedians. All of these have had some very respectable work. I've listed them from what I think is best to worst. Note: Denzel is just above Eddie Murphy (who is no slouch).Denzel is committed, no question. But his effort shows. Its not supposed to. You don't notice it so much when the character is supposed to be intense. But that's cheating. In the first part, he plays an angry man -- in the last half by fits and starts, different types of intensity. Newspaper critics applaud intense roles, but the calm ones, acting naturally, are much harder.
There was a time when he tried. He was very controlled in `Much Ado,' really very good. There were moments in `Blue Dress' where I thought we were watching a major talent. But with fame comes that hungry ego which ruins the self that must go away when acting. This is a very sad film.

","Spoiler herein.Kubrick's films are misunderstood. Reading the professional reviews and comments here, one would think the reason for this film to exist is for Kubrick to make a strong satire. What bunk. What a small view.This movie is about the tyranny of movies (and similar performances). The fact that so few people see it as something else is a testament to the self-protective nature of films in our soul.The Droogs engage in performances. Their speech is theatrical. Their rival gang is discovered on the stage. There is a focus on the eye. They wear costumes. The sex with the teeniboppers is cast as a performance (and photographed that way). The accosted writer is (selfreferentially) the writer of the film, who incidentally drives the character to suicide by exposing him to a performance. During that attack, the Droogs act out another film.The therapy is forcing `us' to watch movies precisely like the one we are watching. Kubrick follows the Film-within-the-film rule of having the distance of abstraction from the film with to the film be the same as from `real' life to the film. The entire film can be seen as (pick one): one of the punishment films; a subsequent vision in the hospital; a musical drama played out in some kid's head; a simple hallucination in the milk bar; a simple invention of the gay writer (who pretends he had a wife).All of Kubrick's work starting with Lolita is an exploration into the plasticity of narrative, in the context of obsession (`Lolita'), war (Metal'), power , space (meaning the environment as in `Lyndon'), and invented reality (`2001') and adulterous fantasies (`Eyes').

","'Practical' is the term movie makers use to denote effects done in real life instead of added in by CGI or animation or some such device.A practical movie is a sort of handmade movie, a sort of sushi of film. Today, hardly any movie that depends on extra-reality is practical. That's good in a way; we get ever increasing imaginative experiences, at least in the better stuff. But as the technology grows, there is a growing appreciation I think of the masters who did stuff with actors and cameras.Its a sort of embodiment, a reality, a commitment that you can feel. It matters to me more that Jeff Goldblum put on all that goo and plastic than Bill Nighy had Davy Jones' tentacles superimposed on his face while he was on vacation. There's a direct connection that comes from this, one that prompts us to allow more in what we accept as real. This is real, and bless Geena Davis for being our surrogate observer, camera and all. Its her horror that is essential to this, and the very real horror of imagining her child. And knowing that the two were lovers in real life.The story is about embodiment, as it happens. Cronenberg in his intelligent period, where ghastly shapes were derived from organic forms. Contrast this with the insect-derived monster in 'Aliens' of the same year. That insect is unlike Ridley Scott's. Its all angles and plates and jutting sharp things. This is modeled, organic, moist. Oh, the story. Transformation again, a method of folding a character into another. A standby, but bodily change is novel. This version of the story is massively different than the last one. In that case, it was a matter of an alien consciousness creeping into a human and eclipsing it. Here it is a matter of human consciousness surviving the horror of transformation.

From Hell," Moulin Beige
","Spoilers herein.For a very long time, it has been a staple of storytelling to ambiguously mix the teller with the characters in the story. One persistent formula is to have a `psychic' character who unknowingly creates the future in his teller role and sees it as prescience in his role as character. Often that character is a drug user and runs into an equally strong opposing creative force based on ritual projection. That opposing force can be religion, the drama of monarchy, or theater. Also normal in the formula is that the sense of his visions becomes entangled with the sensuousness of sex in the person of a temptress.We last saw this formula in the amazing `Moulin Rouge' where the narrator/participant was an absynthe user who drives/creates the story. His visions are opposed by an alliance of aristocracy and theater, and confused by his attraction to a prostitute. That film was a remarkable artistic success because the filmmaker completely understood what he was doing. One could follow him as he related one of the forces at work (sex, aristocratic power, the strength of performance, drugs) to the various ironies and uses of the manner of presentation. Very intelligent, very powerful. In this very month, `Frailty' appeared as a slight variation of the formula.Here we have the same formula, but completely messed up because of the plain dumbness of the filmmakers. In this case, the narrator/explorer is a detective not a writer, reverting to the original mode. As with Rouge, he uses absynthe but here together with opiates (see `Edwin Drood' for a similar opium-smoker from the same era and place). He is played by Johnny Depp who thoroughly understands this storytelling device (see `Ninth Gate').His sex temptress is the prostitute Heather Graham -- being Irish carries extra significance to the formula because the Irish invented this device (see the pooka `Harvey'). Together, they are involved in a struggle with an apparently impossibly force. In Rouge that force was the ritual power of theater backed by aristocracy. Here it is the ritual power of the Masons backed by aristocracy.In Rouge, we had debauched Paris, here it is London, which has the extra patina of Sherlock Holmes. That introduction of the detective (read `Darwinistic explainer') as `inventor' of the world revolutionized this formula and drives perhaps half of all storytelling today.So we have a very well thought out story, with at least one master actor in the most important role. The graphic novel understood what it was about and exploited the formula expertly. But these guys, the Hughes, are completely oblivious to what this is all about and the project collapses into a juvenile, melodramatic jelly. That's too bad, because they are African American. Since Spike Lee is so remarkably outspoken and also so embarrassingly thick and stupid, we really don't need to reinforce the notion that it is impossible for some sectors of the society to deal with even moderately sophisticated material. African-influenced story-telling is the most evolved set of traditions anywhere, which makes this a particular shame.Not only that, but the extras on the DVD include a segment on absynthe which is largely inaccurate.",Null,16,28,15 May 2002
National Treasure," Culture Wars
","Spoilers herein.Sad to say, finally Bruckheimer had the makings of a pretty good movie and blew it by engaging a non-director director. These things can be successful on their own terms - even with most of the flaws this one has - if only a few necessities are satisfied. The thing has to have coherence - not story coherence, but a consistent being. The art direction, writing, acting, editing, framing of shots and such all have to come from the same spot on whatever spectra are acknowledged. Usually that means a position on the 'are we taking this seriously or not' spectrum, plus a few others.The key one has to do with the pulse of the thing. Every film has a rhythm, every living film at least. But all the components of the thing have to key into that pulse. It cannot be decided toward the end in editing. Here, every component goes its own way, even the score which seems to have been borrowed from other projects.I'm convinced that a decent director could have made something worth watching out of this. Of course a decent director would have changed a few procedural things that weren't working. But the important thing is he would have made the thing have a coherent pulse.Its too bad, because the mythology behind this has gas, more even as a first instance of a genre than original mummy and Frankenstein movies and as much as the western.

Reservoir Dogs," Puppies
","Spoilers herein.Yet another film about acting, this time the undercover cop. But `Donnie Brasco' was sharper.The tone is of a play, with artificially snappy dialog.  But almost anything from Mamet does this better. The camera moves about to keep the central set from being dull. But dePalma is first among many are who is being copied here.There's some cruelty, but it is fakey compared to, say Greenaway; and less cogent to the story.Keitel does some teapot acting here, because the scenes are too static for his style. `Holy Smoke' is the sort of thing where he really shines. Penn was much better in `Short Cuts,' Roth was way better in `Vincent and Theo' and more self-referential in `Rosencrantz.' (I'll admit that this is Tierney's best role.) The folded time bit is Tarantino's strength and it is done well here. But it is hardly original and has been done better by others. Of recent Hollywood films, `Out of Sight' and `Snake Eyes' are more artful and more integrated respectively.My point is that Tarantino doesn't walk on water. This film is not original but a bunch of ideas from others cleverly bonded. It does not deserve the IMDB ranking in the top 250. Dogs DID change Hollywood -- not because of its art but its economics. Think `Blair Witch,' or `Easy Rider' if you prefer a film from a wunderkind.",Null,13,24,19 March 2001
How to Train Your Dragon," Night Fury; Flight
","The first major film where the agent takes a stake. This is sending shivers through CAA whose power resides in control of the performing talent. The old school agents and the performing talent have distorted the product. This business of animation studios and literary agents is likely to distort things in an equally damaging way. But for now, the shift is visible, welcome and exciting as getout.This is actually written. It grows from within as good writing should rather that seeming like a desired shape made of chicken wire and filled with ordinary bits. Yes, we still have the moralizing because otherwise parents wouldn't think they were parenting. The rendering is cutting edge.But what sets this apart is the use of space. Most folks don't notice this, but we have come a long, long way in five years. I have been following the advances in this. I'll say that if you have not been watching movies in that period, this could make you a bit dizzy because you will not have been walked through the incremental steps in our new spatial imagination.The core quality of cinema is that the filmmaker gets to design your eyes. From the beginning, intelligent filmmakers have experimented with what character the camera might have. This is behind all the filmmakers I believe are great; each added and exploited some new character of eye.With animation, and 3D modeling, it became feasible for the camera to behave in ways that a physical camera could not. Some filmmakers deliberately made their artificial cameras behave like old fashioned ones; perhaps they did not have the skills to move into unusual territory, but I think in most cases the decision was to make the fake world seem real by having the eye treat it as if it were real.Two centers of innovation were WETA (Peter Jackson's shop) and Pixar. Both experimented heaving with vertical motion and depth. Much of this was in flight, sometimes through water. We have precedents, starting with Hell's Angels and slowly working through Star Wars (the original). Then an explosion, and experiments in often overlooked films: King Kong, Treasure Planet, Van Helsing. Now we have the two schools in full bloom.Independently, Dreamworks just couldn't get its groove in animation. Heaven knows they tried to catch up, but they always seemed to be working in space left over from someone else. Here the agent-producer seems to have hired some real spatial talent and let them have control. Even the opening sequence where we see the village and then an attack is spatially thrilling.Luckily, we have two 3D dragonflight movies playing side by side so we can see the two camps compared. Avatar uses WETA and the WETA philosophy. This has the camera as a companion in flight with its own distinct flight path. The excitement is in jumps not in the motion being shown, but the place of the camera.This film adopts the Pixar philosophy which uses POV and POV-inspired notions heaving. In this notion, we are ghosts that can place ourselves anywhere we wish so as to see thing better. We do move, and our eyes do, but motivated by discovery rather than participation.Compare in particular the idea of falling in love as shared, dangerous flight.Thrilling. Simply trilling. We are seeing the birth of a new medium and will dream differently tomorrow.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,14,27,29 March 2010
Total Recall," The Tyrrany of the 'One Truth'
","I never met Phil Dick, but I did correspond with him 40 years ago. This was well after he not only believed in parallel realities and truths as he had all his crazy life. He had chosen to simultaneously live in as many of them as he could reach. From these folded places, he wrote stories with woven realities.It was important to him that Deckard could be a replicant, and be more real than those not born immaculately. And with the story on which this was based, it was essential that there be three possibilities, each as likely and 'truthful' as the others. Indeed, the possibility that they ALL are is what made this writer important.But alas, there are three people involved, among the dimmest in their respective trades. Piers Antony adapted the story. A well known science fiction writer of the time, he wrote stories for kids. Fantasy things that 'made sense,' instead of what is required here: real things that do not make sense, or rather make quantum sense.No one needs to say much about how Arnie turns a picture into animated furniture. Mildly more interesting is the shape of the trainwreck that is Paul Verhoeven. He may be a charming man, and seems charming in person. He surely seems to sell tickets. But he seems obsessed with making sense of a story. Here, there is one truth; Arnie's character discovers it and triumphs as a result. Gone is the scintillating ambiguity of Dick's creation.Verhoeven, if you don't know, at this time somehow inveigled himself into the Jesus Seminar as full, voting member! The Jesus Seminar was a response to the mess that the New Testament presents, having contradictory theology added over time to serve various agendas. The seminar attempted to use best scholarship to discover in this battleground the truth of the historical Jesus, a laudable goal. The method was to collect scholars — real scholars — and vote.Verhoeven somehow became a voting member, his presence as a 'scholar' allowing ammunition for all sorts of critics. Just take the part of the story where this man was so obsessed with finding the single truth amidst ambiguities that he pulled strings to participate, even at the cost of jeopardizing the enterprise.He did that here as well.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",Null,5,9,14 April 2010
Limitless," Constraints
","There are two things here to recommend.The first is that the screenplay is based on a fresh idea that springs from the kind of gangster genre typified by Snatch. I'll characterize this as an anti-genre film because it uses that genre as a shortcut to describe the background world of violence the story has. But the story itself rides outside that genre.That story has quite a few unexpected turns because it depends on no particular genre but skips among a few. So I'll give this very high marks for having been well conceived. It also happens to have a well handled set of cinematic conventions, switching effortlessly into POV of the superbrain from time to time. There is something interesting here, something about a noir hero transforming into the con master, having to outwit what seems to be three groups of thugs.One notable feature: in typical noir fashion, the central character narrates. But he is also a writer, and presumably what we see in the latter part of the film is the book written in the earlier part.Another meta notion: he ends up fighting of a crowd of thugs by using what he learned from kung fu movies that are relayed in his memory.",Null,3,4,29 January 2015
Rocky," The Loser
","I wanted to rewatch this for a variety of reasons, but what tipped the scale were two 'ring' movies that disappointed: 'Redbelt' and 'The Wrestler.'The reason for Rocky was the camera in the ring business. I remembered it as the very first movie that did this in a way that put you in the fight, that 'folded' you into the cinematic space. Scorcese, for all his many faults, really did an amazing job by essentially remaking Rocky with clarity instead of the dullness of the Rocky character. Along the way 'Raging Bull' really did set a new standard not just for 'in the ring' camera-work, but a new vocabulary of relating between any two characters. Those 360 spins around two folks engaged in something special between them are the lowest form of this.Anyway, 'Redbelt' and 'Wrestler' were by two competent folks, and I wondered. So I went back to Rocky. I may watch the whole series. What we liked at the time, and still do is the folding of reality into the story. This is Stallone's story, even down to his romance with a Copolla. It is where we first ever in film see a steadicam, first on the steps and them in the ring. At the time it was mindblowing. Now it is ordinary and rough.So what we are left with is the now sharper knowledge of how reality overlaps with the fiction. And the story of course.For me, that overlapping is everything. Pay attention to the dialog, every word of which comes from Stallone. See how rich his own speeches are, especially compared to the well delivered but trite speeches of others?This will be an adventure for me, marching through the Rocky and Rambo stuff. I expect to be left better off than Stallone is.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",Null,3,7,26 April 2009
Eyes Wide Shut," Lucid Dreaming
","Kubrick is hard for me to get, and this film in particular. From my research, it seems as if he is one of those filmmakers who sees himself as a storyteller, with little desire to explore the limits of film as film. That's common enough and at root not very interesting. But Kubrick tries to be an innovator within that relatively narrow context by examining novel ways of telling his story.Here we have a relatively simple device. A married couple both dream of infidelities. In both cases, their unconsummated fantasies turn into highly threatening situations. Kubrick's trick is to have the husband's dream presented as if it were `real.' What follows is an experiment in inserting surreal dream dynamics into seemingly solid time. Kubrick employs a few otherwise inexplicable elements, like the title and the mask on the pillow.It works, but the result produces no great dramatic effect, no exciting narrative perspective.A side note. I continue to be amazed at the extra content of DVDs, Why would actors agree to be interviewed in such a way that it makes them appear so incredibly dumb?",Null,29,52,21 November 2000
The Descent," Architectural Darkness
","Regular readers of my comments know I am interested in cinematic architecture.There's built space of course, but much cooler is when a filmmaker deals with the non-physical: architectural fire or water. Smoke.And then there's perhaps the hardest of them, architectural darkness. Form of the formless, containment by absence, the pressing in of the absence of light.'Ghosts of Mars' did a bit of it, poorly, and it is exceedingly rare overall. That's why I celebrate any attempt. This isn't great, but it has some competence and lessons.If you don't know this little film, it has a long setup period where we have a group of young women  not girls, surely  who arrange to be stranded in a cavern with a threat.There are monsters but the threat is the dark. This isn't terrific cinematic engineering, that part all seems to be hit and miss. But it does have terrific pacing overall and that attention to pacing extends to the use of darkness and the various lighting devices they have at their disposal.Much use is made of the point of view nature of the lighting: flashlights and cameras and even after they are gone much of the blocking uses those sensibilities. Its a subtle fold, but so very effective. It makes us see what these women do and joins us to them in terror.There's an effective plot device that pings off this. One of our women has visions, which we follow until we have our legs pulled out from us and her. The ending has one of these  two endings  where we aren't quite sure which is real and which imagined. The idea that both are true is the most unsettling.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,11,21,12 August 2006
Some Like It Hot," The Wilder Monroe
","Not all of Wilder's projects are as well designed as this. But among the best designed of films before 1960 are his.This is classic because its about sex as so, so many movies are. But it uses Monroe in ways that greatly exceed her ability to use herself. I believe that the Monroe legend is because of Wilder's placing of her in a context that amplified her appeal. Wilder had worked with her before. He selected and co-wrote the screenplay around her, adapting as he went.The situation is set up to provide a context of shifting sexual identity so that she can anchor the thing with us concluding that yes, this is sex. This is what it means to be a desirable woman.And its not just the obvious things, the drag identities. Its in the girl jazz band. The machine gunner jumping out of a cake instead of a stripper, the business of a funeral really being a party, the henpecked manager: pronounced 'beanstalk.' Even in boozing out of a hot water bottle.Its so deft in structure, so accommodating to her strengths and weaknesses, that it makes me cry, knowing that Wilder only was tuned properly for two films. And this one was essentially a waste, except for getting her past the tipping point of being a legend, a presidential plaything and Warhol icon.The problem of this movie is that after its all engineered and polished, after all the targeting and focus, it just isn't that funny. What was funny sixty years ago  men in drag is screwball situations  just doesn't catch today. You have to do a context reset and you might like who you pretend to be.Its a great structure, a masterpiece of understanding and designing cinema for a specific purpose.

Inside Man," Inside Out
","I want to like Spike, I really do. He has a natural cinematic imagination, something you can see from the very beginning. And he is flamboyant with the camera which I appreciate when the confidence is rewarded.Plus other things. He seems to have backed off his 'I'm not an Oscar-winner because I'm black' routine, as demeaning as any 'Bamboozled' riff. The title is ambiguously intelligent, and I thought perhaps we would have some sort of folding on the nature of man imposed on the heist genre. (We did get that plus the energetic camera with 'Good Thief.') Also, whenever Dafoe steps into a project, my anticipation level rises because sometimes these are so intelligently shaped that I imagine religions being founded on them.I overlooked the problems I knew would come with Denzel and Jodi. I'm sure they are nice people and solid workers and all that. But actors come in distinct types, having made different choices about whether they will try to enter our souls and if so, how. Both of these defer.Here's the good: in the parts of this where the overlong the script calls for energy, he supplies it masterfully. In scenes that would normally drag, he gives us a mildly dancing camera. Nice. And if you like heist puzzles, you might get engaged in guessing how our mastermind will pull this off. Its a sort of detective story form imposed on the actual crime, and it inexplicably starts with that mastermind speaking directly to the audience via a camera he has arranged. This intelligently overlaps with videotaped interviews of the hostages that are woven through the recounting of the crime. Following Ted's law, the nature of these interviews is separated in abstract distance from the main action the same degree as the action from us.All that will be enough for some viewers.The main problem is the script. These things are cast as a battle of wits among giants. In this case the two giants are supposed to be our genius criminal and the Denzel character who faces off against him. Also in the mix is an undescribed character played by Jodi Foster. She is supposed to be a master fixer who can make anything happen. We don't know much about her. Actually what we are shown gives us little confidence in her powers. So the task of elevating the character to the level of our genius crook is up to her. I sincerely think she would flub it even if the script supported her. She's just not a powerful or interesting person. The script supports the master manipulative abilities of the Plummer character slightly more, but it slips off quickly, about the time we see him in the zoom- pullback shot (used twice!), where his grinning face is shown while a character explains what is so evil about him.The second problem is the pacing. Spike is a local intuitive. He famously goes by his gut when approaching a scene. We can see this in many scenes in all his work: they just tingle. But he has no sense for the long form, the composition of the whole movie. This means he can sort of get by when his audience is TeeVee watchers and the point of the thing is that the character is drifting. But this film should be a fine-tuned assembly, as masterfully managed as the heist within. Soderbergh knows how to fold his movie-making on an elaborate heist. Spike wouldn't understand it if you drew it on a napkin for him.And a final problem is the facts in the case. When these things are all over, we get a thrill in putting it all together. Oh, that's why the crooks spent time mingling with the hostages. But to play this game, the facts have to add up, like the lock gears used heavily in the title sequence. And they don't. There are huge questions that get in the way. Shucks. Advertising this as a thinking person's thriller doesn't make it so.Oh. And there's that junky shot that Spike invented I guess, because he just has to use it. Our hero being pulled on a carriage linked to the camera. Its supposed to show forward progress or determination you see. Pure junk.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",Null,26,51,1 April 2006
The Da Vinci Code," Rewriting Layers
","Okay, let's get this straight. The most heavily promoted movie in history, and one that deals with sublime organization and submersion in art. The story that touches on many of the greatest minds we know and refers to many greater we do not. The myth that in different threads captivates hundreds of millions...All that is contained in something less competent than your average cereal commercial? 'Hudson Hawk' was leagues better. Or if you are afraid of humor in religion, 'Baby of Macon.'Well, let's pass on kicking Ron Howard when he's down. (I already kicked him hard when he was up: 'Beautiful Mind' drove me nuts with its similar mismatch of grace in what the subject was and how it was displayed.)Instead, let's wonder a bit about why such a story in both book and movie form has been so popular in spite of multiple incompetences: from bad history to bad writing in several forms to brutally mundane cinema.We live in stories, we write our own, usually borrowing one and some of the eager lenders are religions. That's because we like manifold stories. We spin our own, but we like that there are hidden forces somewhere that spin their own stories which trump ours at certain points. Noir, depends on that notion. Greek theater. So we spin a personal story that has a greater writer in it.The full modern expression of this isn't content with just two threads, the personal and divine, we modern folk like to have a whole spectrum of forces, layered demigods in between us and the supreme machine of fate.We often cast these as conspiracies. In movies, we see them as detective or con stories, depending on which side of the eye they place us to start. Sometimes they have demons, vampires or ghosts as the in-between manipulators. But the purest form I suppose has the simple noir hero at the bottom, God at the top and several of God's conspiratorial institutions in between, all rewriting each other at all levels.So Dan Brown, I congratulate you for stumbling upon a pure form and knowing enough to copy it. And shuffling it among scholars, collectors, policemen, moles, and various religious clubs.Some day, someone really will write this form the way it deserves. Until then, this will stand as comically overpromised as the French military wisdom and competence which is implicit here.David Mamet often makes trite movies, but he has a tenet worth following. Never have a character explain things. If you do, you have left your cinematic story. Show, drive the narrative in the story rather than explain. That's what kills this here. Ron Howard.

Titanic," The Huge Machine
","Spoilers herein.I admit to a certain admiration of Cameron. Alone among special effects manipulators, he has a solid sense of what works cinematically. When he invests, he invests in a world. That world envelops us with its completeness and magnitude. It is the opposite of, say, Carpenter, who invests in the stage, in the world of the performer rather than the viewer.As far back as `Aliens' this talent has been apparent. This time, he sticks to the formula of a simple story annotated by all sorts of associations. No second plotline. No ambiguities or any questions open for viewer judgment. But he is sensitive to this I think and that is why he chose the most promising young actors that know something about narrative folding. That's where you act both in the space of the story and the world of the viewer. Kate in `Creatures' and Leo in `Romeo' did this. Kate has since grown to master it. His intent is underscored by making the color of her hair more brilliant. I don't know why yet, but this seems to signal such acting, at least in women.But alas, except for the brief scene where Leo draws her - a natural situation for this type of acting - it is absent. Probably Cameron intended something deeper and more nuanced but just couldn't manage it.

Rocky III," The Other Guy Now
","It is taking me longer than I expected to march through the Rocky corpus. That is because — I think — it is so unrewarding. What we are supposed to get, as Stallone has said now for decades, is Stallone. He has persevered and won. He has been thrown off by success. He has returned. And then the desires: he desires recognition, height and admiring love. What we want in return is for him to grow, for us to be rewarded for investing in his life. Simply put, we will sit through this autobiographical drek if the man were interesting — or at least normal but revealed in an interesting way.Well, I am finding him a bore, and these movies lifeless. The story is the same in each; the same buttons, the same faces even. Of the four I have seen, this one has two unique things.There is a fight scene at the beginning with Hunk Hogan. It does not fit into the story template and likely is there as a space and energy filler. It is not referenced in the rest of the story, nor does it illuminate any element of it. Its just stuck in. It is extraordinarily well done though. The climax of these Rocky films is the boxing at the end. The original film had some energy because it was the first time we saw a steadicam. And the boxing was unusual and a but thrilling because it seemed real and brutal. But we tired. By the time of this film, Scorcese had done 'Raging Bull' which is a sort of touchstone for cinematic immediacy in the ring. DePalma was still 15 years away from 'Snake Eyes,' which handles the rest of the world. What to do?Well, Stallone has certain limits physically. Boxing has certain limits as well which unfortunately do not help Stallone. It is as repetitive as golf or tennis, but the overall event sometimes has a carnally carnivorous ebb and flow. But we know how it will end.This inserted fight has the same Rocky, the same ring, the same mumbling. The same crew and their photographic philosophy. But it isn't boxing. It has energy — amazement, what seems like real pain. The man may be dumb and play dumb. But he has an awareness of the physics of spectators. And that's impressive. I wonder what he did with Rambo?Oh. The other thing is a pretty delicate scripting about race. Boxing often is about hate, racial hate. You see two thugs up there pounding each other; if one is black and the other white, the respective communities emboss tribal associations on their players. The previous Rockys exploited this, apparently without thinking about it. This one does some pretty fancy footwork on the race stuff. A lot of attention went into splitting the black faces into the same symmetries we saw in the ring. Apollo Creed is redeemed. Paulie, the guy who we already know is our measure of 'getting things wrong' is shown to be a racist, and we casually brush that off as simply being wrong.Bad movie. Really bad.

Thor," Shakespeare, Shouted
","I continue to maintain that the least imaginative and cinematically effective production group is not Michael Bay's, Jerry Bruckheimer's, or that gleeful combination of Ron Howard and Brian Grazer. It is Marvel, who time after time think a hard punch is an effective punch, color is the same as effect and shout equals passion. Their use of the visual art of cinema is roundly uncinematic, just as Shanghai is profoundly dumb architecturally and for the same reason.They know this, and also know that their films may not be remembered kindly - affecting aftermarket sales. Of all the entertainment businesses, Marvel knows that markets change and the real moneymakers are those that can be sold into new media pockets.So what do they do? Well, I have seen two Marvels this summer. With the latest X, they decided to add some story for a change.But here they tried another tack, and it is worth noting. The dramatic world of Marvel is Greek with teen angst added in and everything taken to excess. There clearly was a market for that. But since the production of the films is so tightly controlled and homogeneous, to sell more tickets, you need a differentiator. The angst and volume is already stretched as far as they know how, so why not stretch the dramatic center from Sophoclesto Shakespeare. So bring in Branagh and allow him to populate the thing with actors who can appear 'Shakespearean.'It is less important that we actually witness Shakspeare, the folds, introspections and narrative loops, than we think we do, we get stentorian presence. No one is going to deride Anthony Hopkins for this, because he is a lost cause among serious actors. But the real tragedy is Ms Portman, who with Skarsgård can really act and who knows how to support a vision like Kenneth would have for his 'Hamlet.' But that is not his job here. His job is to take loud things and give them the smell of Shakespeare.Natalie, like her character, can only watch in horror as this is visited on her, and disaster is grown.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",Null,8,14,22 June 2011
Three Colors: Blue," Colored Noir
","Spoilers herein.No people are more culturally distinct from their neighbors than the Polish. They know something of pain, and they have a stronger vision of beauty than anyone - one which extends to even pain having beauty. And not just any notion of beauty, but a sublime beauty.The most important development in film in 50 years was the development of noir. True noir takes the direction of the story away from the writer, away from anything that makes sense, and places the story as it unfolds in the hands of a capricious fate. It added another layer to the folding of narrative, one above the layer of the viewer and author and two above that of the movie.But noir is black, or was. With these films, our genius explores what colored noir would be like... what a world would be like under an ineffable drive to recover the past. Parallel pasts, hers and his. Other films in the trilogy dealt with tougher challenges: Red as parallel presents; White as parallel futures.That business about the French flag is no more a skeleton for these than the old woman recycling glass. I'm astonished that anyone would believe that.So this is colored noir, and necessarily beautiful - in fact part of the pain is the entanglement with the sublime.

","I've missed the last few films from this guy. He started out doing clever things and has ended up just sketching the supposedly spooky. The only thing he has to offer now is some novelty in the threat. Here it is the plants that surround us. Actually, this is a pretty wonderful idea, rich in cinematic possibilities. It has the ability to link to a rich tradition of noir, the kind of noir where fate sweeps out of the environment and plays with innocent, ordinary people. Here, the effect is that the innocent people kill themselves within seconds of being infected.Thus we have an almost perfect setup where great forces are unseen and discovered by observing their effect on humans. This is the small sister to the narrative technique of illuminating human dynamics (usually love) in the context of great world changes (usually war or oppressive rule).So much could have been done, even with the detective thread. But neither the director, nor his detective (Wahlberg) understood the opportunities and seem to have intuited something spooky leading to an environmental message.You know how some movies are deeply engaging because when you watch them, you are thinking about how you could do it better?

The score is apt as well.Still, to appreciate this you have to ignore all that, even though it is good enough, and focus on what is excellent -- how the camera moves within the frame. It is not De Palma's best in my mind: `Snake Eyes' is the film that shows his talent most purely. But this is great filmmaking cinematically. Every shot has motion in the camera; often smooth movement that perfectly complements the movement seen. De Palma is the true son of Hitchcock -- Hitch's camera ballet was a major component of the story: who can forget for instance the goodbye Babs shot down the stairs and out the door in `Frenzy.'De Palma's camera is less bound than Hitch's. It swoops and turns and explores and navigates without gravity which always informed Hitch's eye. De Palma's vision is less intrinsic to the story, but that's the point -- we are detached, swimming angels, not of the world displayed -- not low tide.",Null,12,21,21 December 2001
The Matrix Reloaded," Seventh Gate - Contains Spoilers
","Spoilers herein.Summer action movies come in two types: there is the Bruckheimer model where the setup can be explained in 5 minutes and there are no story complications to get in the way of the action. Sort of like porn. Then there is the genus that depends on complex cosmologies with the story revealing and elaborating as it goes. Possibly `Star Wars' was the first example in filmdom, I don't know. Harry Potter and Rings are recent examples. These cosmologies tend to be pseudoreligious only because religion provides ready templates. Science fiction book series in this tradition tend to have controlling layers that are continually discovered beyond apparently ultimate layers. This story is in the Macroscape/Berserker/Snowcrash tradition and you can expect some revelation in the next chapter of a higher power past the seventh cycle.This chapter was more choppy than the first, and less dark and edgy. But they do know the magical effects of photographed black skin. And along those lines, they have and use Fishburn, a real actor, possibly our best African-American film actor. They do know how to play visual jokes: turning Monica Belluci into a cow; poking fun at the Terminator movies with the cheesy highway chase; goofing on Superman and such. Some will enjoy just that stuff, some will not.The part I liked was the complexity of the levels and the cinematic acknowledgement of same. Nominally, there are two worlds: the world of (computer-generated) illusion and the `real' world. Some entities in each world can visit the other, and the action shifts between the two. But we have the two worlds of the viewer and the (computer-generated) film as well, and the Brothers have us shift between being IN the action and WATCHING it. This is famously denoted by the bullet-time effect where we are in the world of the action and then the action stops (or slows) and we enter viewerland where we move around to get a better view. Another example is in the architect's room where we zoom into one of the images on the wall, shift layers and find ourselves again. Another is the construction of pilot/watcher/programmer, intended to give us the illusion of some control: the viewer has free will also. Yet another is the appearance of what must be the most elaborate transitions in flmdom.But wait. Each of those pairs of worlds has a metaworld of their creators as well, worlds which we are on the verge of realizing. And each world also has rogue beings or angels and demons of various types. If the formula holds, we may see allegiances of these shift in unanticipated ways. That includes the world of the Wachoskis, here denoted by the albino demons. Very likely, all architects will have architects and all saviors saviors and all a matter of the chink between free will and `fate.' I thought the set design very clever and well thought out, especially when compared to recent blockbusters. Many have complained that the temple/nightclub was unimaginative. But humans ARE trivial, tasteless and hedonistic, and that's part of the joking wink at the audience. No one escapes the matrix.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.",Null,9,15,16 May 2003
The Fountain," Toast
","Let me say at the onset that I would like to recommend this if only based on the passion. I have a special interest in filmmakers who feature their lovers. This man is so deeply in love with this woman that you cannot but be aroused by the depth, the urge, the engagement.In that sense it is real, a love story that connects  and is as a result extremely powerful.But as a film instead of a love experience, it fails. I hate to report this, because the man is so cinematic and adventuresome. But the problem is that he structures his projects in ways that are supposed to matter. He built 'Pi' in a way that was supposed to reflect mathematical hallucination of genius. He structured 'Requiem' so that it was not only a story about the dissolution of a mind through addiction, but displayed in that manner. The problem is that 'Pi's' structure had about as much to do with inspired insight as macaroni and cheese. 'Requiem' was coherent, but the devolution in the vision had little to do with the way things really happen.This is a love story, told with love, and permeated by love. So he has that right, but where the especially considered structure is concerned, he is as incompetent as before. Its too bad. I believe that narrative folding of the sort he tries here is the future. I believe so because it can greatly enhance the power of storytelling and in particular cinematic narrative.I believe in a generation, everyone other than the nostalgic will be working this way intuitively. Its why it pains me to say that in terms of the folding here, its a failure. Oh, it has all the slices: reverse narrative: parallel narrative. One narrative writing (or dreaming or magically projecting) another. A life as planet, a love as religion. A death as life. A walk not walk. Expectations as beginnings. Mechanically, its all there.But it isn't connected. The passion of the story which really, truly makes this film matter is not connected at all to the narrative devices employed. It the broom playing with the toaster in the foreground which in the background the couple makes love.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",Null,12,21,24 June 2008
Mystic River," Rock, Paper, Scissors
","Spoilers herein.I'm going to recommend against watching this movie, even though I rate it `worth watching' at the end.It is worth watching because it crisply illustrates a great dialog and linkage in film art, that one between director and actor. I am recommending against it because itmasquerades as relevant drama but is barely more than a collection of TeeVee-inspired shortcuts.I won't mention the shortcomings other than to remind that there are always two thresholds in film -- or any art. The first involves whether a work is competently shaped and at is at least clever, intelligent or adventurous. This film certainly is that. In fact, all the principles in this project are famous in the industry for no-nonsenseprofessionalism, especially Clintywood.But the other threshold is whether the matter of the art is something you can use in your life. Naturally, that varies from life to life depending on how they are designed -- or more likely were accidentally accreted. In my case at least, the thing that saps usefulness in this for me is the notion that problems in life are explicable. Everything here has an explanation, in each case a repetitive bludgeon of 'sense.' This is Rush Limbaugh hits drama and is repellant in form.So much for that. What makes this fit my `worth watching' category is the way we can see the battle royale for control over how images work in our imagination. Two of the primary forces in conflict are those of actor and director, each with entirely different motives. Actors provide the stuff we see, like ink and letters provide the stuff of books. Directors (and often the supporting `designer' arts) provide the physics of the world of the story.Between them is a mystical river, a collaborative tussle that sometimes results in an effective narrative. Here we have three of the most interesting actor-directors alive: Eastwood, Penn and Robbins. Each of these has radically different notions about what the nature of this collaboration is.Penn is the most interesting to me. He works with multiple parallel dimensions. He feels that the only films worth making are `folded,' at the level of the physics of the world. He has created two masterpieces with this: one as a director in collaboration with Jack Nicholson (`The Pledge'), and another as an actor in collaboration with Woody Allen, also someone interesting in this space (`Sweet and Lowdown').Robbins is interesting as well. He made a terrifically intelligent film in `Rock the Cradle' that uses a writer/director's vision to deliver an Altman-inspired physics to an ensemble, allowing them a means to collaborate among themselves using the same director-actor vocabulary. Interestingly, he has also directed Penn in a project designed to work around his wife's inadequacies. Even in this, the collaboration was with Penn.Eastwood has more confidence in personal style and less tolerance for metaphysics. He grew up in an environment where the stylistic intuition of the director was all. Deliberations and introspective design are a waste. The actors work with you on style or they get fired.Three radically different views about how films work. All of these three ways are visible here because Eastwood seemingly doesn't care about anything beyond the style, and allows private collaborations so long as they don't step on his territory or schedule. Watch here as Penn and Robbins form a director-actor collaboration, a mystic connection outside of Eastwood's physics. It peaks toward the end as Penn -- as director in the character -- literally destroys Robbins' character as a character and diffuses him into the mystic.Watch earlier as Robbins bends all the actors around him not only as an actor, but as a surrogate director. We may never see Marcia Gay Harden be more layered. (She came close in the similarly structured `Gaudi Afternoon.')As the story progresses, we have these three directors each given play, like a jazz trio of sorts. (Eastwood's score seems to give three themes accordingly.) Rock, paper, scissors.The end is jarring, Linney's speech let's us know that Eastwood is aware of hidden manipulation.

Enemy at the Gates," Brutality Versus Lies: Lies Always Wins
","Spoilers herein.This is what theatrical people think war is like: every day is interesting, the conflict centers on certain people, guile is everywhere, love always penetrates, and the sets are lush. Those sets deserve mention. They are deep, multitiered confused jumbles of life. The pieces are big enough to recognize and consist more of objects rather than unrecognizable rubble. I was charmed. This was more a model of an unconscious than a ruin.I was also impressed with how this film began, how it swept you into the center of a story so seamlessly. This is where `Private Ryan' failed so miserably, and few films have been as adept at transporting us (literally here) into another world. Then they larded it up with a bunch of Hollywood plot machinery. But the first part is good.Here's a problem: these actors are competent, but the director tolerated so many different visions of projection, the ensembles never coalesce. Weisz (here made up to look alarmingly like Kate Winslet) acts with her breath. Fiennes gears every line to an emphatic pause, as if the text itself had character. Law emotes.The titles (which also appear during the action) are in a Soviet heroic industrial font. It is accurate (actually from the 30's) but doesn't mesh well with the style of the film proper, which seems to have little to do with Russia itself. British accents? I spent the day with a Russian, here on a short visit, to remind myself how different they really are.

A Beautiful Mind," Not Beautifully Mined
","Spoilers herein.So frustrating. Once again we have an inept film about mathematics. Hard to understand: film is visceral, drawing from visually-based insights as abstractions of reality. That also describes the most exciting kind of mathematics.The magic of the Lord of the Rings books wasn't in the story, but in the creation of an alternative world, complete with cosmology. The film lacks that inner reality and instead focuses on the story, basically one escape after another. But it is rousing good fun on that level. And so we have here. As with `Lord,' `Mind' knows where all the emotional strings are and pulls enough of them in the right order that we get successfully manipulated. But this film misses the opportunity of a lifetime to merge the images of math and film.There are three good opportunities here, all missed:The Nash Story Part 1: Mathematics is a matter of invention more than discovery. A clever mathematician can shape abstractions that influence all thought that follows. It is as close to God as one can get, and since most of the world is imaginary, one can argue that God will be bested at some point -- if it hasn't already occurred. There are conflicting factors involved: you need to be novel, but it must bind to some part of the world that exists. The unfamiliar made familiar; which can be done through `proofs' which is a way of presenting the new in such a way that everyone believes the world was made that way all along.Which means you have to be extraordinarily clever in approaching a problem from an odd angle and finding the linkage. Nash was the best mind of the century in this first (challenging both Einstein and Von Neumann!). That's saying a whole lot. It means you have to have an intense focus that you maintain uninterrupted for months. The very idea exhausts. Nash had this in spades, perhaps his most remarkable quality because it was something he taught himself to do. Finally, mathematics is a verbal art, constructed in narratives with colleagues, not intrinsically in funny symbols as cartoons and movies would have it.So think of this: you must talk with peers using a common vocabulary; but you must not in order to stay important and novel. You must shape the new in small terms, but have a global focus, holding mental orgasms for months. The tension between reaching far into the cosmos and keeping it in a conversation must have been immense. The book on which this film is based focuses on the social devolution of Nash, but the more interesting side is where his unanchored voyages took him. The film didn't mine this lode. In reality, Nash was not incompetent with soliciting sex: in fact he was very smooth and conducted multiple simultaneous bisexual affairs. That was part of the focused exercise to relate to the `world as-is.' Where he was incompetent was in mapping his visions to our lesser reality.The Nash Story 2: Nash's madness was almost certainly caused by his `breaking' his mind by straying too far from reality to get outside this large problem he was working. The conspiracies came not from cold war silliness but something far deeper: Phil Dick science fiction and Kabbalah. Not stupid numbers but topologies (forms). Not codes but manifold patterns in higher spaces. Literally extraterrestrial voices. By the way: Alicia was as crazy, but I suppose since she had an uninteresting mind, it is not worth watching.The most powerful scene (in the book at least) is when Nash and poet Robert Lowell were in the same `hospital.' Lowell entered Nash's room and mind daily and held forth on both for visitors. `Every word was his best friend.' Quite possibly the century's most imaginative and literate minds melded. I would have loved to have been there. (In fact I was in a thin way. I took the class Nash taught right after he was first committed -- his acolyte emulated his manner.)The Nash Story 3 is the story about the Nobel. Uncle Alfie didn't like mathematicians (read `Jews') so refused to establish a prize in math. The `economics' was an independent prize grafted onto the Nobels as an `almost' Nobel. Most scientists are uncomfortable with economics being treated like physics because it is more obviously a constructed reality. Nash's prize prompted a debate within the Nobel community that destroyed the economics prize and is eating away at whether there is anything left but math when you skim more than superficially. It is one of the most profound institutional self-examinations ever. The film didn't mine this lode either.All missed opportunities. Wouldn't you like to have been transported rather than merely made to cry?What we get instead is a powerful actor and a competent director. Crowe's trick is to project his character not only into the space around him but into the space of the following scene -- largely by physical motion, usually involving the forehead. Good. But the mannerisms are not those of a mathematician in the Wiener tradition. The accent is not accurate, just an excuse to give new rhythms to the bland lines. The effect of the madness is not true, reflecting prior movies more than reality.Howard's directing is completely without risk, art, interest. The one effect he tries is a bunch of fiddling with glass: shots through windows, often with (irrelevant) mathematical doodles. These are amateurish because the film has no inner cosmology within which one can register the metaphor. Compare this with the use of glass in `Spy Game.' MIT has a specific, abstract feel that is very easy to capture, but it somehow eluded the location scout.See it. Enjoy it. But weep for the `lesser mortals' who fabricated it and mind the opportunities they missed.",Null,29,44,2 January 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Shakespearian Architecture
","Spoilers herein.I did not like the first Potter film. Indeed, I've been generally unimpressed by all the manufactured Hollywood spectacles that have been moving through the promotional pipeline. So this one caught me unawares. One element of its craft was done so very well, that it alone had me captured for the three hours or so: Architecture.Film is about more than just recording a play. It is all about using tricks unique to film to place us within the story. The most powerful and unique of these is the placement of the camera within the space of action: psychologically or architecturally. Shakespeare was all about this psychological placement, which is why reading one of his plays is in many ways better than seeing it. Directors have certain tricks to place the camera within the shared mind of the actors when the matter of the film is deep enough. But that's possible in only a handful of films. In most cases, the opportunities are architectural: namely placing the camera within the physical space of action in extraordinary ways.But alas, doing so requires skills and funds that are generally lacking. On blockbuster films, they are spending a gazzillion dollars anyway so why do it right? That's why I hit `Spider-Man' so hard on IMDB: it had every excuse to use architecture well with all the vertical cityscapes and swooping within them. Well, our wait is over. Someone in Potter, Inc has made the decision to instill this film with an architectural eye. I presume that is because they are looking at the long run of the franchise, which after all is up against some well-financed competition. Longevity could mean over ten billion dollars.So we finally have something worth watching from a spatial perspective.
The notion of an architectural film, started with Orson Welles' `Othello,' on which he spent everything he had over many years. Until then, the camera was attached to a virtual human who acted as a ghost or god. All the shots were nominally at eye level and when they weren't, they were at places you would imagine being if you were a ghost. That is to say, they were all in generally possible places or perches. Welles' camera already in `Kane' was placed in locations that no ghost would pick because they were impossible: below the floor for instance.In `Othello,' the camera is not attached to any human, but to the buildings themselves. Every camera is attached to a surface and moves with that surface as if the building itself were alive, perceiving what was going on, and reporting it to you. Walls, floors, corners, posts, various embellishments take on roles as characters in the shots, so a frame would as likely include one of these elements as a human and every shot has some explicit reference to the space. Some interesting experiments have been made since then by Tarkovsky, Greenaway, dePalma and Gilliam, and in single films like `Liebstraum' and `Million Dollar Hotel.' But no attempt ever had the art and special effects budget of this film. Watch how often they `establish' the complex at Hogwarts, sometimes seamlessly entering the scene. Watch how often the camera covers the interior space more than the kids. Watch how the position of the camera is in places that only the building would know about. Watch when the camera moves, it moves in the plane that a surface of the space would have.They decided to do this because they could afford people who could do it, and it subtly improves the effectiveness of the magic. Lucas doesn't know how to do this, even with his amazing structures.This decision is driven home with the Shakespearian approach and references:--Harris here plays Prospero, in a very literal sense; the player/magician in his last real performance. Some of the shots are taken from Greenaway's `Prospero's Books,' which also deals with a book that animates characters in the film that enter the world and space of the film. Many references here from `Books.'--The cinematographer (Roger Pratt) is Gilliam's. Now that Sacha Vierny is dead, he's probably the most architecturally aware experienced man in the business.--He's also worked for Branaugh who is the best filmer of Shakespeare ever. His `Frankenstein' was both architectural and Shakespearean. Branaugh appears here in a parody of his `Wild West' role with was a parody of Professor Marvel in `Wizard of Oz' who (it is widely believed) was based on the Shakespearean of `Huck Finn.'--Even in the minor role of Father Weasely is Mark Williams, who is defined by his role as the inept performer in `Shakespeare in Love.' Fits how redheads are used in Shakespearean productions.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.",Null,6,11,17 November 2002
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," The Mark
","Scriptwriters pay attention! For a movie to work, it needs to have layers. For a summer action movie to sell tickets it has to be totally without complexity. What to do?Liman can hardly be called a filmmaker in this context, one in which so many chiefs are involved. But he has understood how to engineer layers and he might have led the charge, or perhaps been chosen by some savvy producer because he knew what he was doing.In any case, the layers here are three, but they are in tones of reality rather than in story lines, overlapping motives, time slices, or so-called plot 'twists.'You have the layer of reality that only two people inhabit. That's a world unto itself. Then you have a background world of comings and goings, of hits and threats, of nefarious motivations and all. This is derived from the old world of noir.The noir influence is that people don't matter. People die, innocents die, the world plays with fate for its own amusement. The inadequacy of the story supports this: the two work for two independent agencies so it makes sense that each of them (neither one of which is an official agency) would want them dead if 'exposed.' But it hardly makes sense that the CIA (that's the CIA building in the beginning) wants to arrange to have them exposed. It only makes sense if it is a noir world, the world of 'The Big Clock.'There's a third layer on top, a setup of chairs in a marriage counselor's office. This 'world' annotates the one that the two inhabit as assassins, and that sits above the background noir world.Each of these has a different cinematography, literally a different lens. Each has a different art design, a different approach to costumes and most importantly a different approach to acting. The office has the two acting to us, building a bridge to the audience; the second has them acting to each other, with the effect of apparent sexual chemistry. The third acting style is the Bruckheimer/Harlan interaction-by-destruction stuff.Each of these affects the other to some amazingly small degree, even to the point of ambiguity about what happens at the end. Do they die in a Butch and Sundance manner and we see a 'Taxi Driver' afterdeath memory? No, all is deliberately vague, past vagueness into nonsense.Because that notion of different sense allows the script to have layers without us working at it.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",Null,8,19,10 June 2005
The Departed," A Truculent Pancake
","What a shame. Scorcese, the old one, lived in a world that worked differently than the world of most folks. His world has no God, no laws, no fate, no environment. His world is a world of characters who exude the world. If there are apparent laws, it is because of the force of people creating the space they project into. He works in this way because its his heritage, an Italian legacy both in culture and film. And because it works. A filmmaker's job is to define a world in a film, ideally in the first few moments of a film. There are all sorts of ways to do this and the way we digest what we see has a lot to do with how it is served in this way.One way, the way the old Scorcese used, was to invest wholly in bodies. Focus the camera completely on people, a few very, very strong people, and grow the world and a whole world system  usually based on simple ethics  around it. It means you have the latitude to develop some loud, apparently full characters, but it also carries disadvantages: we never can fold his movies into our lives. We can never overlap our world into his, because his doesn't exist.He knows these limits. He's spoken of them privately, and in his last two films you could see him trying to outgrow the limits of the old Scorcese. With 'Gangs' he reached far into space, defining places, a city, underground havens, mobs, the flow of rumors through society. He reached to groups. His camera flew, not as expertly as DePalma's but wildly compared to old filmmaker's which was tethered to single bodies. 'Gangs' overreached and ran out of money, time and the patience of his patrons, so it was wrapped up with some explosive characters.'Aviator' showed us a new man. I hailed him as the best new filmmaker of that year. He drifted into the world, away from characters. He designated a watcher in Blanchett, something he has never done before, and he let he bring her tools of folded narrative to bear. It was film worth watching, his first one in my opinion.And now we have the old fellow backsliding into his easy manner, his cheat. His way of delivering apparent power with no power. Yes, it is well put together. Yes, it has serious actors doing their bit without worrying about how it fits in the symphony. There is no grand design, just speechifying. Yes, the use of music is perhaps the most competent you will ever find.But it is empty. Again.

","Spoilers herein.Here's a conundrum: the vacation action thrillers that star unkillable heros themselves die a quick death. Even a short time later they are limp. Seen 'Speed' lately? Each is a matter of repetition with the heat turned up a very little, so the next guy always makes it obsolete.But not this one. I've stopped by every few years, and it never seems dated. (Well, maybe the pseudo-terrorist plot.) But its just in a whole different category than any Arnie movie. They fade fast. I think it is a matter of originality, pacing and the stance that Willis invented. The pacing really is a black art, and to judge from McTeirnan's subsequent missteps, was an accident. But I have to give Bruce Willis a lot of credit. We live in an era when we expect nothing to be done straight. Some ironic coloring is expected, some compact between the film and the audience that gives us traction on which to build fun. Sly, Arnie, Chuck and those others take it all so seriously. Bruce, and later Mel (with less intelligence) would first establish their character with the audience as their man, their representative in the action.Then, once in a while, he'd all but look at the camera and say 'ain't this a gas, watch this!'I don't pretend that Bruce is a fine actor, but he certainly reinvented film. And in his own way as much as Brando. This is his 'streetcar.'It is important in the history of film, and in how we as a society deal with abstraction.

Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Understanding Denied
","There are two things to look for in a film, at least for me.One is whether it is important in the sense that it has life, matters, becomes part of you. This is rare, but so, so very valuable.It becomes possible because film is hungry for ways of delivering that power, so it grabs weakminded filmmakers and forces them to extend cognitive boundaries and refine new visual grammars. That gives us the second kind of interesting film — where the project itself is worthless, but there is some clear new thing emerging that by itself makes the soul tingle with expectation over how it might be used by a real artist.This and its previous version are such a movie. They contain something that I think is important. I mentioned it in the comment on the first one and can only repeat the observation here. We are seeing here the development of a visual style that is more than a style I think.In an ordinary movie, the framing and staging is expository: you are shown what you need to see to make sense out of what is happening. If it is a boxing match with Sly Stallone, you see what is essential: you see perhaps the possibility, the actor, the action and the effect. Its all there, very carefully engineered. In fact, this engineering — a very constrained subset of what can be photographed — is what constitutes the contract we have in communicating visually.What I first saw in 'Black Hawk Down' was an engineering of what you do not see. Some of the action happened around us, the camera eye moving as if it were panicked and seeing only a part of what is going on. You could not make out the sense of what caused what. Because we so solidly expect to see everything that causes things, when we deviate it is a powerful statement.What we have here are transformations and fights that are only partially framed. We are denied enough information to know precisely what is happening. We know there is an exact order to how the many parts fold into an automobile or plane, but we often see just motion. The effect is most pronounced in battle scenes when the viewer would be panicked in the motion and threat of war. Confusion and lack of comprehension is part of the effect. It isn't just random noise though; we know that though the screen is filled with scores of metal shapes apparently in chaos, they belong to two beings. We cannot sort out who is who. We know that within those beings, the animators have programmed coherent bodily motion. We know that each blow is basically like those of Stallone, but we do not know any of the physics behind it, or even which way it is going.This is an amazing visual experience. I saw it in Imax. Sure, the film otherwise is ridiculous, and I find the cosmology troubling. But it is notable that while they go to extreme lengths to explain every point in the history of why these beings are here and why they fight, they go to equal trouble to keep the visual understanding of the fight from us.I think this is something new, and I can't wait until it is used in a real film.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",Null,39,74,16 July 2009

","Spoilers herein.This is absolutely the most terrifying film ever made dealing with supernatural evil. Forget `The Exorcist,' that's kid stuff. Forget the hundreds of `jumping out of the dark' gore pictures. `The Shining'? effete. This has guts like the old horror radio shows used to because I can imagine something worse than anything you can make up and show with rubber and catsup.And surprisingly, this film has aged well, even improved as the hippie era is now long gone.Mia is preciously delicate, open. Her commitment to this film makes it real. One can feel her taking personal risks and this reflects on her character. Roman almost goes too far here, after `Repulsion,' walking the edge of suspense, slowly building, relentlessly restrained. He so eclipses Hitchcock in his camerawork; he so stamps this with a East European mystical surrealism that I wonder why this film is not more celebrated.When `The Exorcist' came out five years later, the publicity machine made much of supernatural happenings on the set, in an attempt to make the film seem more real. But this film is damned creepy when you look at its history.Many people were students of magick in those days, as part and parcel of spiritual exploration. Mia gets into this film rather by accident, has an affair with Polanski during it. Divorces her husband the singing thug and finishes the film. Goes to India with the Beatles, Donovan and Beach Boys to meditate, during which John and Paul write thirty songs based on Kabbalah. Inspired in part by Crowley.This album inspires Manson to kill Polanski's wife, mistakenly thinking the house was occupied by someone close to the Beach Boys. Lennon takes up with Yoko directly on returning from India. Her interest in the occult leads her to the Dakota, where they keep their home until John is killed. During which period, Yoko has a parade of occultists and mystics, even the largest private US collection of Egyptian artifacts.Polanski meanwhile makes the most powerful `Macbeth' ever filmed because of its emotional take on evil anarchy. Then he is exiled from the US. After a long dry spell and much preparation, makes `The Ninth Door.' which shows incredible understanding of the occult tradition in art, and his own role -- his current wife plays the supernatural agent of semiotic art.

It is like runway models. The dynamic there is that the women by themselves are supposed to have no appeal whatever. Add some clothes designed to catch to catch the mysteries of womanhood, and the woman comes alive. It is subtle effect that universally works.The 'narrative fold' here is nested in this phenomenon. This man needs love, so we reinforce the urges behind the romance. Gyllenhaal makes it easy by being simply appealing, and visibly going along. We are not supposed to identify with the old loser, but the young admirer. But there are other devices at work here, so many that the film is overloaded. But I guess that will work at the box office and award circuit. One of them is something I have remarked on many times: the explicit fold. We are watching a performance with highlights of a life, of a man whose profession is performing highlights of his character's life. The inner performance is perfectly aligned with the outer by the songs, carefully crafted in tone and lyrics.We have a second admirer. The woman loves him for the character in the middle of the fold, the guy in the movie. A character played by folded acting genius Colin Farrell admires him for the man in the fold (the inner character of the songs) and barely tolerates him as the character himself. Farrell, we will all know, is redeemed himself from substance abuse. And we have another rather common 'fold.' Bridges is fantastic. We are watching the character (self-named 'Bad') only 20% of the time. The rest of the time we are watching Bridges play this guy. He uses actorly devices that we know are such. The young director frames these devices in camera angles that make us very aware that it is a movie, and that daredevil skills are on display. We don't fall in love with Bad; we fall in love with Bridges.All that is old. What's newish is the use of the landscape. We are told in the first few seconds that this will be the case: we see the open haggard beauty of the place in a couple shots with major guitar chords, then a strong minor one and the coloring changes to dark, and the focal point moves out. Where in another film we see the characters, here we first see the landscape.I first noticed the engineered use of the open and the close in 'Proof of Life,' but I suppose it was already a known device there. 'Lone Star' was a sort of high point in western film, using the same sense of place, but having imposed times in the same shot. Here, with the precisely engineered songs, it is the real novelty and skill of the thing.Duvall was responsible for this, I believe.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,6,11,15 February 2010
War of the Worlds," Swann's Way
","Spielberg is usually smarter than this, because this was doomed from the very beginning. Forget that nowadays if Cruise is in the thing, it has to be stretched from something whole to a platform for his posturing.But quite apart from that there were already two excellent achievements for this. First we had the book, which has excellent energy: mechanical beasts as languid swans among us. Consummate language of inevitability.Then we had Orson Welles on Wells; the radio drama that blurred the definition of sight. Yes, this is about sight and always has been. The 1953 version acknowledged this and took out all the religious stuff and replaced it with things whose sight is lethal. And what things those eyes were! Designed on Mars to emulate beaux art wrapping of what in the fifties was considered the ultimate in high tech vision: the three dots of color TeeVee. The saucers in this case were floating on legs of electricity and exterminated gracefully.Sure, it was essentially a chase movie, but a chase of an eye following poor souls. What could be more cinematic? On the heels of this our genius in Hollywood decides to take the same material and scrub all the cinematic value out of it. Sure, he could have approached it with the same intelligence as 'Close Encounters,' which was a French New Wave film about the creative discovery of imagination. It was essentially a movie about movies.Perhaps he didn't know. Perhaps he just didn't have time: this was pushed up two years ahead of schedule. Perhaps he just didn't care, since all his efforts at intelligent and meaningful film-making just blend into his more mundane commercial successes.But he does know how to stage a scene that manages motion: the orchestrated motion of camera, foreground and often opposing motion in the background. He doesn't do well in three dimensions and you can see every static storyboard along the way. But when he's good at vision, he's good.Plus. Plus this gives the opportunity of the extra motion of the swans, which is how Wells described the ships.But no dance here, no cinematic composition. And no languid ships. These are a cross between the monsters of 'Wild Wild West' and 'Star Wars.' At least those were apt. These ships clunk and grind. They destroy and collect. Their eyes and weapons are different from each other. Instead of being otherworldly, they seem distinctly human, as if they were designed by Lex Luthor.Okay, so the story changes focus from being about invaders to being about Tom and kids. Even Mel Gibson in his basement was more engaging, and that's pretty damning.One final insult. This starts the same as the 1953 movie, with a narrator giving background. With Wells always in our minds, who is selected? Morgan Freeman. You may even like his avuncular, low key acting-as-appearance. But as he who introduces doom? No.Ted's Evaluation: 1 of 3 -- You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",Null,15,32,12 July 2005
All Quiet on the Western Front," The March
","Spoilers herein.These things fascinate me: films that are about something but are presented in a way that contradicts that something.Often it is a film whose message is to strive for the extraordinary, but the film itself is strictly formulaic. Here we have something much more interesting and profound: we have the future of film. We have - not quite independently - the future of the world. And along the way, we have the war film as a key factor in defining the national character.Even in 1930, the vocabulary of film was still in its infancy. Griffith (and many others) had already frozen the template as stage drama plus sweeping vistas that one could only get on screen. The two alternated: first you would see the lavish, grand scope. Then you would zoom in on some small personal drama, sculpted and dramatized as if it were a stage play. Like, say, the encounter with the dying Frenchman in the crater, or the counterpiece in this project: the two classroom speeches.This was a very bad thing. Very bad for our imagination as a society. Instead of the new medium taking us to new places (and yes, a new moral perspective) we remained trapped in Victoriam morality plays. We stick there even today. Much has been made of the use of some of Eisenstein's techniques. But he was highly individualistic, very personal - even iconoclastic. Tarkovsky's films appear radically different but were in this independent spirit. Both were non-stage derived, non-moralistic.Here we have what we would later call a Hollywood film: grand, slick, moralistic (headsmackingly so) and thoroughly mundane in its dramatic sequences. It is, one could say, a militaristic film with a non-militaristic message. I dare say that this type of drag on the collective spirit of the people is as much a curse as any war and indeed a straight line can be drawn from this type of film (yes, even this very film) and the cinematic techniques used by the Nazis to codify and communicatenationality.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",Null,4,19,2 September 2003
Love Actually," Structured Simultaneity
","Spoilers herein.I am a sucker for date movies: I laugh and cry - especially cry - along with the rest. And then feel violated afterwards by the asymmetry of reward: they get my money time and a piece of my soul and I get useless platitudes.This case is no different so far as formulaic and trivial romance. That's the nature of film love. But I did get something different here that made this worthwhile: competent writing for once.And yes, much of the writing - the structure I mean - is formulaic, but it was so well done. The matter is ordinary, but the manner of the machinery was novel.This film follows several recent experiments in presenting several stories that annotate one idea. The principle is that film abstracts and reduces, so if you want to get depth, you have to combine several reductions. `13 Conversations About One Thing,' `Things You Can Tell By Just Looking At Her,' `Ten Tiny Love Stories' and several others follow this route.The idea is that there is one prototypical woman, or couple. What you see as narrative are different dimensions of that. The problem for the writer is one of folded structure. Each individual story has to engage and have a dramatic arc, because that's where the viewers' attention will be. But the whole composition has to be woven into one experience, and that needs traditional cinematic shape as well.To help with this, the writer Curtis has pulled a number of tricks:-this is a piece of film writing, so some of his characters are in film (the sex body doubles) or writers (Firth) or in publishing (Rickman and his company including Linney). The Nighy character is a performer as well, often on TeeVee and provides the structural link to...-the tremendously effective integration of song and narrative. Song interfaces with the story in as many ways as there are stories: as traditional background, as a plot point: Joanna and Billy Mack, as a plot action (the kids, Grant's two adventures), as both in the Joni Mitchell bit.. And on and on in so many ways this could be as varied with song narrative as `Citizen Kane' meets `Singing Detective.'-The art of `bracketing.' That's where you set outposts that are intended to be different and unsuccessful so that the middle is raised. For instance, the `love' is bracketed on one side by the absurdly fantastic Wisconsin sequence and the heavily U.N. Date- movieish Linney problem with her brother. These were supposed to stand out, be different in tone and outside the main machinery.Other bracketing is obvious: the easy sex/love (Liam meets Claudia) and the seemingly impossible in the rock star's. This latter is emphasized in his sexy vixen video. And again between the love without sex (the love for the best friend's wife) and the sex without love (the body doubles).Yes, this is all known and taught. But it is good to see it all pulled off.The director Curtis pulls a great strategy:-write something extremely tight-get the most talented and independent actors possible-get out of their wayOne can see that the acting styles here are incoherent. They clearly do not spring from one mind, rather reflect whatever philosophy that actor has. This would be a flaw in another film, but here, the whole idea is to have different dimensions as part of the whole.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,7,14,27 November 2003
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," Swimming Exhausted
","(this is a replacement comment. The original was not as rich as the film deserves.)Sometimes a film has no narrative whatever, and instead relies on the tone it sets. And sometimes it works for me. Not frequently, but in this case it worked for me. I have to admit that this is just the sort of thing I reject because it has no direct narrative. But in my case, the careful setting up of a situation that has romantic tendrils sets up a whole set of internal narratives that serves just as well. Better even.The tone is a carefully balanced set of desires and hesitations from both sides of the urge ocean. Its a tone poem in wanting to belong, colored by the search for music, ephemeral enough to entice our own unsettled desires lose.I want to recommend this because it worked for me. It still does as I remember it a week later. It will open your unresolved desires.Why it works, is because it shifts the foundation from narrative to place. Like Shakespeare's lone experiment in this technique (Pericles), the serial components of search for place are substituted for the discovery of story. Why this is such an extraordinary experiment is because it conflates place with music. I think you have to be of a fresher generation than mine to make this leap, but it seems so natural that I suppose most viewers won't notice it.So instead of mapping the typical search for self, or search for a love (usually the same) with some fabricated story as usual, we get mapped to a world of sonic architecture where character, song and place meld. Where instead of the ideal romance, the cinematic value is the ideal song. That's why we have the otherwise inexplicable lovemaking session on tape in a recording studio. When some novel experiment like this comes along that enhances the romantic narrative, it is cause for celebration. When it works, it is cause for a parade. I am sorry I did not celebrate this sufficiently in my original comment. I have discovered that it touched me rather deeply.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,10,21,23 October 2008
Wedding Crashers," Good Party
","Once it gets going, this is a pretty standard date movie: Boy gets girl, there's a problem (almost always with dishonesty or misunderstanding) so guy loses girl, then guy gets girl back (often at the last minute). So far as the story, the only innovation is humor that is broader and bluer than usual unless you are a 'Meet the Fockers' type of person.I was interested because of the folding type: Actors playing characters who are acting roles. But that is so common now you can buy templates for your scriptwriting software.Two interesting things. One is mundane: date movies usually show you nothing that doesn't advance the plot. We actually count on this fact: if we know something we expect the characters to know as well. Advancement of the story in this genre includes the necessity that that all is revealed at the end. Whatever we are told, the girl discovers at the end; it is just a matter of her catching up with us.In this case, we are told horrible things about the boyfriend that remain a secret just for the audience. That's unusual and was certainly engineered.The other thing, the thing I actually liked, was the extended preface. We learn that these guys crash weddings, and then for 15 or 20 minutes we attend a dozen or more with them.This sort of dancing and fun usually comes at the end of a date movie. Here it is at the beginning. It is so well assembled that I think they brought in a more professional team just for that. This is so expertly edited that I even surmise that it was done later to help the movie, which is thin story-wise and ordinary in other respects.Possibly some side material about the mother, the oldest daughter (whose wedding introduces the family) and the gay son was removed to make room.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",Null,9,19,5 August 2005
There Will Be Blood," Oily
","I'm going to argue against celebrating this movie. It isn't because it is not effective. It is. It is extremely honed so that every horse is hitched to the same plow, so that power is achieved.It isn't because we don't marvel at the actorly gymnastics of Day Lewis. Its because it doesn't matter. I will truly forget this film in the sense that none of it will change me, indirectly lead me somewhere or trick me into some discovery. In preparation for this, I saw 'Siberiade,' another oildrilling epic where kinship is central and the drive to the earth is a retreat.(The 'blood' in the title is associated with family, not weeping veins.)Elements of that Soviet film will stick with me forever, though the film has less explosive emotion. (It does have a far more dramatic oilrig fire  real instead of from ILM. And it has teasingly seductive songs, not the edgy, spineraising tension of here.)The one element that should have grabbed me was undeveloped. Here is a man who we see is broken. There are no events to follow. He becomes a success and remains broken. The only story for us to seek is why. We know he had peculiar feelings for his sister and left home traumatically. That he prefers isolation of the most remote kind. That given any opening for bond, for blood: HW, the discovered brother, the child Mary, he will grab it with both hands and look for disappointment.We know going in that the business of twins appeared only late, but it could have been central to this mystery of sucking and discarding both blood and oil. I really thought Anderson would exploit this ambiguity of identity. After all, he's made one and a half of the very best films which explores this. Films that are multilayered and reach out and penetrate instead of a barrelling locomotive.So.I would ask you to differentiate. First differentiate rubbernecking over a disaster from exploring and knowing a dangerous situation. Second, differentiate masterful storytelling from stories that have their own lives and catch fire in your heart.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",Null,29,54,26 January 2008

","Spoilers herein.Overall, this is pretty ordinary product, all derivative and quickly forgotten. Not as meanspirited as Shek though.I found one sequence remarkable: the cave painting scene. It says something about the sophistication of our society when a cartoon aimed at 6 year olds has something this intelligent in concept. Here we are watching a cartoon, and at one point the cartoon characters watch a cartoon. Their cartoon is placed at the same distance of abstraction from them as they are from us. More, that cartoon tugs on the same strings as the one we are watching: parental loyalty in a situation of natural violence.We are growing a set of young minds that easily understand manifold selfreference and complex multilevel ironies.

To Kill a Mockingbird," One Bad Egg
","Spoilers herein.Here is a film that is impossible to view as it was intended. That is because its effect was dependent on the cultural context in which it appeared. It was bold, working to explicitly redefine decency during one of the periodic self-examinations of the country. I saw it in 1962, and both of us are quite different now.Judging it now, apart from its historical significance, there seem some major inadequacies. In my mind, this is very much like `How Green Was My Valley,' which was wonderfully photographed and staged, but which had a hokey, romanticized story and some unrealistic acting. Here too. Peck may have been a loved performer, but he just doesn't have the stuff for this role. Everyone else who is on screen outacts him, is more real. More rooted in place. More naturally motivated.The book uses the thread of the story (sexual frustration, false accusation, cowardly herd condemnation, resentful attack, salvation by an innocent guardian) as mere chickenwire into which is woven many terrific small chunks of language. That language is not poetic in the sense of using the familiar to define the unfamiliar; instead it works the other way and is shocking and effective. To appreciate the book, you have to know Truman Capote's manner of enlarging the small, finding decision points inside characters and stringing them together in an external logic. Lee's approach to writing is to add another layer of observation: essentially she is reporting her view of what his view would have been. (The Dill character is Capote.) The mockingbird is a mimic who reports the songs of other birds found in its territory. It is fiercely territorial and seems to define its own identity as definer/reporter of that place.The film jettisons all this to give us a simple morality play. What a scandal. If the primary tone of the book is the respect for the richness of tradition in place, that respect is trampled by Hollywood. Well, nothing new there.But what we do get is some very interesting staging of the children. These kids are so formally choreographed, it is almost balletic. There is some movement, sometimes rushing movement, but everything is toward the goal of getting them in lovely group positions. Very theatrical, and I must say, very effective. None of their movements are natural, all come from the director's mind. But they perform them naturally, and this carries over the philosophy of how the story is told in the book. Some of the spooky staging is from 'Meet Me in St Louis.'This film has a very high rating in the IMDB system. I suppose most of these votes come from schoolchildren who are assigned this film as homework. The level of the morality play is just right for them, and they feel enobled.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.",Null,15,31,1 August 2002
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Episode II
","Spoilers herein.Except for the historical interest as preparation for 'Lawrence,' this film deserves to be on few best lists in my opinion. It has some fine cinematography (mostly experimental) but otherwise no center. The rewritten Japanese history bothered me. Seen `Paradise Road'? So I invent my own cinematic pleasure.I write this a couple weeks after the invasion of `Star Wars, Episode II.' Here is where we find out about how the storm troopers were made and we see the young Obi-Wan Kenobi. We see two factions at war, each leader sticking to their principles. An evil force and barbarism drive the plot. Lean's film is much better than Lucas' and serves the same purpose. Precisely while Americans were making this film, Kurosawa in Japan was making `Kakushi Toride no San Akunin' (`Hidden Fortress') from which Lucas stole much of `Star Wars' most famously including the storm trooper costumes. Here, in `Bridge,' we see the young Obiwan in his first important mission as a Jedi actor. (He would be knighted the next year in large part for this role.) `Star Wars' ended up being the bridge between `Bridge' and `Fortress.'Or alternatively, you could see this as Paul McCartney did, as one of the inspirations for `Sgt. Pepper.' (Just the idea for the band of four led by the joker Billy Shears, mixed with the whistle march, destroying things and conceptions that other parts of British society were building -- or at least maintaining through doggedness.) This is where the line `All you need is love' comes from as well. (And Ono?)Or you can see this as David Lean's apprenticeship in Cinemascope. The acting is rather stilted, especially with Holden. In fact everyone but the medical officer was living in a prior world of `Great Expectations' acting -- stagy readings of lines. But Lean came through it well enough to next make essentially the same picture but in the desert. That had a better score, superb superb editing, and an inspired actor. This film is merely competent. But you can see him testing out the epic in this new medium, especially the framing of a man's emotion in a long shot.Or -- here's another take. War films are a primary means by which a nation redefines itserf. And there's major change evident here. The Japanese committed the worst barbarisms of the century in this time and place, but since the Cold War was gearing up and the US needed the Japanese as a buffer against the Russians, here they are depicted mildly, no less intensely than the British and somewhat comically. Here we have the first appearance of the Brando type of American, not as a rebel but as the prototypical American: no guff, ladies' man; somewhat dishonest but only on minor matters; inventive; and brave when the chips are down. (See `Great Escape' for the next step in this evolution.)At this very same time (in a picture also advised by Washington) Brando himself was in Japan making `Sayonara' where he as a war hero falls in love with a Japanese girl. We needed to rewrite history and make friends.And Siamese peasant girls from this period with bras and makeup? See, that's indicative of the inherent 'let's pretend' stance of this purportedly realistic world.",Null,6,14,30 May 2002
Man on Fire," Brother Tony Dances
","I avoided this for years, because... well because Denzel bothers me. He's probably a nice man. He does a very fine job of projecting a sort of jolly wisdom on screen. But every character and every stroke within that character references this persona. It isn't even him, its his public face. Its the most annoying sort of pseudoacting I know. Unless the movie hinges on this particular and very narrow notion, he fights it.So we end up with a failed picture with a guy in it that we just have to love, or at least admire. Whether we like it or not, race matters in this, because the type he draws on for that personal origin is that of the wise black uncle. He did choose that face after all. Though Forest Whitaker (for example) is in much the same spot, he's chosen to be a real actor, a different man each time we see him.So that bias kept me away from this. My loss. Washington really does work here. Its not because he is any different than elsewhere. But because the filmmaker was intelligent enough to know the man's limits and build the movie around them. And what a construction! Yes, it can be said that Tony also makes the same movie each time. Yes, he uses the same devices each time, striving for the same effect. But he's getting so darned good at it. His dynamic camera is so integrated with his jumping cuts  the most energetic in the business  that while he invented none of it, he surely is the master. I need to go see his TeeVee work on cerebral detectives now. I must.That camera tension is something worth noting, and why it works. Its because the camera stands in for our eye. If managed well, we accept it as our eye, and when it moves, we accept that we would be and are moving that way. When it slides from a face to an object, we believe that we would have done the same, noticing something that may or may not be important.We have the running camera here, making us less of a ghostly, gliding observer, but a human running one, panting, eager. SInce Creasy is so cool, it casts us as actually more in the story than he is. The roles are reversed a bit: though he makes things happen, he is the viewer and we are on the street.Brothers.

Why should I be unhappy?Because I know the book. Now, I have no illusion about books and translation into film. But it bothers me when I think about why I am drawn into this film, and the book helps me understand why.Kesey's work was from the perspective of the damaged mind of the Indian. It was Nabokovian in dealing with created realities, realities that did not exist but were confabulated as an artifact of us entering some diseased eye. The whole point was there is no anchor of right and wrong.Forman is a talented storyteller, but before he is an artist, he is a Czech. And Czechs (at least in those days) live in only one world: a world where some forces in society unjustly imprison the rest in ways that imprison all. It is a real world, a dark broken world illuminated only by brief flashes of tenacious individualism. Self-immolation. Svankmajer stuff -- check him out.
The problem with this vision of 1975 is that it uses the very same techniques it rails against: there really is a good -- it says -- there really is an institutional bad in Forman's world. Cartoonish films are as common as grass, but this one rankles. The institution of Hollywood selfishly changed the ambiguous, morally shifting world of Kesey into a simple morality play knowing that we would be hypnotized with its very clarity.

Edge of Tomorrow," Combat with Explicit Watchers
","Superficially, this has what it needs to be a financial success: novel aliens, lots of combat, competence all around and *the smile.*But it also has advanced interesting, structure. This structure did not originate in the movie community, it should be noted. The source is a novel, later adapted to a comic.Think of it this way, in film terms: traditional noir has an innocent man being plucked out of nowhere to be manipulated for our entertainment. We as watchers become complicit. Here, we have aliens doing the manipulation with us. They are aptly called *mimics,* with the capability of planting insights into humans to deceive them.As the story progresses, the goal becomes to kill the master watcher/manipulator, thereby *winning.* The device is the accidental transfer of story replay from a mimic to our character.We also meet a woman who was fooled in a previous episode (that we only hear about) and so becomes what we would call a movie celebrity.And the insights our players get? They are not much different than movies, played over and over again, each time with our hapless hero becoming more in control. Since Welles wrapped up the phase during which we had true noir, we have had an amazing variety of structural experiments that elaborate or use the device. This one is novel because it places avatars of the audience on screen as combatants and mixes the role of noir hero with their watcher capabilities.Many viewers compare it to Groundhog Day, but the essentials are quite different. In that construction, it started as a movie (a TeeVee report), but quickly became a kind of coming of age story. Repeated second chances.No one else on screen had insight into or control over what was going on. This film is profoundly different, having all those explicit in what we see.This sophistication makes my case that the kinds of noir folds are innovating, evolving quickly. Would a mainstream audience of 15 years ago have accepted this movie? I suppose not, but it all makes sense today to even the most casual viewer.",Null,7,12,25 February 2015
Downfall," The Stage Under Das Boot
","I have a friend that does something she calls 'art therapy.' So calls it art because it uses the same material artists do and produces similar artifacts. When other people do this, I accept it as art, meaning that I allow it to penetrate all of my inner selves it can and make whatever changes it may. After all, aren't all artists engaged with their work in messy, tearful, dangerous ways?But with my friend, it is different. I know how she is damaged. I know why and a bit of how she produced her paintings. The artifact comes to me with that context. Her relationship to it is embossed on my relation to it, so it cannot dissolve into my soul. It only knows the pores of her soul. I suppose if I wanted to somehow re-enact her life it would be useful, but in truth, her stuff is useless to me. More than useless, because I can make art out of neutral found items, but hers aren't neutral.One could say that I might see her demons, but I defy anyone to examine that closely and believe it true. It is not the nature of therapy to serve things for others.I thought of my sad friend all throughout this film. Yes, it is skillfully produced in many ways. Yes, if you pull out this performance or that, you can admire decisions the actors have made. But films are not performances, they are narratives that resonate or not.This is one of the grand therapeutic gestures the Germans are making to resolve the past and distance themselves from it. The twists of character, certain embellishments of phrase, placement of the designated watcher all got in the way for me. I knew that this was a dialog Germans were having with themselves that I was eavesdropping on and grasping for a reason why.But having invested in it, both in time and emotional exercise, it does give me some value.Hitler intuited the role of ceremonial theater, of defining the narrative for a people. He only allowed choreographed films and photos, and never in private moments when he wasn't performing. His most important adviser was Speer, a dramatist who found and designed the stage for the superman. Speer was the most effective dramatist in history, measured by immediate deaths at least. Speer and Reifenstahl created the first effective political propaganda film, a masterpiece by any measure.Until the end, Speer as stage manager orchestrated the drama. He enters this story at the beginning, telling his man that he needs to be 'on the stage when the curtain comes down.' Later, when it really is, he visits his actor and tells him to spare the German people (which is denied as much as Hitler can). I get the feeling that this movie was as much directed by Speer to save the people as anything else he did. So within the drama, we have the director, the designated watcher (our doubly seen stenographer), and historical characters playing not so much those characters but well established German stereotypes. All in all, the construction is clever, and the execution slick. But it is therapeutic art. And we know it, and why it exists, and the specific damage associated with it. So even though it looks like art, it cannot be. It cannot change us.See 'Conspiracy' for something from this era that perhaps could. Shucks, I see my comment for that has been deleted.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching. The film.",Null,12,19,13 February 2006
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Drained

Further, imagine the additional pressure of being near bankruptcy because of extreme business incompetence. What to do? What to do?Make a film that dummies will sponsor because they think audiences are dummies. Pick a subject that DEMANDS a trashy treatment. For the girl, get that girl from `Beetlejuice.' The doctor, that doctor from `Elephant Man;' the `boy' that dumb kid from Bill and Ted's party. A Dracula requires breasts and brilliant red hair, ideally on the same body so just do it. This way you can camp it up without penalty and do some `serious' filmmaking in the background when no one is watching.The problem is that Coppola isn't a well rounded filmmaker. He is in the Italian storytelling tradition (with Scorcese). That mode invests everything in character; all situations, all the notions of `seeing', every visual excess is built around that notion of the individual driving fate. It was a success with `Godfather' because it breathed new life into a tired genre and invested Italian characters with their own world.The excesses here are intolerable, precisely because he fights Stoker's key notion: that fate drives the characters, not the other way around.`No matter,' we can imagine him saying, as long as I do my intelligent stuff in the background. Katz/Merhige would later successfully develop the notion he uses here of the `shadow' of the vampire in the film of that name which is deeply self-referential: films about films, representations about representations. Coppola does a childish version here:
<ul><li>A dozen times or so we have the film itself as a shadow puppet play, merging into use of Dracula's shadow and further into both his other forms and the use of shadow overall. In another project, I might be awed by how manifold this is, and how well integrated. But in fact, the folds are integrated with neither themselves or the story, and especially not the shadows of the film itself (as was the case with `Shadows'). Incidentally, `Shadow' was produced by Coppola's equally blunt nephew, but he wisely kept an arm's length.</li></ul><ul><li>He does do a clever thing with the notion of film itself. As Dracula comes to London, the nature of the film turns into a zoetrope which is both the name of Coppola's (financially troubled) studio and is featured in this same scene where Dracula meets Mina. Get it? The world of the imaginary meets the world of the real? Note that the staging is copied from a similar scene, with similar intent, in `Chaplin' of the same year by buddy Attenborough.</li></ul><ul><li>The scene where Hopkins draws a circle of fire around himself to ward off temptation by the devil (including sex) is a direct reference to buddy Scorses's scene in `Last Temptation of Christ' which dealt with precisely the same thing. In fact, he is using the same cinematographer.</li></ul><ul><li>Because the red hair means closer to the supernatural, Lucy is the first to go. Watch closely as Mina discovers Dracula (as a beast) ravishing Lucy in the garden. As he looks at Mina, his gaze turns her hair red. It is a pretty complicated effect that she doesn't exploit.</li></ul>All this motion, and none of it particularly intelligent, none of it coherent. It gives the impression that someone drained all the blood out of Coppola.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.",Null,12,23,21 May 2003
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Just Die
","Spoilers herein.This genre is now mature enough to have several requirements in addition to simple orange explosion balls. You must have a brilliant adversary. That adversary must lead you through at least one major surprise. Since the franchise was getting old, we have _two_ major surprises here: the switch between revenge maps and simple theft and the switch between destroying the gold as an act of Islamic terrorism and again simple theft.Along the way must be many crises. At the end, some personal growth must result. Click, click, click. Thrills by numbers.The only interesting thing to do here is to watch the actors as actors and wonder why they are there. Willis is there because he has mastered the art of simultaneously acting a role and commenting on it in a secret dialog with the viewer. Jackson is there in the Danny Glover role because Glover wouldn't be right and because he looks like Malcolm Small. Jeremy Irons exists in this world like Willem Dafoe: a serious actor who cannot find meaty parts so fills in where studio bosses want.But Sam Phillips is a weird one. Here is the superchristian popular preacher, playing the evil slut with a death fetish. She is a mercenary for Islam, intent on the double-cross following only her lust. This is strange.

August Rush," Yellow Bricks Heard
","There are three kinds of film that I value and treat differently: those who truly leverage dance, space or sound. I have not yet found one that exploits mathematical space, and would add that when it appears, probably from Ruiz and Greenaway who come close.Of those three, we have some interesting and a few lifealtering dance movies. We have some successful experiments with space. But its music that seems the most challenging, and I think the reason is obvious: if you want a great film it has to be cinematic  you have to get the world visually first. Everything else is annotation.But what is cinematic sound? Does the fact that we are trained to not acknowledge a film score work against us? Is it possible to host such a bold experiment in a sappy, mainstream wrapper, with holy cow Robin Williams?It seems so. Yes, I will advise that you have to actively ignore the pull, the drive of this thing and all the plot, characters and acting associated with it, and simply revel in the notion that the urges in this film are all sonic. Yes, I found some of the visual expressions of inner music silly, just as I do with mathematical urge. But they tried; they built an entire project uncompromisingly around the idea of music as an urge....And not just an urge, but one integrated into the wheels of fate and justice that control the noir dynamics of modern film. Yes, we know the family will be reunited. Yes, we know all urges will find the path to the happy ending. But this is such a unique effect that it makes all the deficiencies worthwhile.

Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Unanchored
","This is a simple exercise in humor by going out of bounds. Well, this has energy.It does have what I call folding, being a show about a show and show business. But that element is mundane, of the 'Zoolander' variety.I've been studying bounds recently. You might call them norms or conventions...Much of humor comes from understanding where those bounds are at that moment and with that particular audience  and then stepping just over them. So much humor can be seen this way just by allowing different boundaries to think about.If the distance of the step is tiny, the humor is considered sophisticated and is often missed by the less sharp or attuned. If the stepping over is a big step, the humor is considered broad, crass.We like the small steps because it shows more skill, even intelligence and it points out the humor in 'real' life. So we remember it. Sometimes it changes us.This is broad and crass. Purveyors of this sort of thing make up for that weakness by shooting in many directions, and at least all the big ones: sex, status, life, religion...When that's your formula, you can only accomplish so much. It all boils down to whether it has energy and whether the overall rhythm of the thing has a groove.

American Gangster," Malcolm X Done Right
","This film went through hell on its way to the screen. It was fondled, butchered, divorced and remarried, sunk, then revived. Along the way, the story evolved from a one story to several, only loosely connected as the studio tried to cover all bases.Scott hired on basically to keep working. its one of his lesser projects, like 'Hannibal,' where he follows the script fed by others. But still, he has a cinematic style that makes this worth watching if you love visual poetry. In fact, you can watch this with no sound whatever and possibly enjoy it more. That's because Scott designs his shots and shaves his editing so that (almost) each shot anticipates the next. Its unique in modern film-making, and when he goes, this style will probably die. 'Gladiator' was the height of this, and Crowe understands what he has to do to feed it. He's not there much, but the sequence where the raid on the drug lab is so 'in the future' it will be a film school staple for decades.Washington doesn't get this end of film-making. He was inherited from an earlier incarnation of the film. So instead of being inside the film, he's placed outside. He's not the story, but what the story uses to tell itself. Its a subtle distinction -- and Washington's cluelessness as an actor is used against him -- but it makes the thing a bit more coherent to consider his character as simply shaped by the forces around him. Washington has such a narrow range, I couldn't help compare this to Spike Lee's picture. Spike goes for the story as it appears in the actors. He discovers it and captures it in bits. He doesn't compose a movie; its coherence comes from found characters. So his pictures have no cinematic soul, and give the illusion of finding reality. That can work when he actually finds life, which is rare. He didn't in 'X' so the choppy nature of that arc stands in contrast to the energetic action of time this has.Scott also likes to designate watchers, even if not written in the script. See how he manages to photograph the two wives in such a way that they are internal surrogates for us?The one thing that annoys is those labels to tell us where were we are, Thailand, Brooklyn, Fort Bragg and so on. This is just cinematic laziness. Scott could easily have shown us where we were, and in fact does some of the time.

Stranger Than Fiction," Unavoidably Dead
","This is something of a failed project because the last two of the three acts are stunted.The first act concerns our hero discovering that in addition to being 'real,' he is a fictional character of a writer in the same reality.Unfortunately, someone decided that this should be lengthened and exaggerated because of the comedic benefit. I am sure the project did not start out this way.The second act is the most powerful in terms of the folding. Here we learn of the beauty of his independence, but that the book with his death is 'so beautiful' that he really should die to preserve the beauty of the work. The laborious introduction of Hoffman's character in the first act is so that he can render this judgment. Its pretty powerful stuff, and after reading the book with his own death, our hero agrees.The third act is a sort of resolution based on the realities of big movie requirements for a happy ending, with the guy getting the magnificently appealing girl. But its rushed and something of a mess. Its obviously grafted on. The narrative connections are broken; the rhythm is all wrong. While Emma's book is declared 'not very good,' the movie is pulled the same way in an ultimate folding.Well, I guess we should celebrate any sort of overt folding in films, even second-rate ones. I have to remark that Hoffman is the best I have seen him since 'Rosencrantz.' He used to be a fine actor.

The Reader," Hidden Information, Unhidden Daughters, Church
","Okay, now I've seen the two simultaneous Winslet movies. Both are celebrated. Both seem to understand Kate's gift as an actress  that she is one of those rare players who can convey what a character does and also, via another channel, what she thinks or rather what motivates what she does. Its what I've called folded acting, with that second layer being a direct communication with the audience that annotates the first.Its a specific sort of openness, and usually a filmmaker asks her to be obviously open. Both of these men, understanding this, have asked her to do the opposite. She is instead, obviously closed, using that second channel to convey that the channel is there but much is hidden.Both of these films are amazing on this count. Its a new development in film acting in the 50 years or so since folded acting first emerged.But otherwise, oh, what a difference in the two films. The 'Revolutionary' one is made by her husband apparently just for this one effect. There is no narrative structure, only a stunt. The music is the main character there.This film is wonderfully structured. It as rich in narrative facets as she is, each reinforcing the other. Seeing the two close to each makes me wonder why it isn't obviousThe film starts with us being told that literature, great literature is about hidden information. Then, throughout, we have the thread of the law, both referencing classroom and trial genres except for the focus on what is not revealed. This is folded into the very literature itself that is denied this woman, except in three circumstances: one we hear about and two we see.And THAT is folded into love, its unrelenting yearning that can gnaw, its sex (obsessively, Germanically clean) and its idealistic romances. Both Chekhov and Homer as the templates. Wow, what care!Its a matter of all choices having been discovered and not made. About what daughters do not know. Lena Olin has a career high here playing two generations. Her portrayal of the daughter is profound. We never really understand what happened with her: her mother was the only survivor of a specific situation. It seems that the daughter was born after the war and wrote a book about her mother's plight, never escaping the story.Its all about observing, observing in every dimension and the power of looking even when you cannot seem to see.At the end, there is a remarkable contrast between Hanna's stark cell, indeed everything in Germany we are shown as stark, and the opulent home of the daughter. There, she reminds that illiteracy is not a Jewish problem  this is after literature has been conflated with life.There is a pretty, sexy law student with whom our lad sleeps. She may have become his wife and that one evening the origin of the other daughter. She is played by the same actress who was the Plum Girl in 'Perfume,' the original womanscent.The role of a certain church is deliberately kept ambiguous. It may in fact be the church that we visit twice. We never really learn what happened there, and its significantly shrouded. That will always be hidden.The same fellow who made this also made the similarly deep 'The Hours' and the execrable feel good trailer trash 'Billy Elliot.'

The Wrestler," Lap Dance
","Aranofsky drives me crazy. He understands film well enough to goof up expertly.Sure, everyone will be impressed with how Rourke performs, and Tomie as well. But they are performers playing performers under a directing style that allows actors to run as wild as they wish. That could be useful if he had a long form film into which they could meld. But he  in all his films goes simply for a story that allows for the establishment of a tone and then he simply hammers the daylights out of it.There's something worth arguing about though. He has this technique of anchoring the camera to his character, often by a tether. It is front, following, side, always with the body. Our Italian American filmmakers do something like this, except not so precise and consistent. It is from a specific philosophy of storytelling that has people defining the cosmos. I wonder how possible it is to make a successful, textured film with this approach. There simply cannot be enough flavor, sunshine, penetration in the mix. Film is wine, not grapes.Tomei's character would have been stronger if the age of the actress was the same as the character, or less.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",Null,7,15,19 February 2009
Hancock," Separation
","I viewed this unwillingly. Will Smith projects give me the willies. Like many other big budget productions the economics drive decisions of safety that suck all the novelty and risk out of a project. It isn't that I dislike Will; he's a likable product. Its just that any movie that chooses him probably would not be worth watching.And this isn't for the first two thirds. Its a simple joke repeated over and over and we settle in patiently looking at our watches until we can escape. Even the movie lobby would be richer we think. And then the story takes an unlikely turn. Perhaps you will know and expect it. I did not and it had its full impact on me. We learn at the same time that our bum-hero learns the truth about his situation and a whole cosmos of new  action annotated  dynamics opens up. Now, if you haven't seen this, the new dynamics aren't particularly valuable on their own terms, but coming after we have been lulled, coming after what is essentially a childish setup  it petty darn marvelous. And it isn't stupid.Basically the idea is that the gift of power, if held in a partnership, makes that partnership ever so much more attractive and valuable, even essential. But at the same time it pulls out the forces that drive the special power. This is not a trivial dynamic. It is not from the 'good versus evil and good wins because it is the biggest badass in town' school, though the wrapper is.Charlise Theron's attractions actually work for her in this partnership we see, because it is not a partnership we are in. The asymmetries of all situations are amplified because of the Will-Charlise dynamic and we become more aware that we bring little else to the table other than our 9 bucks.I liked it.

Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Predictable
","By know you know the most important things: the acting and dialog are unbearable (except in the case of McDiarmid), and the effects are busy but competent. The story spins and spins until it ends where we know it must with each step being supremely predicable.This comment deals with only two elements: risk and dimension, plus a few miscellany. Risk: This is the most profitable franchise in the history of media. Lucas has shown that fans will turn out no matter how bad the films are. The last two were scandals yet sold tons of tickets. He could have done anything with this. Anything.Almost every other major player in Hollywood at this point in their careers  rich beyond imagining and nearuniversally celebrated  would strive to satisfy their peers that they indeed are capable of doing something clever and inventive if not artistic. They know history grinds away at hacks, no matter how successful, until they become jokes, Edward Bulwer- Lytton was in his day roughly in the position that Lucas is now. Today he is a joke from Snoopy in the comics to the yearly Bulwer-Lytton junk writing contest.Recall this movie and ask yourself if there was anything in it that surprised you, that wasn't exactly as you expected from past movies, that made you sit up and say, 'wow.' With the approximately 8 billion dollars this franchise will make directly, there could have been room for something  at least one thing that was cool. There was not a shred of new imagination in the cities, creatures, props or design. Not a single novel technological item or scientific or even cultural idea was introduced, usually what defines science fiction.Though Lucas owns the largest and most advanced special effects company in the world (Industrial Light and Magic), there was no effect that we haven't seen elsewhere. Does this lack of risk, ambition and novelty strike you as odd? The first movie in the series (the 1977 one) did introduce something new in effects, the dogfight and trench run at the end. Since then, effect-laden films have learned how to place and move the camera in new and exciting places. Even a film as mundane as 'Unleashed,' which I saw last week, moved the camera into the midst of the fight scenes. Lucas' camera is still stuck in the same mode as in 1977, which he (admittedly) stole from Kurosawa.Dimension:That is... except for the first seven minutes or so. That is the only part of the whole movie where we see a new camera eye. This is dePalma's eye: it follows the fighters and their pilots; it swings around them and precedes them, it swings to their point of view, it moves back out of the battle and back in. But shortly we are back in the old static greenscreen mode with Jackson.There's a famous story in Hollywood. Lucas took his original Star Wars money and built ILM and Pixar. He really had ambitions to change the future of cinema. ILM has indeed become a major force in movie-making and some say the world is now open to new possibilities. But ILM has instead become rooted in realities: you imagine a place and they make it look real. Pixar was always the place where more imaginative and impossible worlds would take shape.But he simply didn't know what to do with it. He couldn't stretch his vision beyond what he could already see, so he sold it to Steve Jobs. Jobs has focused not so much on inventing new realities but on a new feeling of dimensionality for the viewer. 'Nemo' was cast in the sea so that the action and the camera would be free to move in all three dimensions. Pixar has profoundly changed how we expect our eye to move in threespace, and they have effected that change more in the last 4 years.Space battles are ideal fields for this sort of awareness, but simple travel in high cities affords lots of opportunities as well. This movie has many, many places where the new consciousness could have been employed, but it wasn't.Miscellaneous:Ewan McGregor's career will survive. He's already been in two films that actually did make a dent in the universe ('Pillow Book,' and 'Moulin Rouge'). He doesn't need to claim this as an important film.Non-US viewers will certainly see this story as a metaphor for American politics and policies of force: a democracy that sacrifices freedom for security; a war based on sleight of hand; the statement that anyone not for us is an enemy; the misappropriation of religion for political gain...On opening weekend of this film, I predict that it will be remembered as something that changed the political narrative in the US by sheer exposure (and timing). And that as mythmaking and movie-making remembered not as important but fondly recalled, like 'The Wizard of Oz' is today.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",Null,28,53,23 May 2005
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," Stained Glass
","I have a lot of complaints about Disney; what he made personally and the lumbering beast his studio has become.In particular, he murdered one of the most precious literary structures we have in Alice. But in his first big project, he did well enough to change the world. In its day, this was a rule- changer, the Star Wars of its day. Everything that happened afterward was different. Many people credit the characterizations, which Disney never did as well afterward, creating a vacuum for Pixar to fill. I admit that except for the 'swallow the soap' trick, I liked that element.But I think there is something more fundamental at work. Movies are basically about visual notation. Its less about what the stories are than how they are told. One of the evolutions that I track is the business of outside awareness. But this, I think is something different, sort of in the opposite direction. We had comics before, where objects were not masses but boundaries. We had cartoons before, where large blobs of grey and then color defined shapes that we assigned identities to. But this has two things. They were revolutionary.The first is the narrative long form. It isn't complex; it has only one arc. We even know what the arc is and how it will end, the only mystery (for the original viewers) being in the cinematics of the thing. Disney would stumble later, on understanding the nature of long form storytelling but here he does what must have seemed impossible.The second is more visual. At the time, this seemed more natural and organic than anything that had gone before (except for the Prince  Disney always has trouble with men). We focus on the dwarfs, but the girl has mannerisms that are beyond anything we had seen before, the best being Betty Boop before the censors intervened.But there's something deeper, and to explain it, we need some history. Light is magical. Reflected light isn't very special, light like you see bouncing off a magazine page. The colors you see are dimmer than real world colors because of the strength of the light of course, but what you see is what is not absorbed. You see the leftovers. In stained glass, the light comes through, directly from the source. The colors you see are more vibrant. Ancient glassmasters formulated glass that the moderns do not, so if you have a chance to see one (like the Tree of Jesse in Chartres) you will see millions of facets in each color because of the way that the color was layered on in a 'flashing' process, creating refractive crystal boundaries.These windows are a profound experience because of this scintillation effect that is subliminal. Like these old cartoons, the beings and objects are blobs of shimmering color with outlines that infer identity. Its a deep art that exists no where else, and not even since in stained glass.Now another fact. Snow is not white. Snow is a collection of ordered microcrystals that refract light in all colors. The combined effect adds to white, but as you move ever so slightly, you will be receiving millions of millions of flashes of pure color. And now a final fact. In 1952, when I saw this on a huge screen, the screen technology involved faceted grains of silica that had this snow-effect of micro-refraction. Today's screens use microspheres, tiny balls with smooth surfaces, so the effect is not the same. And obviously digital screens are another matter. They all preserve this 'transmitted light' effect of stained glass, as do all films. (But the new mastering of the cartoon for DVD does increase the purity of the colors, emphasizing the stained glass semiotics.)I recently saw this on DVD, and was instantly reminded of the viewing 55 years ago, which washed over with a blizzard of snow scintillations with medieval weight, both in the story and the stained glass. I've never lost that thrill, and I wish it for you. This changed me and it changed film.Ted's Evaluation -- 4 of 3: Every cineliterate person should experience this.",Null,15,26,4 September 2008
Shooter," I Still Have the Shovel
","Like so many other projects, you have to find something not intended or not well exploited to enjoy it.The film itself is ordinary, a noir revenge story. Its modern noir because the hero is captured in the story and the twists of reality he goes through are organized for our benefit. Government conspiracy of extreme competence? Check. Individual with superhuman powers who unfailingly undoes it, leaving no man standing? Check. Pretty girl who gets swept up? Check. There really isn't much else left to the extremely strict formula, expect for the obligatory but minor plot twist associated with our hero's past.What this has that is interesting are two things. One is the idea about watching from a distance. These noir things depend on the notion of a watcher, us. Modern noir has a watcher folded into the story. Here, its our hero who can watch and touch from over a mile away. Its a big deal, a big idea that isn't quite exploited here. The director is too ordinary. Tony Scott could have done it.The second is a short scene in the middle. Its there for purely expository reasons, to explain a key plot point. But its pretty darn good, one wonderful scene in the midst of a tepid movie. It a visit to an old fellow in the country. He's an expert gunsmith, supposedly the best. He's also clued into the 'government' who is here portrayed as existing only to create attractive fictions. The actor is immensely talented. The setup and writing here is a cut above the rest of the script, incisive, deep and many-layered. In the midst of a rant about conspiracies, he mentions that the shooters from the grassy knoll were dead three hours after the JFK shooting and buried in the desert .

Bring It On," Sweatermonkeys
","Spoilers herein.This a deeply selfreferential film. Recently a comment of mine prompted a response from the writer of the film. He claimed that the studios only accepted formula scripts and his hands were tied. This script belies that. It is heavily formulaic -- pretty stupid actually -- but underneath the writer did something clever.This is a collection of performers who are presenting material that is flat stolen from more genuine innovators, and that's the story as well! Then because it is too obvious, it is reinvented following an LA formula, but that's found in many films (and in the story, many cheerleading squads), so they `reinvent' again by borrowing from whatever they see.The film is about its own triteness. Pretty cool. I'll bet that this first-time writer is a bitchy redhead.But there's another thread too, about the vacuousness of spirituality. Early on, Torrance defiles a totem, the spirit stick, of a group of performing Christians (think `Omega Code,' or `Left Behind') and feels cursed to `hades.' Torrents. A high school boy clutches his crotch and says `try this spirit stick.' Then the LA guru, Sparky gives them `spirit fingers.' But that proves superficial. By the end, they `get the spirit,' the team spirit and the spirit of true sportsmanship. A lotta spirits wouldn't you say?There's final cool deal on the DVD. An early scene was intended to be a very long tracking shot in the locker room. It's on the DVD as an extra. The director's comment says it isn't in the film because after 21 takes they couldn't get it quite right. Then he says he was copying Scorcese. I suspect that moment was scripted to make him seem a nitwit. (It's DePalma's famous tracking shot in `Carrie' he was stealing.) Priceless, and fit the whole deal.",Null,2,5,9 August 2001
Inception," Insides of Emma (The Fall of Angels)
","When I watch a movie, all sorts of machinery kicks in. I am aware of only some of that, and can massage and train only a bit of that — of what I see of myself.This machinery is based on layers, folding, recursion. It is just how the mind works, this business of seeing self. Some art — I would argue all — fits into this equation in some way: surfing, deflating, revealing some part of the flow. The most exciting to me are those that expose the machinery itself, the folding dynamics. Oh, I have no illusion that this or any simple equation is 'the answer,' but it seems that we do live in movies, our life is the movie we make. If we want valuable art, it will be art that reminds us of that fact: a movie that is powerful enough to let us know the limits of its power.Nolan will get credit for making an entertaining artifact. The intelligence — no simply the complexity — of the story makes us invest. It is why folding works with the marketplace: it increases the entanglement we make with the story. Then Nolan can drag in cinematic effects that otherwise would be ordinary: bombs, gunfights, carchases... and we see them as extraordinary because of the perceptive entanglement.This works as well for our relationship with the actor. in interviews, Leonardo is talking openly about what first level actors know: that you deliver the character, but you also deliver a folded presentation having to do with the knowledge the actor and viewer share about the whole process. How does one play a character that is a character within? How do you project an awareness of withinness?As with 'Following' and 'Memento,' it isn't just about the layers; it is about how they affect one another and how they include the folds of the presentation as a film, and as we live.I would like to remark on only one aspect of how Nolan put this together: space. We have all sorts of life values represented here. We have the noir detective, the pilgrimage to family, the deceiver, the drivers... all with designated characters. In there we have the architect. She is the fourth that we know. The first is the father, played by Michael Caine. He is a master professor of some stripe — we don't really know. What we do know is Caine's face, one of the most familiar in film. Nolan knows him as Bruce Wayne's caretaker, the keeper of the enabling space for Batman (including the space carried in the costume-cape).His son, Leonardo's character, has taken his dad's empire of the mind and broken it down for use in layers. The other father here is a surrogate for Cobb's. Cobb is presumed to be the master architect, but is hampered, so he has to seek others. One we see briefly at the beginning, someone who fails. The one of interest to us is recommended by the Dad as superior to Cobb. Enter Ariadne, the goddess of the labyrinth, what in the business is called a four, a reality savant.She is the designer and guide of everything we see, everything. She is the magi, the creator; everything we see is something she made, even the illusion Cobb, has that in an inner dream he made something and lived in it for decades. Even, even the possible illusion that he returns. Even the more ambiguous architecture of lives that Cobb believes he experienced — a lifetime with his wife.There is one scene where this is not so — where the world is not Ariadne's, and for me it is the key scene. I hold it as the anchor around which I build everything.Our actual romance (Cobb and Ariadne) are in their first shared space— her first dream experience. This is Cobb's dream, his architecture. They are sitting outside by a Paris cafe, one of filmdoms most seductive places. (It seems to quote 'Irma la Douce' in more ways than one, but certainly in the set.) He is seducing her into helping him build an inner world — risky, more engaging than anything can be. It is for the purpose of regaining his children (as he settles with his father) and incidentally saving the world from energy tyranny. He is grizzled, worn out from past wars of the mind. He has just suffered a defeat because of an inadequate architect. He is at the end of his life; this will be his last job. She is at the beginning of hers. Her face is fresh, her self open, her mind powerful but innocent. He explains that everything she sees is created by him. He then proceeds to create what has to be the best use of cinematic space I know; the environment deconstructs. It doesn't explode so much as is ceases to become boundaries of space and becomes space itself, dense, breathable. It is the most powerful, erotic thing I have experienced on screen; his space penetrates her skin to the core. When they awake, he knows he has her — forever.My believe is that Nolan opened the possibility that Moll was something he and she co- created as part of the labyrinth we go through with them, noir-wise. It is all about the fall, the connection among layers, the penetration into the soul. Nolan drapes a thriller around this, almost as a joke. But this is about seduction, spatial seduction.

Sherlock Holmes," Ghosts in the Machine
","Two really good things here, and one bad. The bad is that though there are some good components, the thing never gels. Richie has only one formula for humor, and it doesn't work here — probably because illogically we want to think this is real. In his earlier works, Richie depended on his ability to create an alternative universe on top of movie clichés. Here he must build on something more fundamental and fails.One good thing is how the writers mined what was behind the Sherlock phenomenon. At the time the stories appeared, there was a huge battle on for the hearts of the London street. It was — dare I say — where we are today with the Cairo street. Darwin had presented his theory, and a rush of other scientific discoveries were being made. It really seemed to many that the world was amenable to logic and that at some point logical deduction should come to understand human behavior. Criminal behavior was seen as some sort of deviance from the healthy and this potentially easier to grasp. So within Londo (and Paris) a strong backlash of spiritualism grew. Magic was the antidote to science, pure and simple. The irony was that the creator of Sherlock was himself the most prominent of the champions of spiritualism. His fictional character was created as something of a cartoon joke. But Sherlock became so popular that Doyle found it impossible to kill him off — and write about more 'real' things. The failure of logic to describe human behavior continues to the present in our AI disappointments. (A smaller percentage of Americans believe the science of evolution than did the Londoners of 120 years ago.) So the story here is apt and shows both an understanding of this audience and that of the past. People really want to believe in magical stuff.The more interesting thing is from a cinematic perspective. Suppose you understood the Sherlock stories, and you understood that they were centered on stringing causal agency so that it makes sense. Suppose you wanted to translate this to film: what is essentially a mental process. How would you do it? The standard for the last 75 years was to wait until the end where the detective's though processes were explained. As he or she would recount the reasoning process, scenes that you have already seen would be replayed so that they 'made sense.'Here we have the first improvement on this in a mainstream film. We do see this standard device at the end. But we see variations on it all through the movie, including several times the 'working out' what to do next. There are some sideways episodes as well, like the replay of how he stalked his lover in disguise — through a circus! This is really intelligent cinematic thinking. Hooray for Guy! This is enough for me to recommend this. But don't expect a successful film.Downey is great, as always. Rachel McAdams has a strange role to play. Her character really does appear in the original stories as a love interest, but she seems too manipulatable here.

WALL·E," The Certainty of Seeing
","You can read elsewhere the ordinary stuff  about how wonderful this is; about how it exploits cinematic characterization, and even how conservative bloggers have decided to criticize it supposedly leftist premise. (Jees)I did enjoy it. Its an amazing experience. But while watching it, I also was admiring the minds behind it. There are sometimes intelligent movies being made, and a surprising number of them are from Hollywood. I believe though that in most cases, it is because there is a critical mass of intelligent writers, filmmakers and decisionmakers that are working at the fringe of the establishment. Not so with Pixar. I've been constantly surprised at each project how they encapsulate essays in the advance of the cinematic vocabulary.Its a bit like French new wave films made by film theorists, the films being more about what can be done than doing it in the service of effect that matters. (Their retort would be that it DOES matter if it changes the vehicle.)But this Pixar business is a different model. Folks can come and be entertained without having to dip into vats of self-reference. Oh, there's plenty of superficial self-reference, but its all in the service of jokes, and they are all in the service of the narrative.But other folks  like me and perhaps you  can also see that they are doing a few things that no one else is in quite the same advanced way, and they mark them so that you can read it as a sort of metanarrative. Jobs does the same thing with Apple. They make products that people use and like. But they also are in the business of defining what it is to be cool. They manufacture cool like they manufacture electronic products. You get both, and even in the products there's a reference to leadership, because being cool is all in who defines cool.So when I saw this, I saw self-conscious art, and stories about the future of cinema. We've always gotten that with Pixar. Usually, it has to do with space, and what you can do with this new medium that is impossible with 'real' cameras and places.This last movie, 'Ratatouie' added in the notion of control. Pulling the strings. I'm sure many have noticed that the shorts that Pixar creates to play before these features are a sort of synopsis of the reflective ideas they will use in the film. Last time the short and film were about control at a distance, with both the puppetmaster and puppet being featured, but the star was the puppetmaster. You can almost see how the whole story could have been generated by this idea: chef, French (who claim to have invented folded cinema of the reflexive kind), and rat. Secret recipes. Love always.This time around, the cinematic sensibilities are profoundly deeper. A deep certainty. You have to know about 2001 as a start. Kubric's interest there was the warring narrator. Whose world is telling the story, man, machine or god. There is a story, but it hardly matters. Its all about who is telling the story, whose chair you sit in as the viewer. Its a masterful work.Here, its bent only a little: mankind, machine and nature, but its folded back on the story  which here has effect. Wall-e is natural, machine in form, but more human than the humans we see. But watch how they fold it again. Its a movie about the truth in movies, how the power of cinema can reach into the real world. A handholding there and here is a handhold between the worlds. And also watch how they built movies in. This isn't accidental. When they put a movie within a movie like this, the intent is to have the watcher of the outer movie join the world of the watcher of the inner movie. Its a reliable trick to get us to invest in what we see. But they go further. When we see the humans  who are supposed to be like us but clearly aren't  we note that THEY are hypnotized by the movies in front of them and cannot see the larger world beyond, and we can.It happens to also spill over into the great narrative about how some of us can see that the planet is being destroyed and other blithely putter on. That business about saving image- laden artifacts as a memory storehouse... All these layers  yes they are engineered by what is now the most intelligent and adventuresome narrative engineering lab in a studio.All this extra introspection is used not as dry thesis, but in the service of the love story. It made it deeper, and more true. Knowing makes love true. So yes, it is effective, and fun, and deep.To compensate, the camera and space manipulation is less radical than usual.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,17,27,2 July 2008
The Good Shepherd," The Missing Gold Miner
","Set aside whether you find this story engaging or otherwise useful in a human sense. I didn't.In such a case, what I fall back on is wondering whether it tells me anything interesting about storytelling. Its often that case that a bad story has a good metastory. And this is a natural because what viewers do is discover worlds through hints the filmmaker allows you to discover, some of them spoofed. That's what a spy does, and the most interesting spy is always the first spy of that type. That's why this story was thought to have value.But in order to exploit this intrinsic narrative fold, you need to place yourself 9as a filmmaker) at some oblique angle so that you can lever out the oyster. Alas, the filmmaker in this case is an actor, once intense, now merely famous. I've written many times about how rare it is for an actor to be able to make a whole film, or even understand the mechanics outside of acting.The art of acting is wonderfully complex, risky and rewarding to experience. But it has a different set of concerns. Its the water, and the filmmaker needs to worry about the river, its shape, banks and rapids. You need to set yourself in some dry place with shovels. You need to pan for gold. You need to fly as well as swim.This is a river as seen from inside. There's little here. Oh, and the history is not right, I am sure, and equally sure that the truth is far more interesting.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",Null,3,9,5 June 2007
The Terminal," Stuck in Mellowville
","Spoilers herein.If you are an American filmmaker, you live a life registered in American storytelling. And that registration falls into one of two camps, each of which defined their own type of American novel.One camp was invented by Melville. His notion of the world was rooted in the Bible-as- allegory. He set out to create literature - a uniquely American literature - that had broad, complex sweeps of allegory. It was only incidentally about people and always steeped in some great machine that represented the world. In `Moby-Dick' that world was the world of whaling and whalers.The tapestry may be complex, but the allegory is clear and distinct. The author takes this allegory very seriously and expects the reader to as well.The other great stream of America storytelling is from Mark Twain. He tells two stories: the story itself and a story about the story. There are always two narrative levels. This is also uniquely American, especially the nature of humor in the metanarrative. It is immediately based on Austen though the particular notion has roots in Cervantes and Shakespeare. This `twoness' is why Twain chose his name. Twain's aura was of the same colors that would revolutionize the world of introspection with Freud and Darwin.Why do I mention this? Because nearly all worthwhile films these days are in the `Twain` tradition of storytelling and has been since the `new wave' of the sixties. This `American' notion has spun all sorts of cool varieties, which I am surveying in a book under the rubric of `folding.'Its just the way it is: to be considered a serious filmmaker, you have to innovate, to invent or twist some way of folding or introspection or reflection. Spielberg is a simple man who makes simple films, films that are to rest of the film world as product wrappers are to art.Having made enough money, he's been trying to make `important' films so that some day he just might be remembered as someone not unintelligent and unaware of film ideas. He's tried on a few suits, from Kubrick's folding to historical reflections. In each case they seem merely copied and he knows it.Some years back he tried a real new wave film: `Close Encounters' and even featured Truffaut as the one who `spoke the language.' A couple years ago with Hanks he tried the old folding game of a story about a guy who fabricates stories. Flat. Old shoes.Here he tries a Melville, a serious, straight ahead allegory. Presumably he thought his audience would be ready for a complex tone poem about what it might mean to be on the threshold of America. The model of the world in this case is the terminal. All sorts of little symbolic episodes are woven in, and one big one: the importance of getting a `real' image, a signature, to go with a false image (a photograph). This is mirrored by his having to get a stamp himself. The very contrast that this blunt agenda of collecting autographs has with the ad hoc nature of the Jazz involved is stark allegory - as stark as the stasis of waiting in a place that everyone else passes through.Well, as allegory for the masses, it works I suppose. But as film, well it is just another copy.Tom Hanks gets to do Chaplin's Trampwalk.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",Null,8,21,22 June 2004
The Shawshank Redemption," Relentless Storytelling
","I reviewed this film recently with a specific question in mind. At this writing, this film is ranked by IMDB viewers as the second best film ever made. The SECOND BEST EVER MADE!Why? This was my question.The acting is good. Robbins and Freeman are quality craftsmen in the Caine and Hackman tradition. But these are not truly great actors and in any case, they are only asked to play appealing persons, deliberately less-dimensional than real (as opposed to believably hyper-real which is much harder).The director is a first-timer, and it shows. There is simple framing and staging here. In fact, there seems to be a deliberate strategy to be as plain as possible. And that is the core of where I think people find the appeal of this film.The story is very tight in the sense of narrative flow. All the chunks are the same size, with no fancy rhythm. There is no distracting backstory. No element has irony, not writing, acting, shooting, even the score.Now for me, I expect and demand art in my films -- that's why I register this as plain. But I think it is well liked because it is totally without pretense. It is straight and honest; people seem hungry for honesty, and this has the appearance of what they need at just the right time.Is a film great because it merely fulfills? I hope many people think not, and dream that this film moves down the list to be replaced with more intelligent efforts.",Null,67,126,4 November 2000
The Cannonball Run," The Wink
","Yes I actually chose to see this. Its a mess of a movie, mere life filler from a period where cars could be characters.The idea was the allow the episodic to become extremely fine grained, and to shift things so quickly that if one thing wasn't amusing, there was always something else around the corner before you could develop impatience. (This was when that lag time was longer than now.)I watched it because Burt Reynolds is a fascinating actor. He really is a serious actor who mastered that notion of straddling the line between character and buddy of the audience. Clooney occupies this space now, Willis before him.I saw Reynolds recently in an amazing experimental film by Figgis, and also in the 'included footage,' where he asks questions about where that line is supposed to be. (Answer: you decide.) It reminded me that we once thought he would be an important actor.Watch him here. There is essentially no acting challenge, no real character or story. Watch how he fills the space. Its pretty interesting, possibly affected by what we know of his romance with Sally Field, another one in this category.

Rango," Corpus
","It is possible to decorate something ugly with beauty. It will still be essentially ugly, but have some attraction. Likewise, it is possible to have an ordinary movie, borrowing from others in an ordinary way, but to have some clever elaborative filmmaking.Verbinski is something of a genius at this. His charter was to make a safe cartoon, and that means you assemble from known parts. Nowhere is this more routine than in the western. So what does he do? He borrows in the open, making each one a small insider joke. There are a spectrum of these, some overt, others subtle so players at any level can enjoy. So he has to start with the notion that this thing is fractionally folded, in other words it has story bits lent from all over. This notion is conveyed by a frantic, schizophrenic introductory performance. Our main character is a chameleon, wink, wink. Even this is modeled after Robin Williams' intro from 'Aladdin.' Once the story proper begins, we have a sequence of references to prior Depp films, including one never finished ('Don Quixote'), one where the writer is the subject ('Fear and Loathing') and even his obscure Kustarica film.Having set this deeply self-referential tone, it is safe to drag in the workhorse elements of other films, tacked onto the 'Chinatown' storyline.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",Null,4,8,14 July 2011
Music and Lyrics," The Show
","Films define romance to such a dominant extent that the so-called date movie can't stray far from 'the story,' the story of what romantic love is all about. Naturally the larger arc of that story must be that the couple falls in love (often in unlikely or ironic circumstances). They break up usually because of some misunderstanding (and in this case it is often a miscommunication) or because the man is reluctant. Then at the end they get together again, and exactly how the man makes the plea is the whole point of the movie.That last act, the re-romance, the certification of what we saw before as genuine... that is almost always a public act. There has to be an audience in the scene. The reason is a narrative necessity that I call folding. We feel things more sharply when we think we are part of them. So if we see ourselves literally in the film, if we see an audience watching as we watch... If we see their faces react, then we react too.So for many, many date movies, the writing challenge is how to engineer that final fold. Here it is done by starting at the end. We need Grant to sing a love song to an abandoned Drew, in front of a packed audience at Madison Square Garden. The writer (in this case Lawrence) may have started with the problem, so he created a writer with the same problem, how to find the story, the words. Its brilliant, the solution. Drew IS the words and also provides the words.Its made plain even for the stupidest of us: melody (which Grant provides) is just the appearance. The words are the soul, where the romance is rooted. That's Drew. Of course you knew that going in, but she actually says this on screen.Along the way, we are given a B. Spears like singer who shows us the superficial, literally buttwagging public seduction of the most superficial kind. On Drew's side is her sister a huge, heavy woman who runs a diet supply store but eats like a horse. She brackets Drew with the sexy singer to let us know that although Drew isn't pretty and thin and sexy in those ways, what she has is the words. In fact the ditsy singer initiates the search for the words that Drew provides. We even have the food and words metaphors combined when our lovers talk about real romance as real song and both as 'dinner.'Its a remarkable solution. As the need for expensive, solid date movies increases, look for all sorts of clever writing along these lines.Unfortunately the actual film-making here stinks. Its just a poorly done movie that handles the sparkles from these two ineptly. Its odd, because the shows within the show are marvelously perfect, including an ersatz music video at the very beginning. That video, by the way distills the entire story.Oh. Drew's character is unhappy at the beginning because she has been 'badly written' by her former lover, a novelist.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",Null,8,21,15 February 2007
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Parasitic Nests
","I have a particular interest in five different cinematic styles, worlds actually. One of them I have named the Hispanic style. It is characterized by:— elements of magical reality, either in supernatural physics or synchronous connections.— a belief that the world is rich, fecund. Occasionally female sexuality is interwoven. Characters are both in the world and part of the nature that is rich.— layered storytelling.— a laconic camera compared with others, as if there were dream dynamics at world.— use of color.It so happens that most of the filmmakers using this style are what in the US we clumsily call *Hispanic*. More well known examples are: Pedro Almodóvar (Spain), Alejandro Amenábar (Chile), Juan José Campanella (Argentina), Alejandro González Iñárritu (Mexico), Alejandro Jodorowsky (Chile), Julio Medem (Spain), Fernando Meirelles (Brazil), Raoul Ruiz (Chile),  and sometimes: Luis Buñuel (Mexico), Alfonso Cuarón (Mexico), Robert Rodriguez (Mexico) and Guillermo del Toro (Mexico).I like some of the projects these men have completed, simply because they works. Sometimes it transports and is so effective I feel as if healed and placed in a supernatural body. I think these techniques insert into dream urges and carry me in ways I have scant protections against. So I come to an Iñárritu film with some expectation. Some hope. The problem with this style of filmmaking is that maintaining the technique requires a lot of overhead. Usually all a filmmaker has to worry about is the story and the wrapper. If he/she is a poor filmmaker, it is just a story and the worry is about characters and story structure. The wrapper is the collection of cinematic techniques used to inveigle into our inner narratives. Often this is just reliance on genre and stereotypes. A good filmmaker will worry about this though. For all his flaws, I credit Scorcese with attention to this. But it doesn't get in the way. We don't see it.With Iñárritu and his peers, much, even most of what we get in the story *and* the wrapper is there to sustain these Hispanic narrative values. It is a matter of the viewer's tolerance, I suppose, in deciding what is too much. Few viewers will give as much allowance as I do, but here I think it is too much: too much in the story; too much in the wrapper.We are to forgive this because this is a movie about movie-making (theater as movie), and about extreme risk and commitment. So we have three main folds. These aren't circular, but parallel. The most obvious because it is in the story is the fold of the reality of our main character to the reality of films. That the films involved are his past films is nearly irrelevant. (More relevant is the actor's bast as Batman or for that matter as Betelgeuse - Dogberry - Doug Kinney.) Also rather explicit is the fold, a common one, of the world of making a movie to the world of the movie we see. Only Emma Stone escapes navigational issues in this one. Everyone else is placed in clumsy roles. I wish I did not allow the perfect elegance of Medem or Almodóvar to color my view of this.And finally we have the folding of our world into Iñárritu's. But because the clothes are so heavy, we only wear them for the duration of the film. Nothing sticks; no matter how hard I try, I leave this world when the film ends. I only have memories of the machinery and some admiration for the acting. Compare this to the masters. Compare this to things that you fall in love with and never wish to escape.",Null,8,13,23 May 2015
Prometheus," Snowcrash
","It seems all the writing about this film is about the story, how it doesn't hold your hand and what religious metaphors are exploited. Well, that matters a bit because it elevates the thing out of the ordinary package. But a much more interesting way to think of this film is in terms of particles - how they build images and story elements.There are many remarkable instances.Chronologically first, we have the prologue to this prologue, a small film made independently of all else, and farmed out to dimensional experimentalists WETA. It is unlike anything that follows in many ways: nobility, flight of the camera, a blending of scale from planet to gene. There is only one element that carries over, and it is the notion of dustsized particle. This forms the cinematic base of all else that follows.If you have not seen the film, an alien 'Engineer' ingests some nanosludge, and it breaks his body into trillions of particles that interestingly swarm as a group and each transform microscopically. This occurs next to a massive waterfall, a real place in Iceland. But it has extra renderings later in the scene: a mass of coherent froth and a swirling family of clouds.The nanoagents swirl with (slightly more) energy than nature's vortices, and BANG, we have our main cinematic device. There is a story of sorts that this kicks off, and of course most people gnaw at that. Ridley wisely gives us only *particles* of that story, bits that leave a lot unexplained.We'll see this particle notion many times, this particle as image notion. We'll see it first in the ordinary holographic display in the spaceship where an artificial man (after the fashion of Bladerunner's replicants) spies on a naive female scientist's dreams. (The basic vocabulary for cinematic holograms was set in the first Star Wars, and like so much in movieland, we stick with it whether it makes sense or not. It is a mix of glitter, snow and image — particles.)We see it in both sides of the technology, human and engineer. The humans have an extraordinary mapping/visualization technology that displays using this fog/glitter particle imaging. The engineers have inexplicably made holograms of their actions that the replicant can replay. There are two of these, both extraordinary.The first is handled in a way that only Scott could: he establishes a definition of space in ordinary, claustrophobic caves that all of a sudden is filled with these glittering particles which organize to give us a movie — a three d movie. We watch them watching it.The second is so grand it challenges even Malick's recent masterpiece. This is a swarm of white particles that organize to give is the most elaborate and thrilling orrery in films. It serves the plot to tell us (some will explain) about engineers, seeding and planned destruction. But for me, it is a sort of triumph of the white nanoparticles over the black — of coherent vision over dreaming monsters.Think I am reading two much of this? Consider the two actual films within. One is a hologram of the sponsor, explaining the purpose of the voyage. It is cleaner than the others, but still based on this fine glitter. See how the effects have the glitter move to form the images — as opposed to just being suspended fog on which an image is projected?The other film here is an actual film, 'Lawrence of Arabia,' who our replicant emulates. That movie was the first to photograph sand as a self-organizing society — one which defined an alternative cosmos to Lawrence. (The later 'Woman in the Dunes' would elaborate on this.) Incidentally, it looked to me as if that inner film had been processed to be 3d.This is the kind of thing Scott knows how to do, subtle and powerful. Look even at the one effect that was clearly added by funders to jazz up a section of the story. Our explorers race back to the ship to beat a storm of particles. This is an age old device, boring. The particles must be presented as benign because the planet (in most interpretations) has no consciousness. But even there, the particles swarm according to the patterns and vocabulary of that first segment.Genius.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,12,23,30 June 2012

","I either forgot, or never appreciated how darn good this is. The engineering of the thing is splendid. It was the first of a genre, so there was nothing to build on. It uses three building blocks.— It uses the notion of an evil, unstoppable force. It even features the three iconic films that set the precedent for this: The Thing, Forbidden Planet and Psycho.— It is basically wrapped around the fear of being watched. Sure there are violent murders, but the tension is built from what is seen and unseen, the notion that Myers watches and extensive POV shots. Especially the one at the beginning. This is what I call narrative folding where the watchers of the film and a character are merged.— Carpenter wrote and directed it. That you know. But you may not appreciate that he wrote the music. It is fantastic. He has said that he heard the movie before he imagined it in visuals. It shows. The score is not quite programmatic — that it annotates the screen.

","After the huge success of the first film, a sequel was required. Too bad for us. The fiction of the possible dream-vision was jettisoned. This is real world stuff.The emphasis shifts from the crazy visions of the crazy inventor to real complications of time folding, such as we can handle in a mainstream Zemeck. And it is pretty darn complicated. We now have parallel worlds, overlapping times, actors playing multiple characters, actors playing the same characters at different ages, characters changing the lines of themselves in earlier states, the time machine coming and going past itself in ways that only make sense if you are tied to the narrative this one way. We also have scenes and tropes from the first movie repeated in slightly different form. The way of tracking whether the future changes is by photos and newspapers that change as their past is manipulated. Oddly, there is a similar time-travelling document — a pulp magazine of sports scores — that does not change.It is hardly enough to make the movie worthwhile.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",Null,4,7,25 March 2010

The Queen," The Portrait
","Stephen Frears surely knows how to start and end a movie, skills that amazingly rare to judge from what's in the world.This film begins with a small vignette, having nothing at all to do with the story, but introducing the character Helen Mirren plays. That beginning bit begins withe her being imaged for public exposure and then looking directly at the camera as if to say: this, this is the portrait of me.She is one of two queens in the story, the other being the ghost of Diana who is shown only in reference and only in public exposure.The official queen is shown at home, watching TeeVee, and frumping around the estate. The story is a rather gauzy one. Part of it is the delving into deviance of (usually English) society, the one thing Frears does well in the middle of his movies. In this case we see the inexplicable business of a monarchy which exists solely to keep a national story suspended. The story is threatened and some sort of a national crisis is averted. Its engaging because every viewer will have lived through that period and this gives peeks into corners we may have wondered about at the time.A second component of the movie is the supposed examination of character of this woman, and the huzzas that Mirren gets for her portrayal. We celebrate the performance only because the movie as a whole works. I can think of a dozen Mirren performances that are better suited to celebration. Ho hum. We see her grieve more for an animal than for Diana, act more out of fear than honor. We see Blair  our designated observer in the story  superficially evolve.A third component has to do with the introspection in the thing. And that is the only bit I can recommend (other than the opening which it supports). The deal is all about story. Nations require a story so they can know who they are. The Brits aren't the most ridiculous people on the planet, but they are the ones who have most explored the foibles of their own national story in their art, so their introspection makes them appear more silly than the rest of us.That national story includes the necessity of actors, so they hire a few nitwits to dress up and pretend to be monarchs. They are simply actors, no more. So the deal with this film is that we have an actress, Mirren, playing an actress who examines her role. Its a meaty opportunity and thank god we didn't get Dench, who I suppose would have been shoehorned in if not for her appearance. And it isn't that Mirren isn't intelligent enough to be an actor that shows how acting works. But Frears isn't interested and Mirren's style is more about showing her commitment to the role rather than exploring our commitment to it.But that opening.

","Spoilers herein.What makes this superficially mundane film interesting is what Depp does behind the director's back.The situation depicted is a society that is unaware of itself, tragically, humorously so. Within that society, under the radar of group consciousness, an incredibly rich network of one-to-one conspiracies was formed, involving hundreds of millions of people globally. Nothing was controlled, everything was on a one-to-one basis.Now here we have a film that is not just about this, but uses the same mechanism. When we experience a film, especially a Hollywood product, we are seeing an artifact of a society, and generally not a very astute one. As with America in the seventies, it rumbles along thinking it is in charge. It waves the flag of individualism but has no way of getting close to the phenomenon. In fact every effort to accommodate dooms itself because it flexes the big machine.So it is with this film that is planned, written and directed with the mentality of a soviet factory. And along comes Depp. The dynamics of the character are that he engenders trust with the people he contacts.Well known social phenomenon: when you take drugs with someone, an intimate, opportunistic fellowship is created, not from any commonality but by shared exclusion of the `outside' in spite of the best attempts of that outside to intrude. Get enough druggies walking around and you have a bazillion pairs of immediate, mostly superficial conspiracies adding up to a counterculture. This film focuses not on the counterculture, but the pairs formed by Depp's character and the people he meets. As he says, he is very, very good at this.Depp is coming along as a fine actor. He's no Sean Penn yet, but he is one of a half dozen male actors worth following and he is steadily growing. His solution to the challenge of this film is to adopt an acting style that is a conspiracy of pairs. He completely ignores Demme, who seems concerned with his checklist of directors to copy. Instead, what we see is a two layered performance between Depp and each of his collaborating actors.At the `low' level, we see Jung forming a bond. At the higher level, we see Depp forming similar bonds to create the illusion of the first. It's intelligent stuff which he shades according to each role. For instance, with Rubens, there are sexual bounds that are excluded, but because they are explicitly so, they become important at the higher level. The partnership with Liotta is notable: liotta is the senior but less talented, so he withdraws. Depp goes extra distance in this conspiracy to help Liotta define the character of the Dad.Particularly of interest is what Depp works out with the two women, again all behind Demme's back. Potente is an intelligent actress who was in `Lola,' a landmark bit of folded self-reference. His bond with her is intellectual. See the virtual winks and nudges. If she had lived, he would have had a chance at turning his life into something meaningful (and with Depp, controlling the movie to have a more meaningful existence).Cruz is not an intelligent actress, rather an intuitive. See how Depp forms an improv bond with her at the actor level that mirrors the story? Mostly acting with their body movements? And on and on one at a time, Depp creates a counterculture of performances. Stay tuned to Depp.",Null,10,18,17 December 2001
1408," Shined Up
","Shined UpI decided to watch this after Polanski's 'the Tenant' and that was probably a bad choice, because that film is precious.This one consists of three elements, typical of the King formula.The first is the expression of terror, shaped safely so that you can watch but not be personally threatened. I think this is a King invention. Here, we know WE would have taken seriously the warnings so he deserves what he gets. It relieves us.The second element is trite, so far as I am concerned. Also a King specialty is to weave some sort of emotional trauma into the otherwise merely decorative horror. Here it is the death of our character's child, which happened before we meet him. This allows for the final zinger.The third element is the stuff I study and that King knows well. I call it narrative folding. Situations are nested in each other. Time gets shifted, at the same time that the period in the room proceeds in real time, even with a clock counting down. Ghosts inhabit ghosts and all people are ghosts. Cold is hot. Water is land. Daughter is wife. This is the stuff that makes the film work, and I think it is done pretty well. Its why they picked Cusak. He understands this stuff. Has since 'Malkovich' and 'Fidelity' and mastered in 'Identity.'Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,36,45,20 September 2008
Raging Bull," China Shop
","Spoilers herein.I'll be right up front. I admit Scorsese's skill but just don't like his films and certainly don't see any art in them.That's because I disagree with him on what cinematic storytelling is all about. For him, characters are everything, which is why he needs sledgehammers as actors, and spikes (gangsters, etc) as the roles. Then he arranges for them to explode or simmer or steam, or explode again.Every element of the eye is subservient to the character. He (always he except for his experiment with poor Alice) pulls the camera around. We as bound audience follow. It is all about involuntary submission to manufactured charisma. I don't like this style of storytelling. It ignores the greatest power of the camera's eye: to allow the audience to move in and out of spaces: personal spaces, narrative spaces, time folding, sometimes God, sometimes his victim. There's freedom and imagination when the eye is freed, and this is the real power of the filmmaker.But with Martin, he ignores this power: the camera is bound. We are the weak sidekick, forced into respect. All the competence (here the editing is superb) is turned to an end which ruins the experience. Scorsese knows this, in fact at this point in his life he was feeling it, and that is why we get what we do. A camera that forces respect.But alone of his films (I am re-seeing them all), this has a sweet pleasure. In the midst of the obligatory scene where DeNiro takes to himself in the mirror, we get a wonderful reference to Brando. This frames the film and explicitly acknowledges that most films (except those of the real geniuses) are about other films, not life. `Bull' stands on `Waterfront's' structure.And DeNiro stands on Brando's shoulders. How brave to mouth the lines. Brando was intense, but that was not his innovation, it was an ability to project two performances simultaneously. Here DeNiro tries to equal or best that by playing three characters: himself besting Brando, his character equalling Brando's, and Brando wrestling with his character (which we see in `Waterfront' as a man wrestling with his inner self).Watch how DeNiro tries. How he pushes too hard (something we can now call the Pacino/Cage error), how he loses control and knows it. Scorsese knows it too, and it speaks highly of them both to put DeNiro's `not world class' broken actor as representative of the broken `not world class' boxer. I appreciate that honesty. It makes this my favorite film of his (Scorsese).",Null,24,43,30 May 2002
The Iron Giant," Mechanized Animation
","Spoilers herein.I will admit that this is very skilled storytelling: I am really impressed with how singlemindedly every element of this film is coordinated to give a single feel which sustains -- it has to because there is no story development to speak of. So rather than focus on managing evolution of drama, `Iron' focuses on evocation of a single `feel.' And they do that well enough for me. I actually did participate in those duck and cover drills.What I find more interesting is the approach they took to the production of the film, which I find highly self-referential, and which may be the cause of a subtle effect for the viewer. At least I like to think so.The giant is drawn not by a human animator -- instead it is a three-dimensional model created in the computer. The computer then `renders' the 2-D image according to directions. The resulting figure is assembled in a scene that has hand-drawn human characters. In a very real sense, this character of a robot is acted by a robot, while the human characters are `acted' (drawn) by humans.As with all cartoony films, the voices are what you really `see' so far as the drama. But in terms of the images -- which is what all film experiences are about -- what you really see is a conflict among the religions of animators very much like what you see on the screen. That it is set in a pre-computer, but post-nuclear age -- that the lines drawn are not ones of coexistence but of good and evil -- says a lot about Bird's take on all this. A very intimate and effective film on filmmaking. Probably shouldn't be on IMDB's `science fiction' list though.",Null,10,14,26 June 2001
Step Up," Precise
","Something funny about movies. Different genres carry different expectations. Dance movies for me prompt the lowest. I don't care how trite the story or incompetent the writing and acting. I just don't care as long as the dancing is good.In fact in a way its better for the dancing if there aren't a lot of other aspirations. AFter 'Tango' and 'Red Shoes,' I don't need more elaborate folding of the show within the show. But the dancing had better be good.And by that I mean it not only has to be good as dance, but it has to be cinematic. There are only three ways to accomplish that that I know. Oddly, though the director is a well known film choreographer, she seems to know none of them.The way you expect in a ghetto-meets-whitebread story is in the raw energy, the sheer power of unpracticed but expert physical expression. Not here. The whole thing is not only validated by a slick production number at the end, but we see all the practice of that same.No energy. No impulse.

Mary and Max," Escapes its Poo-Faced Limits
","Gosh, another Australian project that knows what it is and successfully escapes itself.The story is about a girl with structural limits: appearance, family, attitude.The media is stop motion, which brings its own structural limits. These are severe limits, because they straddle what we know as real and what we accept as fantasy. How to work with this? The choices a filmmaker makes in this medium are fascinating.Jan Svankmajer presents the result as moving museum art, dynamic dioramas. He can be too precious in that Eastern European way that produces needlework that frightens. Tim Burton, and Henry Selick ('Coraline,' 'James and the Giant Peach') pretend we are looking at illustrated books the way a child would. Nick Park treats the medium the way Walt Disney would, as a simple extrapolation from Donald Duck via way of Pixar. These guys decide not to tackle the simple fact that it is near impossible to elicit real emotion via this form.Only the Quay Brothers and Christiane Cegavske ('Blood Tea and Red String') make the commitment to create worlds by allowing the characters to inhabit them in a way that inhabitants are worldcreators. They affect a bizarre Victorian metaphors but this is because Lewis Carroll is the genius of this technique and not because the era has any intrinsic advantage. There are powerful and worldchanging moments in these works. But the viewer is asked to make a commitment that few will.All lucid stop-motion filmmakers face this set of decisions about how to overcome the limits of the medium. If you are writing a story while struggling with this, what is foremost in your mind? Especially if you are Australian, is a society that for some reason is introspective in art? You will produce a 'folded' story: one where the subject of the story reflects the form of the story. We have a girl in Australia who is obsessed with a successful TeeVee show, also stop motion. It is her fantasy world, the movie within the movie. She faces many challenges in simply surviving. She has a pen pal, and successfully writes her way out her limits, first by writing a book about her viewer's physiological limits. (More about this in a minute.) And then by getting a genuine expression of emotion from him in the form of a complete set of figures from the inner film. She triumphs, has child (all this is pretty overt folding) and finally visits the world of her pen pal to discover that she not only affected him, but was effectively his whole emotional life. The medium is mastered.The two actors chosen are among our very few who understand folded characterization.This half of the project is fascinating in the normal way that these nested, introspective things are, and is worthwhile. But it is the other half that is amazing.Mary is our filmmaker, and Max our viewer. Us.Half of the problem a filmmaker faces is the limits of her medium, and the other half the limits of the viewer. Most of us are emotional cripples, not inclined to work with an artist in a contract of world-building. We are afraid. Max is a citizen of the most urban and sophisticated city on the planet (in contrast to Mary's remote outpost). But he has Asberger Syndrome and is incapable of reading and processing emotion. This characterizes us viewers pretty well; our movie experiences are often exercises in avoiding truth. I found it rare and thrilling to see it explicit in this nested work, which is superficially sweet but essentially damning.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,7,13,15 August 2010

His kingdom is Disneyland, newly berift of the legacy characters. And he dearly needs to be king, but won't be.Strangely, for his first truly big battle with Disney, Katzenberg copies `Beauty and the Beast,' in all important particulars.

Vanilla Sky," Joni's Clouds for Dummies
","Spoilers herein.I was prepared to not like this film; Crowe too consistently centers his vision on the cheap shot. And Cruise -- well, it is hard to be an intelligent actor when you're as dumb as a flagpole knob. I found my worst fears to be true, but also found some strong, really strong elements that make this worth watching.First the bad. Most films are built on other films; some -- especially recently -- openly quote other films. Some of these are also in the category of films about constructed realities, and that's when things can get interesting: you go to a film to construct a reality for you, and the story is about constructing a reality. Often these fold with sophistication. But here they do this intrinsically intelligent thing in a fifth grade dumb way. Not Monet, but paint by the numbers.The film is about fantasy love and deciding between lovers. Rather than quote 'Jules and Jim' on this in a light way as anyone else would: Crowe puts a floor-to-ceiling poster in Cruise's bedroom, then when a voice ('tech support') explains that the constructed images were taken from movies, we see an actual clip. Those of us who Crowe targets would immediately recognize the quote of Bob Dylan's most famous album cover. But instead of quoting it like Greenaway would use a famous painting, we are walked through it with chalk.Patronizing. Embarrassing. Discouraging. Does he think we all move lips when reading?But there are two really fascinating things. I believe that Crowe's imagination is based in popular music first, with the image to follow, and actors and story getting dragged in a matter of course. So the effect of the music is more powerful than any I recall. He deftly binds it, even having Cruise take up a song at one point. This is the deepest use of Dylan in a long time. For those of us that are Crowe's age, there is a cool take on the Beatles: in the late sixties, the game was that drugs could help you create your own reality. The Beatles provided three alternative worlds for you to choose. It really was a matter of pervasive discussion about choosing (or 'liking') John, Paul or George.Once the topic comes up in the film, everything from there can be seen as making a choice. John would have stayed in fantasyland. George would have declared the whole thing irrelevant and opted out. Paul would have gone back to the 'real' world. The film ends with Paul's song. Now that's the kind of near-subtlety that's missing in the story at large.The other thing is no small matter. It purely blew me away, using a cinematic effect I have never experienced before. The whole film is storytelling by reference; what is new is storytelling by direct reference to characters previously played by the cast!Start with Alicia Witt and work outwards from the center. (Alicia was the receptionist at LE, named Libby who is the first person involved in the dream mechanics.) She played an identical, small center as the whorehouse pianist in 'Liebestraum' (get the name?), also as the fulcrum of folded visions.Diaz played the shunned girlfriend in the last popular film dealing with constructed realities, 'Malkovich.' Russell plays Douglas playing the character who recreates the narrative. It is the complement of his role in 'Wonder Boys,' where he was the creator, but real; and a complement of a different sort of him in 'The Game,' where he was the target, not the creator. His work here and in 'Boys' are knowingly referential to his other roles. Very tight selfreferential acting. Kudos to him, it makes up for a whole previous life of selfindulgent frippery. (Made right by his finding his own film Latin love.) And then there is Cruise himself. 'Eyes Wide Shut' is this very same movie (so Kubrick even said in reference to the Spanish original), but with no quarter given to the less astute viewer. How cool that he would come to this very much dumber version while his exwife went to something more elaborately and cinematic ally selfreferential in 'Moulin Rouge,' (a real thrill that should be seen right after either 'Eyes' or 'Little Voice').And finally we have Cruz, whose reference is to an external movie of a different type: this same film. Except the original is more a film where this is a composite of films. She plays her role not in this film, but here in reference to there as if she herself was Jeanne Moreau. And if there ever was a case of films constructing reality, how sweet to have Tom and Penny fall in 'love.'",Null,26,50,16 December 2001
The Wolverine," Sniffing the Dog that Went Before
","There isn't much to say about the ordinary features of this. It is a Marvel production and that means the world is dull in all aspects. They seem incapable of leaving safe territory, so this is more or less Michael Bay in the nineties.But there is something interesting going on. The way these films are put together, I believe, is as a set of manufactured stereotypes for the world market. You can't just target the US any more. Of course you still have to have a baseline of American grit, with the structure of a Western. And you have to honk around with roles of women. Those are essential for this recipe. What's interesting to me is the way the Japanese are handled. Japanese culture as filtered through film is a more powerful influence I think than even Europe minus Italians. Italian storytelling stands apart in film, and the influence is strong.But not as strong as Ozu and Kurosawa. Heck, Japanese film makers even did French new wave better. So when a film wants to leave the underground of who invented what in the cinematic vocabulary and just shuffle stereotypes, but from the same world, it folds into something novel.Our guy on the other side is a somewhat noble officer at a POW camp. Saved from The Bomb, he turns on his savior because he wants the technology in his soul. One of the world's richest technology companies was created by this guy, but instead of the American Tony Stark model, he can only implement ideas from others. The genius in the picture is a Western woman, incidentally evil in ordinary ways, who is hired by our Japanese mogul.Part of the stereotyping is that nothing is settled on the western side. Our hero hates his life of constant pain and remorse. Our western evil woman knows she is absolutely evil. But shift to the corrupt Japanese politician, the organized crime hoards, the Japanese boss, the rejected boyfriend... All these live in a world in which their actions are proper.",Null,2,3,27 March 2014
The Dark Knight Rises," Dickensian Cleanliness
","What, what a difference between this and any Marvelmanaged film!Nolan (with wife and brother) have clearly refined this script a few times. There is a lot of story to cram in, and a few necessary inflection points to destabilize us. They impress, and this merger of story, image and Zimmernoise works well. But you already know that. As I post this, a mere few days after opening, the film is in the IMDb top ten of all time!This comment is about a simple dynamic: condensation. the love story that leaves us satisfied doesn't happen on screen. It is all in our minds, teased out by an amazingly economical shorthand. a similar love story on the villain side that has agency in the plot — that literally changes much of what we assumed for two hours, is also sketched with a very few, high power strokes. a terrific device involving the otherwise talkity butler. Early, we get a story about when Bruce was away; Albert visited a Florence cafe once a year for one short drink on the off chance he would see Bruce thriving (with no plans to return). This story came complete with images of one such disappointing visit. At our very end after all the normal reveals, he makes the trip again. The stare we get from Albert is a fold that resets our memory of everything we have seen. All the action and noise is put in our past as it has been in his. often in these plot-heavy films, the bad guy doublecross is either heavyhanded or needlessly complex. Here it is simple and again uses a shorthand that depends on our film memories, we have a lot of exposition about the history of an elite group of mercenaries and their prison. This takes an amazing percentage of the film, almost equal to the capture and holding of the ersatz Manhattan. As overwrought as all that is, the deep test of soul — the test that transforms — is reduced to one act: jumping from one ledge to another. unlike any other comic-based superhero film, the bad guy here has the most minimal costume; a mask and even that is explained as necessary in a Darth Vader sense. We've all been to so many summer films with illogically costumed villains that this registers.This and other notable dynamics tells me that Nolan and company understand the power of understatement in a sea of excess. Less matters when more surrounds it. An example of the excess is all the business about Robin's orphanage — down to the kindly but dumb Irish priest.I do think this is worth watching; the Dickensian influence is noticeable and welcome, especially after the hodgepodge story of the last episode. Still, there were two elements of the story that made me step out of my role as engaged watcher.One was an elaborate raid on the stock exchange, where a terminal is hijacked using Bruce Wayne's fingerprint. Many people die and the place is wrecked. Here is the story logic: Though everyone in the world would know of the raid and the use of that terminal by the crooks, no one would question the validity of trades made in Bruce's name. The loss of Wayne's money would result in him being removed from the board. Wayne's departure would automatically result in a schemer's succession, and that would somehow 'give control' of the corporation. This control would somehow extend to the closed fusion reactor project.Nothing in this computes. Hey, I'll buy the stadium bit, and the bomb, and the citizen trials because they all make sense in the storyworld. Not this.The second thing that got me... and this is because I know too much. In 'Iron Man,' it worked to have Tony Stark be a supergenius inventor, whose company also secretly made cool gear even with the perky secretary in charge. It makes no sense to me to have a company run by an avuncular caretaker make military weapons and for those to be sequestered as they are here.Military systems in general aren't really that sophisticated. All prototypes break. Everyone who pays attention knows about them. They take scads of people to develop. They take 15 years to design. If Wayne had that kind of money (modestly say $800B), other things would be vastly different.The Marvel universe works better so far as the gear.Hathaway here is what Uma Thurman tried to be some time back.",Null,8,16,29 July 2012
Iron Man," Too Contained
","I did not expect much from this. Marvel just seems to make what seems to me ordinary, boring movies. I was hopeful this time because the three main actors have done some rather elaborate work so far as reflected acting. Downey is something of a prince at this business of simultaneous personalities.But we have none of that here. I just saw 'Forbidden Kingdom' and it uses what is now the state of the art regarding cameras in fights: the camera dances. It folds us into the action. Not so with any Marvel-produced project. We might as well be watching C D deMille with color.Nearly all these Marvel stories are predicated on science gone wrong. Contrast that to heroes from other companies, where it is just cosmic reality or even training that happens to make someone special. But these stories all derive from the Japanese pattern of postwar antiscience movies which in turn were based on 'Frankenstein.' (The Japanese would not have known the earlier gollum films.)So the driving force here is science. As it happens, I would have been disappointed by the blandness of everything, but they ruined the driving force of science for me. Stark was supposed to have gone to MIT with Colonel Rhodes (who wears an MIT ring), but we are told Stark was summa cum laude at MIT. But that school is unique in never engaging in that foolishness. Think about it.But what's a greater offense is how this, the man with the best mind, the most money and the most advanced science, does his work. I'm thinking particularly of the computers. This is the one place where we could have been dazzled. But what we see is ordinary, as if it were envisioned not by a man with great imagination and inventiveness, but by someone who simply doesn't know.Suppose you were shown a car from 50 years in the future and it had a key, steering wheel and dial speedometer.

Blade Runner," Offworld Truth
","Spoilers herein.In the mid-seventies, I exchanged a few letters with Phil Dick, who had then dropped his obsession with parallel, valid visions and had developed a similar obsession with created realities. This concern maps well to the wave of film theory that was sweeping the film world, post-Kubrick. Its a sweet justice that this film from his book was sort of a milestone of that philosophy.It concerns a narrator whose recollection of the events may be colored. Some may have happened, some may have been manufactured memories. Within the remembered story are people who fold memories, from the fellow who manufactures replicants, to he who makes `toys,' to the fellow who literally folds. This first use of noir in scifi underscores the matter: noir denotes a coloring of the world, an implied narrator (usually but not necessarily paranoid).What makes this a watershed is that the studio bosses washed all that out of the theatrical release, making the narrator a trusted one by literally narrating. The film was a flop. With the director's reinstatement of the ambiguous truth, it has become a success. And who says the viewing public is too stupid to appreciate multilevel truths? Even people who think it is a simple story sense something deeper.Harrison Ford as a person is completely clueless about the forces that created, surround and buffet him, so he is a natural for this role, probably his best. Joanna Cassidy (Zhora) is a redhead. Great films seem to have more than their share.This camera is highly architectural. The state of the art with effects did not allow much camera movement, so all the perspectives are borrowed from Welles. So it doesn't innovate there, but the emulation is quite masterful. Where it does innovate is in the vision of an alternative (not future) world, but of course you knew that. However, it is worth noting how rare this is.The combination of knotted truths, architectural camera, effective reinstatement of alternative worlds, and the confused projection of self are completely in line with what Dick intended (if not quite what he wrote). And it is enough to place this in the top three of my best science fiction films, and on my list of must viewing for students of visual thinking.Ted's Evaluation: 4 of 4 -- Every visually literate person should experience this.",Null,17,31,8 November 2002

Jerry lived outside the story. Carrey on the other hand does more or less the same stuff every film, but the character is always within the story. When the humor of the story has to support the humor of the character, you're in trouble unless you have a good idea.

It shameless exploits every accessible emotion including race and adultery but always in a soft way. The one thing that interests me in all this engineered manipulation is the use of redheads. Disney has invented a new science of redhead archetypes, and along the way reinforced or created new roles in film for reds. Here, we have reds in the roles of (a heavy) Alicia Witt and Joanna Gleason. In the role of the creative teacher partner, (Sara) Alexandra Boyd is red.

Casino Royale," New Ground, New Space
","We have a new level in cinematic motion.This movie is in three parts, each part engineered excellently, much more so than the norm.In this case, the Hollywood system really did give us something cinematic and newly artistic in its way.The first part consists of an introduction to the world we will inhabit for two and a half hours. It's a few moments in grainy black and white. In any movie, the filmmaker has a challenge in letting us know where to snap our cinematic imaginations to. They have to do that in the first few moments, using cues and shorthand. Its a special challenge for a Bond film because we have come to expect a certain sex as humor, adventure as gadget stance. A certain notion of open space and global movement with cartoonish, bloodless intrigue. These filmmakers had to overcome that in a few moments, and they did. You immediately know where you need to place your mind with this strong reference to noir plus the notion that it will be diluted. This is followed by the title sequence which has more realistic components overlain on iconic cartoons. The theme is guns shooting hearts, spades and so on. The message is concise: fate, chance, human intervention. This isn't the most amazing introduction I've seen, but you can see that they understood the problem and addressed it with a very clean and direct engineering of the cinematic world.Part 3 is the main movie. Its good enough, as Bond works up the levels of the organization and escapes many times. I liked the fact that its nor flavored in the sense that a man is pitted against what seems the way the way the world is put together. The one glaring flaw in this part was Eva Green. She was miraculously perfect in 'The Dreamers,' where her job was to represent the embodiment of desire in the context of counter-culture as adolescent, sex as movie. Allure is a relatively simple act.Here she has to be a powerful person, intriguing, intense. Willing to deeply go together but with knowledge of her own way. She is supposed to be every bit the equal of Bond and in half of the universe his better. She isn't. In fact, I cannot think of any actress alive that could have pulled this off and still fit within the constraints of the 'Bond girl' which implies certain appearance.But forget all that. The reason to see this is because of the second part. The Bond formula is to have an exciting chase scene at the very beginning. It need have little to do with the main plot, and is there to circumnavigate expectations. If the movie will be heavily dependent on amazing gadgets, you need to display some in this section. In the past, these have been adventurous and clever.This time they have done something so well I want to send you to the theater just for it. They've broken new ground cinematically I think in how they have put this together. Its a chase sequence, Bond chasing a guy that is a suspected bomber. No cars, airplanes, skis, purely a footrace except for one use of a bulldozer. The action itself is remarkable, with these guys moving in space with such grace. And they readily move in three dimensions, up and through cranes and a building skeleton. Naturally there are explosions and objects moving dangerously. But that by itself is not the magic.The magic is in how the camera places us, our eyes. The characters move and we move with them, more energetically. Some of the eye positions we find ourselves in are where cameras would ordinarily be: at eye level with a steadycam or jiggly hand-held; in a helicopter, swooping over a crane. Other eye positions have us confabulated in the action, tangled in legs or the swirl of a fight. Yet others are familiar from animated adventures, those few new camera swoops that must be preprogrammed into compositing software. And then there are some new positions that seem to have been selected only because of their oddity. Plus we have mistakes, the eye getting too excited and looking in the wrong place, as if we were pushing ourselves in the chase and occasionally looking about or getting our situation wrong.And it isn't just where we are, its the pacing of how these are interrelated. We don't have time to shift position, so we are carried along in ALL positions, us in a way being the whole space that they rush through. Us as space. Our eye not as simple sensor of a world but our whole selves redefined as what we can see and blended in a say, 60 foot diameter snake chasing these two guys as mongeese, containing them and threatening them.Its new space, new territory. I wish it were a whole project that had more purpose than collecting our coins by giving us a rush. But there you are. Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,16,36,20 November 2006
Toy Story 3," Graduation
","You go to hear Steve Jobs at one of his Keynote addresses not because you worship the man. It is because you want to be a part of history. You want to be present at the moment that in the future people will say that the world changed. Jobs is a revolutionary; always was. Always will be.His whole approach is based on advancing, advancing, even if he ends up cannibalizing his own market. This is why no one can really compete, because there has to be a fearlessness to do the new. Pixar was like that, and it is why I cherished their projects. Oh, they used good old story engineering. And they were quite happy to pander to simple established emotional responses. But in every film they did two things which kept me coming back. You might call it the Orson Welles model:— advance the cinematic vocabulary so that the narrative has fresh power.— support a narrative that itself is new, that does not rely on genre conventions, so that it can hook to the cinema rather than the memory.Well, folks, Pixar might be dead as a force in film. This movie is a disaster. Oh, it is polished enough. It has that Pixar sheen. It is profoundly effective in making you cry at the endearing new character, Daisy. But it has no new visual ideas in it. None. None at all, the first Pixar project of which this can be said. I will point you to the texture of the shredded garbage toward the end and its luminescence which is novel. But this is merely a software advance that isn't leveraged. No. After giving us a new set of camera conventions every bit as influential as Hitchcock's, they have stopped. Disney? The 'just a manufactured product' mentality? I guess.Oh, and the story. I will grant you that this story is superficially like the others. But look more closely. In the past, they have been scrupulously original. They would never, never have sullied a story by asking you to refer to another movie — excepting other Pixar movies of course. Let other, lessor studios do that, seemed to be their stance. So while it is okay for 'Madagascar: Escape 2 Afric' to be made entirely of references to other films, Pixar stories connected because they connected with your emotions without a film memory as intermediary.But what do we have here? The central element is the big escape, and a half dozen movies are trotted out. Sure, we get it and it is even a fun thing. But it is not pure storytelling, not of the kind we expected.

","Spoilers herein.Movies are to many people largely about performance. Actors certainly think so. Spectator sport is about performance as well, though most athletes don't think so. They think is has something to do with 'the love of the game,' and sometimes personal challenges.Movies about baseball are often performances about performing because it isn't much of a team sport. And this is the most obvious case because:-- It adds the extra dimension of sex as performance (to 'educate' the baseball performance which produces the actor performance) which dimension is underscore by the capture of Tim Robbins in much the same manner as Nuke was captured.-- It features that speech by Annie  about what she believes in (the Church of Baseball... a religion full of magic, cosmic truth, and the fundamental ontological riddles of our time...), followed after some time by what Crash believes including: '... that the novels of Susan Sontag are self-indulgent, overrated crap'-- Crash calls the majors 'the show'-- The only real teaching Crash gives Nuke is about the TeeVee cliches-- We have three kinds of actors. Costner who wants the world to come to him, so only offers what he thinks is appealing; Robbins who throws himself into the psychological space of the viewer (at 90 miles and hour), and Sarandon who cheats by attracting us into her actorly Bermuda triangle.

Before Sunrise," The Movie Not Married
","I think the memory of this is better than the movie itself.I recently saw the sequel. It was one of the most delicate and perfect things I know so far as that shell of romance which is outside of intimacy. That was because  I think  of the actors and and the lines they contributed. It makes the timing natural. It doesn't take geniuses for this because the two characters are acting and playing natural acting is easier than playing natural life.But a huge part of what made that work was the memory of this. So I went back and watched it. Its nice, I suppose, but far, far worse than 'Before Sunset.' It seems just like all the other Linklater movies: thin, effete, words with no edge. Corners with no walls.Delpy is radiant, of course, having just been through the school of Kieslowski.

Like Speilberg, this guy knows how to engage us with more or less competent filmschool pacing and supporting imagery. Both shameless exploit children as part of creating a world of simple, Hallmark values. Both mix very subtle craft with blunt, obvious, repeated moralistic messages. At the end, both make you wonder why you watched their film. Was it just to take up that small time?But a clever viewer can see something else going on. In the film world, there are two communities from different worlds. One community is steeped in corn and seeks to only amuse. They don't understand the other community at all, those who seek to enlighten, transport, explore. These `aliens' sometimes raid the cornballs' talent pool. Mel even was tempted and tried to play Hamlet before discovering his true faith. Very clever of Shyamalan to place himself in the film as the unknowing connection between these two worlds. He is able to empower -- quite by accident -- some `signs,' visual power from the artist-aliens. He is even able to capture one and instinctively knows what they don't like: watered down stuff. Then he runs away.Not all of this is a joke.

Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Woody Discovers Space Jazz
","You never know what he is going to do next, but you can be sure that whether we like it or not, a lot of thought will have gone into it.This time a lot of adventure too.Add these three elements:-- among the several masteries he has is the way he can imbue a film with the sense of place, allowing that to penetrate, to saturate. I think he did this with New York before he realized it. Now, even though it is clearly uncomfortable, he is traveling the world looking for other places.Unfortunately, there are few places on the planet that are as visually keyed to emotions as Manhattan. London. Barcelona.I'm really pleased to see him still pushing himself, still placing himself outside his previous success. Here, he works with a person as place. It's a challenging cinematic experiment.-- he merges this experiment with another that he and others have mastered: a single character appearing in three personalities. He only does two at a time in all three combinations. And again it is autobiographical. All Woody is.His three types of women who collectively compose his complex character here are played by Scarlett with whom he clearly has a quiet sexual passion. Here she is adventuresome enough to enter his cinematically composed she-being as essentially sexual being. Her occupation is continuously improving photography which (with painting) Woody and others often conflate with film-making.His second woman is too predictable to describe. Woody has entered Almodovar territory, physically, sexually and emotionally. Cruz merely has to show up in her passionate Almadovar kit. She's an emotional basketcase, a sexual genius, a painter.The third woman is the new bit in this equation. She's the most attractive, the most self aware. Where the film is sets about watching the exploration of selves in place, she is a student of that place. She is the one who sees and fears and yet indulges. She is the true love, or rather her existence is what makes love possible.Her occupation is the 'study' of Catalon culture.The radical observation here is that she leaves the place, this empowering it.-- and of course the third grand element is not that this is Barcelona, but Gaudi's Barcelona. The place is only accidentally a physical place. It's really a spatial philosophy that suits (and indeed invented) the notion of superimposed ambiguous sexual emotions on space.We are, for all the womanly registration scenes, in Gaudi spaces, either physically or by reference. Energies from the soul recorded, enticed and charmed from the forms we see in two dimensions.If Woody ever were to do a three D movie, this would be the one. Alas, he passes. And he omits the most complex and life- changing place, the crypt of the unfinished chapel. Shame on his advisers.This is essential Tedg stuff. Introspection. Complex love, it's relationship to attraction, what it means to be a woman and how that can be traced in cinematic architectural sex.As a Woodyfold, it ranks with my other subtle favorite which it may well replace in my pantheon of essential films 'Sweet and Lowdown.'Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,11,20,27 February 2009

","Woody is uneven to say the least. His most celebrated films strike me as failures by overreaching. But here the aspirations are slight and the result is rather winning.All of Woody's pictures are self-referential in the sense that they are about him, his foibles and neuroses. Here, that is made more plain by the invention of a simple self-referential device: the film is about an artist who has troubles relating to women, and who has eccentric habits. Ho hum, until you add the tricks which are deft;--The story is a documentary (complete with reminicenses) but of a completely fictitious character--The narrative comes not from a disembodied camera, but from the contemporaries and historians, including Woody. Thus, the artist sits down with the audience, to swap tales about his avatar.--Some of the stories are of the `as I heard it' tall tale variety, going so far as to have three versions of a scene all patent lies. This is really the best.It all works because Penn is such an intelligent actor. He knows that he has to live in several realities:--He is the character--He is the fictitious remembrance of the character--He is one of the storytellers--He is the actor Sean Penn winking at you throughoutPenn carries this off with aplumb -- simultaneous stances, all but the first in good humor.

Elizabeth: The Golden Age," A Spaniard in the Works
","I am reduced to observations that are ordinary, banal because so. Our Cate reduced to a stern manikin. This is the Cate who is our actress most capable of nuance and depth.Our Elizabeth reduced to a bipolar simpleton. This is the queen who invented modern drama, metaphoric use of the English language, and current notions of religious freedom. Very likely the three are related in some way.The rise to responsibility which we all know to some degree, is here just simple acceptance of fate.A great naval battle turned into rockem sockem robots with Errol Flynn flying about. Its as if Raleigh actually distinguished himself there instead of by the enslavement of the Irish. The appearance of the magician Manteo and his removal to the lab of Dr Harriott, the magical 'school of night' of Raleigh and Southhampton, and Shakespeare. The murder of Marlowe. All hidden. Raleigh is depicted here as a buccaneer ruffian. But far from being coarse, he was an effete courtier, particularly skilled at the game. And one of the foremost poets of his day. It was his witty repartee that attracted the attention of the queen.A pale love story, cobbled up in every way. An active, encircling camera and use of space. Things I normally admire.

The Deer Hunter," Shawshank of Nam
","Spoilers herein.I admire films well done, and this is certainly one. But it succeeds only by attempting something so simple one wonders if it is worth the emotional investment of the audience. I think I prefer projects like `Thin Red Line' which also put you through the wringer but can transform your soul.The simple thing here is to focus on situation as the driver of the story. The actors (fine actors mostly) form an ensemble that responds. This is radically different than the typical DeNiro picture which has it the other way around. It is the only DeNiro performance I credit as tolerable because he subordinates his presence to the vision of the filmmaker. He does do that with others (notably Scorsese) but in their case, their vision is entirely bounded by the character, so we watch him grimace and prance intently and are supposed to be amazed.The situation here is an America that breaks its people. Quite bleak. The situation shifts to and from Vietnam and the actors react, but there is no mistake that they were terminally damaged before the first scene. The changing situation is like the revolver's chambers, that bullet will appear in one of them. Randomly.In producing the film, sound is used effectively.

Identity," 10 Conversations about One Thing
","Spoilers herein.About half of all films today are of the type that directly tinker with the narrative in some way. Usually the game is intended to play with the role of the viewer, tricking him into being a cocreator of the story. Sometimes it is simpler, where the writer takes the viewer aside to have a conversation ABOUT the story while the story is underway.That latter is what we are meant to think is going on at the start of this project. There's a 'Scream' -like stance, flavored with the time-hopping multiple threads from similarly-motivated Tarantino-inspired efforts. But then we shift into more of a challenge: this is a mystery, it seems. 'Ten Little Indians' is cited (though the original title would have had more edge) by one of the characters as we shift into a struggle with the writer over who creates the future. It is as if our relationship with the writer changed from comfortable confidant to adversary, a clever, clever writing trick.But no, we do not stop there. We now have two dynamic situations, the action on screen and the newly insecure relationship with the writer. Another shift! This time we move into what I think is a genre that has only appeared only in the last couple years. That's where we see multiple actors, but they are all playing the same character. Happened first for me in 'Thing You Can Tell By Just Looking At Her,' there cloaked in a magical realism. Most recently it happened in '13 Conversations about One Thing.' In both cases the unified character was a woman.Here it is a man, but the backbone of this film is Clea DuVall, though the apparent narrator is Cusack. Cusack already has made a specialty of these sorts of self-referential folding where he is the narrator but not really. DuVall was the central character in '13 Conversations,' and she plays precisely the same persona and narrative anchor here.All this is important if you want to understand the trick at the end.

Beowulf," Grindle's Eye
","I'm glad to be alive for this period, when cinema is simultaneously maturing into deeper realms of introspection and evolving into a new form altogether. Even when I see a thoroughly unredeemable story like 'Transformers' done with this new awareness of time and space, I feel ennobled, even hopeful about the future. And isn't that one reason we go to the movies, to fight the weight of others, the feeling that society is doomed?What's happening is that different technologies are freeing us from the constraints of the physical camera. This  constrained only by what is thought to be the viewer's requirements for understanding  allows modern storytellers to see things differently, with a grander vocabulary. It means adventures of the imagination. It means that we get to question and expand just who we are in relation to the story we watch. Are we invisible ghosts but with otherwise human limits? Are we agents in creating the story, things bent by our expectations and needs? Are we companions or competitors with the writer as he reveals, Scroogewise? Or are we also growing  at least a little  into the literal weavers of the space into which the worlds of the story are poured by others? I believe so, and that belief deepens when we see even the most vulgar filmmakers get on board. This is new in the last decade and it is accelerating apace. No adventure film that depends on effects that was made even a decade ago is effective if first seen now.I'm not sure what technologies will survive. By that I mean whether motion capture will be necessary, with real persons behind the puppets we see, as we have in this movie. Or whether we'll have something more like '300' and 'Sin City' where the emphasis is on the subtle details of humans and all else synthesized. Or even whether the Pixar movement will grow. But I do know that the way we allow the camera to move has changed, and this film is a milestone of sorts.Part of that is the way it was engineered to allow for the IMAX 3-d experience  how I saw it. Its more grand and overstated than we will end up with in real films, I'm sure. But it is a marker.Unfortnately, since we still have a dummy at the steering wheel, the overall benefit is lost. What Zemekis does is swoop, but except for more overhead shots than usual, what he does is give us all the 'ordinary' perspectives someone like him normally would a decade ago. But they are seamlessly connected. So it is generally: shot, swoop, pause, swoop, shot. We do get some spatial definition and weaving, but it is an unintended byproduct. He's just not smart enough to live in the connecting movements instead of the endstations. I'm watching this with 'Three Crowns of the Sailor' made 25 years ago which had precisely the verb awareness instead of the noun, but without the technology.So once again, we see the story reflecting what we have in the film. The story, if you don't know, is about the merger of the human and non-human. We see two iterations: one imperfect, a second nearly perfect. The first is grotesque but powerful, the second graceful and airborne. This movie is the first, a rather grotesque synthesis that we only expect to toss things about. (It intimates something along these lines with 'the new religion' as well.)We can only hope for the champion to arrive to give us the real juice, the one prepared to wrestle with only his soul, and to have a soul that matters.

Live Free or Die Hard," Back to Come Forward
","I think there must be a craft in Hollywood, a guild of stunt designers. Presumably they used to be stuntmen and explosives gurus. But now they must be more like writers and production designers. Half of this movie has nothing to do with Willis or the story, That half is the stunts, and they are designed to be overtly retro, both in what they actually are and the tone of how we see them. This has to be enough, and for me it marginally was. That's not because they were good  they were typical in wow factor. But that they were designed with reference in mind. Those first scenes in the Bond films were this way too: the stance, the historical placement was as well considered as normal dramatic qualities. Stunts had arrived; now they can have irony, self-reference, temporal semiotics. But there's a second half of this movie too. The Willis character isn't in either half; he's irrelevant. In previous films we see him as haunted. Its a cartoonish haunting of family and self-worth. Here, there's none of that, no 'everyman.' The second half is the computer assault. (You should know that I know how much of this computer infrastructure really is put together.)What we have here is something that (except for cell phones) uses notions and even devices at the 'data center,' that come from 1988. Its incredibly dated, even more unsophisticated than that Sandra Bullock thing, 'The Net.' Its retro, just like the stunts. Its a risky decision; I think it works. More important to me is that they can design something like this. Horror movies do it all the time, but they don't do it with double-skips: Skipping back to see how they would have skipped forward.Its just the sort of design ethic that the Willis character had in the first one, which also was the first summer action blockbuster. Its that work at the action, then wink bit.Fitting into that skip forward is casting of the 'I'm a Mac' guy as the main hacker, and the skip back of Kevin Smith as the secondary one.This might mean something important when we see it in a real movie, this engineering of time stance.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",Null,8,15,29 June 2007
X2: X-Men United," Utterly Pedestrian
","Spoilers herein.I have enthusiastic hopes for big budget action pictures. That's because the market is so crowded, and the viewing public so visually sophisticated that we know that some thought must go into these things. This is especially so when you are building a franchise, because memories fade. In fact, this movie will probably be forgotten two weeks after the Matrix sequel appears.But on the other hand, sometimes these projects are so costly, and have such a large distributed creative team that risk drives the thing to the ordinary. In contrast, `Daredevil' was pretty cinematic. The second Harry Potter was a landmark in architectural use of space. The Donners have a reputation for having a deep understanding of how film works and how to intelligently exploit it. So I expected at least a few things excellent.We DO get movement. We DO have one fight sequence that is well crafted - aptly between the two combatants that are uniquely enhanced by technology. But the sets are amazingly, shockingly, scandalously unimaginative. The little soap opera is predictable and trivial enough - a Marvel legacy. The characters are generally flat. In the comic, they are - compared to other comics - human; here - compared to other film characters - cartoons. Huge Actman overacts hugely in a parody of Russell Crowe. Stewart does his continuing impression of what Shakespeare might do for TeeVee. For some reason the kids here are turned into, well, kids. The only mildly interesting characters are:-Famke Janssen. She is a very limited actress, but all such professional lives find that one role that is perfect for them. Everything about her fits, especially compared to the other women who are somewhat less limited as actresses. That hair color is something. I wish there were a film hair technician website.-Ian McKellan, who truly IS a Shakespearean of the British cast, which is to say he is a language rather than a facial/body technician. He molds words, fabricates them into weapons and throws them like the metal globules he steals from the guard's blood. Watch this.-Alan Cumming who makes a career out of comically annotating evil.But these three just do their own thing without any relation to anyone else in the film or creating the film. In contrast, the Jason/girl combo is a pretty thrilling idea especially in the context of being the son of the mad scientist (whose science incidentally seems beyond what the Shakespereans could do). That girl is the creation of Stryker dad after the tradition of `Forbidden Planet.` Now think about that - and how she is dressed - a minute and the perversion becomes pretty rich and astonishing.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.",Null,3,13,14 May 2003
Amélie," Life, A User's Manual
","Spoilers herein.I avoided this film for ever-so-long because of what I had heard about it. One would believe that this is a well-photographed simple sweet story. That somehow it has something to do with the adventures of a sweet girl-woman. Well, it is. But it is so much else, and that `something else' not only makes the sickly sweetness tolerable -- it completely undermines it. That's because every film rests on three threads that connect between it and us the viewers. The first thread is the story, which many people -- even filmmakers -- would have you believe is either all there is or at least that it is paramount. The second thread -- more visceral and immediate -- is the cinematic presentation. This filmmaker has wisely chosen to make the visual space coincide with the fondly imagined nostalgia of a simple past. All is simple, clean, abstract, sweet. Even Paris, whose primary products are dog poop and meanspirited grafitti.But that third thread is the most important -- even more powerful, perhaps because of its subliminal nature. And it is here that this film is rooted, and the rooting is superb, intelligent.That root is George Perec, probably France's most influential writer. Not the most known or best loved, he directly approached a problem of the French character: that they were once an important people artistically. How does one be creative in a land populated by dead, giant saints? You build metastructures of the structures already there -- you build stories about stories. The component stories can be as trite as the public demands, but the assembly -- the structure of which eludes the casual viewer -- can be as clever as you wish.In 1978, Perec published a large book called `Life, a User's Manual.' It is a wonderful work which every literately educated person should encounter. It answers the question `what can a writer do after Robbes-Grille?' (which is roughly the same question as what can a French filmmaker do after the `new wave?') This film is very closely based on that book in both form and content.The book is a collection of several hundred stories, many of the type `at this precise moment, Jacques was removing sand from his toenails (the location of the beach perhaps being a setting for the previous story) and recalling the sand on the photographs he took of his honeymoon in Chartres where Jeanette first saw his feet and said she fell in love with them alone...' All these stories are triggered or anchored in some physical detail, like a box left by a child in the wall, or a torn photograph on the floor of a train station., or a lamp in the form a character.  Most of these stories involve unnecessary losses, small decisions of great consequence or attempts to represent and/or assemble the other stories in a personal context.The book's central organizing device was an apartment building in the same location in Paris as the film. There are so many characters and stories that the book provides diagrams.Elements from the book in the movie (as I recall): images that are torn and reassembled, a painter painting the same scene over and over, a found child's treasurebox, a simpleminded son, a `glass man,' images from all over the world, a funhouse, a fine meal disguised. Minor mysteries solved (the image is of a repairman), characters who are recorders (the jealous boyfriend with his tape, the painter with his VCR, the maintainer of the photobooths, the stewardess who photographs the gnome) characters who create reality (the girl who imagines both reality and films on the TeeVee, the man who is the `designated mourner' for reconstructed images, the painter who is reinventing Amelie).The wind caused two glasses to dance; the important thing here is the wind, not the glasses. If you have not seen this, please do. But see the story as deliberately facile and trite, intended to only be pieces that should be assembled by you to make a real picture.

The Producers," Comedy About Comedy
","Spoilers herein.This works, but it hurts.The first rule of movie comedy is that you have to integrate the funniness of the players, the funniness of the skits and local situations, and the wrapper of the story. This last is where nearly all movie comedies fall down, and where this one succeeds.We have a couple masters at being funny just being: they are allowed to create skits that are manic. This is great stuff that Brooks let his guys run with. Even within the skits, there are levels: Wilder as observer, Leo Bloom. (The James Joyce joke is intended, as was the Kafka.)But the master touch was the story itself: a play about a play with all the action inbetween the two layers. Part of the layering is the deal about the writer of both the play and the film as Nazi. Brooks would never again be as clever, or as willing to personally be the butt of the joke.But there's price behind this joke. The gag is supposed to be the same as in Chaplin's `The Dictator:' preening evil as ridiculous. Brooks wants to be seen as edgy and on topic both, but watch what he really does in the story, the stuff that is apart from the comic geniuses of Mostel and Wilder.He pokes fun at gays. Incessantly. This sort of undermines the counternazism, doesn't it?He has a mild but pervasive blue humor: the svedish secretary, the horny old birds.He makes fun of Germans in a borrowed `Hogan's Heros' way, but not for their ideas or politics. What's funny about pretzels and beer?The more you look at `Dictator' and `Producers' the better they both seem: Chaplin's sheer courage (which cost him his entire livelihood and homeland) and Brook's structure.

Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Luke rewrites Matthew
","This is a replacement comment for the one written on opening night. I've had a chance to see it again, this time in 3D, and of course think about it.The big picture here is that the creative team made a modern film in the sense that it is folded, meaning it is about itself and how it presents other films. There are hundreds of examples of this of course, but this is the biggest movie in history, so something important is going on. In thousands of comments here, I've remarked on this new development, where more and more films have introspective dynamics. We are changing how we think, managing thoughts on at least two levels: the story and the story about the story, or how the story is presented. There is real power in this, because such introspection is a half step away from seeing yourself while being yourself, and that is half a step away from what might be called living the force.An example: the story in this film had to recycle elements from the previous ones (actually just the first two). What is our heroine about but literally scavenging elements from the prior films? Throughout, the term 'scavenger' is used as an insult but Rey carries it proudly. She clearly knows something about herself we don't.Our first scene with her matters. We have been transported with captured Poe into the hanger bay of a star destroyer, which Poe finds impressive. Immediately after, we have Rey rappelling into an identical bay from the last Star Wars saga. She will later fly through this and other parts of that wreckage. About the handling of space. Other than story details, this had to have been much chewed over, because since the original films, our conventions of what a camera is have changed. The original two films were themselves intended to be retro in how they handled the camera. In 1977, the techniques attributed to Hitchcock and Welles were common, where the camera was no longer passive. It became our representative in the film, subtly indicating what we would do if we were there, or what role we would play. The camera could be curious, for instance, show revulsion or fascination. Lucas chose to have the camera be as it was in the 40's. This is one reason dePalma and Coppola thought the movie stunk. But that and the practical effects worked for us, indeed became part of what we loved.Now flash forward to a time where no action movie can be made without the active camera, the camera as our representative. What balance does Abrams find, but to have two film philosophies interwoven. In all the 'character' scenes, the effects are mostly practical and the camera is retro. In all the action scenes, the effects are mostly GCI and the camera is the modern one. The difference is striking because Lucas used a 1930 Howard Hughes dogfight movie as his template for the space battles. Here we still have spacecraft moving as if they were biplanes moving fast, but the weaves among them and among the camera are modern. (This was pioneered by Pixar, and their direct influence is obvious in the 3D version.)One final observation on the story reflecting the film itself. When Lucas and Kurtz invented the characters for the first film, they paid a lot of attention to archetypes. Most commonly cited is the work of Joseph Campbell but they more deeply studied the most popular of these, the Jesus story. (They didn't mention this for obvious reasons.) Think of Mark as history and each of the following gospels as episodes that added to the story.Mark (without the later ending) is about a preacher of parables with no special birth and no resurrection. Matthew in the next episode adds a virgin birth, influence from Persia and Egypt (then considered magical) and rising from the dead. Where Mark had him in the Nazarene desert, Matthew brought him into cosmic battle.The third episode written as 'history' emphasized Jesus role in building an order of followers, whose collective adherence to (lets call it) the force will sweep over the planet and redeem it. The devil appears here with his own order, the 'first order' chronologically created.One might assume that the name Luke Skywalker was random, or that it mirrored Lucas' name. But this is not the case, and this is something Kasdan understood. All he did was give us the Jesus story filtered through Kurosawa.Why mention this? Because Kasdan is again on the case and what he does is metaphorically overlay Luke on Matthew, giving us both.",Null,30,61,18 December 2015
Cinderella," Slippery
","Recently, I watched 'Snow White' and was amazed again. So I had to follow it with this, which is a sort of nadir in the art of film. The story, is actually every bit as promising as 'Snow White' was. In fact to my mind it is better.Unjust subordination. Magic. Love at first encounter. A sexual union. Loss (magic again). Search. Reward.Now, in the source stories, there are plenty of versions that were explicitly bawdy in the search and what was attempted to fit into what among all the eligible maidens. But even without this, there is plenty of room for fable elaboration. You could take this in many, many directions. These things are clouds of rich quantum possibilities.What does Disney do? Insert Tom and Jerry sequences. Where 'Snow White' pulled short cartoons into long form film, this pulls by then well established long form animation back into short cartoon form.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",Null,8,14,13 September 2008
RED," The Babe
","We shouldn't be surprised at the appearance of the geezer action genre. Simple market forces will change every genre and I suppose we will have young (very young) and old versions of most genres, just as we already have (and always have had?) in popular music. It is no surprise that the two latest experiments feature the two guys who are credited with inventing the summer blockbuster: Stallone and Willis. Also, because these are manufactured items designed by witless managers, it will be no surprise that they have as much value as a modern breakfast cereal.But what is interesting is how the geezer genres will have to adapt certain rules of the genre. So many of those rules depend on the role of the babe. You know, the sexy young thing that gets rescued? Or the sexy young couple that is the first to go in a slasher film because they are being punished for showing us sex? I went into this knowing that the chases would be chasey, the explosions nice and screenfilling orange, the bad guys the same we know. I knew the dialog would have the same, bankable flippant style. I knew where everything would be placed but the babe. What to do about the babe?I consider this an experiment, and not the solution we can expect to see. But here's what they decided.The traditional babe, the one that is simply along so that she can be protected by the strong man? She is played by the nearly 50 year old Mary-Louise Parker. Even in her youth and from the very beginning, her casting was exclusively in off-sex roles, roles that openly contradicted the babe stereotype. This was not in any conventional way, like Jennifer Jason Lee has covered. Just quirky and plain. Her plainness and lack of ordinary character is emphasized here. This, I think was so that they could shift the babe focus from the passive one to an active babe.And who for that? The first one cast, Hellen Mirren. So far so good. Helen has built a career from the beginning (and she says, a life) based on open sexuality. Greenaway's 'Cook, Thief' is how most of us remember her 'middle age' sexuality. I suppose that when she was cast, the idea was to have her in a lusty comic relationship with Bruce. There is some remnant of this intent with a backstory about her affairs and one real love with a Russian spy. Her character is supposed to be the most ruthless and accomplished, her job description not being spy but assassin.That would have been an interesting experiment. The woman knows how to project inclusive desire that transcends body shape. She is an intelligent enough actress to know how to bend the overt penile fascination with guns, and we do see a scene where that was clearly intended. But in the rewrites and tests and reshoots, the more adventuresome female juice was blotted away. There are some closeups of her face where the makeup is designed to emphasize wrinkles. Look closely at these scenes and you will see that the closeups are a later addition.The scene where she shoots thousands of depleted uranium 50 caliber bullets like a frenzied bull? Well, her costume is very considered. I imagine there were scenes that were cut that allowed her to move that dress in notable ways. What is left however is a braless shape reminiscent of a demented baglady.Strange. A strange experiment. I wonder what they will do next?I saw this with an old guy whose only thrill was in recognizing the Swedish K, and in knowing that the variant shown in the movie 'wasn't right.'Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",Null,2,7,31 October 2010
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Jarndyce and Jarndyce
","I have read only a small portion from the books, but enough to understand the woman's approach. I have, however, attentively watched all the films. This comment applies to the entire saga with some attention to the final two.Charles Dickens invented a style of writing that is well suited to some kinds of cinematic adventure. What he would do is invent a world, and thoroughly understand its dynamics. These really were invented worlds, though today they appear as though he was writing about his own. He was an absolute genius at discovering certain objects and characters in these worlds and giving them powerful names. Then he would let his characters loose; he literally would write and publish the first episodes of what we read today as whole books. He would send the chapters out, trusting that his named entities would weave their own story. The result is pure joy when reading because the world is whole enough to carry us.It is also why his books all end clumsily.Rowling works very much in this style, the first chapters sent aloft while the story is still soft; the impressive ability to name things; the creation of a universe of sorts. As though she understands this, her alternative world is extended not from our modern technological one, but from Dickens' Victorian England. The filmmakers, starting with Columbus, understood this and adapted what they supposed we supposed were Victorian manners, costumes and architecture. The dragons are sourced not from modern models but from drawings of that period.So the strength is that we are sucked into the world. Usual offenses from clumsy plots, unnecessary events, artificially placed combat and all are made invisible because we care not about the story per se, but the world that supports it. We care less about any of the characters, than the names the carry. That is Dickens' gift. I do like a few names Rowling devised; they are worthy.Otherwise (meaning without the Victorian art, and Dickensian names) we may just as well be watching a Michael Bay film.The previous film had a folding device I appreciated. We are told a story that is supposed to be central, the story of the 'Deathly Hallows.' Now as it turns out, the three objects described in the story are not any more central than any of the other named objects, but we don't know that in the seventh film. The story is told in a shadow puppet form, one we have seen a couple times already this year. The level of abstraction is the same from the Harry Potter universe as that universe is from ours, which is why it matters in the end that Harry destroys one of the three objects.Previous films, starting with the fourth I believe, had the 'pensieve,' a clever device which allows Harry to see movies of the past. The dynamics of the thing are strange because they are supposed to be recreated memories, but the viewer sees them cinematically. We gloss over the difficulty just as we do with alien invaders speaking English. I did appreciate the design of this thing as it evolved in the films, but it retains the inkflows. That works well in combination with the inkflow-like trails of Voldemort's flying minions.Lily Evans as a redheaded girl is adorable.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,8,14,13 July 2011
Final Destination," Clever, highly self-referential
","This is a clever little movie.I'm 53, and go to see teen movies out of curiousity and to try to stay tuned to a quickly evolving, often intriguing culture. Sometimes I get discouraged at how mindless culturemakers think teens are. I felt this way after seeing Romeo Must Die.But this movie gave me hope, as did the little gem GO last year. I know that there are many who would go looking to be scared, who would take this movie (or any one) seriously -- folks who even rank grossness as a thrill.But this movie is like the first Scream movies in making fun not at slasher flicks, but at the people who come to see slasher picks, or more precisely, the reasons they do. However, this movie does so much better than scream because it uses a novel device: many of the deaths are extremely complex sequences of improbable coincidences. It fits with the story, as only death could string these together. But it provides what Scream lacked: a greater distance from the actual slash. In fact this movie is NOT scary, nor gory by current standards. Instead, it spends its time on introspection about the medium. Andy Warhol sophistication finally hits teen culture. The level of this humor gives me hope about the future of the minds of our kids.I only wonder what can come of it next. If every instance of distance requires that we carry the vulgar with it as referent, does this give new life to the base?",Null,9,18,3 April 2000
Rear Window," Copernican Cinema
","Spoilers herein.I just don't like Hitchcock. I admit that he `delivered value' in his day, but as I review his films today, I find them trite, badly dated. The style of acting he used now looks `actorly.' His camera framing is well considered but unimaginative by today's standards. The stories are not engaging (to me).But this film really is a classic. Not because of the acting or the dialog, but because it was so cleverly conceived. And because the execution is so purely cinematic.The first problem a writer/director faces is what stance the camera takes. Is it a fairly static `audience' as if you were watching a play? Is it godlike in always seeing things from the best perspective, though sometimes humanly impossible? Is it a character? Or does it follow a character sometime showing their point of view, sometimes their reaction? Does it act?Do we admit the camera exists -- by introducing jiggle, or showing operator's functions like focusing, developing? Do we dissolve the camera's perspective by juggling time or perspectives? Do we try a `100 simultaneous cameras' approach?Hitchcock usually uses the static theatrical approach -- way too much for modern tastes. He punctuates this by sometimes doing a character focused shot, and sometimes a spectacular-for-the-time godshot -- as in the `Psycho' shower scene.But this film is more purely conceived for the camera. There are no godshots. Nearly all the camerawork is from Jeff's eye, or of Jeff's apartment, with a few notable exceptions. What is novel is why this works -- the set and entire story were composed backwards. That is, instead of having some slice of life that the camera discovers, this reality exists as if it were created by the camera before the action starts. Everything that is required to motivate the world is comprehensible from that apartment -- the entire physics of this world is based on its center.In other words, Hitchcock's achievement here is not how he accommodates the camera to the world, but the world to the camera.Pure genius.",Null,30,49,23 April 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Depth
","Spoilers herein.This raises the bar on production values, as it certainly is competently made, say, compared to the `Star Wars' stuff. It seems oddly paced, lacking a rhythm, and more importantly lacking the patina of magic that colored the first two. In fact, everything seems brighter this time out.Unlike the battle of the second, they have decided to not have any movie jokes, like the surfer/warrior who winks at the camera. But there is still a variety in tone from place to place as if different directors were involved. I suppose that's true.I remarked on the earlier films that they innovated primarily in how they use the vertical dimension. This third film is even more competent and extreme in that regard. They knew it was a discriminator and exploited it. Unfortunately, the towers and cities and mountain gates all have an unnatural sameness to them, they are photographed with huge vertical sweeps. Even the first ending where everyone bows to the hobbits and there is the obligatory `helicopter' shot, it goes shockingly far beyond what one expects. The way it pulls back fast and swoops reminds that we are used to an eye that is constrained by the aerodynamics of light helicopters.Not so here. When this is considered in hindsight, I'm pretty sure that the high production values won't be noticed; that all the effects and conventions here  especially the battle scenes  will be seen as borrowed, all except for the exhilarating use of height. That's worth watching. Magic of its own.That magic is enough to carry this project for me. It is clearly Jackson's intent to move his camera in great vertical arcs, usually in ways that no physical camera could. That gives us a fantastic eye. Just a few hours later, I saw `The Lion King' again and noticed that although they were never constrained by physics, they always moved the `camera' in ways we have seen in ordinary `real' films. That's because `Lion' wanted to look real while `Return' wanted to seem ultrareal.Ian McKellen has always puzzled me, he's sort of a working man's John Gielgud, an engineer of the spoken word.

Munich," Close Encounters of the Spielberg Kind
","I like to swim more deeply in film than Spielberg. So although he makes somewhat effective films, they leave me wondering why they were made.Well, we know why this, 'Schindler' and 'Ryan' were made. Its because after skimming a gazillion dollars by amusing us, this man wants to be seen as a weighty, 'real' filmmaker. A Kubrick that likes to occasionally have fun. We all know these films to be made on ostentatiously weighty material, so they must be deep. I had the highest hope for this one, because I know he was stung by how poorly the others were received by people he trusts. So here, he goes back to his method of 'Close Encounters' which was supposed to use New Wave techniques and to circumnavigate what was then new ideas about noir. I liked it. It took chances and where it failed it did so interestingly, even in the more ambitious later cut.This uses standard (meaning later) Spielberg techniques. Despite his vaunted cinematic storyboarding technique, all the emotional content here is spoken. All the emotional reference is off screen. There are violent acts, but these seen deliberately bloodless, like an Indiana Jones movie would have then, something abstract to talk about. The intended effect was to haunt by the reality that punches through the rationalization. The reality here never gets a chance because its all so movieworld.That's the problem. He wants to make a film that resonates because it hurts, because it ties knots in us. He just cannot. Its still just a script. Consider the last scenes. These are powerfully written. There are a dozen other filmmakers who could have made them work.We've been through an entire story to set up the haunting ambivalence in our hero. He is finally able to be with his wife and as he makes love to her, the only think he can see are the hostage deaths not fully shown until this moment, charmed into their horror by human touch. This is followed by her gently caressing the face of her man, accepting all that has come before. If I read this by a good writer, I would be crippled for weeks.But see how Steven has rendered it. All the pieces are there but the cinematic machine isn't assembled. We have gone all this time, and been set up so well for nothing. I am reminded of 'Monster's Ball,' which is constructed the same way. Its value is all in the very end, where we have Berre sitting on a stoop in a state of bewildered acquiescence. This could have been more. It was far less, a remote poster.Good script. I intend to read it and imagine the film that could have been.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",Null,13,17,8 July 2008
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Alderaan Dies
","I get asked for examples all the time, even after all these years. Okay, here's one.Noir, by my definition is the placing of a world such that the viewers collectively control it. The effect is that ordinary people in the story find themselves jerked around by fate and strange, amazing coincidences. The cause, the reason is that we as viewers want this, and bend the world's physics to make it happen. Noir is the simple state of making us gods over the world we see. At least initially, that role was marked by camera angles that an observer in the world wouldn't have, but modern noir isn't linked to cinematic style.Folding is a collection of techniques that makes the film self-aware. A simple fold is a movie that alternates between observing a world and having someone in that world acknowledge that they are in a film. A common expression of this is a film within the film with the two reinforcing each other. The effect is that the audience is placed in the film explicitly.Catching Fire is a fourfold noir. The outer world is the world of the viewer, us. We have simple needs: action and clearly drawn teen romance. Inside this is the world of Snow and Heavensbee, who watch the populace. Together with Snow and Heavensbee that populace (and us) watch the games, as the explicit audience of the traditional 'film within.' And within that is a charade our two heroes support. Each layer tries to control the next, with the last (our valued love story) affecting the others.Noir is popular in modern film because it acknowledges us in the movie. We like that, we recognize it and we notice when it isn't there. It is its own fold and is used because it works, being our most common fold. The story within the story fold is simpler, not uniquely American, and more amenable to romance because you can conflate difficulties of love which are not cinematic with political unrest which is.All this is just formula, which is what we expect. By these folding conventions, the story can use devices that otherwise would jar. For instance, as with many 'intricate plan' movies, we count on the focus character to do things on the spur of the moment that turn out to have been essential to the plan. The planners seem to have known the future in detail; this is what characterizes noir. But holy cow, sometimes it is too much. Catch here how random it is that the wire is laying as it is, she sees it, she has an unlikely idea, she impossibly succeeds with precision timing, a hole is opened precisely over her where a vehicle is ready waiting.But Philip Seymour Hoffman?

Shall We Dance," Limiting Tracks
","Spoilers herein.As films unfold while we watch them, there's a curious balance between the world of the film and the world of the viewer. Usually the world of the film bulges into our world, the 'real' world. But sometimes it is the other way around. I haven't yet seen the original, but I understand it exploits this notion, the notion of the viewer simply stepping off the fixed track of reality into a richer world of flowing expression.It leverages the by now common device of dancing and trains, in addition to using the train as a metaphor for drudgery and routine. We know that the already mythical Baz Luhrmann went to great lengths to insert a train in 'Strictly Ballroom.' And we have the cinematic ally unique train sequence in 'Dancer in the Dark.'I maintain that today, trains exist more in the cinematic world than the real world, at least for Americans, and one reason this remake fails is the lack of understanding how to employ its nature in the service of the story. It would have failed even if the disaster of Lopez had been rectified, and the many translations from Japanese repression to that of privileged lawyers was somehow made.If you can get past the fact that this is as lifeless a remake as 'Tortilla Soup' (and for the same reasons), and overlook Lopez this script has one of the most interesting concepts in film marriage: marriage is about having a 'witness' to your life. The original build this into their concept, the shifting of that line between who sees what to the stretch of the film seeing the viewer.There's a piece of trivia here. Of all the worlds of dance, ballroom dancing - especially competitive dancing of the type that schools promote - is the least emotive, the most proscribed and predictable, even fluidly mechanical. Usually the ballroom dancing movie is about transcending those limits. Here, it is the opposite: Lopez's speech (itself mechanical) about dance making you truly alive is a bit ironic if you understand what the competition is all about.Bette Midler can relax now.

Looper," Annoyingly Trustworthy Monkey
","Time is all we must encounter; all else is urges. Narrative is built on this simple principle, usually with time forcing the cadence and agents with fate embodying the urges. So when time enters the story as a citizen, we have the opportunity for seriously disruptive experiences.You have to judge these things by a tougher scale than — well, than almost anything else, save when art and urge itself become agents.I had to fight to bring this film into my home, and it sat for months hoping to be used.In time travel stories, the narration can skip backwards and forwards. The many worlds can create histories that make every narration untrustworthy even if they are locally true. The prevailing theory (used by writers, anyway) would have events in the future affecting those in the past just as much as the intuitively more reasonable changes in the past influencing the future. Causality becomes folded. It is a blessing for a writer who understands.But not so here. The story is told from one time frame that loops back. Every view you see is trusted. The end is unexpectedly straightforward. Things do not become retroactively untrue. Lives are not undone, though the Bruce Willis character tries. It is as if the writer was tempted to take us on a wild ride, but ended up writing in events that prevent it.This means that we don't have the luxury of plastic causality, and some of the explanations here just don't add up. The complex scheme of sending people back to be killed is explained by saying that tracing humans in the future is thorough, so corpses are hard to get rid of. This makes even less sense as we see some action in the future. The tantalizing existence of the coordinator from the future is treated as if it were not tantalizing, but ordinary.It hurts that the character we hope will stir the pot is played by Bruce Willis, clearly chosen because of his role in 'Twelve Monkeys,' where (if you did not know the original film) he really did mess with our heads.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",Null,5,8,8 April 2013

Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The Evil Force
","I recently revisited this, and remembered first seeing it. It wasn't the first movie to be heavily hyped. But I recall it as the first one to appeal to kids as a big adventure.In a couple ways, what's come since have ruined this. Lucas himself ruined it by deciding to make all those extra ones, making up the story as he went. And of course, every month on average we now have a new special effects movie that matches the star wars franchise in visual ambition. Many of these in fact are fueled by Lucas' several companies.So its impossible to recapture that thrill. At the time, yes we knew he stole from Kurosawa, and leaned heavily on Joseph Campbell's notions of myth. But it all seemed so fresh, and Lucas himself came across as a visionary genius. And we needed that more than we needed entertainment.Remember, the US had just been through its first sleazy republican scandal and the nation as a whole was discouraged. But the world of movies was exploding. Woody Allen gave us 'Annie Hall.' Scorcese became known. And then this. The thing that impressed us at the time was how seriously it took itself, despite how childishly goofy that intergalactic bar was. Also how powerful the sounds and images were.The mythology was so clear. We had it for decades in science fiction and fantasy novels, indeed much better. But this was the first time we had them cinematically, and cinema when it works may be the most powerful of packaged imaginations. Oh how I wish we could see it as we did then.Now we notice, for instance, how ordinary the dogfights are. These used to thrill. We don't have all the mystery that made the thing deep. Now we know who everyone is and what is going on, and it is all so much more ordinary than what we imagined at the time as possibilities.In later years, Lucas would let us down, as a person and in this saga. In fact, I think he ruined some things. But for the year of this event, he was the most celebrated singer in the choir. And by me as well.What do I mean about ruining? Things evolve. When one thing finds a niche and flourishes, it pinches off other things. When 'Birth of a Nation' became a huge success, it froze movies as filmed plays with a larger stage instead of one of the several other directions it could have taken. Again, there was a period after talkies reinvented the medium where there was a struggle among various different directions. This you can clearly see in the period. In retrospect, it appears as if the world could have only turned out the way it did. But the trends that win aren't the best at all.So 'Star Wars' opened up a gateway for how effects could transform cinema into something far beyond what we had before. And then it closed that gateway, so that effects now cannot show you something unfamiliar. Instead, it all has to be the familiar taken to some extreme.Yes, it was a goose at the time. But Star Wars killed the greater possibilities of science fiction.

Cloud Atlas," Arson
","Were I to worry about our future, it would be less about all the horrors that await than our ability to reason about them. There is a rather short tether between this and wonder about what we are doing to long form narrative. My own story about who we are and where we came from rides on the back of long, complex multidimensional stories. It isn't language so much that drives evolution but what wonders we build with it. In my life I have witnessed our expected length of concept shrink from hours to minutes or even seconds. I blamed TeeVee, then internet trends.So when I see a film constructed like this, my first suspicion is that the writers and viewers have entered into a pact: short episodes, high visual richness with an engaging, somewhat amusing hunt to find the celebrity behind the makeup. This would be a pact built on laziness and worlds too simple to live in: good guy, bad guy, savior. It would be a pact that allows us to use the length of sitting to convince ourselves that we understand stories like the grownups do. This is my first thought coming in and it puts me on guard.And this is in spite of the presence of Tom Tykwer, who made 'Heaven,' one of the most inferentially complex long form constructions I know. Here he directs three 15 minute films. Two are trivial. The 1936 era story is in fact structured after the fashion of Kieslowski, and could easily have served to make the rest matter if they had similar anchors in the world, anchors of unknown loss. God I wish he had written the whole thing.The 2012 story is pretty darn good, too. Not because of what it contributes, which is just comic relief, but in the way it is told through references to other films. Included is the very cool notion that the film we see is the source of another, written by the guy within both. (We see a bit of this film in a later episode, shoehorned into the plot.)These are just two out of six. The last two chronologically overwhelm the rest with childish simplicity, and manic emphasis. So it lacks many of the things that matter to me when I come to a film for sustenance. But holy cow the art of how they are edited together is astonishing. Often I have some inside information about the process, but I have been working other things recently. So I just do not know whether the director-writers knew what they were doing ahead of time or some internal genius sorted it out.

Thirteen Days," Nexus of a Whole Generation
","Spoilers herein.Usually I'm in the game for the filmmaking -- the Ollie Stone stuff if you will -- and get upset when the film relies wholly on script and acting. Plus, Costner annoys the heck out of me. But this film really works because it is relentless and because, well because it effectively captures an event which changed the world. I truly believe that no other two week period in the past half century has had as much societal effect.I was in 10th grade in the Norfolk Virginia area during this period. Our high school and homes were opened to the navy dependents evacuated from Gitmo. Their dads and ours were the eyeballs and fists employed in this enterprise. We were certain we would all die. We traveled with money and medical records sewn into our clothes in the event that we were instantly orphaned and survived in some horrible state.So much came out of what was distilled in this event. The hippy movement, both the peace part and the reckless drug part. The U2s flew out of `Area 51' and the military's obfuscating cover stories deliberately spawned a UFO culture that is still with us. So odd: a militarily manufactured counterculture.The strong desire to hit the Soviets was pushed back (twice!) by Kennedy's levelheadedness. But the military was later able to flummox Johnson into Vietnam. Lemay had been pushing a first strike for 14 years by then and had actually arranged to steal bombs from Sandia in 1950. That is why today the weapons are under Department of Energy control, supposed civilians.
The point is that the story is so central to our modern existence as people that it has a rich mine to exploit -- and it does, so very effectively. Watching this, one wonders first how we could have lost these two. And more to the point, how we could produce our current President Gomer. How do you think he will deal with situations like this? That was the real fear this film created, zooming in from the past.An aside: the props and weapons are carefully researched, as was the inclusion of young Lawford whose dad pimped Marilyn to Jack as a reward.",Null,11,14,26 January 2001
300," One-Eyed Reporter
","The title refers to 'the good friend' character who gives a memorial speech at the end, presenting the legacy that grows to fantastic proportions on its way to us as narrator whose words are from another planet. Presumably you as a viewer will make the association I did the with the demigods of Olympus, so artificial and childlike are the notions this narrator presents. They are so simple and extreme, these notions of how the world is abstracted through one eye..It allows us to take a very few indicators and suppose a world. Deliberate deprivation of young boys is supposed to somehow instill valor. Flying blood droplets is supposed to somehow validate combat expertise. Tactical stubbornness leading to defeat is somehow celebrated, I suppose, coming very close to the 72 virgins bit. Yes, indeed, sometimes this slipped for me into the opposite of what it was intended to purify. The elixir of admiration for the west snapped to Zoroastrian soma more often than not.That's because the history is that the Persians (the Achaemenids were actually Medes, more like Afghans are today) were the great world-builders of the era, creating less a totalitarian state than a federation of free states that flourished by trade not terror. And the Spartans were the thugs, the warlords who oppressed and terrorized their neighbors, building a state based on pillaged wealth. Even the Nazi association is reversed, the Medes were the Aryans, the Spartans essentially African, and no longer extant in today's Greece.(Later, the Alexandran Macedonians, the Greeks of today, destroyed the by then corrupt and fragile Persian empire and all its great libraries and histories, torturing the collected scientists to death, in what has to have been the greatest and most brutal setbacks of civilization ever.) So the resonances with today keep oscillating in a strange and stimulating dance between the intended admiration of these thugs we are meant to feel as the west, and those of Islam. But that 'struggle' is over issues as remote from this as swimsuits are from locomotives. Let's even say vinyl padded speedos.As a movie, the thing is oddly uneven. It's tied together by a consistent score, mixed of heavy metal and aeolian voices. And it does have a story, actually two; though simple, they span the thing and stitch pieces together. But there are distinct visual styles here, too many to integrate. I felt actually as if I were defending myself from some of them as they came at me just as the different components of the Persian army attacked the 300 hooting bodybuilders. Its inevitable I suppose, when the computer work is so massive it has to be parsed out to creative teams distributed all over the world, and they have nothing better to go on than a comic book. I will admit that some of the these teams gave me great satisfaction, some of them in the actual battle scenes where the speed-shifts worked to emphasize the mapping of comic panels into reality. This, if you follow such things, was developed by Peter Weir in 'Gallipoli,' starring a then new Mel Gibson. Mel then sorta borrowed them for his own battle epic, including the early scene where he lops off a head. Here we emphasize the flying bodies, body parts and blood which quite literally become architectural. In fact there are three distinct architectural structures here made of bodies, and many others large and small made of living men.For me the center of the thing is the early scene where the oracle is consulted. Three bits of background.  when I see this plot device early in a movie, someone with a vision (or dream or hallucination) I tend to see the rest of the movie as what's in that vision. In other words here, when this girl reports what she sees in the future, the report is the movie that follows, and that we see through her eyes. It works for me because then I can ascribe the limits of the vision I see to the character I know shaped it. one of my most valued movie experiences is a very early short film. Shucks I see my comment on it here at IMDb is deleted. (If anyone saved it, please send it to me.) Its a dancer with flowing garments that sail with her in space. Over this has been hand painted color that overlaps the boundaries of the fabric, the first spatial artificial effect in film. Its transporting, this century-old image. Its copied in many ways here with the oracle's appearance. She's a drugged young beauty, and they use this as an excuse to have her dance, with smoke, hair, skin and fabric tendrils weaving space, sex, sense, vision. The designers of this scene were used nowhere else that I could tell. Its an extraordinary bit of art. There's something inherently cinematic about redheads. All filmmakers know this. Its in many how-to shortcut books. But like other fundamentals, no matter how hackneyed it gets, it can still be effective. In a film of actors whose hair has been blacked to seem Greek (and elsewhere skin darkened to seem 'Persian'), they find an Irish girl to play the oracle. I guess she's pretty; it's hard to tell because she's less a person than the provider of hair and a nipple in a complex assembly, but there you have the redhead, first seen doing a Gilda hair introduction.I saw this in a theater with a friend and despite dangerous political twinges we got swept up in it, together with the people in the auditorium. I think there's an analogy between the brotherhood of the men we see, and the implied brotherhood of the people in the audience. It brought us closer through vision.

Kingsman: The Secret Service," Not that Kind of Tailoring
","From time to time in these comments, I remark on my surprise at how sophisticated young viewers are, and how they demand ever more complex and subtle self-referential folds. It gives me pleasure to realize that my flower children cohort were and still are largely incapable of this level of abstraction. It gives me hope for the future because introspective abstract reasoning is the central factor in reasoning about the world.Then again, from time to time, the nearly suicidal revelation appears that these kids have lost much of what we knew, learned at great cost. We knew that governments shouldn't spy and torture; that women deserve level humanity; that death is not comic. We knew that feeding stereotypes, especially those of blacks, can be fun only when we know the game. We knew this, and still do.I was patient enough with the excess until the church massacre. After all, I liked Kick-ass and Layer Cake. These had a different balance: yes, they were comic-influenced compositions of set pieces; yes they shamelessly exploited stereotypes and had unexpected nonchalant pleasure in the violence. But they placed the audience and filmmaker outside the film.Here, the opposite is emphasized. This is not Bond or Bourne. No, it is not that kind of movie we are told. It is Bauer, who would shoot the dog after abusing it.After the church scene, I felt myself tumbling into a dead future. Who would tolerate this? Who would enjoy it?",Null,6,13,24 June 2015
Ran," Noh Lear This is Noh Lear This is Noh Lear
","What a wonderfully varied medium film can be! Here we have a film that is both truly great and in a different way a clumsy mistake.By now you know that this was made by a master filmmaker at the end of his life -- in preparation for ten years and Asia's most expensive film. He intended it to be his last, his masterpiece.The Good: This work of art is a sequence of masterfully composed images. The camera remains stationary or virtually so, and each scene is richly rewarding in all the visual dimensions, including motion. The costumes are the most cinematic I have seen. There is a use of grasshopper sounds that is the best example I know of amplifying an image by sound. The frame of the picture is the landscape -- little takes place indoors, and that action always refers to some larger, exterior motion. In my experience, this is the best complement of Wells' Othello, the most masterful use of interior space I know.I give it a ten because it is a masterpiece in this area of cinematic communication, one that seems exceptionally underaddressed.The Bad: The Master attempted too much in trying to match his cinematic virtuosity by swallowing Shakespeare's Lear to produce an equally rich story. In this he fails -- so many problems here. First, Shakespeare wrote plays for a barren stage where the images grow from the mind, supported by super-rich language and interwoven visual metaphor. The scene grows from our understanding of the character and what that character says. Kurosawa tries it backwards here by placing characters is a vast scheme that came from his own mind, off-screen as it were, and it doesn't quite work.As it happens, Ran's emphasis is on grand motion. Little time is spent on character development, except with the scheming wife of the first son (a story element that has little Shakespearean counterpart). Lear is a play about demons and leaves the question open as to how many are from opportunistic devilment and which are internally generated. All this is discarded here, as well as the Gloucester counterplot. Among the great losses from the source are the continuous examinations of what sight means and what it can conceive. How fertile that would have been as dramatic scaffolding for Kurosawa's vision.There's a problem with language as well. Not knowing Japanese, I cannot judge how rich or intricate in metaphor is the film's dialogue. But the sound and dramatic utility of the speech is about as far from Shakespeare as you can get. Shakespeare uses his actors' speech to simultaneously move the dramatic action and to serve as a surrogate for the viewer's mind. Both the story and your own ruminations on the story are contained therein. This depends on a continuous, predictable assumed rythmic base which is articulated by a rich consonant based, cheating rubato. Japanese consists of staccato vowels that I suspect are overly dramatized in the short blasts we get from these characters. Could hardly be more unShakespearean. I assume there is a Noh legacy being mined here instead, which is not available to this western viewer.A side note: after seeing these battle scenes you'll never appreciate Speilberg's blatant ripoff in the first part of Sgt Ryan.",Null,37,72,21 November 2000
Cube," Group Theory
","Spoilers herein.I watch a lot of trash -- for a variety of reasons. One of them is that I am sometimes pleasantly surprised. I was blown away with the intelligence of `Ninth Gate,' for instance. I thought `Scary Movie' was a really clever goof on its viewers.This film pleasantly surprises. It is unremarkable in most of the normal respects: the cinematography and most acting is pedestrian. The directing and editing is poor. So where's the reward?The conception is brilliant. The sets are Shakespearian, with no props, essentially no costumes. In fact, essentially the whole film is in ostensibly different, but identical small rooms. It is all pure drama which hinges less on what you see, instead the situation that is created by dialog. The center of this film is built in your imagination, on incomplete fragments rattling around in there -- paranoid fragments about the nature of fate, trust and a society allied against you.What really appeals to me is how much sense this world makes. The design of the maze makes great sense; the mathematics is accessible and correct (not like `Pi' or `Omega Code'), as is the visual notion of the rooms moving. The logic of the physical space contrasts with the total ignorance about who created this situation and why. Since the cinematic vocabulary is made so clear, the angst about the outside society is made more acute.I think the basic notion works a whole lot better than, say the second `Alien' or the first `Die Hard,' both of which are basically escape movies leavened by `Ship of Fools.'This is a likely target for a remake with a better budget, a much better candidate than, say `The Professional.' Imagine if these folks had the money and creative talent of the disastrous `The Cell.' If this was remade, though, the extra money need not go into more elaborate sets. The sparceness of the sets is part of its strength. Instead, the money needs to go into script dialog, better actors (but deBoer isn't bad), a real score, and some competent cinematography. This would be a natural for a real artist.As it is, it is still worth viewing. Think of it as slightly illustrated radio. Seen this way, it is worthy of a young Welles.",Null,17,30,7 April 2001
The Thin Red Line," Wittgenstein's Red Line of Abstraction
","I met Malick in 68-69 at MIT where I was taking a degree in philosophy. MIT had the decade before gone through a soul-searching re-evaluation of the type of scientist it was producing, and concluded that they could do much better in working toward well-rounded citizens. So by the end of the 60's they had collected - for a few years only - perhaps the strongest collection of newly emergent thinkers in the humanities. And it was quite a rich stew of ideas for a young person, the most exciting place in the world for the humanities for perhaps five years.Malick came in with this pack, concerned with newly emerging ideas about meaning and language. The philosophy establishment was forming a new split (US and Continentals) largely characterized by how to reinvent Wittgenstein's insights but with a more friendly rationale. Chomsky was shaking one world, formal abstraction for computers another. Exciting --- moreso than today. But Malick was not a verbal communicator, nor a logician, nor an academic (all sides of the same thing). So he dove into practical visual semiotics.He is not a brilliant man, merely a journalist. But he does seem to be particularly honest and understands some damned good, solid, human ideas compared to other filmmakers. One can really see this early MIT exposure in 'Red Line.'We can thankfully forget plot -- there is not meant to be any story. In fact, the war is only used here as a canvas of motion, abstractions of 'regular' life, colliding and sometimes adhering to souls, sometimes destroying them. The device is to build the film around the sounds: narrative voiceovers (current and remembered), natural sounds, haunting music. The images are attached to the sounds, which are derived from abstractions. This is exactly the reverse of Spielberg, which is why there cannot be any comparison to 'Private Ryan,' or any other film that is 'about' something. It is why Malick can never 'explain' his films.The execution is hypnotic. I wonder what the six-hour version is like. The editing (and particularly of the sound) is unusual, so transports us beyond the strangeness of tropics, war, history. That editing is much like Van Morrison's music: it establishes the rhythm only as a reference to dance around, peeking in and out. The relationship of the rhythm within the shots to the rhythm of the shots is very bluesy.Having no story opens new possibilities and creates unfamiliar problems. An opportunity is that the film can have many centers: the meditator in the midst of the attack on the camp; the squabble of the villagers; the transport of the ship; the need to look at our own dogtags. The challenge is how to end. When you stick to a formula like Spielberg, you just turn the crank and the climax lifts and comes down, and the story finishes. No story, no formula, so Malick brackets with the transport to and from the island, by the aging of the southern rookie, and by the exit from and re-entry to a world of unfamiliar characters. That they are played by familiar actors (Travolta, Clooney) oddly emphasizes the point.It must have been educational to work on this film, which is why every intelligent actor (or an actor with an intelligent agent) wanted to participate: one can see direct influence in Penn's 'The Pledge' and Cusack's 'High Fidelity,' both highly abstract.Penn knew exactly what he was doing here. He moves in the action, as an actor must. But he places his character offscreen in the abstract voiceovers. That's the 'real' Welsh, and the film's image only an abstraction. He truly understands presenting many dimensions simultaneously. Harrelson doesn't, but that's the point with Keck. I wonder why Depp didn't make the cut?",Null,35,58,16 March 2001

The Great Escape," We Choose the Cooler
","Spoilers herein.Films are like people in the respect that some are leaders but most followers. That's because most movies are not about life, but about previous movies. This film established not only a genre (I chose to resee it after `Chicken Run') but played a role in inventing a society. I'm of the belief that culture invents some art that in turn reinvents the culture. More about that in a minute.What's so special about this is that it places the American rebel (with his motorcycle) in mainstream American society. Before, the beatnik or `bohemian' was unamerican, nonmainstream. This film invents memories of the war for the generation after the war -- it takes an essentially British story and uses it as background to establish a new vision of the American rebel. This rebel is centrally American, heroic even. Independent of sex.There are four forces in this film. The evil Gestapo (with the majority of Germans, but the film glosses that); the two forces of the British and German Air Force stuck in a duel of gallantry from a prior generation; and then the McQueen force. All at once, we have the cockiness and independence of Brando and Dean transformed into a patriotic center, into something directed, seemingly casually, against intrinsic evil.I saw an advance screening of this in most peculiar circumstances. I was a cadet in a midwestern military academy whose commandant was the senior American officer at the POW camp during the planning of the escape. (Americans were moved shortly before, and the reason is an interesting story in itself.) We 850 mostly sons of republicans mostly hawks, all white were given a vision of necessary disturbance, of a strange patriot that we couldn't internalize. Only a couple months later JFK was murdered. The Cooler King was one key image we used with our brethren nationwide to reinvent ourselves. Check it out. This contributed to a national identity that actually lived for a while. Never plan to win, just make your own statement.Attenborough knows something about manipulating the British image for American consumption. His `Ghandi' is a masterpiece of posture. Talent. Sturges' camera is quiet, still, non-modern, so that you lose awareness that this is a film. This stance is dated -- wouldn't work today, and makes things feel as of a different era. Attenborough's camera sweeps (see his short episode -- the Indian sequence -- in `Close Encounters.') Attenborough's acting style here (indeed his role too) mirrors that. It is a fulcrum of everything, a subliminal sweep under Sturges' stillness.Check out the score by Bernstein. If you take out just a little of the march tempo, you have Williams' copy for Indiana Jones. Indy echoed the tone for a by that time narcissistic notion of rebellion: mystical forces of evil accommodated by selfish acquisition and pathetic self-deprecation -- the Reagan American. Williams intended to quote Bernstein  to make this point, I think.If you haven't seen it yet, look for the Cooler guard. His hesitation at the end is priceless, indicating that every soul is malleable. It is why the film wasn't made for eight years, bombed when it came out, but is now in the IMDB top 100.",Null,16,24,23 February 2001
Pineapple Express," Funny Names
","I can't keep track of who leads what trends in humor. It is too centered on the notion of celebrity for me, and has the negative of separating humor from who provides it. If I focus on Apatow or whoever, I drift from what matters.Laughter has to be the most puzzling dimension of being human, the most human and the strangest. Almost everything else, you can both experience and talk about, but humor has to simply be experienced. Other than notions of small surprise, one can't did much deeper. I found this very funny. In terms laughing out loud it ranks the highest in recent memory. The spine is ordinary, and I believe that is necessary: it is a buddy movie — a guy thing. The story is ordinary: chased by determined bad guys because of 'what they know.' The advertisement of the kind of humor to expect is also familiar: stoner humor, dumb guys. Other ordinary stereotypes are distributed throughout. Because we know these things so well, there is a ready warehouse of concepts to be easily pulled up as props for jokes.I think the humor has nothing at all to do with any of these things though. In fact, I'll say that none of the appeal in other dimensions does either. Its all in the writing. The writers could depend on the formula to move the thing from beginning to end and simply focus on the small — chunks of about two or three minutes. If all you have to worry about is being funny; if you are a talented writer who doesn't have to worry about whether the garment will serve a lifetime, you can focus on each button. Watching this a second time, one can see the texture in the words. This is like early Woody Allen where it would have been just as funny as a book, or a radio show. Its the words. Its the structure of the phrases. Its the pattern of knots in each phrase, one after another.Consider even the name of the thing. The name is applied to a gourmet pot with care. The chief dope dealer has as his only skill the ability to name the different brands. The consumers (our buddies) talk about the ancestry of the name in a this-begat-that way, of multiple inheritance and reference. See, I've already exceeded the threshold of useful talking about why things are funny. So let's back up: this is stoner movie with no boobs, no sex at all. The only woman in the thing is loved because she 'talks funny.'See it. Good, tight writing, all of it locally scoped.Oh, there is one structural element. It starts with a preface, a historical piece: Army experiments with pot. This actually happened. Inspired by legends of hashish creating effective 'assassins' military leaders thought doped up GIs would become killing machines. A Sgt Rock type general is disgusted by the results and has the experiments closed down. The location is a secret underground laboratory accessible by a disguised hatch in a field.This same location features in the main story. It is now an underground lab where new strains of pot are developed and grown.

Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," The Real Play
","Spoilers herein.Putting together a project like this requires attention to four elements:Situation (aka: story and mythology), Characters (usually focused on acting), Atmosphere,  and Self-reference.150 comments here deal with the first two; whether the story had drive and power (probably okay), whether the situation was readable and compelling (probably okay), and whether the actors connected (probably yes for Dunst and Pitt). So let's focus on the other two which are by far the more important, harder to deliver and incidentally overlooked in nearly all comments so far.The `atmosphere' is partly a matter of style, but more a matter of how consistent is that style and how effectively communicated. It is more than creating lush sets, instead encompasses the whole ability of the artist to transport us to another world. I'm particularly sensitive to being hypnotized by competent transporters. Didn't work here -- a matter of failure to understand the space. Everything in the environment was a thing, not an element of the environment.The other element, `selfreference' is much more interesting here, and that is because the books handle it so well. In fact it is the only thing that discriminates Anne Rice from thousands of other hacks, her cleverness with narrative. As an ordinary matter of craft, the writer often uses framing devices to establish the character of the narration. In an ordinary movie, the surrogate narrator will appear at the beginning, to settle the tone. Some clever relationship is expected between the character as narrator and as a participant in the story. And that's apparently how this starts.Another framing device, also very common, is to place a play (or equivalent) within the play. Again, some clever relationship between the small play, the larger play and often the even larger `real world' is expected. And this is done too, seemingly according to formula. (Later Lestat becomes a professional performer.)But see what has been done as a sly trick. Rice's stance is to play with the non-humanity versus humanity of the characters. These framing devices almost always expose the `within' as richer than what what we see, and what she has done is turn them on their head: the `within' in each of these cases is less, not more. This sort of narrative trick is to be expected from someone exposed to the Berkeley/San Francisco writer's club. It's not great art, but it is clever and it allows her -- in the books -- to manipulate the atmosphere. It turns irony on its head. The `story' in each case is real where we expect it to be fake. For instance, the Paris drama is presumed by the audience to be fake, but so real a trick it seems real. But the trick is that it IS real.Rice gets this right in the books. But the hapless director here has no clue at all. Cruise neither. And this is why they couldn't get the atmosphere or humor right. They are using the formulas the regular way instead of upside down. The comedy is not supposed to be in laughing at Cruise dancing with a corpse, but laughing at ourselves for not laughing at Cruise.Pitt has made a career working with just this effect, so he tunes into a channel on a radio no one else in the movie knows is there, and delivers. No one except perhaps Miss Dunst. She has little intelligence, but she seems to be a very, very good listener and it must have been Pitt talking. My gold standard right now for child performances is the few seconds of a six year old Alicia Witt in Lynch's `Dune.' That is barbed into my outer mind. Dunst here comes close in some moments: `I want some more.' But at other times seems driven by the director to be just melodramatic.",Null,4,8,16 May 2002

I thought it was liberated, sacrilegious, self-referential, anarchic, all the things we liked.Seeing it now, only a few parts are funny. I suspect they are all written by Cleese: the bit about swallows and coconuts, the two episodes with the French guard, and the skit concerning anarchy. These are precious.The rest is getting worse with each passing day. The problem is that so much of their humor depended on being outrageously, either with the unexpected or the taboo.

Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The Son
","The SonI am convinced that movies are about other movies more than life. The original 'Star Wars' was a success in my opinion because it had three things:  a collection of images from other films, distinctly referencing them. Some were film- schoolish like the Kurosawa quotes. But most were like what Kurosawa himself referenced: already deeply embedded visual touchstones, not having lost their power in becoming clichés. These were collected in one large form, the Flash Gordan form let's call it, which all of us slightly knew. It could be recalled with enough familiarity to register but not enough to set expectations, so Lucas could fill the bucket with whatever he found and liked. a notion of a complete, understandable cosmology. Its the noir notion that laws of the universe exist and cannot be seen, and if they could they wouldn't be comprehensible. This notion is deep in film, so deep that when a movie comes along that posits a cosmology that is whole, and revealable, it shocks. What that movie did was give us enough of a glimpse into this to believe that we could understand the world, at least THIS world of the 'galaxy far away.' Remember when that original came out? The images were impressible, but what people talked about wasn't what they saw, but about how the world worked. It settled first in an ersatz religion among geeky kids and now has been swallowed by the 'simple' US religions, and its presidential representative. the notion of a quest. Its an old form, but cast in the above noted situation, it takes new power. The traditional form, the Goethe-Lytton form was there to remind and reveal mysteries. Here it is clearer, to explain. There was a lowbrow professor at the time of a women's college that a TeeVee interviewer made popular. It was sort of a metaquest. This simple man said that we could actually understand the nature of trying to understand nature. It was a lucky break for Lucas, because it meshed with this shocking notion of a grand cosmology that we know our hero (check out the name: 'sky walker') will grasp, master and show us.That was the first film. A huge success, just huge. It did change many things, but from my perspective the key thing was how it reset that great American invention of noir, as important as jazz, and liberty which form a sort of trilogy of contradictory, three-way tension.Okay. Now the second big Ted idea, the necessity for the equal size of steps in abstraction when you have two steps. It seems this is hardwired in the brain, a sort of human quantum mechanics. If you look back along the abstraction, say a cartoon in a cartoon, the distance between the two will be precisely the same as the surrounding cartoon.So, when they made the second Star Wars movie, they could reference the previous one in the way that it referenced its cinematic background. It had a writer in Kasden who knew how to do this. And it had a director in Lucas' film school teacher who did also. Neither had a huge hit other than this because it was such a cool setup, having such a thing to build on.You'll read lots about trying to humanize, and how faces were used. But all that is simply in the service of abstracting closer to us from the original, in equal portion. This is the son. Why did the franchise fail after this? Because there was no step left to abstract to and maintain the brand.(This comment is a replacement of one deleted for unknown reasons.

There seem to be parallel contradictory histories about whether he was extemporizing or not. It hardly matters. He has narrative energy that at the time was unmatched. It's faded now.And the third thing? Well, this third thing has increased tremendously since 9-11. I saw this with 'Man on Wire.'Disney is the absolute expert at character design, so long as the characters are women. For some reason, male characters are not as rich and mineable. This project was the result of them building a map of female characteristics and structuring projects around them. Why this is so novel is that it is likely the last American film to have an Arab beauty in my lifetime. Now that Arabs are politically demonized by the bushies, it becomes impossible to treat these women as human and therefore appealing.Here we have a snapshot from the era before that became impossible. Of course, at the time it was essentially and insulting stereotype: exotic, superflat belly dancer tummy and 'orientally' kinetic real end. There actually was at the time a Disney real end specialist. I met her.Now this is translated into forbidden fantasyland.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,7,13,20 January 2009
Sin City," Nice Coat you Have There, Mr Miller
","I feel sorry for those familiar with the graphic novels from whence the stories and framing come. They are likely to take Rodriguez at his word that this is merely a 'translation.' I suppose you can believe that and that alone and still enjoy this.But I am much luckier in that I can take this on its merits as a film, with decisions that are made because it is a film. After all, much of the art here is the selection of just which stories are used, how they are woven together and what the rhythm of the thing is. None of that came from Miller.For background, you need to know that one of the three great inventions of cinema is the notion of noir, that particular framing of narrative where the very act of watching creates a cosmology that neither belongs to the world of the watcher, nor the characters but which tortures both by arranging coincidences. All these coincidences include the coincidence that you the viewer happen to be there together with the narrator. The act of watching transmutes the vision into something you'd see, in well... a comic book.In this case we have noir become cinema, become the genre of 'graphic novel' become a specific movie that in its collage is neonoir.That collage is three stories in a wrapper: Willis is a convict, framed by Senator Roark protecting his son, who protects a stripper; Rourke (the actor) is a convict, framed by Cardinal Roark protecting his adopted son, who gets revenge for the death of a prostitute (and is protecting other prostitutes); Owen is a convict targeted by Roark, protecting a whole society of prostitutes. Each has a hospital stay.These stories cross at several points as if they were independent threads in the same city. But wait. In neonoir, we have folds that the noir of the forties didn't have. That means that to some extent these stories all collapse into one. And yes, all three main characters (not counting the salesman who is our surrogate) hallucinate to such an extent that they could be imagining their situation into the other story.In other words, each of the three stories contains a 'dream sequence' which is the others, each within themselves, and all within the bar. The wrapper is the salesman who seduces us, selling us one thing and slyly slipping in another.It must be hell to be a filmmaker with a flood of ideas, the digital means to make many of them happen and have no story to animate. Miller's stuff is just an excuse  a passable one  for the real artistry here. If Rodriguez makes three of these (as we expect), let's hope he tinkers with the idea as much as he did with the spy kids and desperado notions.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,26,46,12 April 2005
Gangs of New York," The Well Situated Eye
","Spoilers herein.Scorsese is competent enough at what he does, But since `Taxi Driver,' that hasn't been worth watching until now.The world of film is rife with gangs battling for the soul of the viewer. One of those gangs is led by the `old' Scorsese -- it rallies under the banner of character-driven storytelling. He finds a story with characters of excess, and peoples them with actors of excess. The story spins not from the people or situation, but from the excess itself. This is not native to cinema, it is an immigrant trend, imported into the world of film. All the devices of cinema are subservient to the characters. The camera literally is attached to the (usually) men. that's the old Scorsese gang. Spielberg runs a similar gang.Opposed are a collection of gangs that build films first from cinematic vision, then enfold story and characters -- the different visions and enfolding techniques differentiate these gangs, but they all hate the interlopers from literature who do illustrated books. These gangs are native to film, and include dePalma, Tarkovsky, Welles, Kurosawa, Kubrick.
But with this film our man Martin enters the world of cinema first before doing anything else and effects a conversion. It is his first film since `Taxi Driver' to assign the camera to the situation instead of the character. In this film, the star is the  tone and feel of the place, and the forces surrounding that place: the characters are third in the hierarchy. It is a masterful and welcome switch of allegiance.Oh, we have a story, the ordinary insipid stuff about a girl and bruised suitors, about political power, about revenge. And we have at least one actor who knows how to control and channel excess (now that Deniro is retired from real acting). It is what everyone will talk about, but none of that really matters. What matters is Scorsese's new eye.This camera understands the situation while creating it. In the past, his camera has been attached to the man. Here, it is attached to the space instead: most spectacularly the caves under the brewery and in the five points intersection. The eye creates the situation first -- cinematically -- in which the characters move. The fights here, both at the beginning and end, really make the `Lord of The Rings' work seems ordinary if large. That's because longtime editor Schoonmaker has had a similar epiphany and assembles the shots around a scene and not a face. She got her start with `Finnegans Wake' (IMDB has it incorrectly listed with an apostrophe) and here she returns to those roots.Scorsese is no longer the leader of a gang, but a member of the ones that matter, situated.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.",Null,18,27,23 December 2002

Parts of `Mission Impossible 2' were very nice. Parts of `Face Off' were visually exciting, even with the two clumsy actors involved. One of those is back again, annoying as ever. But I just ignore the actors and story. After all, dePalma made one of the best camera-centric movies of all time with Cage in `Snake Eyes.'But I searched in vain for anything to like. You already know the story is vapid and the acting childish. But where is the vision? All the attention seems to have gone into coordinating the fireballs and body parts.

Some of the battles are so unbelievable they grate.But it has a beautiful woman, beautiful scenery, then-novel grittiness, and likeable star, The scots have an appealing attitude, transformed for modern tastes. It is photographed competently and edited expertly. All of its art resides in the Peter Weir tradition of multiple speeds of the camera superimposed on multiple paces in the edits.

But on seeing this a third time, one notices how thin this scaffold is.But I suppose it is much better to have a visual awareness and some character in the images than not.

","I ask you to watch 'Birth of a Nation,' folks. By many measures it is the most successful movie of all time, seen by the greatest percentage of the population. Bigger, yes than 'Star Wars' or 'Gone With the Wind.'If you don't know it, it is reprehensibly racist. We can see this today, but essentially no one did when it was new. Now I ask you, what will our grandchildren consider racist that we blindly accept today?My guess is stories like this.Jackson plays a well meaning man, with the affect of nobility you find in intense, well- meaning, stupid people have. Sure, he talks about 'getting ahead' and the value of an education. But when the movie needs tension and movement, the thing revolves around the ordinary sports movie core: determination leads to winning.Two things will seem offensive in the future. The first is obvious: black boys as incapable of even thinking, only playing and having to be forced into 'studying' by the reward of just being on the court in a place of honor. It is new generation racism. Obvious, and we won't have to wait for my grandchildren for that one to be reviled.But the other. The other is that apart from race that sports has something to do with the life of the mind. That discipline and focus and determination, even sacrifice in the one gives you 'life lessons' that apply in the other. This will take longer because each movie that uses it encourages you to not think, and not thinking means you don't think about the thing that just instructed you to not think.And it will take some time because sports is theater (and little less) and these kinds of movies are theater and they will support each other against our better interests.The curious things about movies.

Moon," I Me Mine
","Movies like this, ones that have open seams, are made for me.This happens to me a lot. This is a story with no intended ambiguities. A solitary man on the moon discovers he is an expendable clone, discovering then conspiring with one of his siblings. There is some plotting and a successful escape. We discover things slowly as our hero does, knowing only what he does. It is not complicated.But. But, the thing starts with dreams, and visions brought on by a three year weary solitude. There is a companion supercomputer voiced by (this time the aptly named) Kevin Spacey. We have some hints that we can enter 'his' mind as well. There are three solid plot seams where we could be entering an imagined or artificial world of the clone's and two seams where we might similarly be entering the computer's. None of these contradict, and we could easily be watching a ping pong match (one is shown) where alternative universes driven by urges are buffeted by different consciousnesses. I do believe that strong stories have these seams, even though the writer expects few people to nuzzle into them. That some do, that I do, possibly adds to the richness for the average viewer, knowing that there is danger outside of the station.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,5,11,14 April 2010
True Romance," Manikin Sex
","Spoilers herein.Excess is part of the fabric of film. In some cases, the excess is part of a strategy to enrich the film, as in `The Good Thief' and `Moulin Rouge.' Sometimes it is a strategy to simplify to dullness and just press through with the sensory overload. Rock music has this division as well.Many moviegoers don't seem to know the difference, especially when the simple-minded excess is artificially flavored, as we have here. Tarantino's basic approach is flavored mere noise. The noise is to take character stereotypes and make them as extremely stereotypical as they can be, way past outrageous. The flavor is to do this in a way that is distinctly self-referentially ironic. That way, the audience `participates' believing themselves to be in on a celebration of excess in film through excess itself.It seems to work, since the audience doesn't seem to need much: here a salute to comicbooks and dope. It is a simple pleasure and painless we are told, so lay back. But with so many intelligent uses of a similar device (see `Ghost Dog'). Do we really need Quentin?

Happy Feet," Mad Maximum Motion
","You can parse this into three bits I think.The first is what people normally see, the story. Miller and many of the Oz New Wave don't pay much attention to this. They put something there of course, otherwise we would get distracted. Here it is an amazingly clever fold, referencing another movie 'Flight of the Penguins.' Now as it happens, I really disliked that movie. It was cast as a documentary, but was really an exercise in making these animals 'human.' Its a bit disgusting and something of the ultimate in human-centrism. We turn these birds into performers for us.Miller grabs this and turns it on itself. The story has penguins in crisis because of human- caused environmental damage. They are saved because we think them cute. Literally at the end, we have the makers of that earlier film arriving at the end and capturing their cute human mannerisms. Our environmentalist urges are largely just refactored racial superiority.If we just had that one component this would be worthwhile, but he goes a step further by making these birds yet more human in the way they perform for us. Like a million Judy Garlands on speed, they get their whole identity from performance. This provides an opportunity for a narrative complication: the priests of one performance religion holding against another. Its a pretty sweet and intelligent notion.We literally have humans as birds. We have the voices as usual. By an accident of technology, we accept this readily. The relatively new idea is the motion. Cinematic grammar is primarily about motion, presence and absence of light, motion and environment.Miller's cool idea has us working with novel motion in two ways.The first is in motion of the objects. We see birds, but they move as humans. Its all human motion, both in normal and performance mode. We used to call this rotoscoping and it involved tracing a film. Now we do it with digital rigging and captured kinematics, but it is the same idea we had with Betty Boop's dreamfolk whose movements are Cab Calloway's. Its nice enough for us to fall into the trap Miller sets up because we like these performances.The second is the motion of the camera. 2003's 'Finding Nemo' was a major step forward in how the camera dances. That obviously was the inspiration for this not only in the even more radical camera sweeps but how they tighten for the underwater chase scenes.I wish he had decided to innovate instead of exploit. But still, with all this focus, on watching and dancing, its a rare treat.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,2,3,14 February 2009
Her," Wild Things
","One recipe for a whole narrative is to create a world, a character and a situation, each affecting the others while containing them. It is a hard, hard thing to do cinematically, but look at what has been done here.The world is conveyed by our character passing through it. It is a future world: many things are familiar, some have evolved. Everyone seems prosperous enough to enjoy cinematic environments. Some few technologies have advanced, but none in food, medicine, transportation, not even restaurant service — only those that pertain to the focused world, character and situation. Nothing is explained. Nothing is shown in the ordinary way; Theodore simply passes through spaces. Some of my readers will compare this to Lost in Translation in the oblique way the world is defined. But in that film, the world has agency in the story. Here it is simply a container within which things move. It is a risky thing to do.The character is one we know. We've seen him/her before and we've lived it. But things are drawn more sharply than usual. We know, for instance, that this is a man so capable of deep love that he sells expressions of it to others to use in their supposedly barren lives. We learn early that he is emotionally damaged. Where the 'passing through' vocabulary really pays off for Spike is in the many flashbacks where we see him passing through the world of his estranged wife. It is softer than his strolls outside, but the same vocabulary. By this means, we get both the yearning and the shallowness of connection.The situation we are walked through is wonderfully conceived. He makes his living by verbally pouring emotion into his computer. Soon we enter the situation with his computer doing the same to him. The three agents in this story (world, situation, Theodore) contain, support and generate each other in a way that requires the gentle sci-fi tone here. We have no distractions. No external stories whatever. We don't know about wars or governance for instance. We don't even know about commerce. We do have an external viewer, a wonderfully warm but fragile Amy Adams. Gosh, she is a good actress.All this is as near perfect a construction as I can imagine, and we enter it smoothly. The big surprise for me was how this developed. Nearly every rule in cinematic romance is broken. It does end tragically, but gently so. Our character and his observer are transformed, and so we assume is the world at large in a 2001- mapped-onto-Melancholia-epiphany sort of way.I would like to be able to trust my life with this filmmaker, as I do a few others. I would like to treat him with the open heart that he has drawn here, diving unreservedly into an enclosing narrative. I trust his seductive strokes explicitly. I get great pleasure from the way he economically layers narrative. But he has his own needs as a human and he will disappoint me.For instance, Jones decided not to direct the astonishingly rich Synecdoche after preparing it. Instead he made 'Where the Wild Things Are.' Though it had some charms, I felt betrayed. It served his personal need to work with Sendak before he died. My best loves in film are like this, where the seduction is inescapable and dangerous, but the relationship remains slippery because the artist is more human than being human requires.",Null,4,5,9 October 2014
Slumdog Millionaire," Slum Dogma
","Bless us all, Danny Boyle is in his prime. His 'Sunshine' was lifeatleringly effective for me. He does things with a camera that are new, effective. He does better than others in providing a story foundation that fits the cinematic effects. He's visually clever. Its all more than enough for me.Here, he appeases audiences too much for my taste in building a happy ending that has you walking out actually believing that you have seen a happy romance, worthy of Bollywood dance fantasy. This, I suppose is his answer to those who were confused by 'Sunshine's failure to support a common genre. Alas, a shame.But the cinematic bits are more than enough. Quite apart from the romance, what we have here is a (unique I think) synthesis of the film (here a TeeVee show) within that affects the film without plus a similar device of memory within. Here it is both a recall and a storytelling. The earlier in life we go, the more hectic and jagged the visions. It starts with one of the three 'City of God' types of choppy editing and slowly bleeds into a normally paced picture. But that 'City of God' stuff was mostly just in camera motion, and intended to contrast with the other two 'personalities.'Here it is in the camera, in the movement of the actors and deeply in the editing. Its integrated and cinematic. Its brilliant. I think that is because of the way Boyle has digested the results of Dogma 95. There was a lot of pretentious stuff in that manifesto, but its core and ultimately its effect has been the opposite of the intended. The capture of the natural to be true has to involve intrusive craft, not lack of craft. Boyle, without notice has picked up Dogma graduates for his crew, more this time than usual.The beginning of this film is true, powerful, full of life, energy. It is real. As it progresses and our hero enters and is accepted into TeeVee land it becomes more romantic and unreal, more like a Bollywood romance. It is more powerful than any from Bollywood because we assume it to be real from the beginning. Clever.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,10,16,2 February 2009
Mad Max: Fury Road," Some Dusty Pig
","The first Mad Max had a few strong attractions. It was overtly Australian in a few dimensions which hit a niche of the familiar exotic. It was pure science fiction in that it abstracted our world into a future where only the tiniest fragment of what we know was carried over and amplified. That fragment revolved around one of our most peculiar social constructions, the wild motorcycle gang. It is peculiar in being largely a cinematic invention. (Paris being romantic is another.)The notion of a motorcycle gang originated in California after WWII where returning GIs (mostly tattooed navy men who had served in the South Pacific) bought surplus army motorcycles. The notion of lawlessness unique to motorcycles is from Marlon Brando as copied by Sonny Barger. It is a wholly cinematic convention made real, like movie gangster talk as adopted by the Mafia. Mad Max joined this to an equally unique cinematic convention: the chase. Now this. After decades, it is still the most pure of science fiction abstractions. It is still overly Australian, more about that in a moment. It still takes the chase very seriously. But it now employs a reverse irony on the motorcycle gang trope, moving it into Fast and Furious car territory, merged with comic heavy metal and pushed into humor. The trick with these is to exaggerate enough to make us laugh but not so much that we don't engage with it in its terms. Among the Australian notions is a new one: architectural dust. Most of the stunts were practical, but all of the environments were artificial. This is the first time I know that a big film used the same effects shop (Melbourne-based Iloura) for both composites (the deserts and cliffs) and dust. Different technologies are required, but a similar notion of texture was used, and the two are combined in the dust storm near the beginning. The result is an astonishing effect of surface become air. The cinematographer seems to have been aboard in the way he overexposes and undersaturates, especially during the 'night' scenes. I don't know of any other film save Derzu Uzala that attempts this, and all Kurosawa had was snow.I hope other Australian productions adopt this technique, as it seems both very advanced cinematically and wholly Australian. When Michael Jackson advanced the art of using a spatial camera, we did see that become common very quickly, first through Hollywood's use of WETA, and then other shops.And we did see the world quickly copy the motorcycle gang trope.",Null,9,16,24 June 2015
The Breakfast Club," Library of Fools
","Spoilers herein.I don't know the family tree of this genre: unlikely characters are confined together, they reveal themselves and (usually) superficially are transformed. Here, we have kids in a movie for kids. The genre is particularly straightforward and easy to read, so it is particularly apt for the target.My own theory is that High Schoolers have seven archetypes to choose from for each sex. Here we have the five-choice-total theory convincingly argued, through they toned down the sexpot significantly. That severely dates this, no teen film today would assume the popular princess to be a virgin.I suppose some people will enjoy this, considering it sweet or cute. My own interest is in these archetypes, particularly the redhead. Sheedy was originally cast to play the princess I understand and at the last minute Hughes fired a girl, shifted Sheedy and inserted Molly. Hughes had already worked with her: she was in the middle of something of an intelligent career, playing (before this) the Miranda in a loose adaptation of The Tempest and (afterward) the Cordelia in a truly sophisticated version of `Lear.'Why she would be featured in a Hughes-type movie is a no-brainer: she's charming. But why he would shuffle things around here for her is a braintwister. The film is about stereotypes. The film world in which this film exists is all about stereotypes. The redheaded cutie stereotype in film is all about a zany or wild or passionate independence. But here, she plays the meekest of the bunch, in fact so subservient she falls for the meatheaded braggart. Hughes didn't play this ironic casting game with the others.Julianne Moore makes a living out of exploiting both roles when she plays most of here characters: she plays the character in type and the actor in type playing the character. I think Molly does this too, in an immature way. Once Hughes tried to use her `normally,' in the next film, she walked away from a Harrison Ford-like career. Good for her. She recently did a campy take on herself in `Cut' where the joke was just this duality: the film actually becomes the evil character! At this writing, she is signed to appear in the most ambitious and intelligent film project of the decade: `Luper.'She never had a big career, but I really admire what she did at this age and her sufficient selfawareness to walk away from the numbing money roles.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 4: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",Null,12,29,13 December 2002
Gladiator," Film as Colosseum
","Regular readers of my comments note my penchant for pointing out that film is a modern medium, meaning that films -- good ones anyway -- are often largely about themselves. When the nature of this self-comment is interesting, I point it out. But I failed to do so in an earlier comment on Gladiator, so here is the remedy.Summer movies target the lowest of our sensibilities. The plots are highly simplified morality plays where good and evil are radically drawn; the form is of violent spectacle. In other words, our civilized society wants the same things we observe in later Rome, to which we insist on feeling superior.So the master Scott gives us a violent spectacle about a violent spectacle. He makes fun of us by pandering to our baser tastes while slyly getting us to agree with the wise senator who observes how simple, stupid and manipulable is the mob. He did much the same in Blade Runner, but there the comment was on the sharpness, complexity of the audience not its dullness.
Is this a maturing cynicism, an adventure into a new challenge (mastering the art of painting with a blunt palette), or a striking out against Hollywood's financial politics? I suppose we've have to wait a decade to find out -- until after the power-hungry Caesars die and the medium is returned to the enlightened leaders of the people.",Null,10,19,14 May 2000
Gladiator," The Illusionist and the Ventriloquist
","Two things about this film intrigue me: the novel integrated talents of Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe.We are creatures who depend on idea fragments in everything we do. Virtually everything is a rehash, sometimes creative but mostly not. When someone or something comes along and adds to the vocabulary, something essentially new, it is a big deal -- that's my definition of genius. Today, a major force in defining our basic vocabulary is cinema, the visual element of filmaking. But all the easy stuff has been done as we leave the first generations of the art.So when someone comes along who can conceive a world that is new and unfamiliar, and who can actually deliver the illusion of being in that world, it is notable. Scott does that here (and in Blade Runner). Kubrick did it once or maybe twice; Polanski had the skills when he had an edge, but this is exceedingly rare. Note here how little quoting Scott does of prior battle in his battle scene, how Ben Hur (and all the lesser period pieces) are not at all referenced. How new this all is. (The only concession is the annoying British accent of the Romans.)What is remarkable is that it is all visual. It is not in the writing, the effects per se, or the acting, though they are all good enough. I intend to see this film several more times for just the visual experience. I suspect that because of the coherence and advance of the visual vocabulary. this will be seen as a landmark film long after Private Ryan and Titanic become footnotes.But there is also Crowe, and there's something notable here. I don't see great acting in the normal sense, but there is something else, and this seems new to me as well. To check this, I reviewed LA Confidential and The Insider. Crowe has the ability to develop tension, a normal enough skill, but he also has the ability to project this tension into the environment of the film. Watch how the scenes flow as his acting in one scene is tossed into another; it's remarkable.When he did this in The Insider, he seems to use as his resonator the unwitting, ever-bombastic Pacino. Here, He uses the similar exaggerated scope of the story, both the setting and the violence of the context.WARNING! Spoilers follow:Both Scott and Crowe seem to know what they are doing. So they have eliminated many of the elements normally required: there is no backstory, no explanation of what went before, no comic relief, just the barest of scaffolding. But in that, it is made of huge, strong girders. In another film, we'll have revenge driven by the death of the Hero's wife. Here, she and their child are gang-raped, burned until nearly dead, then crucified. In another film, the bad guy is conventionally bad, but here we have patricide and incestual rape. In another period film, we'd have lots of street scenes (which are cheap) to convey a sense of place: not so here. Nothing not essential to the core projection and resonant backdrop are used. So instead of parading the effects (as with Titanic or Jurassic Park), they are handled casually, incidentally as background. Just a huge visual sweep through which tension is passed. It is early to know, but this could be one of the great films.",Null,13,27,7 May 2000

","Spoilers herein.How horrible to have this as a legacy.For those who don't know, Sagan was a rather weak scientist who became a popular science journalist promoting a genuine sense of wonder, and who further became a champion in battling pseudoscience and rank ignorance. He was criticized for overly simplifying, and much of that was undue. But he did cast a false battle between science and religion, and then weave this simple, preachy morality play around it.Actually, the sad truth is that most science is based on the deist notion that laws somehow pre-exist our exploration of them. Some science is pure of religion, at least the normal kind of deism, but that fascinating truth is too complex to build celebrity upon; too complex to simplify for mass consumption. So Sagan tossed it early in his career.It is actually not true that `mathematics is the only true universal language,' at least not the specific abstractions used here which are merely descriptors convenient for human brain chemistry. First order logic, the basis of the 3D projection here, is arbitrarily cast. `It makes sense if you think like a Vegan.' Later: `the message is written in the language of science.' How unknowledgeable. My point is that the science here is quite bogus (on straight scientific terms) when extrapolated this deeply.Religion IS simplification of complexity into simple oppositions for the masses. And that is precisely what Sagan is guilty of here. The conflict with religion is miscast. The story is unprofound, an empty legacy. So easy to poke fun at believers in stupid superstitions, but then what?No matter. Films are rarely true, rarely profound. But would have been better for this story not to lean too heavily on the idea that `it could happen this way.' But how about this as a film since story is mostly incidental in important films? Zemeckis annoys with other films, since he bends the cinematic vision to the trite storyline (`Gump,' `Cast Away'). But here, he really does please. Around this lacey logic, he does great visual storytelling, great framing. His camera never leaves the point of quiet observation, so is very conservative. His choreographed group shots thrill; some of his long tracking pans almost exhaust. I wonder if he does this to subliminally establish the `hereness' of living here. The colors really work to frame reality. Another framing to establish the hereness, the emphasis on surroundings: the competence of many supporting actors surpasses that of the leads.The commentaries on the DVD are much better narrative than the story.Jody's not an external actor which is a problem in a role which is supposed to be archetypical. in which we are supposed to identify. She is too angular, too sharp to represent humanity or the human mind. And she is not quirky enough to convince she has genius. If you ever met a genius or even a world class scientist, you'd sense a strangeness, an other-worldliness that is missing here. Jody's readings are comic Buckrogerisms.The best effect was the attempt at the machine: superconducting massive rings tieing gravitational knots -- would have been nice to emphasize that the rings moved apparently erratically with flashes of polygonal logic. (Should have been five not four machine rings if the docahedal pod wrapping is to make sense.)

I really enjoy films whose narrative depends on other films, ideally classics.And yet this film failed me, because of reliance on two devices that really annoy. The first is the embedded parody on 70-80's teen flicks. This is simply hackneyed by now. I could take it in 'Ghost World,' in 'Go,' even in 'Ginger Snaps.' But here it is simply a crutch with nothing new and much that is old.The other annoyance -- rather a barrier to endearment -- is the heavihanded symbolism. I gladly swallowed it in 'American Beauty,' more eagerly in 'Fight Club,' and reluctantly with 'Magnolia.' But here, it is so heavihanded only a teenager could not think it unsophisticated. And this in a film quoting Graham Greene!",Null,22,40,21 March 2002
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Panopticon Defects
","Sometimes you simply get proved wrong. I was wrong and I admit it.When I saw the first Transformers movie, I thought I was seeing something that advanced the cinematic vocabulary. The movie was still otherwise worthless, and the advance was in the service of crass goals. But an effective evolution in how we see things is a big deal. What I saw was expert editing that in the action scenes gave us just a bit less information than we needed to understand what was going on. These edits had compositional energy so that in general we got caught in the swirl of the battle, experiencing the fog of war.This, I thought was a big deal, because there is only so much you can do visually. You are delivering an entire world and interacting within that world at the same time. It should be impossible. I qualified my comment at the time by remarking that this also saves money; since you never have time to fully comprehend a special effect, they can be designed or rendered with less fidelity.The second film continued the tradition, with less freshness. This one abandons it altogether and presents itself no differently than your average Marvel bravado. It has a different editor, so that makes sense. But for the first time, the franchise has decided to enter the premium ticket market with three D and IMAX. Ticketbuyers who pay the extra moola want clear confirmation that the extra detail is worth it. So the whole enterprise has had its one redeeming value ripped out. The world we glimpsed was coming has had its transport beams destroyed.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",Null,5,11,1 January 2012
The Social Network," Ungodly
","David Fincher is competent, clean. The writer here does simple, clean, dialog-laden plots for TeeVee.They decided to go for an economical story, something that we can walk into with all sorts of questions about the world and how it is changing and come out believing we understand it.The facts are intimidating. Soon, Facebook will have a billion users. It is already the most visited site in history. As an entity, it already is on par with the the top tier tech companies: Apple and Google. But far beyond that, far, far more significant is the way that the world is changing. Until now, friendship was absolutely anchored in physical proximity. All media allowed that to be extended, but only if it were well established by actually being together.Now, this notion is being replaced by an entire generation. The compact is no longer on mutual support and emotional needs, but simply being paid attention to. Life is flattened while the numbers get larger. Shared abstract thinking is reduced to whether something is 'liked' or not. Political movements exploit this and we are getting into trouble faster than we can imagine. So we enter a theater with a film about this phenomenon with dire worries. Social networking is the successor to TeeVee as the next possible disaster in the social experiment.The filmmaker and writer decided to make a movie about this simplification of the social fabric by taking a story that is necessarily rich and human, and reduce it to a cartoon. We liked it not because the thing is well crafted, though it is. We embrace it because it explains things. In fact, it simplifies things so much that we can feel superior in knowing that we would have made a (slightly) more rich version.The story presented here is no secret: emotionally weak geek type, Jew, Harvard undergrad has trouble making friends. Each of these three stereotypes is exploited shamelessly in the service of an unambiguous narrative. This guy will do anything to make friends and elevate his social standing. But the only thing he can do is program, so he finds what he needs in a website he creates. There is a clear calculus of sacrificing real friends for virtual standing. It is not something he can do because he understands people; it is something he has to do because he doesn't.Turns out is what others need is similar so the thing takes off. Advisors, investors and lawyers surround the thing. Simple. Our hero ends up alone. The story marginalizes women as a necessity, deliberately allowing us to see them as Zuck does. More stereotypes.But what has been done here is a type of narrative fold. The subject is the flattening of the human relationship to the trivial. The movie itself is the similar flattening of the story to the trivial. It is what it shows and implicitly criticizes. We walk out 'understanding,' in that way we do after a political rally before we actually start thinking and seeing real people.In the real world, what is interesting is not what happened with a girlfriend or some jock twins. What matters is the way that connection is changing, the way we form associations and indeed what an association means and what value it gives. This is not a fad. Facebook and Twitter may fade but something profound has started, perhaps changing the very nature of what it means to invest in societies. We likely are not yet past a tipping point in government and family units, but it is likely that we are well past the tipping point in narratives. We may never get richness back as a basic value. It will be relegated to a few who form a social network.It is also interesting that Zukerberg, Dorsey, Canter, Mullenweg and Winer truly believe that what they are about amplifies life in all its dimensions. They believe they are doing good work. If this film is anything, it is evidence that the contrary is true.And Zuck isn't cool enough to be an Emacs user any more, though he seems to have a genius in the opposite direction: finding the lowest common, scalable need.(Written from the Starbucks two blocks from the original Facebook office.)Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",Null,34,54,15 October 2010
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," The Penitent Man
","I had to come back to this, because I'm puzzled.I wonder what it is about Spielberg. Its easy to criticize his mawkish sentimentality and his theatrical sweeps. But I think it is more than that. After all, we happily tolerate that and worse in some others. And it cannot be simply that we are put off by what we imagine as his riches. After all, there is at least one film in there that was deep, and a couple that were both well made and have that quality we call personal  meaning that there's some internal insight. But even those repel me; even the 'holy' ones.My working theory is that he is neither deep as a man, nor inclined to innovate in any way. He makes yesterday's pictures but with no added insight or annotation. So they appear as stupid. The story goes that Lucas understood this, either by being told or intuiting it. So he made up one of his Campbell-inspired, Kurosawa-flavored stories, talked his buddy into starring and turned the thing over to Steven. That first one ('Lost Ark') was a phenomenon. Lucas is at root a storyteller, a good one. You know, he's still filling in the Star Wars narrative. I will re-watch 'Willow' soon. There's twice as much story as is in the movie, and Lucas was careful to find other outlets to tell it. Spielberg on the other hand is someone with an interest in shots (like Scorsese). He's interested in immediate effect, in clarity. Lucas will  every time  sacrifice that for the larger continuity of story and its integration in with the larger mythical context we carry. His films  the ones he directs  are visually barbarous, even when they copy masters.Spielberg will  every time  sacrifice the power of the story for visual juice. This is the case even when the film is supposed to be grave and deep. Remember how trilling it was to 'see' the D-day landing? And how little it mattered, even to the rest of the film? And how little that film mattered.So I'm fascinated by this. The first film was mostly Lucas. Steven had done his one really good film ('Encounters') trying his darnest to be French. Then a flop, and then the first Indy film. He was simply a director hired by the then richest filmmaker in history. Then, monetary success for our Steven and the second film comes along. That one was mostly Spielberg, and ranks with his biggest disasters.Then this one. Now here we have both men playing a role. They alternate in influence, and the result is almost a film school in itself.Half of the movie is the story: father and son, greed power and goodness. Magic versus science, detective work versus adventure-driven guts. Intrigue. These are all unsophisticated in themselves, but they are basic to life. Every time we shift into this mode, the environment fades (even in the last horizon shot) and we focus on the characters.The other half of the movie is the eyewash. Now I must admit that knowing that the exterior locations are real places (excepting the fakey Austrian Castle) gives a thrill. Spielberg could not have known that this would soon matter and that anyone would be impressed by the texture of the real. But the rest is worthless. It really is. Especially disappointing is the final sequence after they enter Petra.Its all about the short view, the visual cleanliness. Its a sterility of soul, a lack of purpose. That's why I don't like the man, or anything he does.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",Null,6,14,16 August 2008
Back to the Future," Zemeckis Flies
","This year, John Hughes died, and we were reminded of the depth of his insight into subadult suspension. Being reminded of his work impressed me. What will we think when Zemeckis dies?Certainly we will be reminded of how he balanced fantasy and reality in all of his projects. Possibly it will be noted that he softened the Spielberg approach by unintuitively adding incoherence.I think I will remember two films: this one and 'Roger Rabbit.' These both are deceptively trivial. Was this the first mainstream movie that played as cleverly with time travel conundrums? It was not intended to spawn a sequel, and you can see that certain conventions were established that hurt the successors. But seen by itself, the idea of superimposing actors, characters and times in the same package works well. Makes this a gem.Notable is once again the scientist. You have only two types: pipe smoking, chin stroking blackboard thinker who explains, or what we have here. Lloyd is wildhaired, wild-eyed. A hardware guy, not an idea guy. An active risktaker, frantic in demeanor, but with apparently no sense of scope. For instance, he spends more time on a model of how to explain catching lightning than on the apparatus itself.The film revolves around his instabilities and mirrors those as instabilities in the world. It all starts when he bumps his head getting off the toilet, folded into his minute of death from jilted terrorists. Everything that follows is his wacky vision, joined by Marty when knocked out by the nuclear guitar amp.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,5,8,25 March 2010
Goodfellas," Italian Storytelling
","Spoilers herein.Competent filmmakers are rare -- there is no doubt that Scorsese is competent and should be celebrated on that score alone.But his films are empty. They take you into a gangsterland (even `Temptation,' even `Innocence') and snap along until they end and then you leave. But you leave with nothing, and I expect more from a competent filmmaker.The problem -- I speculate -- is the degree to which Scorsese is locked in the Italian tradition of storytelling and its 60's incarnation in neo-realistic films. This is a matter of performance, where the force of the story is all in the force of the storyteller. The performer here is Scorsese. His screen persona is epitomized in the Pesci character: driving, driving the group by pressing on. By speaking over others. By showing the threat of violence.There's power here. It grabs your attention like Pesci grabs that of the fellas. I can see Scorsese constantly saying to himself that he'd be nuts to live any other way. But aside from some storytelling mechanics, there are no ideas here, no ambiguities, no interesting characters, no plot maturity, no symmetries, nothing to wonder about and discuss on your way home.But we should salute some of the decisions. Scorsese chooses to frame the film as a story told by the Liotta character. (He plays an Irishman, but looks and acts Italian.) Narrative voiceovers. A clever framing device with us locked in the car at midway through and mirrored in the beginning. The end with Liotta looking directly and speaking into the camera and shooting us.And the camera. Much has been said of the camera. The long, tracking shots, especially the much-copied entrance through the kitchen. The pullback-zoom toward the end when Liotta and DeNiro meet. The occasional corner ceiling shot. Normally I would love this, especially since it is in the framework of a consistent notion of the eye. What bothers me is what that eye is: it is dependent on the characters. The characters drive this movie and pull the camera. Consider the kitchen entry scene: the camera is on a string behind Liotta. We follow, always follow, just as the fellas at Pesci's table have to follow his prattling. Compare that to dePalma's similar long tracking shot of Bruce Willis at the start of `Bonfire of the Vanities.' DePalma's camera isn't dragged along behind by the force of Willis. It floats to the front, the side, swooping around, independently curious. We the viewers are masters of the story. It's the difference between the northern and southern European storytelling traditions.Seeing how little deference the camera gives us really grates when the payoff is so slight. It makes DeNiro pretty hard to take. Yes, we all get impressed by the power of his performance. But it is always clear that it is a performance: we are not seeing a character but a `serious actor,' employed as a tractor to pull us along.Is this a great film? Well, it did not change my life, give my dreams new form, or provide the basis for any meaningful discussion with my wife. It didn't help me define myself or my world. It provided no new perspectives on the things I struggle with. (And many, many films do one or more of these things.) So for me no.What a waste.",Null,46,87,22 May 2002
The Bourne Supremacy," Recovered Fragments
","Spoilers herein.One of the highest compliments I can give a movie is that the way it exists as a film. Some mainstream movies do this: `Mothman's vision was mothlike. `Van Helsing' had swoopers and swooped. `The Limey' was about revisiting and had mini-revisits in the edit. 'Good Thief' was about a drugged perception of a hyperperceptive man.Now we have a Ludlum story, originally about the chaos of partial memory and told in a manner that is the literary equivalent of handheld with inadequate information. Watch what's done here: the way it is shot and edited combines the hectic chase, the frantic fight and the dimly recalled narrative. Its a very clever and cinematic formulation: possibly the best car chase in movies, one of the best fights... and get this: Matt is tolerable, even apt.They must be setting up Julia for number three.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,7,12,23 July 2004
The Great Gatsby," Moulin Green
","When I saw 'Moulin Rouge,' I knew that life would change, because film would have an added mainstream vocabulary. We would embrace it and adjust our dreams and intuitions. And indeed we have had Nolan ascendant. Even TeeVee has shifted.Oddly, after that film, Lurhmann himself went off on a different experiment, trying to exploit openness rather than constraints of space and view. That failed interestingly. Now we are back at the 'Moulin Rouge' form again.That means that we get layers of observation, not necessarily nested. We get shifts in narration that have related cinematic devices, spaces or camera movement. And all of this will be relatively invisible so a mainstream viewer will think she is watching a regular movie.The novel sets this up well. Everyone in that written world is living a fragile story, partially self-created. Some notions in the story have become less powerful since the time of writing, for instance we have a different notion of the damage carried by soldiers returning from war. But the impending collapse of identity narrative is much sharper today than in Fitzgerald's time, at least the ones we see, based on our knowledge of and wishes about the the collapse of class privilege.What characterizes the American novel is unsettling narration. In this case, each of the main four charm us into trust, only to have that trust dissolve. The movie adds two new things to the story. The first is a rather heavy framing device where the book we see is written. This gives some purchase for the voice over narration and allows slippery shifts between inside and outside the main thread.The second addition is the use of the romance movie genre. It pulls on the film in ways not available to readers of the novel. When we see a date movie, we willingly enter what we know to be a desirable but unrealistic world. We see these with our lover, hoping to stitch elusive unachievable remnants into our own pairing.I'd say that Lurhmann exploits these masterfully in teasing us into one precarious position after another as partygoer.The story itself revolves around two scenes. The first is when Gatsby arranges to meet Daisy for tea. This is where reality first threatens the elaborate story Gatsby has woven. Decaprio sought the role for the tensions he could bring to this dynamic. It is introduced here and he surely places the problem squarely in my heart.The second scene is when Daisy has to act to consummate what we accept until then as a delicious love story. The two scenes go together with the spring set in the first sprung in the second. We need a profound actress to pull this off. Someone stronger even than Leo. Our actress here destroys the film with her weakness as actor and character. Her choice in the book is one of strength, choosing (local) truth over Gatsby's fantasy. Not here.Two other weaknesses. The first is that in the book not only are our main characters untrusted narrators over their own lives, but Nick is an untrusted narrator. He is in love with Daisy. He is the penniless war veteran. He is the one tempted by shady financial deals in order to win a love. The book leaves the possibility that Gatsby is his invention from drinking and intersheet fantasy.The second weakness is that Luhrmann is a master of nested narrative, but he doesn't know how to change the presentation of inner layers. So for instance, we see, actually see Gatsby save a drunk millionaire and it is presented in the same manner as everything else. There is no need for this, and Nolan does so much better.But never mind. We come for the cinema. We come to be harmlessly tricked. This doesn't change the world like the red film did. Lets call this the green one. If he pulls a Kieslowski, there will be an orange one. Speaking of Kieslowski, I'm a fan of Lurhmann when he collaborates with structureman Craig Pearce. They had a lot of freedom in Moulin Rouge and used it to great advantage. The thing turns itself inside out several times and is vastly more complex than 'Inception.'Where Nolan has wife as visual anchor and brother for narrative structure, Luhrmann has a similar setup. Both Nolan and Lurhmann produce visual worlds with some striking features, but the key thing is that they are internally coherent. I've become a believer in the power of a sexually engaged collaborator for this. The visual coherence helps with the overlay of the narrative structure; the more reliable the visual world is, the more possibility we have for non- linear elements in the narrative world.Fitzgerald's novel is almost tailor made for this approach. Many who read it see only the society therein and the associated metaphors for a world adrift, buffeted by collective urges. Of course that has power. But the more interesting thing about the novel is the devious slipperiness of the narration.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,8,13,17 June 2013
Shark Tale," Quality Shows
","Spoilers herein.In all things that humans make, there are levels of expertise. A matter of necessary education is to be able to distinguish among these levels, and most particularly between the merely competent and the original on which it is based. This a way of saying that to be an educated, cine-literate viewer, you need to perceive the difference between this and 'Nemo.'A cruel rule in business is that mature markets can stratify between those that define and redefine the market and those that must struggle to keep up. If you succeed in controlling a market this way, you'll always win in the long run in the most important ways.In computers, its Steve Jobs who defines the market. Always has been. Bill Gates copies.In film animation, its Steve Jobs again, with his Pixar. The guiding principle there is a matter of original excellence, to understand the underlying fabric of the thing. When Katzenberg was at Disney, he famously said that anyone could do what Pixar had (with 'Toy Story') and set out to prove it. Ultimately, Dreamworks animation was founded.Pixar made a bug movie, Dreamworks made a bug movie (incidentally funded by Bill Gates). Pixar made a movie about bad guys behind the scenes, and so did Dreamworks ('Shrek'). Pixar made a fish movie, so it is to be expected that Dreamworks would follow.Here are two indicators of why 'Nemo' worked and 'Shark' doesn't, in other words, why the former is the Tiffany and the latter the JC Penny's of animation.Pixar works in 3D, and is concerned with _all_ the matters of 3D. Having mastered many of them in the earlier projects, they focused on one of the more difficult in 'Nemo,' the movement of the 'camera.' The reason Nemo is a fish story is so that the set can have movement in three dimensions, with the camera swooping around as if it were a fish ghostviewer.(You have to understand that the original cameras were stationary at eye height. Most great advances in film have been accompanied by advances in the philosophy of how the camera moves. This is not a mere game, as it implies _who_ and _what_ the viewer is.)So watch 'Nemo' and see that Pixar redefined the genre with the way the camera exists in and sees three dimensional movement. Now watch 'Shark' and be amazed at how they missed this. All the movement - even the fight scenes which many summer movies already make dimensional - are two D. That's one reason why this subliminally seems pale in comparison.There are other reasons of course, mostly obvious and uninteresting. Except in the seriousness of the approach.Pixar takes its stories seriously. They may have some fun from time to time with references to other films, or even stepping back from the story to make a joke about the story. But they never compromise the seriousness of the story. They care about whether Nemo gets lost.Dreamworks doesn't take the story seriously at all. They decided to bring a bunch of pieces that they thought had value, and highlight those pieces. So instead of having a godfather shark, we have deNiro. It is not a character that grows out of the story that deNiro helps create. It is deNiro _as_ a character, down to that odd mole on the right of his face. And so with all the other characters.And the songs too. They are wedged in, rather than growing out of the theatrical dynamics. And yes, so are all the references to other films. Sure, that was a gas with 'Van Helsing' but in that case, the picture itself was morphing from one genre to another just like the characters. Here, the references are pasted on as if the story were outlined and the story 'fluffers' brought in to add cute jokes for the adults.Just doesn't work. At least for the immediate future, Pixar owns this genre, and Dreamworks will have to swim in their turbulent wake.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",Null,9,17,3 October 2004
Hustle & Flow," An Embarrassing Hook
","Sometimes a movie is successful, engaging you but leaves you feeling dirty.Sometimes a movie is well enough made to seem worthwhile but gives you nothing, nothing at all.Sometimes a movie purports to be a genuine visit, an exploration in real, raw human dynamics from a world we wouldn't other wise see. This does advertise itself that way. And it is a fraud.The 'true' part is the story of the guy, the Memphis rapper who sold CDs out of the back of his car. He tricked his way into a meeting with the director  a polished white guy  and made a demo in 24 hours from scratch. That song won the Oscar prompting the ghetto/ trailerpark hoots half the world saw. That part is genuine, a man 'making it.'But what false is everything else. Oh, I know folks get offended at the misogynism, but that's excusable here because that is the way most of the world runs. What is obnoxious is that we see a man 'finding himself,' following his path,' and other sorts of soft notions about moving from irrelevance to a full life. The opening speech gives it to you in terms of dogs and man.And we see him do so in the context of making the song that both redeems him and forms the sonic backdrop of the movie. It seems so genuine on screen: a whore finds her center to sing; a repressed producer finds his groove la la la. And our pimp finds untapped resources that must exist lest we wouldn't have a movie.But in reality this is not the case. The top musical talent in Memphis (which is saying something) is turned to giving us what we see as genuinely from the man's soul but could never be. Never. And even if it were, does this song do anything but make your head bob for three minutes?The acting is impressive, and we should give Singleton credit for that, I think. But what a waste these actors must have known this to be. We like it, but it is lies. We like it because it is lies. There is no genuine black culture any more.

The Birds," Reality Flies Off
","I am not an appreciator of Hitchcock, at least not recently as I wade though reviewings of his work.But this film is different. Many of his films dance on the edge of the surreal, and deal with a person or people swept up in events beyond their control. But here he tips well into another world and does it so artfully that we don't notice. I recall the film being touted as a horror film when first released, but it is not so. Horror depends on reality -- the more likely, the more threatening. Terror is another thing.What is so skillful here is that no one behaves as people normally would, not even close. Yet no one remarks on that fact. Such a notice would be automatic in today's infatuation with irony and self-reference. So what makes this film so intriguing is that it is entirely without irony, non-modern even in the sense common in the 60's. This effect is amplified by the `studio' style of camera-work: stationary cameras and flat sets. Essentially all dialog is indoors.Further: huge mysteries remain at the end of the film, about the cause of the supernatural, about the Oedipal characters, and of course about what happens next. World, people, story are all left open. How intelligent.A side remark: once again in a Hitchcock film, minor actors outshine the main characters. But no matter. The effects, as with the sets, are cheesy, but rather than detracting, this adds to the unsettling unreality of the work. This film is pretty disturbing all around.",Null,12,23,21 October 2000
Princess Mononoke," Leper Gunsmiths; Crouching Harlots
","Spoilers herein.The first thing I want is to be transported. The further the better, the more competently the better. This film transported me. It had quite a bit different take on the world -- heavihanded, confusing, illogical, juvenile mysticism, pop morality -- all different than what we are usually served up. Some of this strangeness (I am convinced) is because the director is a poor storyteller.Disney's ethic was that the simplicity in the art corresponded with a simplicity in the story, so much so that one could turn off the sound and get the story. Not just follow the story but follow the WHOLE story. Anime seems to want to turn that on its head, making the animation simpler than anything out of Disney, but blowing up the story complexity with so many threads that kids believe it is profound.No matter for me, the confusion and pseudodepth was part of the experience.But there is another element here, and that really did disappoint me. 'Akira' was genuinely artistic, not so much in the drawings themselves, but in the understanding of motion. I was impressed with how the edges on the screen corresponded to the edges between scenes. Akira had a similarly childish sense of the complexly profound, but the art showed mastery and self-awareness.The vision in this film is just plain unimaginative in how the motion is handled. I'm not talking about the quality of the animation (which is poor), but the depth of the art. And the images themselves lack imagination: a wormy boar as a demon; the nightwalker was straight out of scoobydoo; the wolfgods?; the smurfy sprites? None of this reaches deep.If you want an introduction to anime and are looking for art, go to 'Akira.' Don't even stop here.",Null,14,31,15 June 2001

","Here's an interesting situation. Evil versus good, or if you prefer: a life of the purehearted versus that of the thuggish.Yes, its the story, but its also the form of the movie itself.The blunt, the stupid, the ugly is the movie itself. Howard and Grazier are so pedestrian it makes me cry. There isn't a shred of sophistication, elaboration or depth in this. Its one arc, unimpeded and unarticulated. Good man, Hard times, Comeback. The only slight elaboration is the worried-wife-as-watcher. Compare this to the richly woven 'Seabiscuit,' essentially the same story but with all sorts of parallel threads and reflections.These two guys Howard and Grazier are the enemy of life with their industrial storytelling, their plywood narrative. It makes it all the worse that they have achieved a glossy style that looks competent, if you think manufactured cookies with artificial ingredients are competent. Zellweger is not a fine actress, so she goes with the manufactured sweep of the thing.The good which opposes it. Say what you will about Crowe's strutting, the man is an Australian actor and there's no escaping that. Even when told to be simple, and even in spite of his own imperfect and unformed soul, he just cannot avoid some depth, some parallel being  a reality under the cartoon. And also on the good side is the simple fact of boxing. Now boxing is brutal. And perhaps most people involved in it are simple. But they are real, and that's all the difference. And it is a real sport, perhaps the only real one. No complex rules and balls. No question of goals or finish lines, just a straightforward matter of the ability to give and take. Its genuine, and I'm sure that's why it was selected, to counter the cartoon limits of what the filmmaker could handle. And since Scorsece mapped the ring and Stallone in vented the slomo flying sweat, its been cinematic as well.So Its unintuitive that somethings that seem thuggish: Crowe and boxing, are the real things here, the pure and the good. And the bad, the evil, the thuggish; why they are our men behind the camera who make money from simplifying it for the goobs on the street.

","Spoilers herein.I revisited this film for a specific project. IMDB comment-writing has given me an excuse to resee and think about what films were important (or good in some way) and why. Now after almost two years, I'm developing a list of filmmakers and a few actors worth following. Should Tim Burton be on the list?Tim has at least one rare quality of an effective filmmaker: he has the ability to shape some critical mass of the elements of his work to adhere to a coherent vision. A Burton film is pretty recognizable. But have any of his films struck me in a particularly strong way? Have any been life-altering (some by others have) or even remembered particularly fondly? The strongest candidate was this one. It is also of passing interest for Geena and Winona history.There are only two things in this film to recommend it: Keaton's slapstick performance. But his three or four frenetic appearances alone are not enough to justify sitting front of the screen. The other element is remarkable: Efman's score. Our old Boingo man I think has literally helped Burton define himself, so the sonic texture here is more than perfect.Burton does not go on my list of greats. But I think I'll start a list of film score composers.A remark on the architecture. I have a special interest in how films handle space, and a part of that is the architecture. What Otho supposedly did to the outside of the house is pretty good actually, very apt for the notion of the film itself: what you see is some distance removed from reality.",Null,7,10,10 January 2002

I do know that when I watched that South Park movie and several of the episodes, I was impressed, I often laughed and I wasn't ashamed of why. It was the sort of humor that is clever and that allows you to share in its cleverness.This isn't clever in the big. In fact, it follows a Disney-inspired template: an unworthy man is redeemed, a boy reunites with his father. And this in the safest of Disney messages: give a hoot, and the government is evil. Noticeably absent is any business about media companies with huge budgets being evil. There used to be a bunch of this, I think: clowns and cartoons, dumping on TeeVee cartoons and cynical, manufactured humor.There used to be winks at the audience, a sort of: 'this is a bit going after a stupid, trailer park laugh, and the funny thing about it will be the fact that we are doing it with both of us knowing it.' Somewhere along the way, the show became a brand and when that happens you do everything you can to support the brand. Things like taking over convenience stores for advertising purposes. Would the early incarnation of this start with Bart writing 'don't illegally download?' Would 'South Park?'This isn't 'The Simpsons' any more; its 'The Flintstones.' It has become trailerpark without the wink.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",Null,7,16,26 August 2007
All the President's Men," A Single Truth?
","Spoilers herein.I grieve for a world that gets its history from films, and most especially films like this.What happened was the President and much of the intelligence and justice establishment were turned against US citizens. Dogged work on the part of Democrats and a few honest FBI unraveled the conspiracy. The Post actually made matters worse by publishing accusations (mostly correct) which they couldn't prove. Nixon was booted out but not before the Presidency was permanently damaged and that constant fringe of conspiracy theorists were given fresh meat. This haunts us today.But the press writes history, and here we have the story as if it were a Julia Roberts movie against a powerful corporation. Here we have a noble Ben Bradlee. Here we are told the big breaks came through Woodstein. Because the only part of the story that could be stretched to include the Post is the early stuff, its importance is overblown.So what we end up with is a simple story about the good guys (always acting honorably) against the evil Goliath. They win. How sad for us all. Redford should be ashamed.How different is it for Nixon to simplify the truth to an essential (but incorrect) story because that's what the public is capable of understanding -- and for the Post/Warner Bros to do the same?So just on that basis, this film should be avoided, reviled. But it is also not a good film. Hoffman can be good, but here he struggles to find a character and never centers. Redford looks pensive, but that's pretty thin stuff compared to what his old buddy Newman was doing. Robards is good, clipped, but probably the least historically accurate. (Well, probably the Deep Throat stuff is.) The scared women were the best. The writing must have been rushed: how could that bit from Lawrence of Arabia slipped through? The bit about `not minding' the candle burns.Let me give you an example: the two approach a female officemate and ask her to use an old flame for information. She is taken aback. Watch how little dramatic effect is squeezed from this. Watch how poor is the collaborative timing. Someone didn't care enough to get this simple effect right.",Null,13,24,6 November 2001

","Spoilers herein.As a film, this ranks pretty low on my charts. But as a stage talent, Judy Garland is one of the best and this is quite a performance. She really does work hard to make us fall in love with her, which of course we cannot resist. Here she is quite fat, which reminds us that by now she was already heavy into speed and sex.I met Noel Langley in the 60s and he insisted that he wrote the screenplay to emphasize certain spiritual symbology. The contrast between these two facts fascinates. Why are gays so attracted to Judy? Why do Christian fundamentalists see this as the Devil's work? Is this the eighth gate?",Null,10,18,23 October 2001
The Soloist," Two Good Strings
","Yes, you can trust Joe Wright with your life, without bound for two hours.Some parts of this are simply ordinary. There's the original sequence of stories which exploited the simple tension of discarded talent in a city that both worships talent and discards people wholesale. These were simple structures, headlines and patronizing prose. There's the screenplay by a hack, with simple shape and essentially no movement. In other words, forget what people usually think a movie is about: the people and the story. Those parts are missing. There is no happy ending. There is no redemption.But this has three things: madness, music and the marriage of madness and music.I saw this right after 'State of Play,' a traditional newspaper movie, with archetypal writer and editor. This is a modern version with two of our most folded actors: Downey and Keener. Their job is simple: define an edge between internal and external. The coupled acting here is not between Downey and Foxx, but between Downey and Keener playing a recently divorced couple. There's a quiet tension these two build around the absent son, whose place Foxx's character fills.Foxx makes not a character but an phenomenon, an experience, this experience of madness in music. He is helped by being placed amid folks who we are told are 'real disturbed people.' What Wright has is a fairly vacuous notion of madness, but a sublime talent in expressing it cinematically. Some of his tricks are trivial when considered independently: a cutout of Ayers getting smaller and 'disappearing into' the music; a cheesy light show to Beethoven; an attempt to conflate voices in the head to music in the head. This latter is very real but the expression is cheap.While they seem trite individually, none are used heavily or relied on. And the effect when combined with more masterly things produces a symphony of excess. Downey's character remarks on the sheer depth, the love the penetration in describing just this very thing we see. It works. Music, indeed all real paths through passion are madness. Every adventure into commitment is a step outside safety of self.Wright knows this. He feels it. He can show it. I can trust him with my life. Its madness to do so, but I recommend it to you.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,13,25,24 April 2009
Dodgeball," Two Teams
","Spoilers herein.Nearly all films are about other films, sometimes literally so.An 'ordinary' mass film purports to abstract life by replaying stuff from the established vocabulary. I dare say there are thousands and thousands of sports films with this plot: apparent weaklings triumph which a key individual reaffirms some sort of purity. Last night I saw 'Barbershop 2' which though not strictly a sports movie, wears the metaphor like many blacks wear 'leisure' athletic clothes. That's the ordinary. Then you have the kind of film that does precisely the same abstraction, except instead of purportedly from life, it is from the genre. Exact same everything, except the abstraction is that much more extreme.Ted's law says that the two abstractions (from life to the ordinary film and from the ordinary film to the spoof) must be exactly the same. That's because ALL the cinematic mechanisms must be the same, else there is no joke.I believe this style started in 1950's TeeVee skits, and probably 15 or 20 minutes is about as long as you can sustain the joke. To judge from the success of Austin Powers, some folks can take it longer. Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",Null,2,7,1 November 2004
High Fidelity," Clever Play on Introspection
","I'm relatively easy to please. If just one thing in a film is an ambitious attempt and it works rather well, it is enough if most of the rest is merely competent. But a competent simple film isn't enough for me. Good acting alone isn't enough.This film takes one chance and does it in my favorite area -- Cinema is essentially a superficial medium; it cannot capture an internal dialogue as a link with the viewer/reader like a novel can -- or at least not without taking chances.Cusack deserves a lot of credit for what he's done here in playing with the link between movie and viewer.(Caution! Some may see these as spoilers...)--He has a dialog directly with the viewer, that dialog is often in the very context of the action, and the matter of the dialog is substantially different (more honest) than what he has with any character.--One episode has three different versions. This is a part of the dialog with the viewer. It is a point of art that the effect is only used once.--The dialog is essentially about the relationship between events and the soundtack of life as if it were a movie, so when a musician (Bruce Springsteen) comes from the soundtrack to the action, it blurs the distinction. Very clever.--As the film is about music as analog ('using someone else's poetry' to annotate or even activate your life) it's rather elegant how Cusack has created a soundtrack for us in precisely the way he creates DJ tapes, like the one for his wife at the end.This film takes intelligent chances with that tough boundary and makes them work.

Up in the Air," The Barrier Around the Seat
","I wish I had seen this back to back with 'The Informant!'Both are good examples of what I think is a new phenomenon in film narrative. No, not exactly new; rather the techniques are maturing to the point that people don't notice them any more. And that's what you want.It is a matter of ambiguous narration. We've always had this, even with silent movie cards. For 75 years or so (let's start with Kane), we've had the sliding notion of the narration of the storyteller, the 'voiceover' narration of the protagonist, and the interior narration of one character to another. This latter is obvious in many bad science fiction movies where the professor patiently explains some key dynamics of the story. We accept that these can meld — have for decades.But we now have a trend where we like to have narrative perspectives made discrete and explicit because we like to play games with what one knows that another does not, and how one can annotate another. So we have movies like 'Informant,' whose key hook is in weaving ambiguities among these platforms.Here in 'Up' is a more complex and delicate composition. First of all, instead of being built on the great confrontation between the big and little guy, it moves on the conflict between independent loneliness and risk in losing ones' self in another.It is about love, is modern in the sense that it moves the tension into the narrative structure itself, and is tuned well, because Clooney knows what he is doing. We have the on screen narrator, Clooney's character Bingham, who knows more than the character does. He narrates to a novice. He also narrates as a living, triggering change in other characters. We hear those characters as bona fide narrators. We hear Bingham to them, to himself, to his apprentice, and to a romantic possibility he finds. Its all about story, each one, and about the dissonances and overlaps among them.The power comes from some large things and small. The large device is obvious. The standard fold in films is to have an inner 'film' of some kind that allows us to enter as participant. Here it is a remote video conferencing for one of the narrative threads, allowing us to fold in to that one only. The 'small' narrative device factors powerfully in the film, but the mechanism is somewhat hidden. The template we are expecting is the standard romantic pattern: love is found, lost and regained. This is broken: our guy does not get anything close to wholeness. He goes back to a hell of what both he and we know will be loneliness. The apprentice girl learning about love? Her life is ruined by a suicide that will haunt her, caused by inept handling of false narrative. The effectiveness of the folding device of video conferencing? Discarded as ineffective.It all turns on our discovery that Bingham is himself a narrative, a distraction, a fabrication in the romantic sense. It comes from out of the blue because there are so many narrators, so many fabricators that we didn't notice the power of this one, Bingham's love interest played by Vera Farmiga. Her power is absolute and breaks everything. This could be a depressing movie if you are sensitive to job loss, suicide and disappointment in love. But it is designed to pass the narrative prerogative to you to handle, so is judged as 'intelligent.'The inner plot is its own narrative. Two young lovers are getting married. One is related by birth, the other by being a salesman of the artificial. Bingham gives them the happiness he cannot have, that he has to deny himself. (There are hints that problems with his parents is the cause.) He literally at the end gives them his happiness in terms of the credits he has accumulated in his endeavors. This in substitute for their own fabricated happiness (in the form of a fake honeymoon).Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,8,12,5 January 2010
From Here to Eternity," The Rule of Threes
","My own estimation is that this is a pretty poor movie cinematically, with the exception of the then-shocking juicy exuberance of the beach scene.But it is crackling good storytelling and that overcomes the wooden direction and uninspired acting.I'm a believer in the power of structure in stories. Here we have the rule of three in two dimensions.We have the three stories that unfold in the first part:-The story of base strumpet Karen Holmes and her illicit affair with her husband's inferior-The story of a retired fighter and bugler who would rather fight the system, and who also falls for a whore, though the movie waters her down to a `dance hostess'-The story of the Italian impulsive who gets trapped in system in a way mirroring the fighter and is thereby killed.These three stories intermingle in controlled ways: the sergeant plays a key role in two, the fighter in two. In both cases their role in one story contradicts or opposes their role in the other: the reluctant fighter in one thread is passive, in the other is a killer. The sergeant in one thread is the colonel's patsy, in the other he cuckolds the colonel.There are two women, both promiscuous, but for opposite reasons: one because she cannot have a proper family and the other because she desires one.Wheels turn with carefully machined interlacing, and we follow each one. That's the first part. All during this, we know that an external force will break the machine. It comes and is treated as a story segment in its own right. But it is just heavy punctuation. Both affairs have ended. The Italian has been killed and his killer killed and his killer in turn killed. End of act two.What makes this novel in my mind is the very odd and short act three. The two endearing sluts are on a boat together, and Alma herself tells a story. I believe in a law of film stories that I discover in hundreds of films: the story IN the film - even a simple, short story as we have here - is precisely as abstracted from the story OF the film as the film is from the reality of the viewers in the audience. That's what we have here, and it really highlights and cements the memory of what we have seen before.But don't see this for any cinematic values: the direction, camerawork (except for that beach scene), acting and production design is ordinary, even tepid. Its the fabric of the story here, and it pulls us like a tractor.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Null,6,14,14 November 2003
Atonement," Types, Typed Images
","I knew from the first few moments of 'Pride and Prejudice' that we were in the hands of someone who understood literature cinematically. Austen is virtually impossible to film because typical of many books, it requires some ambiguity about internal ruminations and the observed events. He mapped this into shifting layers and inside-outside in the very first scene. I moved forward in my seat.Here he is much, much better because he is filming a book written with cinematic values. I cannot say if it is a well-written book. The basic story itself is ordinary, sort of a reverse Lolita with the young girl as the writer and untrusted narrator. (There is one key shot. Everything else up until the 'visit' is witnessed by others except the corpses of schoolgirls. This is the only scene that is staged in a stylistically unrealistic way, and it should be a tipoff that Briony's story is folded into the outer wrapper as well as the events we see.)The most notable trick he does is use the typewriter in a pervasive way, in the story, in the writing of the story, in the score and even in the eye toward the end.He uses camera movement in wonderful ways. For instance, he has Briony move on the upper corridor and stairs of her home in precisely the same movement the older Brony does through the hospital beds, except this time we know it is her eye we are using and her memory we are plumbing. There's the amazing one-take sequence at Dunkirk. Its not like the P T Anderson ripoff of Urusevsky where he just touches characters; instead it is derived from 'Soy Cuba' and 'Touch of Evil' in the sense that both deep and contextual narrative is conveyed. Again, we learn that this is coherently constructed by the writer and not witnessed.The business of our hero being folded into 'Port of Shadows,' (about a deserter  we never learn why Robbie was separated from his company) isn't unique, but its apt and deep. Movies, books, pictures, stories about stories about lies.I don't know Juno Temple from elsewhere  though I know she was in 'Notes on a Scandal' which I saw, but she is the real villain here and she pulls it off well, as does her counterpart the young Briony.In preparation for this, I saw 'Soy Cuba' because I knew this would have the Soviet eye, and the 75 'Great Gatsby,' with which this shares quite a few values, including some of the story. I'm glad I did.It works. Its intelligent. Its cinematic and literary. Keira is tolerable. There's a great speech about letting the Germans have France.

V for Vendetta," Eye for Itself
","Sometimes the world throws a snowball so perfectly it both amazes and depresses me.Imagine a story of an extreme threat, delivered through the visual media, with all sorts of personal triumphs woven into it. Suppose you gather groups of people by the millions to overtly support your enterprise, wrapped in gloss and foreshadowing. Suppose you decide to make it humorless and obvious; and to make it whole and logical not because it is those things but because your confidence makes its seem so.Well, you'd have what this film has built itself against. But you'd also have what this film is.Will we never learn? Do the brothers suppose they aren't paving the way for simplistic munchkin politics? If you want a subversive film, go to Greenaway.Yet, I can admire how this thing is put together. It is highly cinematic visually even though most of the thing is talking. But even that is tricky because the talker is behind a mask, so we largely invent the images in our own minds, prompted from time to time with inserted visions.The first half is the Count of Agatha Cristie, where we are presented with an old fashioned detective story except presented from the criminal's perspective. Serial killings are ticked off and we want to know why. Though we follow the killer, our inquiries are handled by the on screen detective.This is followed by an 'Oldboy' segment, a radical shift, perhaps equally well done. And then we shift into 'Irreversible' mode as we slide into the sappy movieland happy ending. Fireworks.Along the way, we are pounded with self-reference to video media: our heroine and her pal work in TeeVee. The central Valerie character is a filmmaker who incidentally creates the film we are watching indirectly by writing it on toilet paper and passing it as if behind a mask.Our hero is motivated by a certain old movie. Until the very end, we only see our political nemesis on a huge video screen, as his millions of victims do.This IS worth watching, but only for the way it is constructed.

","Paul Verhoeven makes movies that pollute the eye. If you are serious about movies, you cannot avoid bad ones. In fact, if you love movies, you love bad ones as well.But that's not the same as tolerating crassness, as deliberately allowing a vulgar non- appreciation of films by filmmakers into your soul. This isn't a dialog, building an imagination. You don't have to have 'both sides,' the artful and the sidewalk dust. So on the list goes Michael Bay. He just doesn't seem to have anything useful to offer. Sure, there is a lot of movement of the kind you can get by huffing gas, but there isn't the same color that you can get from someone who can actually speak, like say Tony Scott or his brother.There used to be a genre, a science fiction summer movie genre. You'd start with some clever setup. Most old science fiction was engineered to exploit some societal foible or devise a means to encounter self, sometimes both. We have that setup here, though borrowed from all over with no attention to annealing the seams.Then you'd add some tension and action and naturally some love. But it all worked because the container was big and solid. The science fiction cover allowed the contents to be brash. Thing even about 'The Chronicles of Riddick' or even the Matrix things and my 'Constantine.' They worked as what they were because the container was solid.There's effectively no container here, nothing but the noise.Its all so hard to grasp. Evan McGregor knows how to do the folded acting thing. He's already been in two of the most accomplished films of the last ten years: 'Pillow Book' and 'Moulin Rouge,' plus some tolerable ones. Miss Scarlett knows how to pose to imply intelligence, usually adding something. Oh well. Sometimes I say a film isn't worth watching. This time I say watching this can do you harm.

"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Weaving Dualities
","How blessed we are with the current blizzard of fine films!Spoilers herein.Here the Coens embark on their most ambitious effort yet, playing with multiple dualities:--the real world and a  magical reality of myth--the world of performance and the world of politics--the stories of song and those of image--the lovely bright yellow land of the south and the unlovely people who partly covered itIn the center of each duality, they placed the pretense of our trio moving through what Goethe said of Ulysses was an apprentice voyage. Clooney will really be p***ed when he realizes how these guys goofed on him. Turturro is a long time Coenite who understands their light regard for the patina of entertainment the ordinary viewer expects. In fact, he has just come off of two rather ambitious projects concerned with just these four dualities and the complex role of the actor in weaving them into apparent entertainment: his remarkable `Illuminata,' which he funded, wrote and directed, and Tim Robbins' similar (but more political) project, `Cradle Will Rock.' Turturro is becoming a phenomenon, real intelligence.Tim Blake Nelson participated in the highly adventurous `Hamlet' of last year, tilted toward just such an issue -- with Hamlet as a film student musing about these dualities. He then took Julia Stiles, the Ophelia, and directed the forthcoming `O,' a version of Othello that is held up I understand because it is `too intelligent.' He has written and directed other films which I haven't seen, but `Eye of God,' written and directed by him is supposed to also be about this same stuff. Natch, all the bright filmmakers are buzzing about these issues. Together, Turturro and Nelson play the game of switching realities, while both Clooney's character and Clooney are oblivious. The title is from a Sturges film-within-a-film. Same issues -- everything revolves around the chicken dance.A small complaint: the symbol of blindness was too heavihanded, much as with Woody Allen in `Crimes.' And `soggy bottom?'

The Godfather," Respect
","Spoilers herein.Building a life in film is not so much a matter of discovering the worthwhile films, but choosing which of those have the stuff worth building with. I have a clear understanding of what Scorsese is about, which I attribute to the Latin convention for storytelling. This convention is totally invested in characters, not situation or place or God help us, ideas. Scorsese's camera is attached to people, never place. His curiosity is always about people. This is a form of visual gossip that I eschew.So it is with Coppola. But his two projects (the Godfather and Apocalypse journeys) have another merit in how they work with what came before. Apocalypse is far more interesting in this respect. But `Godfather' is very clever in how it places itself. Gangster pictures began as a matter of a pretend world, and became ever more so as the genre matured. Mobsters lived in a world not unlike that of the Roadrunner,  always at a distance from reality, often winking at the audience.Coppola took his focus on the human to this genre. The film itself is no masterpiece without this placement, but is great with it. We inherit all the machinery and momentum of the genre to place behind the characters. Brando understood this, and alone is able to effect the transferral. Pacino would go on to sledgehammer his roles, but is appropriately subdued here.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.",Null,17,30,19 February 2003
