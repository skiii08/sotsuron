Requiem for a Dream," Stunning. Punishing. Beautiful. Unforgettable.
","These are just some of the many adjectives that come to mind to describe this wonderful film.  It is one of the most harrowing films I have ever seen.  Never has a decent into the deepest layers of hell been so strikingly filmed.  My only complaint is that the script itself is lacking in areas. The characters are given just enough to do before the slide begins (don't worry, that's no spoiler ... just look at the title of the movie), but while I appreciate when a director doesn't waste time, more time spent with these particular characters would have been appreciated even more.  However, that's my only complaint.  Visually, this is one of the most exciting films I've seen in years.  The performances are sound, with Ellen Burstyn giving us an Oscar-worthy turn.  The editing is especially incredible and should also be nominated (if the Academy has 1/4 of a brain between them all). But for as good as this film was, if Aronofsky gets his hands on a Godfather-quality script, I seriously don't think the film world would be prepared...9/10",9,0,0,11 December 2000
Spider-Man 2," Everything a comic-book movie should be
","I just saw this film at an exhibitor's screening, and it was everything a comic-book movie should be. I had low expectations, since I thought the first film was decent, but left a lot of great opportunities on the table. But not part 2. Raimi has really stepped up to the plate with this film, and created something that will be loved by both the mainstream viewer, as well as the film geeks and comic geeks. He took time with the characters, and gave Peter, M.J., Harry, and Aunt May some quality character development. We even get more of J. Jonah Jameson, which is great for the comic relief (even if I can't stop calling him 'Schillinger'). The CGI is much better this time around, and Spidey no longer looks rubbery.It is much more believable, and doesn't take you out of the moment at any point. Also, we're given a much better bad guy. Doc Ock is a fantastic villain, and much of this credit goes to Molina. He doesn't cheese it up at any point, and since Raimi gave us some time with him and his wife before the experiment goes wrong, we see that he's a kind man who wants to make the world a better place. Honestly, the film is dripping with pathos, and yet it doesn't feel like it's trying too hard to do so. And when we get to see how vulnerable Peter Parker is (wait until you see the subway car scene), we actually feel for the poor guy. This is the first comic-book film that got me to feel for the lead character, and I'm grateful for that.I'm a big fan of the X-Men movies, but this film has a lot more heart than either of those. Thinking back, I can't remember a better comic-book film. Spider-Man 2 gave me everything I wanted, and more. Kudos to Raimi for finally hitting one out of the park. I almost can't believe it, but this one is a 10/10, and I cannot wait to see it again on 6/29.",10,2,2,12 June 2004
2001: A Space Odyssey," Kubrick's finest hour
","Arguments can be made for many of Stanley Kubrick's films being his best work, but I would have to say that 2001: A Space Odyssey is indeed his finest hour.  Like many of his films (and I believe that Eyes Wide Shut will also fit into this category once people realize that it is about so much more than sex), it stands the test of time.  Ground-breaking, wholly original, and completely deserving of the praise it has continually received.10/10",10,1,3,7 December 2000
The Sixth Sense," Good, but not THAT good
","If it weren't for the great characterizations and performances, this film would've been a one-trick pony, and I wonder how well it would've stood out in people's minds otherwise.  Plot twists notwithstanding, this would have been just another drama.  Best Picture nomination?  The Usual Suspects is ten times the film this is...7/10",7,0,0,13 December 2000
