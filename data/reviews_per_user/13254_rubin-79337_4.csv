Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Well...OK?
","Here are the good things about Phantom Menace:Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, and Natalie Portman all showed great acting chops as Qui-Gonn, Obi-Wan, and Padme respectively. In addition, Ray Park did a good job as Darth Maul.The lightsaber duels were impeccably choreographed, and the CG wasn't the worst.Now, the bad parts, they will be listed in ascending order of how bad they were:1) Midi-Chlorians: look, its not a bad call, but George could have been a lot more creative.2) The subtle racism of Watto and the Trade Federation. NOT COOL.3) Jake Lloyd may have been young, but choose a better actor. For the love of the Force, I would have even preferred a young Hayden Christiansen.4) Jar-Jar. For the love of God, please no. This would have been acceptable under two possible circumstances. 1, he just wasn't there. or 2, the Jar-Jar Sith lord theory holds true, which would have in fact, made this move by George really creative.",7,0,2,5 May 2016
Spider-Man 3," Best Scene in Marvel History
","While Spiderman 3 had many flaws there was one scene that is, without a doubt, the greatest adaptation of a comic book character to the silver screen. Before I mention this groundbreaking scene, I will first mention the flaws.1) Harry wakes up from the coma much faster than I did when I hit my head like that, and all of a sudden he is friends with Tobey again?2) Too many villains that were frankly, very unnecessary.3) No one threatened to put a foot up Venom's ass. If you don't get that reference, I'm gonna put my foot in your ass.4) J Jonah Jameson was criminally underutilized.Now for the greatest scene in cinematic history: Tobey was fantastic when he went all emo, and danced his way into all of our hearts and pelvic thrusted the critics away. If I could see more of Tobey dancing like that, I would give the film a 10/10",4,0,1,2 May 2016
Captain America: Civil War," Fantastic, looking ahead for more
","I will begin by discussing each of the important characters and how they influenced the movie.Iron Man: Continued to be hilarious, but also had an incredible emotional side that was not very evident in the previous films. RDJ's portrayal of Stark continues to amaze me.Captain America: Chris Evans' portrayal of Cap is always refreshing, and his ability to be the moral compass of the group was unparalleled. Multiple of his scenes were done without much CG, specifically the Helicopter scene, which is amazing.Winter Soldier: Sebastian Stan plays it well as a guilt ridden, former assassin who wants nothing more than to live a peaceful life, but gets forced into fighting when he clearly doesn't want to. Stan is able to bring some levity but also shows us the range of his dramatic acting.Scarlet Witch and Hawkeye: I am putting them together because for a majority of the film, they are working together. While Renner does not add much to the plot, he does add to the character driven performances, spouting clever dialogue. Olsen shows a range of emotion, from the shock of the explosion in Lagos to the fury of Vision preventing her from leaving. The effects with her were incredible.Vision: Bettany establishes Vision as a still 'young' and naive person, still trying to mesh with the humans around him. He is humanized more in this film than in Age of Ultron, but this humanization brings humor when it clashes with his robotic side.Ant-Man: Scott gets thrown into the mix, like Spiderman, and is able to provide clever dialogue and a pretty intense Giant Man moment. His main part in the film is his humor, which he nails perfectly.War Machine, Falcon, Black Widow: None of these characters had a particular importance to the plot, but were all fantastic actors/actress and had some great dialogue.Zemo: Many people criticize Zemo for being a bad villain, but he was one of the best in the MCU to date. His focus on a small scale goal of tearing the avengers apart rather than conquering the world and his human motivation establishes him as a compelling and credible threat. He emphasizes that he doesn't have the power to destroy the avengers, but he was able to tear them apart from the inside.Spiderman: Holland was 19 years old when he got this role. He is 3 months older than I am, and he was able to steal the show, surrounded by some of Hollywood's biggest A-list actors. This is the best portrayal of Spiderman so far in live-action. Sorry Tobey.Black Panther: Chadwick Boseman was incredible with his portrayal of Black Panther. His accent was on point, his fight scenes were incredible, and his emotional narrative was the perfect compliment to the arcs of Captain America and Iron Man.Special effects were on point, Vision's density shifts along with Ant- Man's abilities were fantastic. The additional practical effects were extremely convincing. Also, the giant black panther statues were awe inspiring.The only reason I am not giving this a 10 is because the movie does not tell as much of a self contained story, but rather it sets up the next few movies in the MCU.Also, Stan Lee's cameo was as clever as Tony Stank.",9,1,3,6 February 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," So many horses
","Solid movie, decent plot, interesting action scenes. Three important observations: 1) Bat tornado at the beginning was visionary. Insightful directing and cinematography by Snyder. 2) The incredible necessity for at least 8 horses brought the film together.3) MARTHA!!!If you haven't realized yet, I am joking, but overall, it wasn't a bad film, but it wasn't a fantastic film. I hope to see more out of the DCEU in later films.",5,4,10,2 May 2016
