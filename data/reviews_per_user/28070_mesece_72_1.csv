Conquest 1453," disappoint
",In my opinion this movie is not good to watching and totally different than any part of real ottoman history. there are a lot of worst parts that don't show reality. some of characters had certainly opposite style than real people. for example Sultan Mehmet's master Ak Semseddin was not a fat person and he was beardless and he only exist at the and of the movie. Almost half of the movie is about Ulubatli's love with Era. Muslim people never participate in illegal love and they never make illegal baby. it would be better to change movie's name with 'Ulubatli's Love with Era' !! it s not good movie in digital effect. normally this movie's story is one of most reach and effective story but director and writer of this movie are not successful on it. i watched this movie with my nephews and cousins. We were 7 people and only my little nephew like it. so I don't suggest you to watch and waste your money and time.,2,31,67,27 February 2012
