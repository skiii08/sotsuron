Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Nothing brilliant, but doesn't suck
","I think the root of much of the problems with TPM is not a distorted view of the originals.  It comes down to a lack of chemistry between the characters. Yes the original Star Wars had its share of faults, but it had an electric chemistry between the three leads that is undeniable.  And that chemistry is undeniably lacking in this new movie.  All the great effects, all the strange revelations, and all the hype can't make up for this lack.",Null,0,0,16 June 1999
