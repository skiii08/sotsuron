The Avengers," I hated it
","I had very high expectations for this movie, after seeing that it got > 8.5/10 on Rotten Tomatoes. Needless to say, this movie was a disaster. 65% of the movie was full of them talking about how they are going to 'kick some ass' while the other 35% was them actually doing the deed. This movie's ending was very predictable and was like every other superhero movie ever created. I can not imagine why someone would give this terrible film a rating greater than 1/10.I had very high expectations for this movie, after seeing that it got > 8.5/10 on Rotten Tomatoes.
