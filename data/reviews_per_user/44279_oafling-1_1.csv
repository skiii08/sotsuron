Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Poor Tim Powers
","It's a shame Tim Powers' wonderful book is in any way associated with this buffoonery. One of the most interesting, intriguing, thought-provoking, and engaging writers out there will remain over-looked by the vast majority if they think this is what he's all about. Powers has written a number of very interesting and very well-written books and people should try to find some of them and read them. Obviously, the great sausage factory that is Disney, as well as the majority of American cinema, used the book because of its compelling title. It would be wonderful to see some of his other works actually brought to the screen by someone not doing a children's movie-'Declare'; 'The Stress of Her Regard';, 'Three Days to Never'; 'Last Call'; 'Expiration Date'; 'Earthquake Weather', etc. are all great. Now THOSE are movies a competent, thinking person's director should make.",Null,0,1,20 May 2011
