The Ring," Hey! I can yawn, fast-forward, and chew bubble gum at the same time!
","I agree with the sentiment of one reviewer who basically said 'Lynch can get away with nonsensical weirdness, Verbinski. You can't.'As I age it occurs to me that Hollywood's tricks don't work on me as well as they used to. Well, sometimes they do. Depends on the execution. I like Naomi Watts straight away, but even her comely presence failed to save this atmospheric mess from my fast-forwarding trigger-happy finger.Since no one seems to know what this film is about, I won't try to explain what I don't know about it either. I do know that it reminds me of 'Signs' in its popularity and its ridiculousness.",Null,0,1,22 March 2003
500 Days of Summer," After The Boys of Summer Have Gone
","The only thing that carries this film is the sweet-natured hope of Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character that he will find his love returned by Summer, aka (in his romantic mind) THE ONE. Without this universal desire for love, the filmmaker has no hooks in the audience to sit there for the manipulation that ensues. For a bit I thought this rom-com was going to buck the trend and end up worthwhile. No, it fell apart completely the more you thought about it. Summer was 'honest' with Tom about her unwillingness to commit, but then she just proceeded to toy with him right up to the final scene in the park. Why was she even there (married and pregnant)? 'I've always loved this place since you showed it to me.' Then the bitch rubs his nose in how she came to know he wasn't 'the one'. Oh, and be sure to clasp Tom's hand one more time with wedding ring glistening you demonic little twit.Disaster all around, but not the type you wind up wishing for. Poetic justice would only be served if that self-satisfied imp Summer would have met her Mack truck on the street. Now THAT would have left me a smiling, satisfied customer!",3,16,25,8 May 2010
