The Blair Witch Project," A completely original film!
","The Blair Witch Project is undoubtedly one of the most original ideas for a film I have ever seen.  Shot straight on to film with a hand held camera and an old 16mm shoulder cam, the entirely subjective feel of the film grasps you and doesn't let go! From the moment the house lights dim and the screen lights up, you will be hooked, unable to draw your eyes away from the film for even a second!  Without doubt THE must see of the year!",9,0,0,17 November 1999
