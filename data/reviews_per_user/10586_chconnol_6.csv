The Blair Witch Project," Flawed Masterpiece
","A flawed masterpiece of psychological suspense, 'The Blair Witch Project' nevertheless is fascinating and truly frightening in several sequences.  It works thanks to it's simplicity.  Contrast this movie with 'Poltergeist' in which Spielberg loaded on so many overt special effects that anything truly frightening was subverted. (Don't write back saying the Steven Spielberg didn't direct 'Poltergeist' that it was Tobe Hooper.  The story is that Hooper lost his mind making it and Spielberg stepped in and directed the bulk of the movie.) In 'The Blair Witch Project' virtually nothing is seen. It's all inferred like the feeling one gets walking into a dark room (or basement).  Yes, some of it doesn't really make sense.  For example, why would the three of them keep filming when they felt or knew they were doomed?  Obviously, without that, there'd be no film.  If you've ever camped out in a rural area or the deep woods, the feeling the film gives you is 100% correct.  A great BOO movie.  ONE VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: How and where you see this movie is important.  I saw it in a movie theater and the effect was amazing.  People were screaming and the darkness definately helped the effects.  Other people I know saw this movie at home with the lights fully on.  They didn't 'get it' at all.  It's like the first time I saw 'Carnival of Souls'.  I watched on a sunny, Saturday afternoon.  No effect.  Two or three years later, I catch it late on a Sunday night (around 11:30 PM). Scared the Hell outta me.  Gave me the creeps.  Atmosphere is important for horror-thrillers like these.",Null,0,1,14 November 2003
Alien," One of the Scariest Movies Ever Made
","The late, great Pauline Kael said it best when she wrote about 'Alien' (actually, she was reviewing 'Aliens' but I digress).  She wrote 'Alien turned your insides into knots.  It made you dread the scenes to come.' Exactly.  When I saw this movie at the age of 14, I nearly couldn't breathe. I both wanted it to end and keep on going all at the same time.  Everything about it works: the cast, the effects and mostly, Ridley Scott's amazing direction.  By now his 'look' has been copied so many times (and by his brother, Tony, as well) that to new viewers, the movie might seem old hat. But back in '79, this was a new, dark vision that was terrifying.  The Alien is truly a shocking, gruesome monster.  He/She's(?) your worst nightmare: a creature with no remorse, no soul.  Just a killing machine with no other agenda.  And you're trapped.  If you look at the film, there's actually very little gore (yes, except for the famous stomach bursting scene).  There is one complaint I have about 'Aliens'.  Once you have seen it, experienced it, it's done.  You will never feel the same sense of terror and doom that you feel the first time you see it.  You can marvel at how skillfully it's made and such but you'll never get that awful, nauseating feeling that it gave you upon the initial viewing.  I wish there was a way that I could have my brain wiped out of this movie (and a few others like 'The Godfather') so I could experience them fresh all over again.  There's nothing like it.  That is what makes great film.  In this regard, 'Aliens' is somewhat better.  You can enjoy the action in the film over and over again and pretty much feel the same way and catch even more that you might've missed the first time. BOTH films are excellent compliments to the other.  They're a complete set. Forget the other Alien movies.  They are not in the same league as the first two.",Null,0,1,12 November 2003
Forrest Gump," Absolute Garbage!
","I hated this movie when it came out and I still loathe it.  All the people in the audience I saw it with were 'oooo-ing' and 'ahhhh-ing' at this cornball, manipulative, simplistic garbage.  I notice now, nearly ten years later no one talks about this movie at all.  Krap is as krap does...Hollywood garbage posing as 'art'.  Ugh...save me from stuff like this...  What's strange is the Zemekis' next movie, 'Contact' was Excellent. It's one of my favorite movies.  Go figure...",Null,7,14,20 June 2003
Moulin Rouge!," It's a movie only a narcissist could love. You can have it.
","My God, there are a lot of comments about this movie.  And though I felt like there was no reason to post anything about it because of the high number and the fact that no one would likely read it, I realized that if I took that attitude, George Bush would get re-elected easily.  So, with that in mind, I absolutely hated this movie.  It's like a movie made for people with short attention spans.  It's for people who just want everything to be FABULOUS.  They can't stomach anything related to character development or any meaning.  They just want to be 'dazzled'.  This movie is NOT dazzling. The director, Baz whatever...seems to not trust a shot that lasts longer that 10 seconds.  He's so busy moving his camera around and shoving 'shots' in our faces that he gives the viewer no time to take anything in.  The shame is that there are some images that I would have liked him to dwell on longer.  It's a movie that MIGHT have worked for me if I was high on something but as it is, it made me feel depressed because of it's shallowness and my knowledge that a LOT of people were going to make a more out of this than it deserved.  People see movies like this and are so taken with 'The Look' that they immediately think 'well, it's so great looking and moves so fast that no slob could've made it'.  Well, it's the old adage that junk can be made to look like art.  I actually feel sorry for people who love this kind of movie.  They're probably as shallow as the movie.  It's a movie only a narcissist could love.  You can have it.",Null,2,4,17 July 2003
2001: A Space Odyssey," Oh, Puh-leeze...
","Good God Almighty: why do people feel the need to proclaim the greatness of this movie?  Yes, the special effects are truly awesome and it seems, at times, that Kubrick really got a kick out of them and just was playing around.  Story?  Go figure it out, huh.  Please...I hear people talking about the layered meanings and how 'deep' it is.  Nonsence.  Pretentious nonsence.  The movie is ridiculously murky about it's meaning.  If there is or was any, it was only Kubrick's meaning and he tried (and suceeded) in keeping it away from the audience.  Sometimes people hear about a movie and how much it's praised that when they see it and don't 'get it' they feel stupid.  I felt that way and for years I sang this movies praises.  But in the back of my head, I kept thinking (knowing) that I didn't get it.  Now I've seen it again and I have to stand my ground and say that there is nothing to 'get'.  Maybe it's in the book or Kubrick knows what he's trying to say but to the casual viewer or even the educated one, you will not be able to get it.  Don't bother.  See 'Dr. Strangelove' for truly great Kubrick.",Null,1,3,10 November 2003
The Emperor's New Groove," One of the Greatest Animated Comedies of All Time...SERIOUSLY.
","If it hasn't already happened, I anticipate it will: 'The Emperor's New Groove' will become a cult hit. It's spectacularly funny. Why so? Jeez, take your pick: David Spade, Eartha Kitt and Patrick Warburton do unbelievable voice jobs. And the animators have out done themselves with the gags that just keep coming. So many of them in fact that even if you've seen it once or twice, look closely. You'll see more like the NO LLAMAS sign as Kuzco and Pacha exit the restaurant. An absolute classic that is right up there with the BEST of the old Warner Brothers set. Those expecting 'uplifting' Disney fare ala 'The Lion King' will be sorely disappointed. All others will get a very unexpected and welcome surprise.",Null,0,1,22 September 2004
