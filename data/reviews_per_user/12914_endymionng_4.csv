The Hangover," I don't get it...
","This is the funniest movie of 2009 ???!!! There is not one character in this movie I feel anything other than indifference for - that is a bad thing for a comedy. You have to laugh with the characters or in rare cases at the characters. I did not laugh at all in this movie, it leaves me cold. Granted there is a rather competent storyline, which is why I still give it a six. That and the decent acting, but that and the story is wasted on crude jokes, silly cameos, obnoxious illogical behavior and just total weirdness... Go see pretty much any John Hughes comedy from the eighties and you will find both the jokes and the heart missing from this movie.",6,1,6,19 March 2010
The Happening," Homage to Triffids
","Strange how such a low key little movie, can inspire so much hatred in viewer comments, but OK I myself hate Signs, to the same degree. However this is obviously a little genre movie, with nods to a lot of 50'ies B-movie Science Fiction - Wahlberg even speaks to a plastic plant that looks like a Triffid... And as opposed to Signs which was an awful religious sermon thinly disguised as Science Fiction, this clearly tries to take science seriously and deliver a message. Yes the message is spelled out pretty much at the start and there really isn't that much excitement and tension in the movie, but it still fits quite well with the overall mood of an indifferent society in decay. So give the vitriol a rest and enjoy it as an indie update of a 50'ies B-movie Sci-Fi flick. I bet that the upcoming 2012 will be loved by all the CGI-loving masses, but it really is still the same movie on a basic level as this one...",7,9,17,30 June 2009
Signs," Religious sermon
","Is it possible that there are no coincidences??? Give me a break... This cannot possibly be a premise for a SCIENCE-Fiction movie, thats just preposterous.I like MNS's topics for movies and there is no doubt that he is a VERY skilled director of both people and cameras. Sixth Sense was extremely clever and very frightening, Unbreakable was one of the first movies to take comics seriously and was also very cleverly written. This had the potential to be a new ET or some other kind of clever Science-Fiction, and instead we get this God awful (pun intended) sermon thats supposed to tell mankind that EVERYTHING is predestined.

Click," Quintisential cop-out
","Why oh why is this made as a comedy ? Here we have a clever twist of Faustian/Scrooge mythology and we have a possibility to make a really icy satirical movie to illustrate some really existential questions of the meaning of life and how we let life go by before our eyes. All that and they ruin it with fart-jokes, dog-humping, stupid magic tricks, other silliness and some very spotty acting. Chris Walken of course has his role down in his sleep but the rest doesn't seem to know where they are most of the time. Very sad indeed. If you wanna see this movie then STOP when Sandler dies - then the impact is way better! And you don't have to sit through that awful cop-out which we all saw coming a mile away... Oh, and where did anybody get the nutty idea to put DavidHasselhoff in a movie - yikes... See any movie written by Charlie Kaufman to see how a good movie about this kind of subject is made.",7,0,1,1 April 2007
