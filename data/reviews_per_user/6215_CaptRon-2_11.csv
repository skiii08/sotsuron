Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It was good
","Not a bad movie.  I don't know why the press beat it up so much. Yeah, there was way too much of the animated character and the Ben Hur style race was longer than an Indy 500 race but otherwise a good story with strong characters.",7,0,0,21 May 1999
Inglourious Basterds," That Magic Line was crossed and ruined a potentially gripping movie
","Warning! This review contains spoilers related to specific scenes and their outcome. If you do not wish to know key plot and scenes details, STOP READING NOW.This is a hard thing to say because I really love QT. He has produced some brilliant work and some not so great stuff but I like where he is headed and generally give him more praise than my peer group.With that said, there is a magic line that everyone has that just can't be crossed. Over the years I have watched QT kill people off in unimaginable ways and accepted it as his 'art'. I'll even admit to a bit of cheering on because of the graphic nature shown on how to dispose of a few deserving characters. (SPOILER ALERT) But even with that rich history of accepted death and mayhem, the basement scene in Nadine went too far for me and I ultimately left while Hammersmark was being questioned by Lt. Aldo.I can't exactly put my finger on it but QT disrespected the audience and especially me. I have a rule for movies, any movie that says you can make up whatever rules you want but you then have to stick by them. To get out of a bad plot line, you can't suddenly invent super powers that weren't there previously or change the rules of engagement to make it to the next scene.Wilhelm (the Nazi with the sub-machine gun) followed the rules. He was made to be a character that the audience related to and liked. He complied with Lt. Aldo's request and as we learned in a previous scene with Aldo, lives are spared when rules are followed. Allowing Hammersmark to suddenly pull out a gun and shoot him multiple times to death defiled those rules and just made it clean for the next scene (no one else for Aldo to question and confirm what happened). Stupidity also reined as it was difficult to imagine that a movie actress with no military training and who was mortally wounded in a hail of gun fire had the presence of mind to grab a pistol off the ground and perfect hit Wilhelm with every single shot. QT completely screwed up that scene and raised the middle finger to his audience because he wrote himself into a corner and didn't know how to get out. Shame on him for thinking more of himself than the audience.Finally, the whole basement scene was bad from the start. Knowing that it was a dangerous, stupid place and Hammersmark had no military or spy training, the characters remain there and interact with the German soldiers and SS officer was just something that made no sense. The enlisted men drinking on a night out to celebrate a birth would not have been armed and in their heavily drunken state, wouldn't been able to shoot anyone given there were three guns trained on the SS officer and two of these guys were assassins.Bad job QT, you let us down and I am out $9.00 because you felt you could go cheap and think we were stupid enough to do what you wanted. I could care less if your next movie sweeps the Oscars and wins in every category; I will not watch it on principle alone just to not feed your money machine until to apologize to your audience.",2,14,36,1 September 2009
The Notebook," Setting a new standard for movies
","When I rate a movie on IMDb, and I have rated many, I start all movies at a 5 (average). From their a movie exceeds or fails to entertain or move its subject matter depending on the subject material being shown.Why tell you this? Because for me to give a movie a 9, you are looking at movie that is a) Oscar material; b) The kind of movie that becomes a classic.The movie is unique and has twists that some may or may not pick up on early. Its handling of a gentle subject matter the range of emotions the actors use is outstanding. James Gardner surprises us near the end of the movie with so much depth that you truly suspend all disbelief and feel as if you are secretly peeking into someone's room during a private conversation.The movie may be hard to watch for some and will pull at your heartstrings at every opportunity while not forgetting to make you laugh at other moments.As with any movie, there is always place for tweaks but this is about as perfect as a movie gets. This movie deserves your interrupted attention during the full two hours.",9,3,4,22 August 2004
The Beach," A different film for a different generation
","A surprising film with beautiful locations.  This movie deals more with the concepts of man against man, man against nature, and finally, and most importantly, man against himself.  This is more the kind of movie that the 25 - 45 year old crowd would like more that the raves of teenage girls that may be disappointed in Leo's character. The movie actually rates a 6.5 but half points aren't allowed.  Perhaps the message to be gotten from this film is that paradise is from within, not from a place.",7,0,0,12 February 2000
Shutter Island," Same old story
","It is hard to review this movie without giving away certain plot elements which would lead the reader to a final conclusion. Being sensitive to those that have not seen this movie, I will endeavor not to disclose such details.This movie was extraordinarily average in that it has been told many times and multiple levels, some often better than the sitting for this movie. While the cinematography was well done, it copied Deloris Clayborn in both format and style which surpassed this film. The cast is strong but it just can't overcome the uneven pacing of the film or the averageness of the script.As we prepared to see the movie, I informed my movie partner that the movie plot shouldn't involve certain twists else I would be very disappointed. Within the opening scene, the films ultimate conclusion was apparent so I was forced to suffer through the next two hours to see an ending I already knew. For some movies that isn't always a bad thing because getting there can be half the adventure (Lord of the Rings comes to mind) but in this case, between the poorly paced flashbacks and the current storyline, there was little to keep the audience excited.While the actors delivered strong performances, Dicaprio and Williams do not have on screen chemistry. Thinking of the awkward love scenes in Star Wars Eposides 2 & 3 with Anakin would give you some idea of how these two do not fit together.This is a Netflix movie and not something you want to pay $10 to sit through. It has been done before and a whole lot better than this movie.",5,5,11,21 February 2010
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Missing key elements
","This is a good movie that Potter fans will enjoy but it is not up to the level of the previous two. Less time is spent with the adults and there is considerably less magic by everyone except Harry. Richard Harris' replacement seems lost in his role; is he wise or lost in the school? The answer isn't clear and I wasn't sure if I even wanted to spend the time seeking the answer. The plot line is razor thin and the climax is a mere bump in the storyline. Lots of surprises as to why the second week ticket sales drops so sharply. Funny thing was is that I wasn't surprised as all. One can only hope this movie is a segway to something greater else this series has run its course. One last note, you can tell how much everyone has grown up since the last movie. Unfortunately, many of the classmates are not present in the background. Mr. Longshaft was good in the first two movies but is both absent and not even mentioned in the third.",7,1,2,15 June 2004
"Girl, Interrupted"," Impressive, well acted
","This was a fill-in movie that was impressive and very well acted. Based on a true story of a young lady who spent a year in a mental hospital in the late 1960's, this movie brings the characters to life in a touching and telling way.  The raw power these women display on the big screen is moving.  The entire move exists without a strong male lead and still maintains great quality.",8,1,1,15 January 2000
Super 8," A green movie - completely recycled
","WARNING: SPOILERS CONTAINED BELOW. DO NOT READ PAST THIS POINT IF YOU DO NOT WANT KNOW CERTAIN PLOT ELEMENTS OR SPECIFIC SCENES!Imagine if ET didn't meet Elliot but instead was captured by the government and tortured for decades. You would end up with a less than cute, very misunderstood homicidal maniac as the lead alien. There's no connection between the alien and the audience in this movie. He doesn't help or bond with the lead actor (Joe) and the only benefit of their brief encounter is that the alien decides he might be a nice person and therefore doesn't eat him. Oh lucky Joe!The real problem with the is movie its too much. There were a lot of great names listed in the writing credits but with all the ideas floating around, no one took charge and said no, let's stick to one character and their situation. Here's a rundown of just a few drama points:Joe: Mother dies in horrible accident. He is closely bonded with her and is lost. Father is town deputy and is mostly absent both emotionally and physically. He is a bright kid but a poor student (C- on his papers). He also likes the girl (Alice) whose father (Louis) is the nemesis of his father thus creating more conflict. He has a major show down with his father as he is forbidden to see Alice again (think Romeo and Juliet). He and his best friend (Charles) both like the same girl (Alice) setting off more tension. His desire to make a movie runs against his father's idea of going to summer baseball camp. Also, his dog (Lucy) runs away. As if this wasn't enough, he carries around the necklace that belonged to his dead mother. Apparently his father gave it to her when Joe was born and they somehow recovered it after a several ton steel beam crushed her. He eventually surrenders it to the alien as the last piece needed to power his new spaceship.Charles: Dysfunctional family of pure chaos. Nice, clueless parents with a teenage daughter wanting to be a slut and group of minor siblings that scream and beat on the table during mealtime for no apparent reason. Obsessed with making his movie, he is overweight and lonely for a girlfriend. Tension between Joe and Charles mount over Alice. Tension rises because Alice doesn't want to do anymore movie scenes; Joe isn't allowed to make any move movie scenes; Cary keeps blowing things up during the movie scenes; the store film tech is a dope fiend who wants to date his sister; etc.Alice: Sweet but poor girl next door (actually across the tracks). Her mother has abandoned her and her father (Louis). Her father is the town drunk, often arrested, forbids her from seeing Joe. She lives in a dirty, unkempt house. She steals her dad's car, drives without a license, and is eventually captured by the alien as her father tries to run her over with the family car. She somehow survives despite being hung upside down for days.I could keep going on and on with the various characters as some of them are far more complex and have more drama than those I listed. However, I think the point is made and this is why this movie is no ET. With ET, you had Elliot and ET. The father is MIA and you really know very little about Elliot's family outside of their physical scenes. Same for the NASA alien chaser, Elliot's friends, and classmates. Close Encounters was similar in that you know the lead scientist, Roy and his family, and the woman and her child, Barry. In Super 8, the writing team casts so many nets in the hope that the audience will somehow connect to the character but instead leaves us hoping the alien eats them all and ends their miserable suffering. You are also left with so many questions. Why was the alien being transported? Why would they transport the alien and the parts needed to rebuild his ship on the same train? How did a biology teacher who was dishonorably discharged in 1963 still have access to the alien's whereabouts and the train schedule 16 years later? How is the same officer is still in charge of the program 21 years later but was never promoted? It just endless plot holes which doesn't make this a bad movie, actually very average, but it never rises to the level of what we have come to expect from this group of writers and producers.",5,1,3,20 June 2011
The Green Mile," An Oscar Winner
","One of the best movie I saw in 1999.  If October Sky woke you up with it's sleeper approach in the theaters, The Green Mile will be your Christmas present under the tree.  Tom Hanks and the cast/crew bring together a piece of art seldom found on film.  Many thanks for giving us three hours of true entertainment.",10,0,1,23 December 1999
Rango," GNDN (Goes Nowhere, Does Nothing)
","This was a movie I wanted to like (I really did) but it just never came together and fell into the pit of average. The character development never gets past Rango so the rest of the cast is nothing more than minor support roles. Villain's are numerous but no one really stands out and it leaves you feeling like a repeat of Spiderman III, one hero, three villains, drifting story.One of the key ingredient to a successful animation is relatable characters. With Rango, the characters are so ugly that you find yourself not caring if the desert or something else swallows them up. Relating to them is next to impossible as they are too foreign to be relative.The story is about finding yourself, being a hero, finding faith, not giving up, knowing your friends, and being a fast-talker. There might have been more but with so many moments it was impossible know what this story really wanted to be. It is far better to create a simple story and add depth than to throw all your ideas on the table and try to paste them into parallel story lines that make sense.It might make a good rental for the kids although very young ones might be frightened by the snake scenes but its not worth movie ticket priced. Credit to ILM for trying but their story writing has a long way too go.",4,15,34,10 March 2011
Gangs of New York," Gangs in on the road to trouble
","Perhaps expectations can be raised too high before seeing a film that leaves the viewer feeling cheating.  Gangs in New York came with high praise and loads of expectation but I found the critics wrong and my expectations left at the ticket counter.The acting was wonderful and we are quickly reminded of the star power behind Leo and Daniel. Their ability to deliver and take second stage to allow Diaz to truly shine made the 2 1/2 hour movie worth my time but little more.  Martin's script doesn't ever find its mark and spends too much time trying to develop a plot that is simply not believable. We muddle through Leo's character never really feeling his pain or understanding his complex motives. When we finally reach what should be the climax, a secondary plot reveals itself and steals what would have been an acceptable and richly sought after ending.While I normally write longer and more detail reviews, I am careful not to reveal spoilers and will therefore leave my above comments brief and to the point.  I rated this movie a '5' - begin average and nothing more.",5,1,3,28 December 2002
