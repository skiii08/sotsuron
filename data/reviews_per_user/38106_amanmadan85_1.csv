Skyfall," Is MI6 that rookie?
","Bond films are action entertainers and as action entertainers go, you must allow some leverage in terms of suspension of disbelief. But this movie took it too farAs I went to watch this movie, it already had an 8.3 on IMDb with over 15,000 votes. The critics reviews are also highly positive (some calling it one of the greatest Bond movies). I had higher hopes also given Javier Bardem was the main antagonist. Like I said, I don't mind pure entertainment for an action movie, I quite enjoy the Fast and Furious series as pure action entertainers.My problem with this movie was it seemed like MI6 was being played for dumb throughout. There was one illogical scene and it was followed by another mind boggling where either MI6 would take a stupid call or the opponents would simply think them to be a bunch of useless amateurs and actually succeed with their plan. Now, the basic plot is completely fine and intriguing, it is the scenarios that were a complete let down. Sure, Bardem's character was intelligent, but it does not mean MI6 has to play dumb and let him get the best of the agency. Also, one generic point against most movies portraying cyber crime, you just show someone being a genius and don't even need to explain how one achieved his/her goals. But usually other such movies get canned by critics and viewers alike, strange everyone is looking the other way for this movie. Excessive romanticism with combination of Craig as Bond + Mendes is quite apparent, added no doubt by stellar performance by BardemFor a series that projects adventures of one of the greatest spies in the world working for an enviable intelligence agency, the movie should have been slightly more cerebral, have some deduction or logic to arrive at certain conclusions rather than simply a series of action sequences wherein it never seemed like the bad guys were able to get one up against the best, but go one up because there were giant loopholes just waiting to be exploited.Quite a disappointing movie with the only highlight being the title track and a few locales",3,35,72,1 November 2012
