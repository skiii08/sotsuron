Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," How did such a horrible movie get made?
","I grew up in the era of the first three and though Return of the Jedi was very flawed I love watching those first three. I was excited to see this movie. I saw it in the first few days it was out and thought it was an embarrassment on so many levels. The story, the voices, the special effects, the story, the characters, were all terrible. It had so few redeeming qualities and none that constitute mention.It comes on TV today and I decide to give it another shot. It is worse than I remember it. It is unwatchable. I look on IMDb and see it has a decent rating, which has to be because many fans have inflated the ratings. I can only compare this movie to torture. It is sad to see the original creativity to fall to such a low level. It is so sad. It is terrible, terrible, terrible.",1,1,3,5 April 2008
District 9," Wow, that was refreshing!
",A tremendously crafted piece of work. I can't want to see it again and again. Not many movies get me out of the house on opening weekend. I decided I'd go see this given the great reviews. I was blown away and might go again this weekend.I don't own a TV by choice. I knew absolutely nothing of this movie. I went to IMDb today and saw the rating it had received and decided not to read anything about it and just go see it. Amazing piece of cinema.I don't want to get into any plots points. I will say it is refreshing to see a sci-fi movie that is not based in NYC. I'm very tired of seeing NYC be blown up. I was also happy to see it not take place in America at all.,10,9,19,14 August 2009
