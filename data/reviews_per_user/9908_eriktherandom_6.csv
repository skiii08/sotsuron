The Avengers," Good, But Not Great.
","There seems to be a lot of hype about this movie, so I went with a friend when it first came out. Sure, it packed theaters, but after seeing it two additional times with two other friends, I come to the conclusion that it's just an 'okay' movie.I understand a lot of people are going to say, 'Oh you're stupid this movie is great!' but at least hear me out.Let's get started with the special effects. Hands down some of the best I've ever seen in film. Giant aliens ripping apart buildings was pure awesome. However, I saw this movie only ONCE in 3D. Why only 1/3 in 3D? Because the 3D was godawful. It gave me a headache, and being as it was done post-processing, it didn't look convincing, not that 3D ever really does.Where the movie falls short is the random times of corny, clich√©d dialog, and just downright bad acting at some points. Cobie Smulders, as much as I love her in How I Met Your Mother, was terrible. Her lines sounded scripted, and she simply existed to try to add a more surreal element to the film. Basically over-emphasizing how dangerous things were.The movie was far too long in my opinion. I noticed kids in the theater starting to get fussy toward the middle of the movie because of how long it takes to setup the plot. A lot of people were confused as to how the Tesseract really worked and how it played a substantial part of the plot. Too much terminology for people to remember, to be quite honest. They should have skipped more scientific discussion in place of better character development.There really was little character development. Yes, the team fought, then they made up, then they fought again, only to come back and win. That's as far as the character development goes. If you watched ALL of the Marvel movies, the first hour is rather pointless simply because all it does is establish the background of the characters.The action scenes occurred right toward the last 40 minutes, and were well directed. You felt at true sense of teamwork. The biggest problem was, no character except for Ironman was in any 'real' danger. The characters felt like they were just non-stop combat machines and you never really feel a 'on the edge of your seat' moment except for when Stark disposes of the nuke.The balance of drama and comic relief is nearly PERFECT. Tony Stark of course was the majority of the comedy.All in all, the movie was fun to watch, but I certainly wouldn't say it's a cinematic masterpiece. While the special effects and great cast of characters bring this movie to life, it suffers with a dull plot that can leave you dozing off at a few points.",7,2,8,15 June 2012
Saving Private Ryan," Possibly The Best WWII Movie Ever Made!
","From the word 'go', I felt immersed in the scene of the D-Day landings. These scenes were indeed frightening, but terrific all at the same time. The camera work was just excellent, and the acting was superb.One thing I noticed from people leaving comments, many people hold a hostility towards this film because it makes American's look like heroes. This is totally understandable, as we do often gratify ourselves too much. But, this movie was based on the lives of American's in the war, and the writer and Spielberg tried to make it as unbiased as they can, but the fact is more people look at the American fronts more than any other. This is a sad fact as nearly all countries suffered from this great (but yet horrible) war. It is clearly seen in the movie that surrenders of the German side were horrible because our American troops executed some of them, that stirred me in the wrong direction but yet it is true.And as for previous comments, the English and Canadians did help clear the beaches, but didn't play a huge role.Setting the issues before aside, this was possibly one of the best movies ever made. I know spots can get dry sometimes as will all movies, but other than that it kept me interested, and entertained.",10,2,3,13 February 2009
The Hurt Locker," Ignore The Others, This One Deserves It.
","I noticed a lot of people angry at this film over the simple fact that Avatar did not take the award. It's an understandable thing, a multi-million dollar film compared to a lower budget film, it just seems to not make sense.However, don't let the low budget fool you, this film delivers. The camera angles are perfect, the story fits well with the characters, and I found myself on the edge of my seat more than one time. Don't get me wrong, it's a very disturbing film if you think about all the ways people do sick things, but it's a masterpiece in its own right.Unlike other war movies, there isn't a squad that eventually learns to cope, as there is always the tension between the squad in the film, and the fact that it isn't two hours of 'glorified' patriotism and shooting, makes it all the more better.If you like action films, but yet like something a bit more emotional and slow paced, perfect movie. If you're looking for a shooter movie, watch elsewhere.",10,6,17,10 May 2010
Avatar," Great Theater Film, But Suffers At Home.
","When I first saw this in theaters, I thought it was one of the most pleasing visual experiences I've ever encountered. While it is amazing visually, story-wise it lacks. A lot of people are giving this movie 10/10 ratings over the simple fact that the visual work looks nice. Problem was, this movie was made for the sole intention of being 3D, and seen in 3D.So naturally, since I enjoyed it in theaters, I thought I would purchase the DVD for enjoyment at home. I took some time tonight to watch it, and realized that I wasn't as wowed as I was when I first saw it. Perhaps it's because I don't have a $6000 3DTV, but rather I watched it on a 50 inch plasma.Here's some of the problems with this film: First, the storyline is unoriginal. It was very well written and put together, but the base concept was about acceptance, and respecting that other people are different than you, that doesn't mean you can take what's theirs. This storyline has been done 300 other times before. Maybe it would have seemed more original if the script wasn't shelved for 9 years.Second, too much was crammed into a film. It started slow, didn't get to the point fast enough, and much of the story from the beginning is easily forgettable. Let's face it, the battle scenes where the awesome, but that's about it. The rest of the movie is easily forgettable. I'm not one for sappy love stories, but there could have been more character development within the relationship of the two.Third, much of the storyline was filled with plot holes. Jake 'died' within 40 seconds of lacking oxygen, yet the Colonel was able to fire a whole clip of ammunition and fire a pistol at the chopper. Makes no sense.Fourth, some of the story was poorly acted. I'm convinced that it was the story itself, and not the actors. You can easily tell that some of the lines were rather cheesy, and being that Jake really thought he was part of their world, it felt awkward when he was trying to talk like them about spirits and whatnot.I suppose it's not a huge turn-off, but the story could have been easily compressed down into 1 hour and 40 minutes or so. To me, there was too much, the story didn't make sense at times due to plot holes, and there was virtually limited character development, and I feel like it was far too long. When you are getting sore from sitting in the same place too long, that's when a film is too long.",7,2,6,7 May 2010
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," People Clearly Don't Know Good Entertainment.
","The first Transformers was amazing, but to my surprise, this one was equally amazing.I will admit that the action scenes were too close together, but that's a simple mistake that is easily made.The visual effects were just plain AMAZING for this film, can't wait until it comes out on BluRay.This movie was a bit more serious than the last one (but still funny nonetheless), and to me really was underrated.I did feel a lack of character personality with the bots, but other than that superb acting by nearly all he characters.Job well done.",10,7,16,2 July 2009
Toy Story 3," An Excellent Use Of 3D, As Well With A Great Story Line
","I noticed that most films in 3D today, wow audiences by usage of superb 3D effects. Here's the problem, movies are now so much based on fancy 3D, they loose focus of storyline and character personality / development.In Toy Story, I noticed the focus on 3D was minimal, as they focused more on the story, and telling the story in a way that it will be special.Essentially, the whole gang (with the exception of a few) is there, and you've got the classic scenario we all go through as kids, and that is that you eventually have to put away your toys, and face the fact that you are growing up. There is a special connection between Andy and his toys, namely Woody. A connection that many kids have with at least one toy.The story has some jokes that adults understand, as well as ones kids understand. When you can have that in a story, you're obviously going to have a well put together plot with plenty of good jokes.The balance of 3D and story was PERFECT. It had some nice 3D moments, but generally it's a movie you can enjoy equally as much in normal 2D view.Toy Story is the only series I can say that I liked equally the same for ALL of the films. Each has superb writing, and each has a good cast as well as likable characters.Sadly, all good things must end, way to go out with a bang.",10,4,7,22 June 2010
