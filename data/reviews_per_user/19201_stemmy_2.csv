Ali," Not the greatest of all times!
","This was an ordinary film about an extraordinary individual. It's a good effort, but falls short in virtually every area. Will Smith has a decent stab at Ali, getting the voice just about spot on. He's worked out but is still about 30 pounds shy. But you never BELIEVE this is Ali you're watching. It's always Will Smith and I found myself expecting Carlton Banks to run on and do a little dance.The fight sequences are beutifuly shot and almost faithfully recreated. But the film just seems to cover a decade without filling any gaps. Ali beats Liston, suddenly he's married with kids, refusing army induction, losing to Frazier, beating Foreman and hang on - it's ten years on and he looks no different. To anyone who doesn't know about Ali it's as if all this happened in six months!If you want to know about the real Ali - read the books, watch the real interviews, and watch the fights. Now, that's entertainment!",5,0,0,13 March 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Yes! It's a cracker!
","The collective sigh of relief on opening night by Tolkien fans worldwide must surely have knocked the Earth slightly off it's axis!I know they've missed a lot out (do we really miss Tom Bombadil and his curly shoes?) and I realise they've chopped and changed the plot but from beginning to end this is just superb. This film far exceeded my expectations. When it finished I wanted to just sit there and wait for 'The Two Towers' to come on!  Can I wait a year? Well, if the next is as good as this, it'll be worth it.",10,1,1,9 February 2002
