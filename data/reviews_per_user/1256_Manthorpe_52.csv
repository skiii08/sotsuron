Scarface," Tides of greed.
","One of my favorite films of all time.Tony Montana and his friend Manny have come to Miami from Cuba as political refugees in the early '80's....to take over the cocaine empire and rule the world. Quite simply, the story is about greed, excess, power, and violence....ahhh the American Dream. Al Pacino pulls out all his skills and gives his performance of his lifetime here, he becomes Tony Montana, literally. Quite simply, one of the best acting performances I've seen, if not the very best. How he nailed that accent is a mystery to me, and while it's convincing, it's also completely hilarious! There are more quotable lines for this film than any film, period. How some people do not enjoy Pacino in this film completely baffles me, although much of the discontent for this film comes from the fact that he has an accent, and I think some just have a hard time getting used to it. Without the accent, I don't believe I'd like it as much. He's just one bad mofo.The story itself is fairly simple, rising to the top can be just as fast as dropping to the bottom. And even everything in the world can't make some people happy, when by all rights it should. Filmed in the '80's, it is unmistakably hard to ignore. The clothes, music and cars have the decade of excess written all over them, which is perfect for this film in particular. And just like the '80's themselves, Scarface screams of excess as Tony quickly rises to the top of the drug empire. No one stays on top forever.
Although not a mob movie, one of the best damn gangster movies made. Ridiculously highly recommended.",10,1,2,29 June 2004
Alien 3," Weak
","I blame the downfall of the Alien films partly to this movie. It's when the movies went from being masterpieces to pieces of s***e. It's not as bad as Regurgitation but it's leaning that way. More towards that than towards it's predecessor.Weaver is almost unbearable too look at with her shaved head, and Hicks and Newt are dead. That right there is enough to p*** me off. This movie could have been so much better than this. And come on now, a prison setting? Please. Don't waste my time.I usually like David Fincher so I can forgive him for this, but it still stinks. 6/10.",6,301,315,2 January 2004
Catch Me If You Can," Slick, Feel Good Movie
","I normally don't like Leonardo in films after that disgrace known as Titanic was released (even though it didn't really have anything to do with him), however I'm glad that did not sway me from watching this movie.Possible SPOILERS: maybe, not sure yet.I like to keep it simple. Frank Abagnale, Jr. is a slick counterfeiter/conman with Tom Hanks from the FBI always hot on his heels. Based on a true story. Frank had a troubled family life and after a surprising separation of his parents after his Mom has problems keeping her legs together. Frank loses it and decides to run away, only to return to visit his father, Christopher Walken, from time to time. I especially enjoyed Walken in this film. His relationship with his son, Leo, in the movie was rather realistic and reminded me of mine with my father. Walken fans will enjoy seeing him in this film, even though he doesn't play his normal evil self. I also enjoyed Hanks and Leo's relationship in the movie as it resembled a father son relationship. Frank cares for Carl(Hanks), and Carl cares about Frank, even though it is his job to catch him and throw him in prison. And you can't help but to admire how Frank always outsmarts Carl throughout the film.Being a Spielberg film, one can expect the typical happy ending. And although I normally don't buy into such fluff, it worked for me in this film. It has a few quirky moments, but overall it was a good effort and I would enjoy watching it again. If you like any of the cast in any of their other films, I recommend this movie. Overall, I give it an 8.",8,1,2,10 November 2003
Minority Report," The Patriot Act...evovled.
","One of the better science fiction films that has come out in the past few years, I was pleasantly surprised by Minority Report. The visuals are simply stunning and really get your imagination going. Not only are they nice to look at, they're fairly probable. I especially enjoyed the cars that drive themselves and take you up to your apartment or condo. The retina scanning cameras that are everywhere are also very realistic. The US government is already trying to implement biological modes of identification besides simply having you give your fingerprint at the DPS station to renew your driver's license. In all actuality, it's fairly feasible, even scary. Although the film takes place in the not so distant future, it's more like 1984.Tom Cruise is a hit or miss for me, sometimes he's enjoyable and sometimes I want to crush his head in a vise. It always seems to be a toss up, but he does a decent job here. Colin Farrell outshines him though as the investigator of Pre-Crime who's trying to dig up dirt on Cruise's character, although his role is minimal. You really do hate him at first because of his character, which is a good sign that he did a nice job...even if he reminds you of a gibbon monkey or a man in a Gillette Mach 3 commercial. Let's just pray suspenders aren't around in the future. Overall a very entertaining film from Spielberg with some excellent action sequences and a few decent twists. But since it is Spielberg, you always know how the film will end. Nice and pretty, everything's fine and you get breakfast in bed while winning the lottery. If he didn't always end films the same way, it might make his movies more enjoyable as you wouldn't be able to predict what type of ending they'd have. That said though, extremely entertaining but could have used a less goody two shoes ending...still a grade A sci-fi film.",8,1,2,17 June 2004
Chinatown," Bring you down to Chinatown.
","Yet once again Jack Nicholson shows us how it's done by simply doing what he does best, playing himself. Chinatown is a unique and fairly impressive noir piece that I was only recently able to see. Much like L.A. Confidential, CT throws us right into the mix of the old days, very convincingly, through great cinematography and perfect set pieces.  Chinatown is fairly effective creating a mysterious atmosphere by using shady characters of questionable backgrounds and a story that holds much more to it than what's merely on the surface. Somewhat hard to follow when compared to most films, you really must pay attention during this one. This is not one to get up and go to the bathroom during unless you hit the pause button. I found this slightly annoying at first, but then it quickly grew on me. I like how everything here isn't spelled out for you in bold letters. One must pay attention and piece things together for themselves, which is exactly how a mystery should be. It keeps you on your toes. You never seem to know which direction the story is going to take you next.Technically, the film is close to perfect. The cinematography, the score, and the acting are all top notch. All of these elements are combined into a screaming mystery flick. Some may be tempted to get bored at some point, but don't, you must pay attention. I personally enjoyed it quite well and think it's an excellent film. My one and only qualm with it though is the seemingly anti-climactic ending that, while realistic, simply comes out of nowhere without warning. I felt a tad let down at the end after all of that buildup, but the more I think about it, the more I actually like it. This, as I have heard from many people, is not a film to judge on it's first viewing, but one that must be viewed several times in order for the viewer to absorb everything. For this reason alone, and the fact that I've seen it only once, I can't bring myself to take too much away from it simply because of my one qualm with it. I must view it again and see if I like it better. I think I will do just that.Overall, a great, beautiful, classic noir that won't soon be forgotten.",9,1,3,19 July 2004
The Big Lebowski," This is just my opinion, man.
","Jeffrey Lebowski a.k.a. The Dude, has been confused by kidnappers as the husband of their victim who happens to have the same name, and as a result he's pulled into the mess against his will to clear his name and to get to the bottom of things. With the help of his slightly psychotic friend Walter (Goodman), they do their best to solve the mysterious event. And it all started with a rug that tied the room together...Jeff Bridges as The Dude here was simply an astonishing surprise to say the least. Never would I have pictured him or even felt he was capable enough to pull off this quirky character. Hats off Dude, and sorry for underestimating you. John Goodman's performance as Walter was another pleasant surprise as the hardcore Vietnam vet who cannot forget his buddies that died face down in the muck. There's a certain chemistry between the two that would have been all but impossible to foresee before getting started. The casting crew must've known something I didn't because it really makes the film.
What more can be said of the Coen brothers? They simply know how to keep it simple yet extremely entertaining and wholly original. It is a rather short film but never lets up when it comes to the laughs and the characters. Definitely one of my favorite comedies of all time and I know I'm not alone. The dream sequences alone are worth the rental.If white trash, Vietnam vets, nihilists, bowling, and smoking jays sounds appealing to you...then this would be a wonderful addition to your film collection. No room for improvement. 10/10'You mind if I do a jay?'",10,1,2,5 February 2004
Fight Club," Marvelous mischief.
","A somewhat anti-American message about the lack of need for materialism and the need to destroy it, with a powder keg. I first put off seeing Fight Club because of the name, it sounded stupid, and the type of people that were telling me how great it was weren't exactly those with discerning film tastes. Shows how much I know. I'm glad I didn't let that prevent me from seeing this original and thought-provoking film. It's actually not really even about fighting....it is but it isn't....it's something much more. Marvelous, simply marvelous.America is a herd of consumers that seek material items they don't really need for their own personal reasons. Whether it's because of greed, materialism, or power...it doesn't really matter. The fact of the matter is that we really don't need them even if we think we do, this is what Fight Club is really about. Without spoiling anything in the story itself, Norton's character, an insomniac white collar worker bee, has become extremely unhappy with his life although he has everything he 'needs'. But does he? Tyler Durden (Pitt) is an interesting stranger who has absolutely nothing as far as material possessions go, but he does seem much richer. Is he really? It all gets interesting when the two join together to make a fight club of sorts to basically feel more alive and see what happens when they push things to the limit. In comes the mischief and a great film.Some people seem to despise Brad Pitt but when he's in movies as great as this one, it makes you wonder if it's just a petty jealousy thing. Yes, he's good looking, who cares? Is he a pretty boy? By all means. That doesn't change the fact that he's an excellent actor with excellent film choices. One of those excellent choices was Fight Club. He plays his psychotic character with ease and believability. Probably my favorite of all his roles. Edward Norton is also a perfect choice for the film and delivers yet another perfect performance. Both actors give flawless performances that make it impossible to imagine anyone else in their shoes. There's also a strange screen chemistry between the two that I'd have never predicted.Some have complained about the violence in FC. Is it violent? Yes. Is it real? No. If violence in film bothers you, then you're missing out on some seriously great films, including this one.FC is a truly beautifully shot movie. The cinematography and innovative scenes come out of nowhere and are extremely entertaining. I'm certain that I've never seen a film shot quite like this one. Even the opening credits sequence is quite impressive. It all adds up to one of the most stylish films in years. Combine that with a truly original and entertaining story with excellent acting and masterful direction...with a dash of humor, and you have simply one of the most entertaining films one can watch. Without giving away anything you may have in store, that is all I will say about that. It is all but perfect. I would elaborate, but I would not dare.Very highly recommended.",10,0,1,23 June 2004
Citizen Kane," Generously, 8/10
","For the record, I despise writing reviews for classic films, particularly the old ones. For one, it is impossible for me to write this in perspective to the the time it was released as my parents weren't even born yet, much less myself. Two, it's impossible to enjoy it to it's fullest because of the inherent aging of the techniques and effects used. With that taken into consideration, 'Citizen Kane' being a film sixty-three years old, I was immensely impressed with the environmental and makeup effects. It's simple amazing that they were able to do what they did in that time period. I have seen recent low budget movies that don't even hold up to this, and that's sad. CK set a massive number of precedents when it was released; not only technical precedents, but precedents in the amount of control given directors in that time. Welles basically had full and complete control which was simply unheard of and it seems to have worked to his benefit. However, given the many precedents it set, the film didn't totally and completely impress me, and I have no doubt in my mind that it's a result of my growing up when I did and seeing the films I have seen. Many, many films have used the same techniques since, many that are more entertaining. While I found most of the story and screenplay extremely interesting, it drags it's feet in several places which was distracting. And although the acting performances were fairly impressive, I had serious problems with Dorothy Comingore's performance as Thomas' wife. She didn't convince me. Her performance was forced at times, and simply satisfactory at others. Welles was easily the standout in the acting department, I'll say.I will also be willing to admit that maybe my expectations were a tad higher than they should have been; me expecting to be blown away. I liked it, I really did, and I have nothing but respect for the precedents it set....especially in comparison to other films made in the same era. It just had problems with entertaining me at times. However, despite my problems with it, I feel 'Citizen Kane' is a truly great film, just not one of my favorites. I think most of it's fame comes from it's technical brilliance as opposed to it's entertainment value. With that said, I'll give it 8/10, generously.",8,0,8,15 November 2004
Memento," Perfection in film.
","Leonard Shelby suffers from a brain injury he received when he tried to stop a pair of burglars that had broken into his house and raped and killed his wife one fateful night. He cannot form new memories. He can remember everything clearly before the accident, but nothing afterwards. He must figure out a way to live his life with this condition and to catch the person or persons responsible. Can he do it, and if he does, how will he remember it?First off, I would like to say that Memento is probably my favorite movie of all time as of yet, and not without reason. It's probably the movie with the most reply value that I can even imagine. Every time I watch it, I notice something new or come up with a new theory on things. The acting is as good as it gets and all the characters were cast perfectly. Guy Pearce is one of my favorite actors simply because of this movie and L.A. Confidential alone. Joe P. plays the perfect good cop/bad cop and Carrie Ann Moss is very convincing as the revenge riddled, manipulative woman.
Everything about Memento is flawless. The script, acting, dialog, camera work, editing, direction, story.everything. This is as good as it gets folks..to such a degree that I seriously almost feel sorry for the people who don't get this movie or understand it, as they're missing something so spectacular. Some people have even gone as far to say that the movie contains plot holes. I beg to differ and must presume that these such persons aren't too quick. There's a method to the madness. Of course the movie has holes in it which open up almost endless possibilities, but that is a reflection of the fact that Leonard did not have all the details either. His file for instance. We are left with fragments of 'memories' just like Leonard, and are forced to actually think and try to figure it out with him. Some people don't like to think I guess, or are completely incapable. Maybe it would have been better for them if Lawrence Fishburne rambled on about all of the details for about 45 minutes with sunglasses on, all while pooching his lips out. The fact that we don't know all of the details and that the story's origin and ending do have infinite possibilities is one of the reasons that I love this film so much and is why it's so great. Brilliant, simply brilliant. Had it been done accidentally or out of tactlessness then I would think the exact opposite, but that is certainly not the case here.Sometimes a `gimmick', like filming a movie to be watched out of chronological order, can be pretentious and unnecessary, as we see in movies like 21 Grams. However, Memento's story was meant to be told this way. It's another technique that adds to the audience's lack of knowledge about what has happened in the past, exactly like Leonard's. These techniques all contribute to getting the audience to care about Leonard, and it works. Although the film is viewed backwards, all of the scenes slightly overlap each other so it's easy to follow. The director has used two different types of scenes here as well. We have the color, reverse sequence scenes that show what Leonard has been through.and we have seemingly chronological black and white scenes in which we are given tidbits of information about Leonard and his condition as he talks to an anonymous person on the telephone. Truly masterful work. This movie will leave you thinking about it for a very long time. I still like to think about the possibilities...Flawless. 10.5/10  people should be strapped in a chair and hooked to a plethysmograph and forced to watch it over and over and over..",10,0,2,5 February 2004
Alien: Resurrection," Weak, bloated and unnecessary
","Once in a lifetime a movie series like Alien comes along with a great story, intense action, great acting etc. And also, someone always seems to get their filthy little, greedy paws on them after they are completed and have basked in their glory. This is one of those movies.Possible spoilers, but the movie will ruin itself...Alien: Regurgitation is a complete fraud of the Alien franchise. It doesn't fit with the rest of the films and puts a black mark on a wonderful series of movies. Even though Alien 3 was questionable and not nearly the same caliber as the first two, it completely blows away this turd. I think one of the many wonders of the world for me is why Weaver even read this script, much less decided to accept it. Shameful.I won't even give a plot summary for this crap. The plot is weak, and the action looks like John 'can't make a decent movie' Woo directed it. Not only that, what the hell is up with the spooge alien with a sad/happy face?! I mean, what in the hell?! Not only that, they couldn't even come up with a better way to kill it off...they did they exact same thing as they did in the first two movies!!! Lame.Movies like this make me hate Hollywood and it's unquenchable thirst for money. For me, this movie does not exist in the Alien series and will be the reason why I will never buy the Quadrilogy....I'd be embarrassed to have this movie in my collection.Weak, bloated, unnecessary, and completely gay. 5/10. <----it would've been lower without the aliens in it. It also would've been lower had I written this before voting....blast!Do not expect anything of this movie except to see aliens.",3,0,1,2 January 2004
12 Monkeys," Awesome Time Travel concept.
","The Army of the Twelve Monkeys, with a psychotic leader (Pitt), is responsible for releasing a deadly virus into the human race resulting in the death of 5 billion people in the year 1996. A time traveler (Willis) from the year 2035 must go back into the past to collect the virus in it's pure form, before it mutates, and help return the human race to the surface of the earth, in the year 2035. The survivors have been forced to live underground to prevent from being infected and animals released by the Twelve Monkeys are now free to roam the surface once more.Minor Spoiler Alert:12 Monkeys, from the very creative Terry Gilliam, is one of the best, if not the best, time travel movie I've seen. It is produced with only one minor flaw (Stowe somehow remembers Willis) and is easily forgivable considering the rest of the film and the acting performances. Instead of going back into the past to change the future, the concept of this movie is to go back into the past to get information to help the future at it's present state, if that makes any sense. After all, if one were to go back in time to change something from happening, what would happen to the people that have their time altered? They wouldn't remember, or even be the same conscious being, so what would be the point of that? In a sense, it really wouldn't matter to them, not directly anyways. I've always had trouble with this in time travel films, and the reason I like this movie's plot so much is because it's premise is, `you cannot change something that has already happened.' Very clever, and less confusing. Unlike the Terminator movies, were they simply try to change the past altogether and prevent the future from ever happening.The acting performances are quite convincing, particularly Brad Pitt's version of a schizo-psychotic crazy person with a lazy eye, and especially when they're in the asylum. He was brilliant in his role as the head of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys, Jeffrey Goines, and you begin to believe he's really crazy. Willis and Stowe do a great job as well.Fans of Terry Gilliam can expect his usual dark industrial/apocalyptic vision of the future as seen in Brazil. And considering the behavior and nature of the human race, it isn't all that far fetched to the open mind. This is a must for Gilliam fans, pure and simple. 9/10",9,0,0,12 January 2004
The Others," Fairly decent and original concept.
","I'll have to admit that I put off watching this movie despite being told by several friends that it was pretty good and worth checking out. That's mostly because 'scary' movies usually turn out to be nothing but crap riddled, cheap thrill fests with terrible acting by actors just looking for their next handout...not to mention directors that care nothing about the progress of their careers. That and the slew of B- horror/thriller movies that seemed to come out very close together along with this movie made me a little apprehensive. However, I was pleasantly surprised.First off, I'd like to say that I have yet to see The Sixth Sense, so I cannot comment on any similarities between the two films that I have heard exist.Grace (Kidman) and her two young photosensitive (X.P.) children live in a sprawling old house together in England in the 1940's and await the return of their father and husband who went off to fight the Germans in WWII. As a result of the children's very rare and dangerous skin condition, all of the house's curtains must be shut during the day and all of the doors must be closed and locked to prevent any accidental solar exposure to the children. Despite the warnings from her children and new found servants, strange things begin to happen in the house which Grace chooses not to accept or investigate...partly because of her zealous religious beliefs which leave her closed minded and ignorant to things outside her psychological realm of thinking. Sooner or later, she will have to come to terms with what's going on...Kidman's acting is admirable in this movie, and although I usually have a hard time enjoying her films, I felt she did a very decent job here. I think she was born to play a stubborn, hard nosed, uptight tart, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. I especially enjoyed the acting performances from both of the children. Both are talented child actors and were definitely helped by the script which captured what it's like to be a child. I was constantly reminded of my own childhood amongst the belittling and teasing between the two, and of course the naive and adorable fears. The film is shot beautifully and has a lot of atmosphere, partly due to the fact that since the children are photosensitive, the house must always be dark, and the director definitely likes to play with that. There's something else that helps the film's atmosphere as well, the fog, which obviously adds to the general spookiness. But I'll leave that one alone as it plays an important role herein. The score helps as well, and is well placed and executed.Overall, I found this to be a very respectable and enjoyable film in almost all respects, and I no longer consider Kidman a pretty face begging for nude scenes. I felt it was very well thought out, and if it weren't for a minor plothole involving Grace's husband, I would have ranked it higher.
Easily a solid 8/10.",8,75,106,23 January 2004
L.A. Confidential," An instant classic.
","L.A. Confidential has one of the best screenplay's ever written, which is complimented by excellent castingwhich produced some top-notch performances from some virtual unknowns at the time. Guy Pearce, Russel Crowe, Kevin Spacey, and James Cromwell were all perfectly cast for this film. Kim Basinger won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her role, although some of her fellow cast members were more deserving of an award. Had the Hype-tanic not been released the same year, this film would have completely swept the Oscars. Damn undeserving Titanic. Oh well. That just goes to show that the Academy doesn't necessarily reflect respect where it's deserved. Even though this film scored a few, the Titanic swept the 1997 awards, including Best Picture. My heart will go onNO!Even without the compliment of an A-grade screenplay, the acting performances are truly worth recognition. This was the first movie I had the pleasure of watching Guy Pearce in and I was blown away. He really seems to fit his part in this film and you really feel the emotions that the other characters have towards him. Russell Crowe and Kevin Spacey also fit right in and provide excellent performances. Spacey easily pulls off being the smart ass showboat, and Crowe is very convincing as the reactionary, muscle-bound 'bad' cop. James Cromwell also plays the chief of detectives flawlessly. And although Kim Basinger won Best Supporting Actress, I must assume that her competition was laughable at best. She plays a hooker, wow. Not that she didn't do it well, I just didn't feel it was all that deserving of an Oscar. I mean, how hard is it to play a tramp? But that's not her fault, or anyone else's involved in the picture....and it certainly doesn't take away from anything here.Curtis Hanson really shows everyone how it's done with this one, pulling off truly masterful directing techniques in every aspect. There isn't any area where I feel he could have improved. Everything flows perfectly and evenly, and the moods and pace are controlled very well. The general noir feeling he was going for was done nothing short of impeccable. The story itself is extremely entertaining and has a great ending, but I won't comment on that....you can see for yourself. I will simply say that the story is one of the best I've come across in a long time. Overall, simply perfect in every way and will easily become a classic.Definitely a great addition to anyone's collection. 10/10",10,3,6,2 February 2004
The Terminator," Unforgettable, truly original sci-fi
","In the near future, a powerful computer run by SkyNet is entrusted to make almost every computerized aspect of human life fully automated, and is in charge of almost everything including missle defense. The computer begins to 'think' for itself and sees the human race as a threat, and decides to attempt to wipe it out by starting a worldwide nuclear war, killing most of the world's population. The survivors are left to fight the machines and attempt to regain control. They are lead by a powerful man named John Connor who teaches them to fight back against the machines whilst on the brink of extinction. The humans almost succeed in exterminating the machines that have kept them slaves for decades, but as a result SkyNet sends a cybernetic organism called a terminator back in time to kill John Connor's mother before he is even born, thus removing the threat of him altogether. John Connor decides this cannot happen and decides to send back a soldier to the past to protect his mother, and himself, from the terminator. The fight for the future will be fought in the past. Man vs. machine. Sorry for that, like it was needed.Very possibly the best action film of all time, with the exception of it's sequel, and executed with a bunch of no name actors and a shoestring budget...not to mention a director with almost no experience, it's an amazing feat to say the least. It's been 20 years since it's release, and while some special effects have aged inevitably, the effect of the movie itself has not. Linda Hamilton, Arnold (I'm not even going to try and spell that last name), and especially, the cult following worthy Michael Biehn for his characters alone, all give good performances. The film has a few very minor flaws, but is not reflective onto the enjoyment or quality factor. The action and the story are all paced nicely, has excellent direction, the characters have are well developed, and the overall content is quite impressive. The movie is fairly simple, but is extremely effective. Terminator has been deemed a classic and respectfully so. I'm sure it will provide a great movie experience for myself and others for many years to come. The idea of a machine sent to kill you that is all but unstoppable, without any remorse or hesitation, is very chilling and is one of the film's main reasons for such success. I don't need to say any more, you've seen it. Needless to say, this film started many careers of those involved. Classic.An absolute must for any action or sci-fi fan's collection.",10,0,1,11 February 2004
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Mein Fuhrer!
","Stanley Kubrick's classic satire, Dr. Strangelove, continues to this day to show us simply how silly war and particularly the idea of nuclear war really is, but with comedy, very dark comedy. Chock full of excellent actors and with the direction from one of the most talented of all time, Dr. Strangelove is a brutal powerhouse of a film that few can compete with. Made and released during the Cold War, it definitely had much more of an impact back then than it does now because the film is about just that...the Cold War and it's ludicrous implications. All hell breaks loose when a general gone mad, General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden), decides to take things into his own hands and start a nuclear war in retaliation to the Soviet's 'attack' of implementing fluoride into our water supply, thereby poisoning the entire American population's bodily fluids. As the imminent threat comes closer and the planes carrying the warheads travel closer to their targets destined for complete annihilation, it quickly becomes apparent that stopping the attack might not be as easy as the powers that be originally thought. As dark as it sounds, this film is hilarious! Peter Sellers is this film. Without him, it wouldn't be nearly as funny. He plays three different characters including the President of the United States, Jack D. Ripper's first officer, and of course Dr. Strangelove. He is a pure joy to watch on the screen and even with the knowledge of his multiple characters beforehand, he is almost entirely unrecognizable from role to role. One of my all time favorite movie characters is his Dr. Strangelove. He was also supposed to play Slim, the pilot, but supposedly the cast and crew could not stop laughing during his performance to the point of hindering filming. As a result, he was replaced. I'd love to see those out takes. George C. Scott as Gen. Buck Turgidson, the completely brash and ignorant commander, is also quite hilarious.Very few films can make such a strong statement, one that stands the test of time. It's even more difficult to do that with satire/comedy. Kubrick does this with Dr. Strangelove flawlessly and created one of the most important films of all time, if not the most important film ever made.",10,1,3,15 June 2004
Alien," Fear of the unknown.
","A deep space mining crew is suddenly awakened from hyper sleep to answer the emergency beacon emitting from a ship on a nearby planet on their way home to Earth. Upon investigating the ship of the beacon's origin, they are introduced to a new alien species...Possible Spoilers: As far as I'm concerned, Alien is the epitome of ultimate terror. Confined spaces, very dark lighting, a small number of people stranded very far away from home, facing an invincible and sadistically evil alien who eats humans for breakfast, and which is born by ripping out of a person's chest. Not only that, the damn thing has two mouths, acid for blood, and makes Superman's strength look like it's comparable to that of a hairless baby mouse. H.R. Geiger is one sick S.O.B. for coming up with the design for this damn thing. I bet he's a big opium freak, as suggested in the new dvd, and a good thing too because it's the craziest alien life form I've ever seen created. A journey into his mind could make any serial killer cry, I'm sure.Films like this simply aren't made anymore, and if they are, I certainly haven't seen any of them. Ridley Scott sets his name in stone in the terror department of film and sci-fi, period. The tension is built up perfectly, and throughout the film you never really get too much of a good look at the alien itself, making it even scarier than it really is because it's a mystery. This is also complimented by the technique of using minimal lighting in the film, which was a wise choice, otherwise it might be kind of silly seeing some guy in a rubber suit jumping around. The musical score simply adds to the already creepy environment and imagery, haunting and brooding at just the right times without giving away anything yet to come.
The cast is a good one featuring Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerritt, John Hurt, Ian Holm and a few other familiar faces that not only seem believable, but have a nice chemistry running between them. In all probability, such a deep space mining crew might just be assembled as such, if it were reality of course and we actually had such a means to do such things. And Weaver can really play being terrified out of her mind with he eyes closed, as she also displays masterfully in the subsequent sequel.Surprisingly, the special effects hold up to today's standards despite being a quarter of a century old. Of course there's no CGI, but I think in many cases that that's a good thing. Too many director's nowadays seem to feel differently, much to my dismay, even though there are exceptions. 
If you haven't already seen it, you're seriously missing out on a truly terrifying and epic sci-fi experience. Many people in the film industry have recognized this and is why so many sequels were made. 
But I do have to ask, were did Weaver get those undies? Yuck.One of my favorite movies of all time. The purest definition of terror and fear on film. Do not watch if you are pregnant or have heart problems. Flawless.",10,1,3,11 February 2004
The Doors," The Lizard King
","We all know how legendary The Doors were and still are, and sooner or later someone was going to make a film about them. Might as well be Oliver Stone. Given the subject matter, Stone was able to go off the deep end with his imagery here to the point of making one have an epileptic seizure OR think they just dropped some acid. Either way, it's great to watch in my book.The film is flawed in that it's not titled correctly. It's not about The Doors, it's about Jim Morrison and basically just the wild and crazy side of him. That's ok I guess, Morrison was The Doors. Many have criticized Stone for not depicting Jim in the proper light, but given how many people knew him it had to be an almost impossible task to please everyone as everyone knew him differently. I think we all can attest to this through the friendships we have with our friends. Some know us as one way, and some know us as another. I respect Stone for trying and feel sorry for him about the flak people have given him as I know he is a very talented director. I think his intentions were spawned out of true admiration and that he made this film for himself and to pay tribute, and not to win any awards. More of this can be found on the Special Edition DVD from Stone himself.
Even if one does not enjoy the trippy qualities of the film such as I do, or any part for that matter, one could not avoid admitting how well Val Kilmer portrays Morrison. It's simply amazing and is one of the best performances that I can bring to mind, and is the best example of how to literally become someone else, bar none. He doesn't act like he's Jim Morrison, he becomes Jim Morrison. He is Jim Morrison. This is no doubt helped by the uncanny facial similarities the two have. Not only that, most of the singing that's in the film was done by Kilmer himself and even a few of the original band members admitted that they honestly could not tell the difference between their two voices. Even if you hate Val Kilmer, this performance jumps in your face and screams for respect while trying to strangle you.As mentioned earlier, some do not like the film for several reasons. One is that it makes Jim look like a monster and that it only glorifies his wild and uninhibited behavior. Two is that it's basically just one big acid trip into bits of history about the band. For one, Oliver Stone said it best....when you have to condense a person's life, a legend at that, into two measly hours you must take the highlights. Everyone lives longer than two hours, even Jim. We all know Jim was crazy, and with so many of the insane stories Stone heard while trying to piece together the script for this, a lot of what he heard was simply what you see. The wild and crazy side. As a result, what we're left with is not an accurate depiction of The Doors or of Jim Morrison. It is entertaining, yes, but it is not accurate. I think it could have been done perfectly, but it would have been excruciatingly difficult...and still not everyone would like it. And as far as the trippiness of the film, well that's Oliver Stone for you. We saw the same thing in Natural Born Killers a few years later. I personally like the style of it and felt that it was in place here but that's just my opinion. The '60's, drugs, and rock and roll equals trippy.Overall a decent attempt at one of the most difficult subjects to cover, legends. And even though it's not entirely accurate and even though Morrison is one of my idols and he deserved a little better, I do enjoy the film greatly. The film should have been named Pandora's Box.",9,119,142,17 June 2004
Taxi Driver," 'You crazy son of a bitch!'
","Considered a landmark in the art of filmmaking, Taxi Driver explores the depths of human loneliness and the extreme consequences of such. Travis Bickle is a taxi driver in New York who has been lonely most of his life, and displays behavior that perpetuates that fact, which makes it all but impossible for him not to be. This life of isolation and self destructive behavior ultimately leads up to one thing for Travis, brutal and intense violence towards those who he feels are killing the world through their despicable behavior and lack of moral. A simple story, executed nothing short of masterfully, that slaps the viewer across the face and introduces the greatness of Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese to the world.From the musical score (brooding warning), the buildup of the story and characters, the acting, and the direction are simply flawless. TD takes a little while to get started but that is very necessary to develop the characters involved, especially Travis (De Niro), as we need a point of reference in which to gauge his changes in mental state as the film progresses. Younger cinema lovers might get inpatient with this film, but true film aficionados will know what we have here...ass kicking cinema that is rarely made like this anymore. This is the second installment of the Scorcese/De Niro duo that would come to be one of the most formidable and predictably great partnerships in movie history. Undoubtedly a true classic.Suck on that.",10,0,0,2 June 2004
Predator," A creature with a toothed vagina for a mouth is on the hunt.
","Predator is one of those guy movies that I grew up on, so naturally I have an affinity with it despite it's minor short-comings. And the funny thing is, as I'm sure others have noticed, is that it features not one but two future US governors! What a great formula for an action film: Great characters that can actually act and not just sit there looking stupid, a beautiful and claustrophobic setting, mood-inducing score, and one of the coolest creatures ever created as the bad guy. Yes, the dialogue in spots is laughably bad but is to be expected in just about any film in the same genre that I can bring to mind. Luckily though, this is really only contained in the beginning. A decent script and excellent direction is really what sets this apart from most other action films, including some others that Arnold stars in. Had it not been for that, this could have been a real stinker, even with an amazingly cool antagonist.Stan Winston is a genius for coming up with the Predator design and effects. Although this film is not as good, the character itself has reached almost the same status as the 'Alien' character designs. Everyone who's seen a few movies knows what the Predator is or at least can recognize it. I've always wanted to be a Predator for Halloween. Too bad the suits cost as much as a used car.Predator succeeds because it keeps it simple and to the point, while keeping you on the edge of your seat and by not asking for your forgiveness very often. Pop the popcorn, bust out the beer and enjoy. Classic action.",8,1,2,30 June 2004
Léon: The Professional," A difficult review to give...but a good film, and an absolute must for Oldman fans.
","Leon is a hard movie to write a review for, as it's not your typical action film, nor is it your normal romance...and I don't think it's truly either one, but the basic elements are there.Natalie Portman displays her natural acting abilities, that will no doubt be honed into perfection as she gets older, and is perfect for her role as Matilda. In fact, it's one of the most memorable child roles that I have seen. Her attitude and confidence can sometimes be very surprising. Jean Reno does a decent job, but his simple role doesn't seem too difficult a one to pull off. However, it also works. He's sometimes downright goofy and almost retarded, but is meant to show the simplicity of his character. Which brings us to the unparalleled and wickedly talented Gary Oldman, who portrays a particularly nasty and evil character. His Norman Stansfield seems to be spawned from Hell itself. Oldman is not new to playing villains, and he gets to showoff his amazingly intense acting abilities even further in this character. Born to be the bad guy, and probably my favorite actor. His performance alone is reason enough to watch this movie.The story is simple, but very unique, particularly the 'romantic' aspect. We've got a 40 year old man and a 12 year old girl basically falling in love with each other, which can probably make a few people uneasy. I raised and eyebrow or two myself, with it's sexual undertones and hinted at implications. I don't think the director went too far though, and feel that he showed just enough without going overboard. Even with that, some people may still find it a bit unnerving given the 'romance'. Personally, I don't think Besson had anything dirty that he was trying to imply and that all of what you see is all of what happened between the two in the director's mind. I will admit, that sometimes I think the cute moments in the film were trying to hard and could have been cut down just a teeny bit. The dress up game and the infamous cow mit scenes are perfect examples.On the other hand, we have the intense and sometimes seemingly over the top actions scenes. A few parts in the movie seem so insane because the city seems to be devoid of police, or the ability for people to dial 911. However, many times life does imitate art, so who's to say what's realistic and what is not? Some of it seems almost cartoonish sometimes, but I'm willing to forgive a little of that here and there and it doesn't take away too much from the film, if at all.Leon contains some beautiful camera work, and the score seems to compliment the almost opera like feel it's pace and story also suggest. It all adds up to a stunning visual treat, combined with a touching story.
Overall a good movie worth checking out. Every time I watch this movie, I change my opinion on how much I like it. But overall, I'd give it a score of somewhere between an 8 and a 9. 'You don't like Beethoven...'",10,0,1,15 February 2004
American Psycho," Killing people is cool...
","Now this is a good horror slasher flick. It is much more than that as well. Not only does AP bring some class and wit to this genre, but it also brings an eerily realistic and masterful acting performance from Christian Bale. Absolutely perfect. Thinking that Leo was being considered for this makes me nauseous. There's no way he could've pulled it off anywhere even close to the magnitude that Bale did. On top of his acting, he looks perfect for this role...a normal good-looking guy on the outside, but with something very dark and sick just under the surface. You can see it in his eyes. For this film alone, I eagerly await to see him in more films. Now I will say that I have not read the book, so anything I bring up or comment on is strictly for the film itself, as a film. It's usually a fairly pointless routine to compare books and movies anyway.Set in the snooty materialism days of the 80's in New York, all of the film's characters only care about two things, money and themselves. This is a recurring theme that pops up continuously throughout the film, most importantly attributing to the fact that Bale doesn't seem able to be caught because people are too wrapped up in these two things. In that sense, the film is a mockery of sorts, a satire of the time period and culture. Bateman (Bale) cares about money, but has become bored with the way his life has become, and really simply cares about his outward image and his desires that he cannot completely control. Through witty narration and random speeches Bateman gives, we realize the extent of his obsessions and how they completely run every aspect of his life. The best example of this is given in one of the first scenes where he's talking about how he prepares himself for the day. Great stuff. This film also has quite a bit of comedy contained in it as well, at least if you have the right sense of humor. There are several classically funny parts throughout, mostly attributed to the subtle yet clever narration. Not only that, if you leave out the book when interpreting this film, it leaves itself quite open and is a cause for much debate here on IMDb. It's one that can constantly be debated as long as the book worms can't leave out the fact that it's based on a book. I stand somewhere in the middle but on neither side. After all, films should, in all rights, stand by themselves. Visit the AP message boards after viewing for more of what I speak.Overall, an immensely funny look at materialism and murder, and the perceptions contained in our world and or lack thereof. All but perfect. Not for everyone though (especially children), and it's probably a little misunderstood, hence it's curiously low rating. If you enjoyed Fight Club, you'll probably find some intriguing elements here.Highly recommended.",9,0,1,20 July 2004
The Shining," All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy
","Jack Torrance (Nicholson) is a writer looking for solitude so he can concentrate on his work. So naturally, when he's offered the job as winter caretaker for the secluded Overlook Hotel in Northern Colorado, it seems like the perfect way for he and his family to get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life so he can concentrate on his writing. Little do they know what a hotel built on top of an Indian burial ground could have in store for them and their states of minds.First off, this movie is based on a novel by Stephen King, and from that one might deduce that it sucksas most of his novels adapted for the silver screen do just that, which a few exceptions. But this one is a remarkable exception and has everything to do with Kubrick. The acting performances are top notch to the degree that it seems the movie was intended with the three main actors in mind. Nicholson easily pulls off being an ex-alcoholic on the brink of insanity, and Shelly Long looks terrified standing still. Anyone who has seen this movie knows exactly what I'm talking about and would agree that she's very convincingly totally helpless. The little boy who plays their son, Danny, is/was an excellent child actor as well. Most young children have difficulty acting terrified and scared, but this kid hit the nail on the head. And I can't even imagine all the takes they had to go through, being that Kubrick was the director and was known for being one of the hardest, if not the toughest director to work for. I heard, and this might be false, that the movie you see was actually only 1% of the film that was used to shoot the movie. Tiny Spoilers:This is the best kind of horror/thriller movie.no monsters, just plain old insanity and frenzied visions of disturbing occurrences. This isn't a movie that scares you or freaks you out simply by shoving stuff in your face when you least expect it. Anyone can do that. What the director has done here is make the audience feel isolated and secluded just like the characters in the movie, which is done through nifty and careful planning of shots and angles. The movie opens up with Jack's car driving done the sidewinder to the Overlook Hotel around curves and it's just beautiful. And it's meant to show just how secluded the hotel is from the rest of civilization. And that's how the movie begins to freak you out. You know it's a secluded location and you soon find out that it's built on an Indian burial ground, and from there you can slowly see Jack slip into insanity. Both Jack and his son Danny have intensely disturbing hallucinations/visions of things that have happened or will happen in the hotel, which sets the tone for the blood-curdling ending.
Of all the `scary' movies I've seen, this is one of the very few that have ever creeped me out or sent chills down my spine, and that's saying quite a bit as I usually find most horror and scary movies complete jokes. I mean, yeah movies aren't really scary anyways, but this movie is freaky.just imagine yourself in that situation. A Flawless Masterpiece. 10/10.",10,0,1,13 January 2004
American Beauty," Not your typical film.
","In a world full of consumers and with such importance placed on self image and materialism, people struggle to find happiness.American Beauty is a wonderfully beautiful and visually stunning achievement in film, chock full of impressive acting performances from all involved. It's visual style is something that most films can only aspire to reach or imitate. The mere use of the rose petals here is a compliment in itself. The story is one that stereotypes the lives of your typical average American, and rightfully so. It displays the faults and beauties of American culture through eccentric, but not unrealistic characters. In actuality, this movie strikes pretty close to fact just by the characters that are portrayed within it. First of all, the acting in this film is truly remarkable. Rarely is such a competent cast assembled that not only can act, but can interact realistically with each other. Kevin Spacey shows us once again that he is extremely talented and has quite a range, worthy of recognition. He's hilarious here as a man going through a mid-life crisis as he realizes the boring person that he's become. Annette Benning, as Spacey's wife, plays a neurotic and materialistic baby-boomer mom, on the brink of a nervous breakdown as her search for happiness goes on, and as her family further plunges into failure. As an audience member, you really begin to despise her character because she pulls it off so well. In that sense, a job well done. Chris Cooper, also a very talented actor, plays the hardcore Marine father that lives next door. Through extreme punishment and discipline, he tries futilely to make his son 'perfect' in his eyes. His performance displays the inherent problems with extreme discipline. The rest of the cast is very competent as well. No acting performance is below average.Through a well placed musical score and vivid imagery, American Beauty moves along as a piece of art, with an opera like and epic feel to it, and surprising with a very minimal story that uses it's depth and characters to it's advantage. There are many meanings and interpretations to be taken here, which makes it very easy to re-watch and an excellent pick for anyone's collection. Very enjoyable and very original. More films like this should be made, and a very impressive job by a debuting director. Classic.My one and only qualm with the film was the entirely ridiculous pot prices. Two-thousand dollars for an ounce?! Oh yeah, and it's G-13.....right. Other than that, a perfect film.",9,0,1,16 February 2004
Apocalypse Now," Madness.
","Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) has been sent on a classified mission into Cambodia during the Vietnam War to assassinate Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) as he has gone completely insane and is no longer taking orders. And since Kurtz is one of the most decorated men in the armed forces, it is hard for Capt. Willard to understand how Col. Kurtz could go off the deep end as he has, killing without clearance and taking the war into his own hands. What possibly could have pushed this great man over the top? Through Willard's long journey through the jungle to find his target, he tries with some success to understand why. But what will he decide to do once he finds him?Any movie that can start out with The Doors' 'The End' is a great movie in my book, especially if it can flow with the mood and imagery shown with the song. Apocalypse Now does this perfectly. I can't think of anything better for it to be set to, the Vietnam War and the insanity in the soliders' minds that it created. AN is a dark and brutal story about a long journey through some of the hairiest jungle in Vietnam, the ultimate destination of which is murder. Through it's use of music and score alone, we are thrown into a dark world of mystery, violence, and insanity. A perfect example of how to set mood through music alone is this film right here.    An overall great cast, with the exception of Laurence Fishburne, of which Sheen and Brando give us more than enough acting skills to spread around on our movie desire bread. I just don't like Fishburne, ever since I found out he was Cowboy Curtis in PeeWee's playhouse my contempt and hatred for this man has increased ten fold. I realize the pettiness of this but I simply do not care. We need to sick Gary Oldman on him. Brando is excellent as Col. Kurtz and I can't think of any other actor that could have played the good man gone insane and hold such screen presence. Sheen is also fun to watch as Willard and we can identify with his questioning of his mission and the war in general. My favorite character in the movie has to be Robert Duvall's Lt. Colonel Kilgore. Before this film I never pictured Duvall as a wartime cowboy but honestly it's my favorite of his parts to date. He simply nailed his character, which is one of the best in the entire film, as the gung-ho Air Cavalry commander who loves to surf. Maybe a little over the top but still brilliant. I also love the smell of napalm in the morning.The plot is a fairly simple one and it doesn't take too much brainpower to figure out what's going on. Willard's mission is to kill Kurtz, plain and simple. But it's the journey of the film that is really it's heart and also the dire situations of war itself. In the Redux version we are forced to sit through the extended French plantation scene and the Playboy bunny scene which really adds nothing to the film's entirety other than it makes it a longer journey. I don't feel they take away anything though, it's just a matter of if you want to watch a three and a half hour movie or the original. Through this journey, the film points out the utter futility and irrelevance of the war to the Americans and the massive effect it had on the soldiers who fought in it...in fact, that's the entire point. On top of that, the troops were not supported by the public and that could very well have helped cause a character like Kurtz' to go completely mad.  
A big war movie lover, this one is up there with Platoon and The Deer Hunter, all of them classics. I sometimes try to compare films of the same genre to one another but it has gotten me in trouble in the past in my reviews as I have had to go back on what I've said. All three have their own strengths and add their own twist to the Vietnam War....so to really say one is better than the other is fairly pointless...even if after having most recently view AN I think it's a tad better. In the end, Apocalypse Now is a true classic in either version and worthy of the status it's been given. As a fellow reviewer has previously stated, AN is one of the most ambitious films ever made.",10,8,11,17 June 2004
Being John Malkovich," Brilliant, and truly original.
","A struggling puppeteer, Craig (Cusack), and his animal-obsessed wife (Diaz) become mesmerized by the discovery of a portal into the mind and body of John Malkovich, which is found in the office at Craig's new job. Craziness and weird situations ensue. Possible Spoilers herein: (but if I do, they won't be too revealing)This movie is another great example of how Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman can pump out some truly original films not typical of today's regurgitation-style film-making. I decided to watch this film after thoroughly enjoying Adaptation. Cusack and Diaz show off their acting skills in this movie, which was a surprise for me because I typically don't like the movies they both choose to be in. John Malkovich was cast perfectly as the host to which a portal to his mind exists. He's a weird guy, so it fits perfectly. The idea that there is a portal out there in which you can experience being someone else is truly awesome, and makes a great premise for a movie. I also like how the portal dumps it's occupants on the side of the road on the New Jersey turnpike when the ride is over. Kaufman seems to have a knack for making quirky but wholly original films and is why I can't wait for their next project. This movie has it all, comedy, romance, reality, fantasy and fun. The jokes in this movie are executed beautifully and made me laugh out loud several times. I love almost everything about this movie, the actors, the screenplay, the comedy and fantasy, and the ending. Ahhhh. Catherine Keener is also great in this film as Maxine, and man is she sexy! It was no surprise when both Craig and his wife wanted to get with her, and pined over her. I loved her character in the movie, even if she was an evil floozy.My only qualm with the movie was trying to figure out why all of those old people would want to go into Malkovich at once and share his mind and body. Personally, I'd rather just die. I think the movie could've done with them, but that's just me. Other than that, it's perfect. 9/10.",9,0,1,12 January 2004
Dark City," Similar ideas to The Matrix, except it's a very good film, as was here first.
","How long have you been here? Are you really who you think you are? Have you always been this person, or is there something or someone else that your mind is struggling to remember? Does the sun ever even come out? Have I ever been outside the city? These are all questions the main characters ask themselves once their hero John Murdock realizes there's something amiss in their world and realizes nothing is as it seems. Where exactly are they? They're in Dark City. Tiny Spoilers:The city is ran by a dying alien race, called the Strangers, who have supremely superior technology and run the city as they see fit, keeping everyone asleep and oblivious to their surroundings and conducting secret experiments with the help of a traitor scientist, played by Kiefer Sutherland. But what they didn't expect was that one day, someone would wake up and start asking questions. Enter John Murdock.Dark City is one of my favorite science fiction movies and has undeniable similarities to the Matrix, just without the terrible acting and cheesy psychological babble. This movie has basically the same premise but is done without all of the action and money-grubbing sequels, and thankfully no Keanu or Fishburne. And also, unlike the Matrix movies, Dark City doesn't sit you down and explain everything to you and make you want to fall asleep. It calls on the viewer to actually think and figure things out for themselves. It seems more and more people these days are not willing to do that, which would explain the Matrix's overwhelming popularity, and this movie's slipping through the cracks. The camera work and lighting are excellent, giving the entire city a truly dark feeling, which is the entire point. All of the cars, building and clothes are from the '50s era which gives the movie and out of time sort of feel to it. The acting is also something to be admired as well, particularly Keifer Sutherland's role as Dr. Daniel Schreber, who is the only human who helps the Strangers. And Jennifer Connelly is super hot as usual, and gives a good performance as well. Rufus Sewell plays John Murdock perfectly and deserves some credit too, but he's not as hot. So, if you like the Matrix movies for their action and their so-called philosophical revelations that are thrown at you left and right, then you might have trouble wrapping your wet noodle around this one. However, if you can think on your own and actually contribute something to the evolution of mankind and the collective unconscious, then you should enjoy this film. Overall, 9/10.",9,0,2,14 January 2004
Aliens," Hold on to your butts...
","Ripley has been floating in space in hyper sleep for 57 years since her last encounter with the alien, and has been luckily picked up by a deep salvage team. The planet that the aliens inhabit, LV426, is now the site of a large community of terra-formers who have set up an atmosphere processor on the lonely planet to get it ready for colonization. Little do they know who their neighbors are. When 'the company' loses contact with the colony, they send Ripley in with a team of Colonial Space Marines to investigate. All out hell breaks loose.Possible spoilers:'Aliens' is without a doubt one of the best sequels ever made, and action movies period, which achieves it's success by taking the story in a different direction instead of remaking what's already been done before. James Cameron also adds his own additions to the story which make it even better. Cameron has proven over time that he is the only director worthy of being passed the torch of the Alien saga and that he is one of the very best directors for action films, if not the best. For many people including myself, this film is the conclusion of the Alien series, and I don't think I need to explain why.What we've got here is the same grotesque alien species we had in the first film, except there's a veritable army of the damn things led by an ultimately powerful Queen alien. We get to see how the aliens actually live, which is quite similar to an ant or termite colony, and find out how the facehuggers and eggs come about. Kudos to whoever designed the hive and the Queen. I know they were both inspired by Geiger, but I'm unsure if he was involved directly.I personally prefer the group of characters in this film as opposed to the previous one, but that may be because I think Michael Biehn's role as Corporal Hicks is such a standout. The guy was born to play a badass and does it with ease. Lance Henrickson as Bishop is also another noteworthy performance in which he portrays the dubious android. Paul Reiser is typically annoying in every sense, but that is his role here so it's not a bad point. Hudson (Paxton) and Vasquez are also enjoyable characters that get a few laughs going. Overall, a terrific cast.While Scott's 'Alien' was more of a tension filled terror fest, meant to keep you on the edge of your seat with fear of the unknown and lurking danger, 'Aliens' creates the same type and level of tension through incredible action sequences. I feel both are equal as far as entertainment goes, although they take entirely different approaches. 'Alien' probably had more of an impact when it came out because nothing like it had ever been done before. However, I feel that 'Aliens' does the same thing in the action department, and without being unrealistic like a lot of it's rivals in the same genre. Cameron's perfectionist style and attitude towards his work is all too realized here. The lighting is perfect, camera work is amazingly done, and the general mood and pace of the movie are controlled very well. There were some parts that were filmed in reverse to get a better effect, which is quite impressive in it's own right. He also succeeded in getting that spooky atmosphere just right as well that Scott had so carefully created.The story itself lets Ripley develop into a shade of a different character with the introduction of Newt, allowing her to develop some maternal instincts which she was devoid of in the first film. She once had a child, but hyper slept through her entire life and now has a second shot at being a mother again. This plays a huge part in her motivation and determination for becoming the badass with two guns, who delves almost fearlessly into the depths of the hive to save Newt. Weaver becomes the epitome of a movie heroine here, and I have yet to see her equal. This scene leads up to the face off of the two mothers and climax of the film. The classic and mother of all showdowns, coincidentally between two mothers. We have the alien mother, the Queen, fighting to save her eggs and brood against Ripley, who is fighting as a mother to save Newt's life. When Ripley torches most of the eggs, the Queen is now out for blood and vengeance. It all comes down to one of the coolest battles in movie history...Ripley in the power loader vs. the Queen alien. It will be hard for any action movie to ever compete with `Aliens', and it will be recognized as a landmark in cinema for some time for it's sheer brilliance, but not just for the action because this movie has more than that. There is only one other `action' movie in my mind that can stand close, which is Terminator 2, also from Cameron. If I had to pick, I'd chose `Aliens'. I can't see how anyone who likes sci-fi or action could not love this film. As good as it is and no matter how much I like it, this movie never would have become what it did had it not been for Ridley Scott's creation to build upon. I consider myself fairly discerning when it comes to action, but honestly I can't say anything bad about this film.With that said, this is easily in my Top 10 of all time.`Game over man, Game OVER!'",10,1,2,12 February 2004
American History X," Not all that it's cracked up to be...disappointing.
","Derrick Vinyard (Norton) is thrown in jail because he brutally murdered two black men one fateful evening when they tried to steal his car. He is a monster of a Nazi and is quite well known around the community as such. While in prison, Derek has had time to think and he realizes that his reasons for believing in what he does are complete and total frauds. His younger brother Danny (Furlong) seems to be heading down the same path. Can Derek convince his brother to change his ways before it's too late?Ed Norton deserves all the credit he receives as a talented actor, and he definitely shows off his skills here. It's hard to believe that he's the same skinny weakling that he portrayed in Fight Club. He's a big muscle bound monster filled with hate for the first portion of the film and is then transformed into a man that has seen the light and faults in his ways. Top notch actor. Edward Furlong, despite being in only a few films, also shows off his acting abilities...however, neither one of them could save this film.Minor Spoilers:The premise of the movie itself would make it worthy of being in the Top 250, however it has serious flaws in execution and especially the script, as it's filled with entirely unbelievable situations. Too bad because I really wanted to like this one. Nazis playing basketball with local black gangs? Um, yeah m'kay? But a bigger flaw has to be Derek's reasons for having the beliefs he does and the reasons he changed them. His racist beliefs stem from his father's dislike for minorities and from his death in which he is killed by black people while trying to put out a fire in a crackhouse. The latter is believable but the look into his father's beliefs in the dinner scene was entirely unnecessary and laughable at best. Once in the slammer, he makes friends with a black inmate who enlightens Derek's view by telling him sex jokes. And although Derek has had the Nazi beliefs he has had for many years, a simple joke or two and getting rammed in the bootay by fellow Nazis in prison sway his opinion to the opposite. It could happen right?The ending was what really put me off though and is the main reason why the movie showed itself, to me, to be pretentious. It would have made infinitely more sense had Derek been killed, but having Danny killed for simply blowing smoke in some black kids face is a serious flaw concocted by the makers, and is again, unbelievable. It makes me wonder what they actually thought when they first read the script. I guess they figured it would blow the audience away as there would be no way for them to foresee the final events. I believe that most people fell for this simple trick and is most of the reason why this film has such a lofty rating here at IMDB. Ideally, Danny's life should have been spared for Derek's redemption. Sure, it would've been a 'happy' ending, but what we are left with is much worse. Groan.This film left me very disappointed as I was looking forward to it's story and had heard many good things about it. However, the movie is simply not believable. A movie dealing with real issues needs to be, I don't know, more realistic.Great acting, decent camera work, but terrible script.

Ocean's Eleven," Ocean's Impossible.
","Bust out the popcorn and leave all of your realistic criticism at the door and be prepared for some good old-fashioned entertainment. We all know Soderbergh can make a very gritty and realistic film as we saw him do with Traffic, so it's a little hard to rip this movie for it's lack of realism since it's safe to say that it was never meant to be so.
An ensemble cast with mostly decent actors definitely helps OE, although there are a few that I think we could've done without. Maybe it's just the fact that Julia Roberts makes me want to gag, or maybe it's the fact that Don Cheadle can't pull off a British accent that well, but something about the characters annoys me. Overall though, they're fairly decent but could've been a tad stronger. Andy Garcia and Brad Pitt are the definite standouts.The premise of the film itself, the scheme to rob three casinos simultaneously, is let's face it, completely impossible although entertaining. And some of the tools this crew uses are straight from James Bond's workshop and are very unlikely to be available to anyone. But hey, it's not trying to be realistic and really doesn't need to be. It's simply a fun popcorn caper that never expects the viewer to take it too seriously. The plot to the heist itself is fairly amusing and clever. Overall great entertainment even if not a great film. Don't expect too much, especially realism, and you won't feel disappointed.",7,0,1,8 July 2004
Alien vs. Predator," Complete and utter failure.
","AVP fails on several levels. It completely fails as an addition to both series, and it fails as a film itself. When I heard Anderson was in charge of this project, I knew that it couldn't be good news.and then when the PG-13 rating came along, my fears were multiplied and confirmed. A huge fan of both series, I wanted more than anything to like this film and for it to at least be average. After all, I cannot think of many film ideas that have had more potential. This very well could have been the best action and sci-fi film ever created, only if it had a decent director. I actually gave Anderson a chance, a 10% chance of making an average film, and a 0% chance of making it into what it deserved and had the potential to be. Those who gave him more should be embarrassed. I'm embarrassed that I paid to see it, however, I have a unique way of justifying it. Since I paid for it, the only way I can redeem myself is to rip this excuse for a film apart in this review, which will be long, and tell everyone I know how much this film completely sucks and how the originals and all copies should be burned.MASSIVE spoilers:First off, it fails right off for having a weak and unbelievable story, all thanks to the brilliantly moronic Anderson. Full of holes. An ancient pyramid, reminiscent of the Cube, 2000 feet below the ice in Antarctica? Riiiiiight. Predators have hunted humans for years, so let's send some adolescent ones to go after the fiercest species in the universe, and hey, let's only have them do it every 100 years.Riiiight. A chained up Queen Alien that's also been frozen and imprisoned by some wimpy ass Mongoloid Predators that get schooled like little b*tches? Riiiiight. A Predator and a woman make friends and the Predator even makes a shield and spear for her out of an Alien carcass? Oh-f-ing-KAY! I'll stop, but it doesn't take a film professor to see where this is going. They might as well have put an Alien Predator sex scene in it. So much potential and this was what Anderson shat out.Anyone with even a lick of respect for either franchise can see how utterly stupid this film was even before any production was set forth. It gets even worse. Why in the hell would you claim to be a fan of both franchises and then go against many things we know about both creatures and make yourself look like a fool? Easy, Anderson is a fool. Face-huggers now fall off within minutes of attachment, the gestation period for the chest-bursters is now also a few minutes.and, to top it all off their blood is only sporadically acidic. How's that for consistency? Want more? Why in the hell would Predators set up an entire human civilization to perpetuate their ritual Alien hunts and bring weapons with them that melt when they come in contact with Alien blood? If these things have been hunting Aliens for hundreds of years, you'd think they'd be smarter than that. And while we're at it, let's change the way the Predators and Aliens look. The Preds in this film look like they have down syndrome with their masks off. The fact that they look like linebackers doesn't help either. The original in 1987 looked infinitely better and more realistic, not like some lumbering oaf in a rubber suit. And just to make them fiercer, as if it were needed, let's make the Aliens so that they can open their mouths as wide as a Muppet, particularly Guy Smiley, can. This is the material we waited 14 years for?! I actually felt sorry for the Predators in this movie, they're just sad. On top of looking like they rode in on the short ship, they get their asses KICKED. Colonial Marines did better against a HIVE of Aliens than the Preds did against a few running around.and these were friggin' Predators!!! I thought the Predators hunted the ALIENS? These Preds were sissies, and were about as stealthy as a rhino giving birth during an electrical storm. Utterly ridiculous. The cinematography used is entirely out of place. The quick-cut editing used during the fight scenes is some of the worst I've seen to date. You can't see anything that's going on and you might as well not even see the fights at all. That's exactly what I was looking forward to after 14 years, especially in a film with 'Vs.' in the title. While some of this may be possibly attributed to the studio axing it to make it PG-13, the shots that are left are far too close to the action, leading me to believe that this may have not been the studio's fault as some Anderson supporters claim. It's truly confusing and annoying. Straight out of The Blair Witch Project. And let's not forget to throw some Matrix bullet time into a face-hugger sequence, we'd be lost without that. And for a film that is obviously meant to be action-packed, it certainly isn't. Half of its measly runtime is spent setting up this ridiculous scenario. Where is the damn epic showdown?! This was a Versus movie right?End of 'spoilers'.And to all of you people defending this film, what in the hell are you thinking? Just because you're a fan of both franchises doesn't mean you have to swallow this and embarrass yourself on these pages. We deserved more. If you are OK with this film and do find it enjoyable, you are completely void of any taste in film. I simply do not understand your mediocrity.For having more potential than almost any film in the last decade and releasing this stank pickle, I give AVP 1/10. R.I.P. Alien and Predator.",1,80,156,31 August 2004
JFK," Think for yourself, question authority.
","One of the most important films. Many will disagree with that, but it's not a statement just about the film itself, it's also about the fact that Oliver Stone had the balls to make this interesting political masterpiece. Anyone with half of a brain knows that the Warren Report was the biggest joke on the American public ever conceived, and Stone decided to rock the house with his theory about the Kennedy assassination. Is all of it true? Of course not, but that is entirely irrelevant. Do you think the magic bullet theory was true? Case closed. Time and time again, the US government has tried to fool us into believing their ridiculous theory to try and cover up the lies...and considering most people truly are stupid, it has worked. Why do you think that the full details are still not to be released for many years? Could it be that by that time, everyone guilty will be dead or the fact that we as a nation won't care as much anymore because it'll be old news? Gee, I wonder. The simple fact that someone put forth a theory about the JFK incident on film for the public to see is extremely important because it made people think, and still does. The people that bash this film because it's 'propaganda' have entirely missed the point and are the same ones so easily fooled by the government. Beyond that, JFK is an excellent film is all respects. It's about the investigation and the one and only court case that was brought to raise questions about the Warren Report to display the government for what it is, liars and murderers, by New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison. Filled with an excellent cast and directed superbly, JFK raises many questions and still provides classic entertainment. A bit long for some, but most likely for those with a closed mind or those that are afraid to believe anything other than what the government tells us. baaa-baaaa. Carry on sheep people. 'Here's Love Connection, watch this and get fat and stupid, by the way, keep drinking beer you f***ing morons!' If you know where that came from then you know where I'm coming from. R.I.P.Forgive me for the comparison, but it is much like Dr. Strangelove in that it's not just a film, but one with a political statement. Of course, Dr. Strangelove is a better film and has much more of an important statement, but still, they're similar in that respect. As mentioned previously, the cast is simply excellent and particularly Costner, Pesci and Oldman. Kevin Bacon and Tommy Lee Jones' characters are also humorous and depicted with skill. The cinematography is also something to be admired, and we get a good glimpse of this in the opening sequence. I especially enjoy how all of the scenes are put together, giving us something new at every clip and something different to consider.All in all, a very important film that's worthy of much more recognition, the lack of which is probably due to the ignorant American masses that swallowed the Warren Report in the first place.Incredible and extremely ballsy.",10,3,15,17 June 2004
Dog Day Afternoon," Wyoming
","Yet another film that displays Al Pacino's superb acting skills, Dog Day Afternoon does not disappoint. A true story in which two friends, Sonny (Pacino) and Sal (John Cazale), have decided their luck has ran out and that the only way to solve that is by robbing a bank. I found the reasoning behind the robbery to be quite sincere although very unorthodox from what we're used to. What should have been a simple snatch and grab job turns into a media frenzied nightmare for the duo, mostly because of their naivety, lack of judgment, and a tad bit too much compassion. Dog Day Afternoon is a different bank heist movie in that for one, it's a true story, and two, the robbers involved aren't all that up to the task for their seemingly lack of planning and conviction to do what needs to be done in order to achieve success, which treats us to scenes that aren't typical in other films with the same premise. Filled with humorous moments and glimpses of their ineptitude, DDA keeps us guessing as to what will happen next. John Cazale as Sal is particularly intriguing as the quiet killer and is more enjoyable here than in The Godfather films and The Deer Hunter, mainly due to the difference in his characters. And as mentioned earlier, Pacino is Pacino...no need to really elaborate there. Chris Sarandon as Leon is also worth mentioning.The beginning of the film is particularly interesting as we see the mistakes the robbers begin to make early on, which preludes to the media and law enforcement frenzy that ensues. It continues in this fashion until about 3/4 of the way through where it slows down a bit and could have used a little more editing. The ending is slightly anti-climatic but this is due in part to it's basis on a true story. It could have been slightly better, but overall a great film. Although typically inconsistent, I feel Lumet did a great job.I just wish Chris Saradon as Leon would have said, 'Jesuth Christht.' That would have killed me.",8,1,2,10 June 2004
Amadeus," Mo-rrison-zart
","A fictional story revolving around the life and times of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce), 'Amadeus' is a tremendous achievement in film. The story is one of revenge fueled by the jealousy and overshadowing of another composer, Court Composer Salieri (F. Murray Abraham). Mozart's work was considered the work and voice of God himself, and many including Salieri could not understand why God would give such amazing talent to such an undeserving man. Crude, vulgar, immature, and irresponsible, Mozart was all of these things...but he was also the source of music that had no equal and talent beyond all comprehension. Court Composer Salieri felt that he could not let God get away with such hypocrisy and made it his sole purpose in life to ruin and destroy the man who mocked him and highlighted his mediocrity. Through true genius and talent from many involved, 'Amadeus' is simply, a flawless masterpiece in every aspect.Entirely deserving of it's eight Academy Awards, it seems I'm not the only one who feels this way about this film. I consider it to be perfect, but the most impressive aspect of it to me is F. Murray Abraham's performance as the vengeful and envious Salieri. Through his performance and narration, one is swept away in the emotions his character feels to the point of understanding his hatred and intentions. Possibly a little out of his mind, you can empathize with his character as his feelings hurl him towards madness and violence. His performance as an old man is incredible and entirely believable right down to every mannerism. It's amazing. This is no doubt complimented by the excellent make up work done for this part of his character, which was also awarded an Oscar. Tom Hulce was perfectly cast as Mozart, the wild and unparalleled composer. Had his performance not been equally impressive, Abraham's performance may have not been as incredible as it wouldn't have been as easy to empathize and identify with. The supporting cast is also not to go unnoticed. An overall superb casting job.Director Milos Forman achieves greatness through making a movie about music and opera, and representing his film in just such a way. Even when no performance is being given, the music in the background sets the mood for what we see on screen in an operatic way making it twice as meaningful. It is also beautifully shot, and using all natural light and no artificial lighting, we are treated to an immersing experience that makes one forget it's just a film and these are just actors. Few do this correctly, but when it is...it's truly magnificent and makes the film. The costumes even further add to this atmosphere of realism.There really isn't much else to say about it, it's simply one of the best films I have seen, complimented by an excellent story set in a very romantic time period in history about one of the most famous people in history. If you have not yet seen it, you must.'mm-hmmm'",10,3,6,14 June 2004
Donnie Brasco," Fogettaboutit!!
","Donnie Brasco is a film based on a true story about Special Agent Joseph Pistone (Depp) who infiltrates the Brooklyn mob element to clean up the streets. He must decide whether to put these people that he's become friends with in jail, or go down the same road they have and get trapped into a life of crime and violence. His mentor in this world, Lefty (Pacino), is an aging hitman and is really the only person he can trustand even though it's Brasco's job to take down people like Lefty, he becomes a true and valuable friend. Brasco must decide whether to take down this new found world as his job requires and betray those who trust him and those he's learned to respect, or succumb to the mob and betray his job.It was a nice change to see Pacino play a character that I felt sympathetic towards, as his usual tough-guy roles leave little room for that. He plays a passed-up aging hitman with dreams of leaving the life of crime behind and never looking back. Both Depp and Pacino perform with respectable style as usual and the chemistry between them seems to work, even if it's not the duo you'd expect to see on screen together. Michael Madsen was also a joy to watch as the quick-tempered Sonny Black. He doesn't get many quality roles, so it was nice to see him here and he fit the role perfectly.
Very Minor Spoilers:My main reason for enjoying this film though would have to be for Pacino's character, Lefty. You just feel bad for the guy. He's been working for the mob for 30 years, just waiting to get the respect he deserves, but somehow has always been cheated out of. After making friends with him and gaining respect of the mob family, even Donnie and Sonny B. get offered opportunities that Lefty was more deserving of. It's easy to see why Lefty felt the way he did and wanted to leave that life, and start over. It simply wasn't worth it anymore.Typically, I don't enjoy undercover style mob movies, but there are exceptions, and this is one of them. For example, Goodfellas was an awesome movie, up until the end. Even though it was based in a true story as well, it ticked me off when Henry Hill ratted out all of his lifetime friends and family to save his own hide and took a little enjoyment out of it for me. But with this movie, I felt it ended perfectly. My only qualm about the movie is how much they use the phrase `fogettaboutit'. It's already a cliché, so why feed the fire? Other than that, I really enjoyed this movie and the performance therein. Overall 8/10.",8,0,0,13 January 2004
The Evil Dead," Marvelously putrid.
","What more can be said of Raimi's legendary cult-classic that hasn't already been beaten to death like a puss-oozing zombie that crosses paths with Ash? Possibly nothing, but I'll try. Before Spiderman and before the countless spin-offs of this movie were made or even conceived, Raimi and friends decided to make a low budget zombie flick mainly for fun, and surprisingly it has become a masterpiece of shock and horror. Possibly a perfect example of how to make an entertaining film on a shoe-string budget, The Evil Dead delivers what it promises, the ultimate in grueling horror. Even with it's mild budget and sometimes shaky acting, TED shocks and spooks the audience through chilling atmosphere and some of the most violent effects ever put on film. Those who are squeamish need not apply. As a matter of fact, just run for your girly life.There are several reasons this film succeeds. First, Raimi's camera work is truly masterful. By using fast camera work and aggressive shots, Raimi has created an eerie world that is sometimes hard to look at but too entertaining to turn away from. His style from behind the camera is absolutely unmistakable. This is perfectly exemplified in the beginning of the film, where the camera alone creates enough atmosphere to leave you biting your nails in suspense of what's to come. You feel at any moment someone is going to get their neck chomped on by some zombie hiding just out of view. One of the most impressive openings I can think of, perfection in pacing and atmosphere. It gets even better once the action starts. Some shots hold for a seeming eternity, and part of you wishes for it to stop for it's unrestrained gore and violence...but the other part of you is getting a sick kick out of it. One of the most impressive shots is where the darkness from the trees begins to chase people, knocking any tree or obstacle down that happens to be in it's way. Truly magnificent technique, however they did it. TED also succeeds because it's self-aware of the fact that it's a simple zombie movie and never takes itself too seriously, and doesn't expect the audience to do so either. It's meant to be campy, cheesy, revolting and chilling at the same time. There are moments in the film where it seems to be making fun of itself and the genre in general. For this fact alone, one cannot hold certain things against it such as sometimes questionable acting from the supporting cast and sometimes the downright implausibility of certain situations. If you can accept this and you're not put off by mannequin ultra-violence, then you should find yourself on the supporter's side of the fence. I think some don't like it because it can be ridiculous and cheesy in parts, although it was meant to be. Even with the fact that it's sometimes cheesy, there are some downright chilling moments in this film that most horror films nowadays cannot begin to muster. Case in point, the zombie screaming from the cellar door. The zombie growls and howls themselves are enough to send shivers up one's spine. And let's not forget the unforgettable tree love scene, ridiculous and hilarious simultaneously.Last but certainly not least: Bruce Campbell as Ash, the badass of all zombie films. Campbell is Ash, period, and always will be.In my opinion, this is by far the best of the trilogy, and although there could have been more of the chainsaw, this is the definitive zombie film and probably always will be. I feel it succeeds over it's sequels due to it's increased violence and lack of humor in comparison. It's blood, gore, camera work, and shock factor are still formidable even today and are what make this such a cult classic. If you've ever liked any horror film, this is an absolute must-see.Love or hate it, there it is.",10,189,242,16 August 2004
Big Fish," Big Liar
","While it's visually stunning and exceptionally filmed, this piece is a little sappy for my tastes although it certainly shows some promise. Being a fan of Burton's previous work, I figured this was worth a look, and while I did enjoy most of the film, especially the visuals and scenery....I had problems with it's sentimentality and the basic underlying story which consists of a pathological liar promoted to a hero. Sure, not all of the stories were complete lies, and I realize that, but I feel the movie was asking me for more than I could give it to succeed. The appearance of the film and characters within it are truly great to watch, particularly Helena Bonham Carter's witch character. The environments and landscapes are filmed with precision and masterful technique. The overall cast is great, although MacGregor has trouble with his Southern accent. The stories are rather boring but all have a whimsical feel to them, which makes them just bearable. However, it really ruins itself with the vomit inducing ending. If you liked Steel Magnolias, you should love this. I felt dirty. Average at best.",7,0,2,15 November 2004
2001: A Space Odyssey," A film of monolithic proportions.
","A review I have put off for far too long....Bluntly, 2001 is one of the best science-fiction films made to date, if not the very best. Stanley Kubrick was a genius of a film maker and this is one of his very best works. And although it is misunderstood by many, and respectively underrated, it is considered one of the best films of all time and I'll have to agree. Back in 1968, no one had done anything like this before, and no one has since. It was a marvel of a special effects breakthrough back then, and seeing how the effects hold up today, it is no wonder as to why. The film still looks marvelous after almost forty years! Take note CGI people. Through the use of large miniatures and realistic lighting, Kubrick created some of the best special effects ever put on celluloid. This aspect alone almost single-handedly created the chilling void of the space atmosphere which is also attributed to the music and realistic sound effects. I can't think of another film where you can't here anything in space, like it is in reality. Not only is the absence of sound effects in space realistic, it is used cleverly as a tool to establish mood, and it works flawlessly.Aside from the magnificent display of ingenious special effects, there are other factors that play a part in establishing the feel of the film. The music played, all classical, compliment what the eyes are seeing and make you feel the significance of man's journey through his evolution from ape to space traveler.The story, while seemingly simple, is profound. Sequentially, several mysterious black monoliths are discovered and basically trigger certain events integral to the film. What are they? Where did they come from? What do they do? These are all questions one asks oneself while watching the story develop and is asked to find his own way. While most come away with a general idea of what took place in the story, each individual will have to decide what it means to them. Any way one decides to answer these question results in profound solutions. It's not left entirely up to interpretation, but in some aspects it is. Experience it for more clarification. The end result is quite chilling, no matter your personal solution.While it is a long film, and sometimes slows down, it has to be in order to accurately portray the journey of man. It's not a subject that would have faired well in a shorter film, faster paced feature. Those with short attention spans need not apply.Last but not least, is the epitome of a remorseless antagonist, HAL 9000, the computer. Never has a machine held such a chilling screen presence. Which reminds me, for a film with such profound ambition and execution, there is surprisingly little dialogue. Another sign of Kubrick's genius.All in all, one of the best films made to date and one of the very best science fiction films made. A personal favorite. Everyone must see this film at least once.Very highly recommended.",10,619,935,5 January 2005
The Untouchables," Slightly bloated but still entertaining.
","The mob is flourishing in Chicago during prohibition under the command of Al Capone (De Niro), and things are getting out of hand. One cop, Eliot Ness (Costner) has decided this corruption and violence must come to an end and Capone must be taken out. We all know what happens.An overall good mobster movie, The Untouchables isn't as great as it could've been although I do enjoy it. DePalma takes a premise that could have been truly great and gives us the popcorn version. Some of the scenes are simply way over the top, beyond belief, and do not seem to fit with the rest of the film giving us glimpses of the man that we see today, pumping out mostly trash such as Mission Impossible and the like, with the exception of Carlito's Way. The cast is excellent, and came out before Costner became the King of Flop and still appeared in decent films. De Niro as Capone was a wise choice, although he's not on screen much, and is entirely believable and Connery can play an old wise cop with ease. The climatic rail station scene is impressive even with all of that slow motion, but I do like it, unlike some who hate the movie because of it. It's just not as good as some people here would like to make you think and many movies are much more deserving of the Top 250. In the end, it comes down to a lack of realism. Overall, slightly above average but not necessarily a disappointment.",8,1,3,16 June 2004
The Matrix Reloaded," Why the butt shot?! WHY
","Sometimes a film comes along and it's seemingly endless supporters mystify me. This is such a film. While the first movie was OK, I'm baffled by how many people feel this movie is even worthy of being considered a sequel. The first one was decent, but not perfect, and pretentious in every sense of the word. The 'philosophical' babble and references are enough to make me groan. And it gets worse in the sequel.Reloaded has some awesome action sequences and decent special effects, but the acting in the movie is like the first one but worse, terrible. Keanu and Fishburne have got to be some of the most overrated actors out there, and is probably one of the main reasons I can never take these films seriously. Fishburne comes off as a complete and total tool, spouting his nonsense philosophical babble about nothing whatsoever. Had the casting been a bit better, and had the movie had a better screenwriter, this movie could have exceeded it's prequel. But as far as I'm concerned, the only reason to watch this movie is for the special effects, which are decent, but not the best I've seen.Spoilers herein:What do I like about this movie? Well, most of the action sequences are good, particularly the chase scene on the freeway, aside from Fishburne's duel on top of the tractor trailer. At one point, they look like they're practicing. But the part where the agent jumps on top of one car sending it into a cartwheel is truly awesome. I could have done without the superman bit, and the needless flying through downtown to save Trinity. Did anyone notice all of the cars and destruction Neo (what a name) left in his wake? I'll admit, it looked cool, but is one of the reasons I can't take this movie seriously. He must've killed hundreds of people just to save her. But I suppose some of the fan boys out there would say that it was absolutely necessary for her to survive for the sake of mankind. OK, whatever. If Neo is 'The One', then why would he need her? Oh that's right, because he loved her, right. The sentinels were awesome too. And the beginning when Trinity launches the bike off of the roof of a building and lands all sexy is probably my favorite part.The scene where Neo pulls a bullet out of her is useless, and this has got to be where the acting is the absolute worst in the entire film. I mean, can the dude make a different face?! Your girl is about to die!! I could do his job. It's got to be a close tie with when Morpheus is preaching his crap to the orgy crowd. Oh yeah, and hey buddy, it's not bright inside, you can take your freakin' sunglasses off.And while some of the fight scenes are cool, Keanu has a hard time convincing me he's actually fighting. They could've cast someone with better eye-hand coordination at least. He just looks lame, but that's nothing new.Alright enough. This movie is cool if you like special effects, but is not nearly what it could've been and gets way more credit than it deserves. I originally gave it a 6 when I voted, but I think a 5.5/10 is more suitable after thinking about it. And there's simply no way to forgive the Keanu butt-shot, ever.Closing thought: Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne are overrated.",5,1,2,12 January 2004
To Kill a Mockingbird," Essential.
","Undoubtedly a classic hallmark in cinema, To Kill a Mockingbird dealt with social issues when social issues were still very much an issue in society, much more so than today although some of the same basic feelings are still present. Being younger than the film itself, I can only imagine the impact it had on people when it first came out. And seeing how the film has not been forgotten after the decades since it's release, I think it's safe to say that it had quite an effect as it continues to do so. Having read the book in high school, the film seems fairly accurate to the story except for a few very minor things that are mostly the result of a book being condensed into a much shorter journey.Gregory Peck is perfect in his role as Atticus Finch and apparently I'm not alone in that opinion as he won an Oscar for the role. All three children in the movie are also quite impressive and entirely convincing. I particularly enjoyed seeing Robert Duvall in his first film appearance as the ambiguous Boo Radley. It's very difficult to give reviews for older films, particularly ones that were made prior to my existence, mostly due to the inevitable fact that like everything else films also age, sometimes weakening the original potency. But to be honest, the only thing that I can see that has noticeably aged is the music, which is entirely understandable and is to be expected. And given the fact that it's over four decades old, that is quite a statement. It all boils down to a very important film about a very important and popular book in which social issues were dealt with and still holds relevance today. Like many classics, it's not just a movie, but a film with a message. A heart warming classic and an essential notch in the belt of film history.",10,19,26,21 June 2004
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Blood.
","Francis Ford Coppola is an amazing director worthy of the status he's been given by making some of the best movies of all time. Dracula is a very decent movie but not a classic, even though I simply adore Gary Oldman and love his simply amazing portrayal of Dracula in this film. A true joy to watch and never one to disappoint. His evil laugh during 'the baby scene' is one for the history books....too evil for words. Chilling. It also has Keanu Reeves in it, my least favorite actor. Keanu can't act to save his life, and the only rational reason for his movie appearances (notice I didn't say performances) is the fact that he's a panty waist pushover that will never object to anything any director asks him to do which makes him more palatable as a casting choice, I suppose. I can't imagine anyone who would actually think he's a good or great actor. I respect Coppola but I have no idea what in the hell he was thinking when he cast this joke and at the same time displayed impeccable taste by casting Oldman. Without Keananu, I might like it a little better. At least his role is fairly minimal.I do enjoy watching this film very much and I even own it, but when I view it I'm simply waiting for Oldman to appear and display his talent. The guy is a chameleon with all of the different accents he has successfully portrayed over his years of playing villains and never falls below my high expectations, even in films that are mediocre. His Transylvanian accent is so thick that it's difficult to believe that he doesn't actually speak that way. Winona Ryder is satisfactory as Dracula's lover but she always reminds me of an upset little sister with her pouty expressions and melodrama. I will admit that there is quite an unusual amount of chemistry between her and Oldman here. Anthony Hopkins plays Van Helsing, the vampire hunter, and is amusing to watch and also does a fine job with his accent.
I think the reason the film wasn't perfect other than the questionable casting choices is that it seems to take the road of style over substance. I feel it could have been perfect. The sets, costumes, and musical score are all great and the story progresses quite nicely but it seems absurd at times. Also, Coppola must've had a massive unrelenting erection while filming. The unneeded nudity and sexual provocative-ness of the female vampires seems a little silly sometimes. This very well could have been in Bram Stoker's book, which I have not read, and I could be entirely wrong but it seems to be a little much even though I truly love breasts. Some of the special effects are poor which is most likely a result of Coppolla's studio approaching bankruptcy during filming. Other than that the film has a great story and is filmed beautifully and is very enjoyable to watch. Overall, above average. I would love to see Gary get more starring roles. I'll get off his lap now, my dance is over.",9,1,1,16 June 2004
Platoon," War within war.
","Sometimes war isn't just a war pitting two armies together, but a war within the armies themselves. Platoon is a gut wrenching account of this and we see that sometimes the enemies in battle can be on the same side. Charlie Sheen plays a private in the Vietnam War who volunteered himself for battle to try and find himself. He quickly comes to notice while he's still wet behind the ears that things are not what he expected and that maybe he has bitten off more than he can chew. Led by two opposing leaders and father figures, he quickly learns the skills he needs to survive and kill.
Platoon is an excellent movie that takes a somewhat different approach to the genre, in my opinion, in that you care more for the characters therein than in most war movies and find yourself rooting for the characters more than usual. There are two leaders in the group that are both excellent soldiers but are at each others' throats constantly, and the men must eventually pick sides as to who they decide to follow. Tom Berenger plays Sergeant Barnes, a man that has been shot 7 times and has served more than his fair share of time in the war. He has been hardened to the point of losing almost all moral and is a sick and twisted character that will do whatever it takes to win the battle. War has become his life. Berenger was born for this part. Meant to be a tough and scary son of a bitch, you end up believing that he is the character depicted in the film. 'Everybody got to die sometime Red.' And on the other end we have the equally formidable and seasoned Elias played by Willem Dafoe, the charismatic and sympathetic leader who has served several years in Vietnam and is more of an intelligent and charismatic character. Dafoe was also perfect for his part as well and is easily the most likable character in the entire film. I love his part in this film, it's just a cool character. Charlie Sheen was also a very good choice to play the fresh meat grunt who must earn his way, and we see the movie through his eyes and narration. Platoon is also filled with many other familiar faces including Johnny Depp, Forest Whitaker, and some guys who you will definitely recognize but may not know them by name. It all comes down to a simply excellent cast with excellent acting that is realistic at the same time. Acting is not the movie's only strong point. The overall direction by Oliver Stone is masterful and educated, Stone having served in the war himself. The film includes many of his own experiences which positively gives it more credibility and realism. Probably his best film to date. Filming in the wilderness has got to be difficult, but what we're treated to is being dropped right into the jungle with the grunts themselves and we get to experience many of the aspects of the war, including being surrounded by death, the insects, the sounds, the marches into unknown territory, the hardships, the weather, etc. The battles are also not to disappoint and keep your heart pounding and ears ringing. Also, the musical score sets the mood for the film perfectly...haunting sadness. The story is the film's most strong point though. It's a war within a war with many characters to pull for and to identify with. We get to see all of the characters and their relationships develop throughout the battles which leads us to the inevitable. What we get is a heart churning epic that I will always remember. I have said in a previous review of mine that The Deer Hunter is my favorite war film, but after purchasing this DVD and watching it again recently, I honestly don't know which one holds that coveted spot. There's simply too many greats. Truly one of the best movies I've seen.This is a must see for anyone. It's easy to understand how it won Best Picture.",10,1,2,10 June 2004
Tombstone," `Why Johnny Ringo..looks like someone just walked over your grave.'
","I can't say enough about this movie...pure and simple. There are so many aspects that I like about this movie that it's difficult to even cover them in a review, but I'll try.First off, the cast is second to none. Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer, and Michael Biehn are the definite standouts here. All give absolutely unforgettable performances and are complimented and multiplied by the rest of the cast which contains some big names in it's own right. Paxton, Elliot, Boothe, Zane, and on and on. The list never seems to end. This movie is a pure joy to watch even if just for Kilmer and Biehn, the two badasses. Kilmer plays the drunk and formidable Doc Holiday, while Biehn plays the deranged, demented and very dangerous Johnny Ringo. Their eccentric characters taunt each other throughout the film, alluding to an inevitable showdown..Tombstone is probably more of a guy's movie than a gal's. I mean, one of the main reasons to watch this film is just to see how badass all of the characters are, and trying to decide who is more badass and who has the coolest lines. I feel like scratching my balls and lifting up one cheek to let one rip just thinking about it. But that's not to say the ladies won't like it, it's just that it's kind of testosterone laden.which rocks because it's not overdone. The dialog in the film just reeks of badassness. I can remember more quotes for this movie than almost all that I've seen, and understandably so. `I want your blood, and I want your soul..and I want 'em both right now! Don't any of you have the guts to play for blood?!' `I'll be your huckleberry.' YES. Or, `You smell that? Smells like someone died.'Tombstone is an adapted story from real life events that took place before the turn of the 19th century. Of course not all of it is true as it's adapted, but it's cool to think about the fact that something very significant happened back then, enough so to be remembered 100 years later and worthy of the basis for a film.The sets are really impressive here and definitely have the boom town feel to it that the creators were going for. That goes for the costumes as well. The whole atmosphere of the film is executed quite nicely and is believable. I watched the special edition disc on the dvd and was impressed by the fact that they built the entire town just for the movie, and that it wasn't just some set that's been used in other movies somewhere along the line.
Tombstone never tries to be more than it is. It reaches epic status by keeping it simple. The movie is about the characters, and all are impressively created and depicted. And because of that, it is an epic for me. And epic of great acting and excellent characters. It's because of this that the movie has such a high replay value and is a wonderful edition to anyone's collection. It's a very pleasing movie experience that can be returned to time and time again.An absolute must for Michael Biehn and Val Kilmer fans.`Fight's not with you Holiday' `I beg to differ sir..play for blood remember?' `I was just foolin' about.' `I wasn't.' `Alright lunger.' `Say when..'",9,0,0,3 February 2004
Blade Runner," Director's Cut.
","Blade Runner is undeniably one of the essential building blocks of the science fiction genre. Not only does it's visual style blow one's mind and open one's imagination, it raises important questions about life through the eyes of beings that are superior to humans in almost all aspects except for life span...all with a minimal but masterful plot. Add that to the fact that this is one of the few sci-fi films that doesn't rely entirely on special effects, wars and explosions to make it's story interesting and you have a classic. And the Director's Cut just makes the original better by giving the axe to Harrison Ford's abysmally bleak voice over and removing the light-hearted ending. Basically, it makes the film is more ambiguous which makes it far more interesting in my opinion. Ridley Scott wanted it to be released in exactly this fashion, and it's easy to see why.The visual and environmental similarities between BR and Scott's prior work, 'Alien' (1979), are easy to spot right from the get go. It's fairly simple, they're both dark and use scaled Gothic models with Swiss precision, creating an entire world worthy of the dizzying imaginations of the audience. I would not be surprised at all to find out if both films had some of the same special effects people. That said, BR is a beautifully dark and futuristic world that is very convincing to the eye even though there's no CGI...which is a good thing because a lot of times models are more accurate and realistic. And believe it or not, for the most part, these effects easily hold up in today's world and look only slightly aged. And on top of it all, it has an excellent score that's a perfect fit.The story and plot are very simple but hold many smaller lessons. Deckard (Ford) is sent to kill the runaway replicants, but as he progresses throughout his journey, he begins to question if what he is doing is actually the right thing. Aren't they alive and conscious too? Don't they have hopes and dreams? How different from us are they really? Simple but extremely effective. Most sci-fi's nowadays are too busy trying to cast Vin Diesel or buy the best CGI effects without really worrying about the story. It's sad, but it's all about money. It's also why we don't see films like these any more....money is more important than making a quality film, but you don't need me to tell you that. What it all boils down to is a minimal story that works wonders for the movie and the audience's imaginations.Superb acting from all involved, masterful direction, incredible cinematography, world-creating special effects, and a great story make this one for the ages. Not soon to be forgotten. Undoubtedly, a true classic.",10,0,1,22 June 2004
The Deer Hunter," Life and War.
","Possibly my favorite war film, The Deer Hunter is also a movie about life in general, real life. It's not just a war movie and it's not just a film about simple life. It's a balanced story made to compare and contrast the people's lives surrounding the Vietnam War and the consequences of war itself in the eyes and emotions of the people involved. I simply love De Niro in this film. He displays a range of emotion that his characters usually don't allow for him to portray...yet he remains the tough guy. Any De Niro fan owes it to themselves to watch this heart-wrenching epic. One of my favorite De Niro performances. Christopher Walken and Merryl Streep also create some remarkable performances in their own right.Some will think this film is slow or is too long. Kill yourself now as you entirely missed the point of this work of art and are of no importance to society. You have no attention span worthy of forming any relevant opinion and all reviews given by you shall be deemed as wasted server space. With that out of the way, I will admit that this movie is long but I feel that it works for the movie and not against it. It's meant to establish the characters and their relations to each other in the beginning and to set up that bond between the main characters before they're off to war, which is complimented in the post-war scenes. To get the true effect of contrast to work properly, you must be able to get used to and care for the characters and their environment before throwing them into battle. I will even go as far to say that I thought the beginning was dragging myself, but then completely reversed that opinion once the post-war scenes came along. It's necessary, and is one of the reasons I like this film so much.The simple realistic ways that people interact together in the film makes it very believable...it is very much how life would be if these characters existed and were in such a situation. The acting performances are definitely enhanced by the wonderfully written script and dialog. They're all completely realistic and believable as they should be.For war film buffs, there is a scene in this movie that will blow you away, literally. The whole Vietnam part of the film is completely brutal and harsh, even compared to most war epics. Some of the images are quite disturbing, but it's war, that's life. One scene in particular when they're in Vietnam will stay with me forever as one of the most intense scenes I have ever seen depicted on screen. Watch it and you will know exactly what I'm talking about. Great stuff.The ending is tragic and sad, but completely suiting to the rest of the film. One of the easiest movies I've ever scored.10/10",10,0,0,30 January 2004
Identity," Could have been great, but is cliched all to hell and riddle with more holes than an Iraqi house.
","I tried to watch this movie without any expectations, and it has two good actors in it, so I figured it might lead to something original. hmmm. It has an interesting enough concept, and midway through it really showed some promise after a certain something was revealed. However, anything in the film is soon tarnished by a laughably predictable Hollywood ending that most might not see coming because they won't think they'd even take it that far. I joked about how the movie would end while watching it, but was surprised I was right when it came. Should have known better. The plot twist itself, prior to the ending, could have made a decent movie and I'm sure the director thought he was making an intelligent film. But the way I see it, the twist makes it all too convenient for the plot holes and inconsistencies to exist without explanation anywhere in the story. Ray Liotta and John Cusack pull off some good performances, but no acting performance could make up for the story. For example, put Keanu Reeves in the Matrix and it still sucks. Wait, he's not an actor. Liotta should stick to crime drama and Cusack should stick with those quirky movies we all love to see him in. I can see why some people may be fooled into believing this is a good movie. A good movie is one that can be watched time and time again. ANY movie can keep you interested until the end, but that doesn't necessarily make it good. All you've got to do is confuse the audience all to hell so that there's no way they can tell what's going on until the end......but in this case, it kept me interested with many intentional distractions only to be let down. The movie lost several points just for the cop out ending alone.I am genuinely fascinated by this film's favorable rating. I'm feeling generous today. 5/10",5,5,9,4 February 2004
The Matrix," You don't know Kung-Fu.
","One of the most overrated films of ALL TIME, if not THE most overrated film of all time. Why people love this movie so much completely baffles me. I realize that different people have different opinions and tastes but even some fellow reviewers here that have comparable tastes to mine praise this film to my astonishment. There isn't anything great here, so why all the fuss? It's not original, and if you think it is you didn't see Dark City or a slew of others....the story is very slow, it's pretentious beyond words, and the acting is absolutely terrible to the point that it's hard to sit through without wanting to bite a running chainsaw, all thanks to the abysmally talented Reeves and Laurence Lamprey aka Cowboy Curtis. The ending is also weak, and don't tell me it's because they had planned on making a sequel because movies should be able to stand alone.....and don't even get me started on the sequels. At least they're not too overrated. I have felt this way since 1999 when it came out and I went to see it in the theater. When it was finally over, I said, 'That's it?!'Let's go over this piece, shall we? People praise this film for it's fight choreography, when the people fighting are tools like Fishburne and Reeves. Are you serious? I can't help but to laugh out loud at Keanu in the dojo training scene with Lamprey. He looks like he's got a Klingon dagger rammed up his butt! This is the 'One'?! I can't think of anyone more miscast. Actually, I can't think of a film where he wouldn't be miscast. True, a lot of my discontent with this film comes from the actors, but even with decent actors I still think it would've failed. The story is also sloppy and filled with more useless techno-babble than a quantum-physics book from Brent Spiner's 'Data' from the Star Trek: The Next Generation series. To sum it up, it doesn't make any sense. People as batteries? OK. For a movie that spouts so much techno-babble at you, it's not very technical. It's all a red herring.My biggest problem with the people that like this film is that they praise it for it's originality when that could not be further from the truth. Do your research or just watch more movies and you'll begin to realize that this film is nothing more than a long list of rip-offs from others films....and it gets the credit for all of it. This isn't the film's fault, it's the uneducated fans....the same fans responsible for it's ridiculously lofty rating here at IMDb. I think the rip-offs were intentional personally, and I don't think even the Wachowski brothers thought it'd be as successful as it was because of it.Criminally overrated....and will not stand the test of time. The epitome of the phrase, 'Style over substance.' Just another summer blockbuster.It's a lot like Pokemon. People like it, but I can't understand why....and I don't think they do either. I think this will just be another fad. Time will tell.",6,8,17,23 June 2004
Casino," There's a lot of holes in the desert...
","Simply one of the best gangster films out there with an excellent 'true' story yet strangely underrated. Casino is a masterpiece of a mob film from Martin Scorsese, and in my opinion better than the well received Goodfellas...and I don't know if I could tell you why, that's just the way I feel. There are many obvious similarities since they're both created by Scorsese, both have DeNiro and Pesci, and in both the s*** hits the fan in the end. They are frequently compared in reviews so I'll say, for the record, that I enjoy Casino much more. I think most of the reason Goodfellas is rated higher is because it came out first and some people see Casino as a rehash. I do not care about that myself, they're both great films.I've seen this film over a dozen times and it still has yet to get old. It's filmed beautifully and the music seems to fit the time periods and helps to establish the overall environment of it all, as it should. DeNiro and Pesci were conceived by God himself to play their parts in films like these and are always a joy to watch. Sharon Stone as Ginger is a definite standout. I honestly didn't know she could act until she was in this movie. She portrays the drug addicted ex-call girl turned wife of Sam Rothstein, the mob friendly casino boss. The film is quite violent and some denounce it for being gratuitous as if the mob goes by the same standard. It's just a movie and if you enjoy watching films in the same genre, then it shouldn't be too much to handle. The language is also fairly harsh, mostly from Nicky (Pesci), but it helps give it a gangster feel. Plus, it doesn't help that there's so much voice over in the film, which is were a lot of the profanity comes from. That's just how mob guys talk, come on now. Didn't you know? All of the wise guys that I know do the same. Even though many consider voice overs a cop-out in filmmaking, I honestly can't imagine the movie any other way. It definitely works and at least it's not Ray Liotta's voice.As previously mentioned, the cinematography is beautiful, all that panning and sweeping...love it, and it works. I particularly enjoy the opening sequence in which the operations of the casino are explained.......also the intro to the meeting in the desert where the camera focuses on Sam's sunglasses as Nicky drives madly across in the reflection, stirring up a storm of sand. Simple, but great. Even more interesting are the true parts of the story. I did some research and the film does mix and match some things around, but for the most part it is true. In actuality, the true story was much crazier and it involved the skimming of four casinos, not just one, one of which was the Stardust....all were ran by the real Sam Rothstein, Frank 'Lefty' Rosenthal. And yes, the character that is supposed to be Nicky (Tony 'The Ant') really did do what he did in the movie with a vise. The fact that it's based on a true story does make it a little more enjoyable to me, especially since it's pretty damn close.What it all boils down to is one of my favorite films that I've seen, and one of the best mob movies ever...just like Goodfellas. I think most just don't give it a fair chance. Had Casino been released first, I think it very well could replace GF in the Top 250. Some will hate me for saying this, but when it comes to this category of films, Casino is only second to the Godfather films. Now watch my body turn up in a cornfield.",10,1,1,17 June 2004
Heat," Dichotomous, epic crime drama featuring two of the best actors of all time...
","An extremely skilled crew of armed robbers and burglars led by Neil McCauley (DeNiro) is running rampant in the city of Los Angeles. With a crew so tight, is there anyone who can stop them? Maybe the fiery Lt. Vincent Hanna (Pacino) can stop them before anyone else gets in their way. It's also a story about the different love lives of all those involved and the consequences of being so dedicated to each side. What more could any movie buff ask for? DeNiro playing the seasoned criminal, and Pacino depicting a hot-tempered cop who will do whatever it takes to stop them. A movie with a cast and story like this was bound to turn up sooner or later, and thank the low-rid it did! The supporting cast is also top notch featuring Tom Sizemore and Val Kilmer as members of Neil's crew. I felt the cast that was assembled was very believable and the performances were as well. The camera work was well done, I loved the dialogue and the music seemed to fit each seem whenever it came into play.
Minor Spoilers:Heat features two of my favorite action sequences ever. One is at the beginning when they take down the truck and the other is close to the end when they heist the bank. The tractor trailer tow truck ramming the armored car while being blocked by a stolen ambulance was simply genius, and might actually work in the real world if one were so inclined. The bank heist sequence was heart pounding and kept me on the edge of my seat curious as to who would get away and who would get taken down. An all out war in the streets of L.A., it's hard not to enjoy that.especially when you care about the two main characters involved. But Heat isn't all about actionit's also a love story in a sense. We get to see Hanna's failing marriage continue to fall apart as the movie goes on, as he seems more dedicated to his job and catching Neil than to spending time with his wife. Things take a turn in Neil's life as well, when he finally meets a woman he truly cares about and doesn't want to leave behind. He now must make a choice between leaving while he can with the heat hot on his tail, or take a chance to go and grab the woman he loves and never look back. And when Chris' (Kilmer) wife Charlene (Ashley Judd) is approached by the police, she must make a decision on whether to turn her estranged husband in, or face the risk of losing her child to the heat for aiding a known criminal. Decisions, decisions. I like that.realistic drama.It all boils down to a man to man showdown between McCauley and Hanna in the end, and only one of them is going to make it out alive. Perfect ending for a perfect movie. I can't believe this movie isn't rated higher than it is. If you're a Pacino or DeNiro fan, this movie is a must.A truly masterful film in every respect and a favorite among my collection. 10/10.PS  `You get killed walking your doggie!!'",10,0,0,14 January 2004
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," They could grab it by the husk.....
","King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table set out on a quest to find the Holy Grail...as told to do so by a cartoon God that lives in the clouds... Easily the most hilarious and original comedy ever made, Monty Python and the Holy Grail claims it's undisputed throne through insanely ridiculous situations and characters that will very likely never be duplicated. Pure comedic genius that doesn't go stale with age or decades of competition having been released. Simply seeing the way comedy films are made today, this film will very likely have a long reign before anything can even hold a candle to it. An absolute belly-laugh fest that never lets up.Only the cast of Monty Python could have pulled this film off, with each actor playing many different characters...all hilarious! The genius in the actors' lines themselves are truly to be admired. The comedic style of talking in circles is one technique that most comedies do not try to do, simply because they can't compete with the genius of this film, which uses it flawlessly. Those that do try usually fall flat on their faces. Two particularly excellent examples of this can be seen in the beginning scene, in which the characters discuss the origins of coconuts.....and the other when Lancelot breaks into the swamp castle to save the 'damsel in distress.' This is merely one technique that the cast has perfected to conjure up laughs consistently throughout the entire film. The only way that I can imagine that someone might not like this film is if they simply do not enjoy it's type of humor. Too bad for them.Another hilarious technique used in the film is the use of comedy in the background. From people slamming cats against poles for no apparent reason, to people filling up baskets with mud in the fields....all very strange and hilarious at the same time. It's also simply amazing that all of the characters are played by the same group of actors, which shows the great range all of them have. Some are simply unrecognizable from one character to the other and it sometimes takes a good eye to pick them out, which makes it fun. And I don't want to ruin it for anyone, but this film takes some turns that no sane person could see coming.Ridiculous characters in ridiculous situations equals ridiculous laughter.The epitome of all-star comedy that will no doubt continue to stand the test of time. Kudos to Gilliam and the rest of the Python crew. If you haven't seen it yet, make it your first priority in life!",10,219,265,16 February 2004
True Romance," What a cast.
","I typically do not enjoy Christian Slater's movies, but this one is a definite exception. Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Gary Oldman, Val Kilmer, Brad Pitt, Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper, Tom Sizemore.I mean come on, how could it not be a cool movie? I was told that I had to watch this movie by several friends, but for some self-admittedly ignorant reason, I was always put off by the name as romantic comedies usually make me gagwith a few exceptions. This is no romantic comedy and I'm glad I came across this film. And if you're an Oldman fan, this flick is essential to your collection.Minor Spoilers:Clarence (Slater) and Alabama (Arquette) meet when Clarence's boss hires a hooker for him for his birthday, with instructions to not let him know who and what she really was. As it turns out, the couple instantly falls in love and after a short night together, and they spontaneously decide to get married. Clarence becomes obsessed with the fact that while Alabama was only a call girl for a day or two and had only a few customers, that she actually had a sinister pimp named Drexyl (Oldman) who was also a big drug dealer somewhere out there. With the advice of Clarence's imaginary friend and mentor, Elvis (Kilmer), he decides that he cannot be happy until Drexyl no longer exists and decides he must be taken out. The confrontation starts a whirlwind of events that the couple must somehow get through before they can live together in peace. It all comes down to a huge climax with guns drawn, bullets flying and much bloodshed. Will they survive and live happily ever after?I love this movie and am quite surprised that it's not at a loftier position on IMDB, which is the reason why I feel obligated to put in my 2 cents. I usually only write reviews for over-rated or under-rated movies.....and this one is certainly under-rated. TR has it all, romance, comedy, action, and some very tense scenes and situations. The acting is top-quality, even Slater, and with such an ensemble cast it's definitely one of the movies strongest points. All of the characters are well thought out and make the film a true joy to watch. Simply seeing Oldman (probably my favorite actor) depict a Jamaican pimp who thinks he's black is an awesome sight. I don't think there's a character he can't pull off, and especially if it's someone a bit deranged and a little bit out of his mind. Another performance worth mentioning is Christopher Walken, who plays a Don for the Mafia. I won't give away his involvement but I will lead on that he has one of the coolest lines and performances I have ever seen in a long time. Dennis Hopper who plays Clarence's father in the film is in the scene with Walken and has equally witty dialog and attitude. My only problem with the movie, and it's a very minor one, is that Clarence and Alabama's romance seems a little hokey at one part, but that's it. Other than that, I love this movie!Tarantino wrote it and it's very obvious throughout most of the film. I highly recommend this movie to QT fans or anyone interested in any of the cast. Because of the acting performances, True Romance has a very high reply value.Overall 9/10.",9,2,4,21 January 2004
Evil Dead II," It's all about the chainsaw...
","Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell come back to the woods to try and capture what made the prequel so great, and almost succeed. I prefer it's predecessor, but that is not to say this is not a good film. The reason is not because this is an inferior film, they're just very different. The original had vomit-inducing ultra-violence and shriek-inducing scares and thrills with a tad of black comedy thrown in here and there. This is the exact opposite, where the scares and violence are toned down, but the comedy and camp value has been scaled up. For reasons that don't make any sense to me whatsoever, ED2's first ten minutes or so are a recap and mild remake of the first, supposedly due to the fact that Raimi could not get permission to use footage from the original to put in this sequel. I don't know about you, but I don't see how that's necessary. Rarely do sequels include exact footage from the original, even more rarely is it needed. So for what it's worth, I've heard all of the reasons and it just doesn't add up. Fortunately though, this doesn't matter much and does not take away from the film as a whole...it's just not exactly a sequel and not exactly a remake. But it is, exactly, a very entertaining film.Now what I do prefer in this film compared to the original is that the characters act in ways that are slightly more plausible. The first film had me screaming at the screen trying to help out the characters. Don't go outside, look behind you, and for God's sake, get the damn chainsaw and go to town on those nasties! Saw their friggin' heads in half! Here, my voice was saved a bit as Ash must've heard my advice from earlier and decides to bust out the bad boy flesh eating zombie stomper and shred their minion asses into oblivion. Never have chainsaws been so much fun.We are also treated to the same wild and uninhibited camera work from Raimi, something that made the original stand apart from the rest of the genre for that attribute alone. Raimi does not disappoint here. His frenzied technique fits perfectly and he knows it. Watching the Darkness from the woods chase Ash as he tries to escape into and through the house is truly an awesome sight. As for the camp value, unless you're dead, you'll find some humorous elements here amongst the insane absurdity. And I will state, for the record, that I enjoy this film's ending much more than the original's.A delightful addition to the horror/comedy genre, and a different although worthy sequel/remake. If you liked the original, you'll find something interesting herein.",10,2,2,28 September 2004
