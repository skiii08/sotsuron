The New World," Mixed.
","Collin Farrell plays a guy in the 17th century that used the F word when he gets angry. Didn't everybody? I kinda doubt it. Anyhoo-this film also casts a woman from Germany as Pocahontas which I found kinda surprising given that there definitely are more than one good looking First Nations actresses. Had a few good moments-when Collin Farrell's character is 'rewarded' for his good behaviour & tasked with finding the northwest passage-which in those days was basically a death sentence. Things go badly and things go worse in the New World. Made me think of the story about 100 members of the Rowanoke settlement that vanished except for the word Croaton carved into a tree-which pointed a finger at the Croaton First Nations which dwelled in that area also. No mention of that in the script. Lots of 'naturals' leaping about and vowing to drive the white men into the sea. Where they like that? Nobody knows for sure. Plenty of virgin scenery in this film and the relationship that developed between Pocahontas & Captain Smith is all this really seems to be about. It's not really billed as a love story though. Maybe it depends where you are in terms of how you interpret the movie. I can see Europeans liking it-as in probably the 'difference of it' (or because Collin Farrell was in it) For me -since I live in North America & have spent a fair amount of time in northern areas where First Nations people are often the dominant social group, I found the film lacking. And it made me feel a bit uncomfortable.",5,0,0,16 September 2014
10 Cloverfield Lane," More average than excellent.
",I read the movie industry blurb about this movie not really being a sequel to Cloverfield so I went to it not knowing what to expect. Personally I thought that they should have tried to make it more of a sequel to Cloverfield or done something not related to any other films. I found the whole thing a bit gratuitous. John Goodman is always in watchable movies and I think him being caste in this helped it work as a drama-since it can only vaguely be called a science fiction film. What they did is use a background of science fiction to play out an interpersonal drama-which is OK I guess but I think if that is what they were going to do they could have come up with their own science fiction scenario rather than borrowing someone else's idea. I thought there should have been more to it.,6,1,5,7 May 2016
The Maze Runner," An expensive to make ho hum movie.
","I had a time slot to fill and this film was available to watch so I saw the film. I had seen the trailers and I knew what to expect. The movie was no revelation on any level. I fell asleep in the film-twice. I thought the set work was worthy of an adult science fiction movie but an adult science fiction movie this was not-it was made by young people for young people.I think that younger persons don't deserve to be in charge of such a large project. The story line was kiddish and was not up to the level of the sets it took place on. Kind of like seeing a sixteen year old driving around in a Rolls Royce or a Ferrari. It just comes off wrong. The film would have been a lot better if they hadn't relied on heavy handed creature special effects that were in scenes that were so loud I thought my eardrums were going to burst. The creature special effects were definitely not subtle and appeared to be a combination of creature special effects borrowed from the newer Riddick film & the Resident Evil film series. Pretty boring fair-even for teens, I think. And it was loud. Way loud. Loud does't make uninspired & dull sequences work better.",5,4,9,27 September 2014
Hostel," Crass teens get their asses kicked by a larger evil.
",This film uses a tried and true scenario-crass over privileged teens from North America travel to a less privileged country and get their asses kicked by a greater evil than having no class whatsoever. The film works at a basic level but without giving away the plot lets say the film creates a false sense of victory at the end that the sequel squashes within its first five minutes. In that way this film is nothing more than a conduit to an even darker tale of hopeless suffering & evil. It could be seen as a cautionary tale and perhaps in a way it is. Who knows what goes on in out of the way villages in darkest eastern Europe. Transylvania is in Eastern Europe. This story is derivative of the story of Count Dracula on many levels. 'Vlad The Impaler' was a sadistic individual who killed entire villages via cruel torture methods. Much like the antagonists in this film-a Russian gang operating out of a secret hiding place & camouflaging their particular brand of satanism beneath the disguise of organized crime. Whats the message here? I suppose don't go to such towns-if you value your life. I can see that.,4,1,2,14 October 2014
Interstellar," Not good enough.
","This film made three major scientific errors: you can't have visible light from a black hole, you can't have planets around a black hole and you can't-according to current scientific theory- have a wormhole anywhere near a solar system. Thats a lot of scientific mistakes. I think many viewers compared this film to the classic film '2001 A Space Odyssey'. I don't think its comparable. The fantastic elements of 2001 were based on superior alien technology rather than never seen before because it can't exist natural phenomena. The film attempts to make up for its total lack of viable science by using some slick space ship designs, some unusual planets and some well known actors-quite a few of them in fact. It made me think of what a crook played by John Leguizamo said in the film 'Assault on District 13': 'its fascination politics'-as in this film is about mesmerizing its audience with slickness but not really saying anything that is classifiable as decent science fiction. That the world might not be able to feed itself is possible- that they might one day say that the Apollo flights never happened is also possible-but I think even a star studded cast couldn't save this sleight of hand show of a movie. Its been running forever in a cinema downtown nonetheless. To me its kind of a sad movie in that it really isn't very good but plenty of people think it is.",4,3,7,3 January 2015
Gone Baby Gone," More Hollywood Effluvium.
",This film is actually interesting. In a convoluted sort of way. There is good solid ensemble acting by all involved and a notable performance given by Casey Affleck who plays a youngish private detective trying to break a missing child case that is mired a mile deep in local effluvium. Another younger guy who deals cocaine is depicted in the picture at one point as being some kind of a noble person who 'fights the good fight' which I think is pretty damned unlikely. The depiction of unreal rotten morally empty people as representational of the people that inhabit the poorer areas of the good city of Boston-is tedious. One thing that I have never seen in 500 Hollywood movies is a depiction of anyone who grew up in North America after moving from England as a kid causing them to lose their British accent growing up in a place not England. Accepting that even exists in todays world is considered by many to be on a par with accepting Satan into their lives-when denying such things exist is basically what it is to be Satan. Given that thorny general state of affairs I would't call this movie ground breaking or noteworthy. Policeman takes kid who has doper mother-detective steals kid back and returns to doper mother which will ruin kids life-end of story-nobody wins. The movie doesn't enlighten. Things stink generally at the start of the film and they stink generally at the end of it also. Frustrating movie. So frustrating it is interesting.In a convoluted sort of way.,5,4,6,6 October 2014
Nightcrawler," A movie about demonic possession.
",At least thats what it seems to be. Played left of center. Its about a disturbing guy who wants to 'be someone' and all he has is whatever he can scratch together out of whatever he can get his hands on even if that means stealing anything he can get his hands on. The main characters motivations are dark but never obvious unless you look a bit deeper. Nobody really does except for one cop who basically disappears from the flow of events as if she were no more than a fart. I doubt the main character would have been so seamlessly exonerated for his misdeeds as the film progressed because his misdeeds were of an ever mounting nature. There is no hero in this film-only a sad fade to black ending as the main character cinches himself a better position in the food chain through more realized trickery and false representation. All in all probably a new American classic.,7,0,0,15 July 2015
The Revenant," Effective Film.
",This movie opened on Christmas Day and was the perfect holiday movie. Leonard DiCaprio deserves an Oscar for his performance in this movie-it might be his best film ever I think. Tom Hardy played the arch enemy of LD's character-which TH also did very well. I have not seen a bad guy like that on screen for some time-maybe never. The historical aspect of the movie was handled well-you really got a sense they were back in the 1820's. The film was apparently based on a book but I have never come across the book they are talking about. I really cannot say anything negative about this movie because I think that so far it is the most accurate film dealing with the subject of pioneer America. Go see it-you won't be disappointed. I think it will do well in terms of long term sales if it isn't knocking them dead at the box office right now-it will probably sell a lot of DVD's over time and become a 'new classic movie.' It deserves to be one.,9,2,4,19 January 2016
Wanted," Basically a boring movie.
","Movies like this are the result of Hollywood embracing the world of comic books. I liked to read comics when I was around 10 or 11 years old, for a time, but comics are no substitute for having friends. In a way this is a superior film-if you are the type of person who likes to escape into a world of super hero's-like a 10 or 11 year old might. For an older crew I think it leaves much to be desired. It simultaneously supports the notion that all people in their 20's are talentless losers who have to rely on their father's reputation of they want to get anywhere in life and additionally supports the notion that older staid type are endowed with super powers-as if 'Daddy knows everything.' Its a quick study. I think it actually does a disservice to the actors involved with projects like this-because at its heart films like this are seriously sappy. Minus all the little jokes. Which only support a larger nihilistic premise. Plus bullets can't go around corners. Even if you wish it your very hardest.",4,1,3,8 November 2014
Now You See Me," A smart & well done movie.
","I thought this was a very good film. It was a bit complicated in parts but I think it was well done. Action and intrigue and things that I have never seen in a movie before made this film worth seeing. I recommend it to fans of both action films and genre films. This is a little bit of both. The acting was great and the pace was good, never making you want to sleep which is something some movies make me want to do these days. I would see this again-and thats the yardstick I use to decide how good a movie is. The last scene left you wondering but I guess thats not a bad thing. There are unexpected twists in the film also which is different than in most movies.",9,4,7,8 January 2015
The Conjuring 2," This film could have been done much better than this.
","Patrick Wilson & Vera Framiga were fine in terms of their acting in this movie. The home of the family who were the subject of this movie was depicted as a pigsty, complete with dirty telephones and disintegrating walls & badly worn furniture. Such a depiction greatly reduced the scripts effectiveness as tale about 'ordinary people in trouble.' People generally didn't live in unclean homes like this in the late 1970's unless they were in the drug trade. This historical issue ruins this movie and it becomes a sort of parody-a parody of a horror movie and a parody of the late 1970's, which is probably not what it was intended to be. All in all it was a bleak movie but it was bleak due to its depiction of an era that had a lot of things going on in it. Little of which was present in the movie. I don't recommend seeing it.",4,0,2,16 June 2016
No Strings Attached," 'It's like a crime scene in my pants'
",Is just one of the classics uttered in this cheese doodle of a film. Others not far down the line include the all time great 'we are sluts we are sluts we are all just sluts' & 'my underwear is dirty' (referring to a gal who just gots her period the previous day) It's a freakishly bad movie about screwin' and sweet nuthin' else. I think that people go to these films lured by the prospect of a few laughs but when a film starts talking about screwin' by usin' the friggin' F word repeatedly ya knows ya gots droppin's for a movie. I thought this movie truly sucked and not because I'm a Natalie Portman hater-on the contrary I've seen her in some fairly good movies- same with Ashton Kushner. This just ain't a decent script and it makes you pity the characters. The writers seem to think they are endearing the characters to the audience but it does't work. The bad lines are so frequent they paint themselves onto your brain one after another like listening to someone speak in a bad dream. This film sucks. Really really really. It's like Seth Rogan wrote it. Maybe his penis did.,3,4,6,15 September 2014
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Move on Peter.
","These films were initially shot in New Zealand. I wonder if it was more to pay a 'homage' to a country that boasts the largest cinema screen in the world rather than for the scenery- Scotland & England are interesting from landscape point of view and would have been more appropriate since the Tolkien books were written in England, not New Zealand. I read three JR Tolkien books when I was young and much of whats in this film I didn't recognize-maybe I forgot it-maybe it wasn't even there. The film was forgettable in the true sense of the word- as in the scene with the dragon is so bad you will do pretty much anything to forget it-go on a week long drunk-watch 25 007 movies in a row-that type of thing. The only positive reviews I have seen for what amounts to an abundance of less than amazing films these days seem to come from New Zealand-home of the worlds biggest cinema screen-and the place where director Peter Jackson decided to shoot much of the footage for these so called screen adaptations of a decidedly wordy story for kids & adolescents written in the 1930's-that foreshadowed WW2-but that little tidbit can't be mentioned by Peter Jackson. Guess you saw that coming & I really should have seen this film coming also-it was predictably overblown and did little to enlighten the viewers as the the reasoning behind the troubles in Middle Earth. I still haven't got a clue-something about a ring-that nobody wants & a bunch of wizards that nobody can remember the names of. File under Unicorns.",5,3,3,28 September 2014
JFK," Too long.
","This is a well crafted film, but at 189 minutes, I think it could have used serious editing. I can handle 90 minutes to 2 hours if it is a really good film, but at 3 hours, I'm done before it is. There are plenty of conspiracy theories about JFK out there but I'm not really interested in them. This film informs, but it also expects too much from the viewer. I can remember reading about the now famous speech given by JFK in Germany where he accidentally called himself a cocktail-when what he really meant was to compliment Germany by saying today he was a German-by way of identifying himself as a citizen of Berlin. As a compliment to Berliner's. And to all German's. What he had technically had said was: 'I'm your not secret undercover German President of the USA.' That's a much more strange verbal concoction than accidentally called himself a 'cocktail.' Nobody ever talks about that. He could have just said 'I thank you all for being so welcoming to me on my trip to Germany.' I think it was a long succession of verbal gaffs like 'the Berliner bit' that ultimately caused the assassination of JFK. In terms of conspiracy theories I don't know if saying a thing was probably caused by something actually qualifies as a conspiracy theory since I have no theory as to what that idea might entail. Specifically. The film JFK doesn't add to anything in terms of the story of what happened to JFK. We know he was shot & killed. We know they figured out who shot & killed him not long after he was shot & killed. We also know the guy that shot & killed him was himself shot & killed not long after he was taken in by the authorities. End of story. Knew all that stuff ages before the JFK movie came out. So did everybody else and his brother.",6,2,9,21 October 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," Marred by a poor quality new version on DVD, among other things.
","Technical issues should not be a significant factor in watching a movie. They were when I watched a new copy of this film on DVD-it jammed there times in an otherwise functioning DVD player. The film is good-on the big screen-but its sometimes very dense visual field will not translate well onto the smaller screen unless of course someone has a very large TV at home. This also probably represents the best of what Marvel comics had to offer. When I was younger I was familiar with all the different comics and most of them were not very appealing-which would be most of the Marvel comics-since they were often drawn in an overly stylish way that was like using a visual language of 'artistic clichés' which was not very creative. For a decade at least there has been a massive amount of attention expended in turning Marvel comics into movies-and very little has been seen from the other comic book creator-DC comics-which was generally thought of as having the better artwork, compared to Marvel comics. This is a fun film but its success will probably only spur more adaptations of the other essentially repetitive and dull comics that Marvel churned out month after month for years on end. It is as if someone thinks that comic adaptations are always good for adult viewing also as if nurturing a never-ending childhood should be the goal of the entertainment industry. Since most of this subject matter is movies with a significant amount of violence in them that should concern adults. It should not be that kids are growing up with all violent movies and adults should not also be expected to always enjoy watching that kind of thing also-as if they were children as well, when they are not.",6,0,4,30 June 2016
Jurassic World," Another calculated cash grab at the wallets of parents with young teens.
",I suppose this film wasn't intended for people over eighteen. I think there are too many movies aimed at younger audiences being made these days-it seems like just about everything that has come out this year with one or two exceptions were films for thirteen year old types. Films that really have nothing to offer anyone who actually went to College. I'm all for a good adventure-in fact its what I like to watch the most in movies but I wasn't impressed with anything other than the film looked like it cost a fortune to produce. I was more amazed by the amount of money they probably had to spend to achieve the desired effect of creating a movie that looked like it cost a fortune to make. I don't think thats the same thing as an adventure. The plot line was virtually non-existent being merely a 'next step down the greed ladder' for the pseudo corporation that created the Jurassic theme park in the first place. The idea of using DNA trapped in amber is real science but I didn't get a sense that this movie would necessarily appeal to younger people with an interest in science. It was the kind of thing that Disney did a lot of-suggest science in a movie but don't actually talk about any specifics. ROOOAAR goes the big Dinosaur. OOOOOH goes the audience (supposedly). I doubt they were too many OOOH's and AAAH's for this movie-I think it probably got the ho-hum reaction it deserved from the thirteen year old audience it was targeting. Dinosaurs. Ho-Hum.,4,2,7,9 July 2015
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," Not to be confused with a film actually using a Transgender lead actor.
","I thought the music in this film was not bad-maybe a bit 'draggy' at times (pardon the pun)- but as the film draws to an end the true nature-the true not Transgender nature of the person playing the lead comes out. Ooops. I was hoping it would actually have been a Transgender person-but rather it was an actor playing a Transgender person-albeit effectively-but in this day an age if you want to represent an Asian person in a movie for example you don't use facial prosthetics on a Caucasian actor's eyes-you hire an Asian actor. David Bowie's involvement in the play this movie was based on makes it noteworthy in the minds of fans of David Bowie. There is Bowiesque music in it but I am hearing more Lou Reed aka CBGB's NYC punk circa 1970-which isn't bad-but again-it isn't actually rock tunes written by a Transgender musician. In a way I think this film defines the worst kind of scam-in another way its just good harmless fun. A drag queen called Jinx Monsoon or something close to that seemed to have been the only person with an 'alternate sexuality' involved with this play at any level at any venue & it has played at a few. One of the musicians in the band appeared to be a 'drag king' but other than that there was nobody else 'different.' I wondered if it was based on someone real but if it was that was never mentioned-or I missed it. Cute film-but it was what it was, so I just gave it a five. Some of the dialogue was...thoughtful-but it didn't come from a ...you get the picture.",5,0,2,9 October 2014
Everest," Just OK.
",Mt-Everest. It is 21 times higher than The Twin Towers. This movie chronicles the tale of how a man from New Zealand who had set up a high mountain climbing adventure company gets himself into deep trouble on the highest mountain in the world. Its a saddening tale. In the film there are references by a character who says he is 'going snow-blind'-a thing that should have been foreseen by wearing sunglasses to cut down on the glare-indicating an unprepared climber- which brings me to another observation-the character who said the bit about going snow-blind had his head exposed in frigid winds which makes him even more unprepared to deal with Everest as if he was hiking in the woods in Vermont in November. The term 'snow blind' can also refer to 'white out' conditions when the horizon merges with the ground in a snowstorm making you ipso facto: snow blind. Only a fool would attempt to climb Everest without extensive mountaineering experience and without the proper clothes and eye gear-as in even if its not very bright your eyes should be behind protective glasses that are flush to your face. Not in this movie though. In this film-which is supposed to be about real life events-the climb contains amateur climbers as well as experienced ones. Its a cautionary tale that says if you want to climb to the summit of Mt-Everest you have to be more than prepared and you have to be completely disciplined and you have to have extensive mountain climbing experience and even then-you must be ready for the unexpected. I don't think summit ascents are to be taken lightly and I think the high mountain adventure companies like the one depicted in this movie were taking mountain climbing too lightly. Apparently several books were written by folk who survived that day on Everest where a total of 15 people lost their lives. Also those written accounts give different versions of events. There are in total over 200 frozen bodies of dead mountain climbers on Everest as of 2015 and one or two are even used as 'mile markers' which I find gruesome.,6,1,2,11 October 2015
Sicario," Average.
",I saw this film in a big cinema complex for over ten bucks. I sat through a 'pre show' that seemed to go on forever and seemed to be aimed squarely at younger teens with Blackberries. I found that depressing especially since the film was aimed at adults not at younger teens. After what seemed like an eternity and after a handful of not that interesting looking new movie previews the feature finally came on. When it was over I thought it was a very average film. I am a fan of Emily Blunt & one or two others in this film but I thought that despite its impressive casting it was basically nothing special. There have been quite a few films made about the drug war that exists along the Mexico/USA border and this one doesn't really say anything new. People get killed and them some more people get killed et cetera et cetera. You would think that by this time they would be creating more sophisticated plot lines. Apparently not. This film offers no hope for a brighter future for any of the characters it depicts in the movie and offers no solutions to any of the problems it includes in its plot line. Frustrating cinema disguised as nouveau intelligence stuff. This film has about three action sequences in the whole thing which last a total of about three minutes-also not the best action orientated film ever made. Not a dog but in the ballpark.,6,16,33,1 October 2015
The Witch," I think its a well crafted effort.
",I remember reading the 'official entertainment review' of this movie after it had come out. It was panned by the critics. I went to see it just to see what they were complaining about and I found a film that was original in every sense. The characterizations were a bit strong but maybe thats the way people were back then. Nobody can say for sure since nobody is alive from that time period. I thought that somewhere in the film they could have found some way to explain why they used two 'v's' to make the word 'witch.' The reason being that the word 'witch' came from Scandinavia in the form of the word 'vvitch' meaning 'sorcerer' (usually a male person as posed to a female person) which has a more powerful evil connotation that the commonly used western term 'witch.' The origins of the term are darker and imply greater evil than a 'witch.' Anyway-the film was gritty in an interesting and different way and I think the film attempted to convey the darker connotation of the concept of a 'sorcerer.' Not a film to watch alone at night. Effective horror- something that you don't see very often.,8,6,12,11 April 2016
Steve Jobs," Hardly the stuff big dramatic movies are made of.
",I think it cannot be said that Steve Jobs was classifiable as a heroic figure given the plethora of unpleasant things that have sprouted out of the internet which probably couldn't exist in its present form without the existence of the MAC computer. A device SJ developed but in many people opinions-a device that was never finished. The one I'm using now is a newer one that has a keyboard that makes a fair bit of noise when you type on it-making someone using it in the same room as someone watching TV a problem-it will seriously mess with someones ability to focus on a TV show with its assorted racket of clicks. To me that defines a irritating design rather than a successful design. Additionally many people are now discovering that the big online retailers like amazon & ebay hold accessible but not erasable summary files of their purchases that go back years-which is where buying becomes something a little different. That SJ maybe didn't intend for things to be quite that way is a little like saying because Tommy didn't mean to burn down the building playing with matches he isn't responsible for anything. In this way I think the movie misses the point of Steve Jobs. I think he essentially just wanted to make affordable computers for everyone and ended up doing lots of other things....Nevermind that something that costs over 2000.00 dollars cannot categorically ever be called 'for everyone.' Saying its like the Volkswagen Beetle is a moot point because if you buy a MAC you still need a car. Making well know actor Michael Fassbinder-'the worlds only perfect man' the face of Steve Jobs doesn't change that the old expression of 'computer error'-the catchword of the 1970's era -still applies today-the only difference being the mistakes are now bigger and they cost more. Like this movie-it probably cost a bundle to make but I think it is essentially an empty gesture: as in the computers someone uses are like the clothes they wear or the car they drive-its just facets of their lives-and not the most important things about them. Imagine making a film about the life of Henry Ford-he was unquestionably an automobile pioneer but is that really film drama material? I don't think so. Its film documentary material only. This should have been a serious documentary so that pros and cos could be aired out instead its a press kit for some new electronic doodad from Apple-that you paid to see. Plus there is the fact that computers like the MAC bother a significant permeate of peoples eyes who don't suffer from eye problems under normal daylight. I think that is a significant issue that has been completely ignored by Apple and all the other computer companies in their rush to get something in the market place in order to cash in on peoples need for personal computers. 'Nuff said.,4,13,43,10 October 2015
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Priceless Rotten Filmmaking.
",I thought it was awful. It's like the worlds most expensive movie for children that was unsuitable for children: due to a body count of hundred of people dying violently it in the movie. I was a fan of the first three Lord of the Rings films so I went to see this one. I saw it in 3D on a screen that was too small to support a movie in 3D. It was so long that I left before it was finished feeling like I had just sat through a two hour kiddie film-one that didn't even work on the level of an escapist film for a number of reasons. Firstly it was so full of cheap monster special effects it came off like a remake of a cheap monster movie. Secondly: the acting wasn't very good-there were so many long looks the movie took on the tone of a life insurance policy commercial somewhere in the middle. That they were dealing with 'big things' was lost in the muddle that defined this films plot line. Really a titanic waste of time even for viewers with open minds willing to check out anything out there. For over twelve dollars I think that pretty much sucks. I give it no better than a four out of ten.,4,2,6,1 January 2015
Platoon," A good war movie that perhaps misses something important.
","The Vietnam War. From March 1965 to April 1975. Technically. They signed a Peace Treaty in January 1973 but the fighting continued until August 1973. The last US troops left in 1975. This film, Platoon, is a slice of the Vietnam War. Through the eyes of one film producer. In a way I think that Hollywood has never really talked much about the 'whats and the wherefores' of that particular war, in any of its films-even in the iconic 1979 film Apocalypse Now. Which is the best of the bunch of Vietnam War movies. In Platoon you get a fairly predictable depiction of soldiers who would rather be partying, struggling through hip deep swamps and cutting their way through dense packed jungle-hunted at all times and none too happy about it. None of the films about Vietnam mentions the ongoing US space program that just happened to happen at the exact same time as the Vietnam War. I wouldn't be impressed with the space program if I was lying down in mud, in the rain, in clothes that haven't been washed for a month, in order to avoid getting my head blown off by a bunch of people I'd never laid eyes on before, in a country I never had any interest in. I think the feelings of patriotism that followed the initial US decision to enter into a ground war in Vietnam in 1965 faded rapidly when the bodies stated coming home. By the thousands. This movie is a slice of life during the Vietnam War but its conspicuous avoidance of mentioning the ongoing US space program-which would have been on peoples minds-is 'selective memory' on the part of the scriptwriting. It wasn't 'that bad'-it was 'very much worse', in my humble opinion. Few haven't seen this film by now.",5,0,3,21 October 2014
Taken 2," A pretty good movie to me.
",I thought the first Taken was a good film and I was surprised at how good this sequel was. A person could say that it was odd there was a film starring Liam Neeson called A Walk Among the Tombstones that seemed to be another film director plagiarizing the Taken films and using Liam Neeson to help achieve that objective. The sequel to Taken was-at least to me-a very watchable movie. I have heard it criticized for having yet another batch of Eastern European crooks in it but it really isn't another batch-its the same ones from the first movie-and after killing so many in the first movie it stands to reason they would be out for revenge in the sequel. It made plot sense to me.Maybe it could be criticized for being a bit formulaic but I think that is sometimes how the world is-things flow along a relatively predictable track so maybe its not so formulaic after all. All in all-it was good fun to watch with all kinds of chases and fights which is why makes these films entertain and are not philosophy classes. Looking for Franz Kafka-its not here-but thats what makes it fun to watch.,8,0,1,12 January 2015
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Maybe a bit of a fun escape movie on a Saturday afternoon.
",From time to time I like to watch these types of films. They can vary from not bad to really quite abominable. This one had a really good cast and evidently plenty of money to work with. The film works well up until they introduce an enormous man-monster who likes to yell 'Arrrgh' and smash things. I find it amazing that they could not come up with a more imaginative 'antagonist' type character. I think that the filmmakers relying on such a clichÃ©d character is truly embarrassing. The fact that the movies story line before 'the big ending' was a bit more complex than usual was demolished solidly by the way the film ended. In general I think they have spent way too much time developing the whole realm of superhero comics into film & TV. Those types of works do work-but only from time to time. I think that the saturation of the superhero genre that we are reaching is negatively impacting on the sum of everything in the genre.,6,1,3,23 April 2016
Lucy," Great Movie
",This was a surprise-I was expecting something much more run of the mill but it turned out to be an excellent movie-both from a cinematic point of view and from a SF point of view also. Interesting story supported by great images made this one work brilliantly. Don't see many movies as good as this these days. Luc Besson did a bang up job directing it on a par with the best films out there from any time period. Three cheers for this one. I liked the way it was maybe a homage of sorts to A Space Odyssey in terms of some of the images-anyone familiar with that film will understand the reference. Liked the way it cross cut images that were part rock video and part documentary in keeping with the eclectic nature of the times we live in. With one foot in the world of trendy and one foot in the world of science it kept viewers interested in what would happen next. Nice build up to the big finish-best seen on a big screen if possible.,9,6,15,26 September 2014
Spectre," Reinventing an old Bond plot as a new Bond bad movie.
",Its funny how nobody seems to want to say that Spectre was a criminal organization that already appeared in an early Bond film-not just in this new Bond film. This is a good flick despite the fact they seem to be discovering Spectre for the first time. In a way I can understand why Daniel Craig didn't really want to do another Bond movie. Scripts become dogma if the earlier movies plots are selectively ignored. The fact that M was 'onto' the existence of an organization she knew existed thirty years ago is a bit like 'discovering' that drinking beer can get you drunk when you are thirty years old. Not so believable as a discovery. Since I have always liked Bond films I went to see it and it was full of action and most of the other things we have come to associate with a Bond film-but considering the plots total lack of credibility I thought it worked worked well. It could also be said that the earlier Daniel Craig Bond film Casino Royal was exactly the same thing because it was. Its gets hard to feel like Bond is relevant if they are just going to copy previous Bond films and call them new ones-even if they make it all appear 'contemporary.',6,0,3,7 December 2015
Joy," A dumb movie.
",I had no idea what this film was about-I just thought it might be good because of Jennifer Lawrence. Boy was I wrong. I suppose if compared to being in a hurricane or a flash flood-this movie would definitely come out on top-but as a 'movie for entertainment purposes' it belittles the audience and the people on the screen rendering them mere caricatures of people-not real people at all. That is strange to see-actors with talent wasted on what is basically nothing but a dumb movie project that isn't even worth being a movie of the week on some family orientated cable station. There were other things that didn't work in relationship to this movie-an endless 45 minute 'preshow' from the movie chain that treated the adult audience as if they were all in grade seven. Going to the movies has become virtually a waste of time-especially if this is the type of thing they expect people to go for. I heard the positive reviews by critics but I don't see any positive reviews from an cinema goers. Everybody seemed to think this movie was ridiculous. I know I do. Its a movie about a woman who designs a mop. That's right-a mop. Unbelievable.,2,16,38,31 December 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," This movie make no sense.
",This movie have script right out of how to speak pidgin English give or take a few parts. This movie make little or no sense. This movie full of violence. This movie maybe funny in places. This movie have low IQ. This movie make lots of noise. This movie have Charlize Theron (Charlize?) Anyway-this movie take place in desert and asks the question 'who broke the world? I wonder. The movie go on too long. This movie make me thirsty. This movie I won't see again. I got stuck seeing this movie.Hey thats a cool off road vehicle. Well there had to be something good in it.This movie had audience surprisingly comprised of older adults (?!) This movie was probably the strangest piece of big studio filmmaking thats ever been created and it made Planet of the Apes look like an intelligent movie. Well I didn't think POTA had much going for it. Mel Gibson not in this movie-which was probably a smart move on his part.,3,18,36,8 June 2015
Furious 7," Its a hard film to review.
",In some ways its a great action film and in other ways its a total joke. Its a lot of fun to watch crazy car chases but the man to man fight scenes were 'over the top.' You don't get hit in the head with a 25 pound monkey wrench and just shake your head and keep fighting. Its a lot of stuff like that-death blows just pissing off characters- repeatedly-that gave me a bit of irritation. This type of film making is all about bigger faster and more action-so I suppose it all makes sense in the context of the movie but at the same time time I thought they might have toned down the Godzilla versus Hercules fight sequences into something that would apply to human beings. Its still watchable as good action film. I think this franchise never had a future beyond this film anyway for what its worth now that they probably won't be making any more of them due to Paul Walker not being around anymore.I only give it a six because of the abundance of unrealistic fight scenes. Its not supposed to be a Rocky movie.,6,5,22,5 April 2015
