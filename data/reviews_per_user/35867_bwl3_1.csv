The New World," A completely mesmerizing experience
","Watching this film was like a new experience for me. It was like absorbing history, nature and poetry all at once. Absolutely nothing was force-fed or heavy-handed (i.e., 'Hollywood'). The historical accuracy (apart from the presumed romance between John Smith and Pocahontas) and casting were truly amazing. Every school in the nation should be required to show this to history students. If you're expecting a quick-paced adventure flick you'll be disappointed, but if you let yourself sit back and just soak up the magic, you'll be truly rewarded. If you ever wished you had a time machine to transport you back to another era...to experience firsthand what a long-vanished world was really like, here's your chance. I'm going back again as soon as possible!",10,6,13,20 January 2006
