The Sound of Music," every year at grandma's
","When I was a kid, the only movie my grandmother owned was the sound of music. And every time we went over there, we saw that awful movie. This movie really sucked. Especially when you're a kid that enjoys star wars. I think that everybody on this planet has a grandma or grandpa that loves that movie. In the sake for all children: Don't show that awful movie anymore to us. We hate it. Its not cool. And the music sucks! Its not that I don't like musicals, but this was so corny and crappy, that I never can watch it ever again. Why do you people like this movie this much? Can anyone tell me that? Whats so special about this movie that it gets the ranks it gets on this fantastic site. I want to understand, so please help me.",1,20,62,10 November 2005
Insidious," Big disappointment
","I was really looking forward for a new Horror movie from the stable of James Wan. As a huge horror fanatic I was thrilled to learn about Insidious. The premise seemed good, The actors were top notch, and the production team outstanding... Until...Spoilers Ahead:The first half of the movie was great, atmospheric, exciting and full of tension, but when the second act (the plot) kicked in, I thought... What the Actual Hell, are you freaking kidding me... Ghosts with greasepaint on them? A stage that looked like a high school theater play? This took me all out of the movie. It went from a good thrilling movie to a mediocre school play...I know I'm gonna hurt some fanboys feeling, but Come on!No, this wasn't my cup o tea. I need my horror to be more gruesome, more realistic and more exciting (all in the second half of the movie)So if your 12 then maybe this movie is up your alley, but for any horror loving adults... this might be not for you.",1,3,4,7 September 2017
