Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The turkey of 1999
","The worst thing about this movie is not that it stunk from start to end, or that Lucas has messed up the otherwise excellent saga, or that it's a movie made just for the money and to show what one can do with computers, or that every friggin alien in the movie was supposed to be funny but was rather annoying, especially Jar Jar (my God it must be the most idiotic character in movie history), or that it's strictly made for boys under 10 years, or that it has NO Star Wars feeling whatsoever, or that it is one of the worst movies Hollywood has produced for the last decade. The worst thing about the movie is that so many people liked it. It just makes me furious. Did any of you see the three first movies? - 2/10",3,0,1,13 January 2000
Minority Report," Almost There But Not Dark Enough
","Janusz Kaminski is perhaps the greatest cinematographer in the world today, and he is Spielberg's most important crew member. Minority Report is just as beautiful to look at as A.I. Spielberg has created a darker film than he usually does, but he could not resist including another sappy father-son plot point. This is exciting as hell, but Spielberg loses touch in a somewhat dull and too-resolving ending. The film would also be better without some comical elements which interrupt the dark style.

Memento," Nolan the Hack
","Became a cult film by fooling the audience to think it was original. It is not. The concept of someone with amnesia taking pictures to remember is stolen from Tom Tykwer's WinterschlÃ¤fer. The backwards story has been done before, for instance by Jerry Seinfeld and in the Korean movie Peppermint Candy. This aside, the film is quite entertaining, yet unimpressive.

The 13th Warrior," This almost tastes like turkey
","Quite a good story that should have made a really creepy movie. But it is not a creepy movie, just one huge fighting scene. Fun to see English actors try to speak Norwegian. The scene where Banderas learns to speak Norwegian is one of the stupidest moments Hollywood has come up with. Nice one McTiernan! - 5/10",5,0,0,13 January 2000
The Others," Sixth Sense Light is not so Light
","The Sixth Sense was bound to inspire other film-makers, as this film is a good example of. Nicole Kidman and two surprisingly brilliant and creepy kids star in this slow, but very effective horror film. Just like the above-mentioned, The Others concentrates on story and terrific actors. Nicole Kidman has probably gained from her traumatic events with Tom Cruise. She acts with a nerve she hasn't shown before. It's a chilling experience, which unfortunately loses touch somewhat in the end. It still leaves you with the feeling of having seen a modern horror classic.   Rating: 8/10",8,0,0,21 December 2001
Insomnia," An Insult to the Norwegian Original
","**SPOILERS**Pluses for good performances by Pacino and Williams combined with the magnificent nature of Canada (Alaska in the film). What makes this a major stinker is that it is a majorly softened version of the Norwegian original, to meet the commercial demands in the States. Skarsgård's unpleasant personality was the core of the original's success. Some examples of the changes include: the dog Pacino shoots is already dead; Pacino does not feel up high-school girl; Pacino does not have aggressive foreplay; and the ending is awfully moralizing. Complete miss by the overrated copycat Nolan (Memento was not the first of its kind). Rating - 3/10",4,3,7,28 November 2002
We Were Soldiers," Acceptable After the Awful Black Hawk Down
","Far more successful than the unjustly praised Black Hawk Down. This is not a terrific war movie as it does contain some terrible elements, such as, 'Tell my wife... I love her... (last breath)'. That was not a joke, it is really in there. But where the script is poor, the direction and the heart of the story are excellent. There is more wisdom said about the horror of war in the unspoken words than in the spoken words, and that makes the movie quite powerful at times. This is not an army commercial like the afore-mentioned Scott blunder.",8,1,2,28 November 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," OK Film to Kick Off the Digital Revolution With
","Admittedly, I cut Lucas some slack here. I expected far worse. This is a major improvement to the last crapfest mostly because it is much darker and there is hardly any Jar-Jar-pollution. Shame about the awful love scenes, as they interrupt the otherwise entertaining action. And of course, as always with Lucas, the acting sucks to the next dimension. The Yoda fight is spectacular. Finally, having watched a digital screening, the technique behind this film is clearly the future. Ten years from now everyone will shoot digitally, and I welcome that, as it is far superior and cheaper than film stock.Rating - 7/10",7,0,1,28 November 2002
"Monsters, Inc."," More Pixar Brilliancy Beats Shrek
","2001 was supposed to be the year where Dreamworks for once would win the animation war against Disney with their great Shrek. Unfortunately for Spielberg & Co., Pixar would come to Disney's rescue again. Pixar seem absolutely infallible, and they fortify that feeling with Monsters, Inc. Monsters, Inc. is a funnier and warmer film than Shrek and, to me, that forms the most important part of a good animated film. It still doesn't quite reach the peak as Toy Story and A Bug's Life did, but the difference is slim.   The story is extremely original and well-written and is bound to keep both adults and kids pinned to their seats through the whole film. (Only one kid started crying, which must be considered acceptable casualties since the film is about monsters.) Even the ending is cut right before the last mandatory reconciliation, making it much stronger. If the story or the incredibly entertaining characters won't do it for you, the animation surely will. There are some details and scenes here never done before. This is, technically, the best achievement in CGI filmmaking so far. As a footnote, before the movie you will be fortunate enough to see Pixar's 3-minute short For the Birds, which is the funniest short film I have ever seen. Rating: 8/10",8,0,1,21 December 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Not That Fascinating
","I have never read Tolkien, but I suspect I will have to quite soon. Since I haven't read the books myself, I cannot say for sure, but I suspect that the focus of the film is a little bit off. I was never completely captured by it. It was greatly entertaining, but I didn't really care that the movie stopped in the middle of the quest. I do not mind waiting one year for the follow-up. My theory is that the film focused on the action scenes and left out much of the magic and the feeling in the book. Chats with Tolkien fans in newsgroups have supported this notion of mine. Also, if the book doesn't provide more fascination than this, then it is strange it became such a giant in the literary world. Except from the missing feeling that good fantasy should contain, the movie is undoubtedly impressive. It is visually spectacular, and entertaining most of the way. The cast is mostly fabulous. Ian McKellen is of course top notch. Liv Tyler is great for as long as she is on the screen. She could easily have been exploited more. But the unlikely star of the film is Viggo Mortensen. I have never been aware of his talent, but here he shows that he is a star. The problem for me is the lead character. I have never liked Elijah Wood as an actor. He may reflect the book character, but he is not very charismatic on the screen. Fortunately he does not take up too much space, even if he is supposed to be the lead.My favorite line in the film is when the hostile dwarf says, 'No one tosses a dwarf'. Very clever.Lord of the Rings may very well be the big Oscar winner and I will, as usual, shout furiously at the television. It is a very good film, but it won't reach my TOP-10 for the year.Rating: 8/10",8,0,0,21 December 2001
Spider-Man," Satisfying
","Satisfying but not mindblowing. More could have been done with the excellent material, but it still portrays the story well with quite some depth shown particularly in the ending. Parker's inner conflicts are central as they should be. The CGI is so-so compared to Jurassic Park, which is now nine years old. But the costume is amazing. This is a good introduction to the sequel, which will be better. Rating - 8/10",8,0,0,28 November 2002
Ocean's Eleven," Slick and Fun
","I had to check to make sure and I found out I have seen seven of Soderbergh's films, and they were all good. The least impressive film of his five last was Erin Brockovich and that says it all. Soderbergh doesn't make bad movies.For once, Robert Altman's movie of the year does not hold the most important cast. I think it took nearly one hour before the last star was introduced in Ocean's Eleven. George Clooney is perfect in his role as the mastermind. He is constantly compared to Cary Grant, but he is more than Grant ever was. Pitt continues his row of cool roles, while Andy Garcia makes a a cruel and slick villain of the kind audiences love. The only objection I have to the cast is why they had to bring in Julia Roberts. Her role is so small and uninteresting, she just seems like wasted money. The film is an elegant and clever robbery flick. It is not of the most complicated of the genre, but you will have to be attentive to understand all the plot points. The usual characterization of the movie is that the eleven thieves 'rob three casinos'. This is misleading as they only make one robbery. I believe the vault they were going after contained money from all three casinos, which makes the catch phrase sort of unnecessary.
This film is pure entertainment, and it is not going to be on the Academy's lips - but I believe that was never the intention. Enjoy!Rating: 8/10",8,0,0,21 December 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Tedious road trip
","Far less interesting than the first, and this road trip is honestly getting a wee bit long and tedious. A bunch of characters try to find each other, then they battle some and that's basically it. It goes nowhere. Gollum is almost but not quite as annoying as Jar-Jar and the talking trees are plain ridiculous. The hobbits are still charisma-less and the dwarf is way too much this time around in his desperate side-kick attempts. The last hour is worth the ticket, though. The final battle is tremendous, but the two first hours are at least one too much considering nothing really happens.Rating: 5/10",5,0,0,27 January 2003
Moulin Rouge!," Mixed Feelings, But Mostly Impressed
","I am thrilled about and a little bit mad at this movie. The film is mostly spectacular, but unfortunately Baz Luhrmann is not only a fabulous filmmaker; he is also a raving lunatic. This could easily have been the best musical of all-time, but crazy and unfunny humor constantly ruins the rhythm of the film. Extremely annoying, but I managed to ignore it as the film went on. The musical scenes are absolutely fantastic. They are either explosive (as in the scene where the Moulin Rouge is introduced, powered by Fatboy Slim's Because We Can) or beautifully romantic. The soundtrack is a must-buy. I am usually a little troubled by musical scenes but in this film they work much better than the scenes where the music is absent. Nicole Kidman is as enchanting as ever, but surprisingly enough, Ewan McGregor ends up being the scene stealer. This is his best performance to date. He really makes you root for him. I think this is the best portrayal of 'boy in love' I have seen. Luhrmann messed up 'The greatest love story ever told' in Romeo + Juliet, but this time he makes it almost right with what must be the second greatest love story ever told. The ending is just as hopelessly sad as in Shakespeare's story, and that proves much stronger than any happy ending. All the visual aspects make for great eyecandy. Paris is portrayed as a dreamy and beautiful city just as it is in Amelie. Nothing like the reality, but that's fine. I suspects quite a few technical Oscar nominations for this film and also, of course, some musical nominations. I can't wait to see Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman duet Come What May at the show.I was, as I said, much troubled by the comical elements of the film, and would have absolutely adored a purely dramatic cut of the film, but if you manage to see past that (or if you are one of the few who share Luhrmann's twisted form for humor), you are in for a treat. I want to give this film as many points as I can, but I feel obligated to punish it for not doing all that it could.Rating: 8/10",8,0,1,21 December 2001
Mulholland Drive," So far best in 2001
","It would normally be disappointing to see that David Lynch is back to his usual style after making The Straight Story, which is his best movie so far. It would be disappointing if it wasn't for the fact that he has made a 'Lynch movie' better than any other 'Lynch movie'. Mulholland Drive can in many ways be compared to Lost Highway (1997), but Lynch has refined his style since then and presents a much more satisfying film this time. I am not a fan of confusing films. This film is as confusing as they come, and still I absolutely loved it. This is not a movie you have to fully understand to enjoy, as every scene and every character boils with entertainment. There have been speculations from prominent film critics that the film cannot be understood; that it is merely a dreamlike mix of scenes. I do not share this view as I believe I understood most of the basics of the film, but it is definitely a film one can re-view a few times.

8 Mile," Eminem v2.0
","Eminem is as good as I expected him to be. This is another good movie following the Rocky formula. It serves justice to hip hop, including some great battle scenes (as in rap battle, not Braveheart battle). The ending is somewhat disappointing - it is not really a resolution. One extra scene would make this great.",8,0,0,28 November 2002
The Insider," Mann's Ultimate Masterpiece
","Michael Mann is a true genius. After the brilliant Heat he has once again made a perfect film in every way. The acting, plot, cinematography, music and editing are all Oscar worthy. The Insider works, incredibly enough, as an improvement of All the President's Men. This film could not have been better. On my TOP-10 all-time list. Rating - 10/10 (I have registered 1800 votes on imdb, only ten of them got a 10)",10,1,1,21 April 2002
From Hell," Decent Ripper
","Jack the Ripper is a perfect story for a film, and the result is quite creepy. Actually a little too creepy. There is some gore and a few really disturbing scenes in this film and it gets a little speculative. I have no idea what the Elephant Man had a cameo for. It seems as The Hughes Brothers are more interested in shocking the audience than to stick to the story. This is only a theory of who The Ripper was, as no one really knows. The film is very stylish, painting 19th Century London blood red. Johnny Depp is solid with his usual melancholy.   From Hell is a very good thriller but it could have been stripped down a little, actually adding to the chilliness. Rating: 7/10",7,0,1,21 December 2001
Eyes Wide Shut," Waste of time
","I've always said Kubrick was overrated. It gets very long and very boring and at a part it seems like it will be a thriller but when the 2,5 hours are finally over you find out it wasn't. It was nothing. And just to make it all clear: everything you've heard about this movie is only b******* to get you to see it. Cruise and Kidman hardly touch eachother throughout the film. And how that PG-rated orgy scene could be cut in the States is a mystery to me. - 5/10",5,3,6,15 January 2000
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Don't Believe the Hype!
","I have not read the books. I was under the impression that the books were for children, but after noticing that many adults were reading them I had to ask someone. I was told the books were sort of like Star Wars - highly accessible for adults. Well, the film is definitely sort of like Episode I. It is made for kids, and I do not find it particularly accessible for adults. There are some great effects in this movie, but that is not enough to keep the attention. As the film moves on it becomes uninteresting and quite boring. I am sure most kids will love this, but the filmmakers should have included more intelligence in the fun, like Disney is a prime example of.
The mistakes are plentiful and the story does not take form before 90 minutes have passed. That is when the Sorcerer's Stone is even mentioned for the first time. This is a safe sign that the 152 minutes make an unnecessarily long movie. The biggest problem of the film is, however, the cast. The complete kid part of the cast (excluding Watson) is completely without charisma. These kids are as uncharming as they come, and I cannot believe how Radcliffe could be chosen to carry a film of these proportions.One positive thing I have to mention is a very cool chess game with living pieces. Not worth the ticket though.Rating: 4/10",4,1,2,21 December 2001
A Beautiful Mind," Fantastic Journey Into the Troubled Mind
","I am fascinated by the fact that so many brilliant minds are tormented with psychological disorders. It adds to the complexity and the mystery of the mind. The true story of John Nash is one of the best and most interesting examples of the troubled genius.The trailer for this movie is a hoax. From seeing the trailer I thought this movie was to be a bad romance mixed with a bad thriller. The trailer almost fooled me into not seeing the film, which proves to be the worst piece of marketing I have ever seen. This is neither a romance nor a thriller, and it is far from bad. A Beautiful Mind is a terrific drama about schizophrenia. It deals with psychology in a beautiful and original way.
Russell Crowe did not deserve his Oscar for Gladiator last year. He does deserve it for A Beautiful Mind. I believe his achievement matches that of Jack Nicholson in One Flew Over a Cuckoo's Nest. He is quite frankly stunning, and plays on a tremendous variety in this film. Jennifer Connelly may very well win an Oscar too. The stunning beauty should have been an A-list actress at least ten years ago. Let's hope she is finally recognized.If The Lord of Ring hype fails, I believe Moulin Rouge or A Beautiful Mind will take the Best Picture award in March. Of the two, I would go for the latter.Rating: 9/10",9,0,1,21 December 2001
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Improvement, but Still an Hour Overlong
","Better, darker and funnier than the first wreck of a film. Quite sophisticated Hitchcock-like mystery complete with Dutch angles. Kenneth Branagh is absolutely hilarious. However, this is at least an hour overlong and no matter how much CGI Columbus throws at you, you will wish for a premature ending in the middle of a scene for the last part of the movie. Still for kids. Rating - 5/10",5,0,1,28 November 2002
Ice Age," Beats Dreamworks
","In contrast to Dreamworks, Fox try to follow the Disney recipe in their first CGI attempt. And they do so with great success. Where Dreamworks have failed, Fox succeeds straight away to make a film with great warmth and fabulous humor. The animation is not as good as Pixar's and the story is not as well-plotted as Disney's, but other than that this is great fun. I think it also contains the first gay couple (prehistoric rhinos) in animated children's film history. The sabre squirrel is worth the ticket alone.Rating - 8/10",8,2,4,28 November 2002
Vanilla Sky," Interesting Copy
","I have no problem with remakes like Ocean's Eleven as they update old ideas. It is a little harder to accept Hollywood remakes of recent, successful foreign movies. The original is Abre los Ojos, which was made in 1997. What Hollywood does in these cases is a common phenomenon, popularly referred to as theft. That aside, let's concentrate on the movie as it turned out.Many confusing films have popped up after The Sixth Sense. This is certainly one of them and I have heard many complaints that people left the theatres puzzled. This should, however, not be necessary as I think the plot is very well explained in the end. I even feel a little too much may have been explained, but it is still of the more intelligent sorts of movies. It is highly entertaining and Crowe is a master of portraying warmth and he shows this particularly well in the ending. The problem with the film is that it is originally a Spanish movie. Latino countries often embrace the incredible and the mystical in their movies, and it somehow works better when they make these movies. Here, it feels sort of weird.Cruise has long ago become a mature and excellent actor. His character in Vanilla Sky is almost as written by Bret Easton Ellis. Pay particular attention to when he is introduced to his new mask by the medical team. The flaw, if I can call it that, with his character is his choice of women. I am skeptical to any person who would choose Penélope Cruz over Cameron Diaz, although that is what Cruise did in real life. Choosing her over Nicole Kidman is not much better though. ;-) Also, Jason Lee and Kurt Russell make good impressions.This is a high adrenaline movie with excellent music, and if you aren't tired of the Sixth Sense effect yet, this is not a bad bet.
PS! The introductory scene with Tom Cruise in a completely empty Times Square is not only impressive, it is also quite real. Rating: 7/10",7,0,0,21 December 2001
Amélie," Enchanting
","I have not been French cinema's best friend. I do like movies from the French Wave, but their newer movies are rarely interesting. Mostly these films portray the political problems the country is struggling with, and this is always done with extreme and painful realism. It is a liberation to have Jeunet in the midst of this. The co-director (with Marc Caro) of the two masterpieces Delicatessen (1991) and The City of Lost Children (1995) chose a different path this time. This story is very sweet, but it is done with extreme technical insight and originality. In other words, although it is another concept, it is still a recognizable Jeunet film. Jeunet is alongside Tom Tykwer and Danny Boyle forming the new European wave of brilliantly skilled directors with great visions. The film is a crowd pleaser, but not the way we are used to. It has been compared to Forrest Gump, mainly because of the naive and warmhearted lead character, but it is not choosing the simple path. You will have to be open-minded to new ideas and experimenting with the art form to like this movie, and it seems like people are since the film is met with standing ovations wherever it is screened. As a sidenote, Forrest Gump is still a slightly better film.The lead role is played by the fabulous Audrey Tautou, who is destined for a big future after this. She plays with such cuteness and charm that it is impossible not to compare her with her name sister Audrey Hepburn.
Amelie has been mentioned for Oscars nominations already. I think it will surely get a nod for best foreign movie, but it deserves to get the recognition that Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon got. Amelie is a much better pick than any martial arts film.Rating: 9/10",9,0,1,21 December 2001
The Sixth Sense," The Greatest of all Twists
","Finally a really, really scary movie. Probably the creepiest movie I have ever seen. The magnificent script stands as one of the most significant achievements in 90's cinema. Shyamalan makes a beautiful and scary story with immense subtlety and twists it near the end in a truely shocking way. Flawless horror. Rating - 9/10",9,0,0,21 April 2002
