Blade Runner 2049," Extraordinary
","First of all , the cast perfectly fits to film and the film was better than what i expected.The storyline was great , the acting superb they act like they're living it.The effects were made the film better and if you're in a confusion about to watch or not to watch I think not a think i definitely recommended to watch it.Although everything you ain't gonna lose anything , and i believe that you're gonna like it.",10,9,21,10 October 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Waste of time
","First of all, these are my own opinions.I watched whole saga more than six times except rogue one and the force awakens.If I disappoint you I'm truly sorry.The film was totally disappointing and it's waste of time.It's not what I expected.I thought they take lessons from The Force Awakens disaster, but it's worse than The Force Awakens.While I was watching the film I was extremely bored.Nothing was exciting.In almost every movie there was a feeling that is connect you to film, but in this film there was non.The only thing they've done is earning money with the title.But the real thing what they've done is humiliate the film.The film is losing their legendary and the value.I think the solution is not continue to this.Stop making films over the saga.You should've start making solo movies.I mean like Life of Obi Wan or else.With that you ain't ruin the scenario and maybe you can fit it with scenario like rouge one by the way in the last three movies so far, the best one is rogue one.Even the solo movies are may complete the missing parts of saga.Believe it or not it was most effective way.Well, these are my opinions like I said it in the beginning,I hope I don't disappoint you.Wheter I like it or not I'll probably go to the next episode.I hope it'll better than the others.",5,72,138,13 December 2017
