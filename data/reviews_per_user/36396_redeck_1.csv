Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Recycling is not good in the movies
","This was a disappointment.  There was far less imagination after a decade to plan than Lucas demonstrated in the few years between the first three movies.Too much was recycled.  A final fight sequence which happens (again) of a set of narrow scaffolds surrounded by power plants and deep wells.  A triumphant march at the end where the warriors are rewarded.There was too much wasted effort and not enough of the elements that work (such as the Jedi Council).  I especially disliked the way the identity of the emperor was heavily telegraphed (foreshadowing with a brick).I had no complaint with the special effects, the acting, the casting, or any of the rest.  My problem is with Lucas.  With a decade to plan, there should have been fresh ideas.  Maybe he is saving them for the next two movies.",4,0,1,20 May 1999
