Vertigo," More boring in comparison with other Hitchcock classicals
","Most remarkable thing that I can say about the film is bad quality of coloured film technics. While the world leaving 'white and black', the cinema producers of course started to use coloured film technology. But I must say that this film would be amazing if it was screened in 'white and black'. Both quality and the impact that it makes is important for me.Based on a novel, Vertigo explains a story about a man and his wife. This story includes John Ferguson who is a detective fearing from heights because of an accident in which a policeman died while trying to save John on the roof. This tragic event occurs while both of them chasing a guilty. Anyway, John becomes a popular man and waits for retirement. But his old friend from college Gavin Elster knows all about John and wants him to follow his wife with the doubt of she treats like a woman who has lived in past. In fact, Elster's purpose is to kill his wife to pose as she commits suicide and he wants to use John as witness. For this purpose Gavin works with a woman whose aspect is like his wife. The plan is founded to do on a tower of church because of John's phobia of height and so fake Mrs. Elster will walk up but John will go left half finished.From starting almost 90 minutes may make you get asleep but after that you may say that Hitchcock could do his best. Fake Mrs. Elster's fake suicide and John's efforts to performing the event are the resembles of creativity of Hitchcock. Performances of Kim Novak and James Stewart are also as wonderful as the director.Examining partly, you may not feel usual Hitchcock intensive tension, but it's completely a spectacular film. Two more criticism about some scenes: First is starting scene in which policeman didn't shoot the guilty from near distance and second is the John's following scenes with car. It's impossible for fake Mrs. Elster not seeing him. These aren't smart to fit in with a Hitchcock film.",7,1,6,14 November 2007
United 93," Remembering 11th day of September 2001
","I clearly remember this day and never forget along the time I live. Far away thousands of kilometers from USA, in Turkey, about 5 o'clock with local time, I was watching the news on TV. I couldn't believe my eyes which saw attacks on TV. Shocking attacks to the twin towers and Pentagon caused a panic in USA. This condition is transferred to the cinema very well. Whole departments concerned with these tragic hijackings got them amazed and even the army was shocked and couldn't know what to do. Even today people don't know how such tragic attacks happened and lots of plot theories are expressed all around the world.The story explaining the last hijacked plane United 93 shows the wild face of the terror. According to the plan that appears afterwards all planes should have crashed at the same time or close times to their targets. But this fact was not possible technically because of the delay time of the planes. This is explained impressively in the film in which United 93 hijackers see that twin towers' last moments and get the crash message when they are in cockpit. People's behaviours describe the inevitable end and in this times you feel like in this plane. Also a man's conversation between his wife was taking part densely in press.As a member of Islam, only thing I know definitely is that not All Muslims are like those people. Unfortunately the people who govern USA show all Muslims are like terrorists. I condemn the people who realized these disasters and caused the innocent people to die. While watching hair-rising hijacking scenes I was shocked and didn't want to be in United 93. The scenes make you feel as if you live these moments.In addition to those words, USA considered these tragic facts as war reason and after that the Neareast never had a peace. Afghanistan, Iraq and Lebanon and it is said that Iran is in row now. Shared characteristics of these countries are Islam is mostly believed religion there. It is also said 3000 or 4000 innocent people died during the crashes but several times of these numbers are dying in Iraq after the war had started. In other words 3000 or 4000 people are dying just each month in Iraq and furthermore no mass destruction was found there USA alleged it for war.To sum on, wherever or whoever terror comes its' name is terror. It can be sometimes realized by the members of an organization as it was 11th day of Sept 2001 or it can be sometimes realized by a state as it was or it is in Iraq.Not necessary to talk too much about it. Because it explains the real near past. Just watch.8/10",8,1,3,8 October 2007
Finding Neverland," I hardly bear not to stop the watching in halftime
","Basically describing a theatre writer's dream world, Finding Neverland, it got me bored during all the time. A man writes for the theatres is married with a woman and by the time this marriage comes to the point of end by means of another woman. To me, there is no remarkable fact to watch in the film an if the story that it is based on is boring like the film, I would never buy it.I don't understand why these kind of films are made and too much money are spent in vain? and more serious why do people overrate in IMDb? There is no reason to admire that because the theme is nonsense, the performance, the directing and the other factors are terrible, too. I hardly bear to complete the film and to say that 'I have watched the Neverland'.In my opinion, don't waste your time. Trust me...",6,0,1,15 October 2007
Citizen Kane," Charles Foster Kane. What an amazing name...
","I confess that I didn't know anything about the film except for it's name before I had watched it. But I wasn't regretful to watch it and spend two hours. The film basically explains a man's life who had to leave his family with their wishes.Think a man. He is promised to take over big companies after an age and he chooses just a newspaper that's name is 'Inquirer'. Starting as an unknown newspaper, its' circulation reaches the summit between USA newspapers thanks to Kane's amazing applications which especially concern labour unions. This makes Kane happy but this happiness doesn't continue for a long time. He gets married with the President's niece and most people believe Kane is intended to be the future's President but on the contrary he criticize politicians and even the President. This marriage finally comes to end at an interesting moment. This point is that his ex-wife doesn't support him against a blackmail of an immoral politician and thereupon Kane divorces her and gets married with a bad-voiced singer. He works to make her famous but it doesn't work and this marriages comes to the end, too. While all thoses happening, he also loses his best friend Mr Leland with a dramatic fact. Upon sacking him, Mr Leland sends him Inquirer's principles which had been noted by Kane and hidden by Leland.After this huge paragraph, I'd like to note especially that Kane is addicted to live lonely along his life whether it is in his power or not. Also it's very attractive to achieve displaying a media boss' life....and of course Rosebud. Rosebud is a code that represents the childhood of Kane.Citizen Kane should certainly be watched by the fans of ancient time films.",9,0,2,15 October 2007
Underworld," Mean-class vampire vs wolfman film
","In fact, I wouldn't comment for it. But when I start to comment for others, I don't want to be absent for this. Because there aren't too much reason to watch it and somehow if a film that I have watched isn't amazing I needn't comment. Most people say that Kate Beckinsale could be a good reason to watch for that but I think not enough.It has been one week to watch it and I don't remember even a remarkable scene so this shows the quality of film. A fight between Lycans and Vampire rises and this fact is also related to mankind. Lycans follow a man who they believe him as a superior featured for Lycan race. Vampires also follow this man and want the helps of their ancestor. While doing that, director uses too less colours and the story almost passes in places like the underground.I rarely examined the forums about this film and I am of the opinion that it is nonsense like most people said. But it can be scheduled for some scenes. You know, but I didn't like it...",4,0,3,22 October 2007
Shaun of the Dead," lots of fun wait you in it
","I have never watched Zombie subjected films like Dawn of the Dead which Shaun of the Dead kids it. If you have no information about the film before the watching and want to control of subtitle synchronization, you'll be get wrong because of seeing fear scenes. But it's completely comedy film.All the characters are quite original. Ed's a very fantastic and I laugh at his jokes during all the film. To me, he is the hero of film more than Shaun and already he finishes with an amazing scene. Ed isn't a forgettable man he kids also the hero's fat and stupid friend image. Shaun is also amazing.It shouldn't be counted as surprise seeing it in IMDb's top 250. It's aim not to criticize just zombie films also the clich√©s in cinema. I celebrate the whole staff doing a reasonable film with a small budget like a 4.000.000 $.As a summary, Shaun of the Dead's success isn't surprise, but it could be shown at the top of the surprising films.",8,1,3,22 October 2007
Finding Nemo," Very nice...
","When animations started to get popular in early times, Finding Nemo made remarkable splash with its' interesting subject. Fishes are known as creatures whose memories aren't capable to remember facts that has happened 2-3 seconds ago. So a man tends to forget most things, he is asked to 'are you fish memoried?'. The film based on that idea provide people to live amusing moments while watching it. Also the idea 'Wolves grab the sheeps who leave the herd' is taught for especially children who watch it.The adventure of a small clown-fish sometimes make people laugh and s.t. think. The details are also very interesting and worthy to think about it.Lastly, it deserve eight points due to its' interesting and easy to remember story.",8,0,2,26 August 2007
The Great Dictator," We think too much and feel too little...
","The last sentence which will save me from doing too much comments.'We think too much and feel too little.More than machinery we need humanity.More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness.'Chaplin is as usual and shows his talent in most moments. For example, the country names Tomainia and Bacteria, the dictator names Hynkel and Napaloni are so original. Gestures and mimics make you laugh while thinking the tragedy of war at the same time.The words which I start to my comment are quotations when he and Officer Schultz are together in √ñsterlich border talking to the crowd. They meet at World War while Officer Schultz running away from enemy. Jewish Barber saves him and they meet by chance when Hynkel govern the Tomainia before the World War II.Shortly Chaplin ridicules with the tragedic face of the War with bombasts.",9,1,2,11 March 2008
The Prestige," The most fascinating film that I have ever seen in recent times...
","It has been long time I haven't given ten points for a film. 'The prestige' deserves all praise sentences.The pledge, the turn and the prestige. The facts that shaped around these concepts are the base of two passionate illusionist's rivalry. But they are more interested in the last stage of illusion that is the prestige. Because it is important that the illusion happened or not, there is no importance for the shape of happening. Two capable illusionist are aware of this reality and devote themselves to beat each other. One of them is Alfred Borden and the other is Robert Angier.To the story that based on a novel, Alfred Borden and Robert Angier starts to work in Cutter's shows. During an illusion Borden causes Angier's wife to die. After this tragic dead, Borden separates his way Cutter and Angier continues with him. Whatever Angier does, Borden's illusions arouse interest between people even if Angier travels to America for the technological support of Nikola Tesla. At last, a machine that Tesla invented is useful for the show of Angier. It is supposed Angier to die by the effort of Borden and Borden goes to jail and waits for the execution day. In fact, Angier doesn't die and Borden doesn't go to jail. The person that jailed and waiting for execution as Borden is his assistant and also dubber. In addition, the person who died during the Angier's last illusion is his clon who produced by the mysterious machine. But no one knows that amazing fact.As I said above, Angier and Borden race for the number one in illusion world and they lose their family for the sake of this purpose. Angier works to gain new numbers owing to machines that Tesla made and Borden works to keep his secrets from Angier. In fact, his secrets aren't so mysterious as Angier supposes. His secrets are very easy and arise from a loyal man like his assistant Fallon. He is so loyal to lose his fingers and go dead instead of Borden.The last things I'll say about the story will be like that. As an electrical engineer, I think there is many injustices about Nikola Tesla in the film. For example, Tesla is pointed out as a man who finance his works owing to such special machine demands. However, his financiers was today's big companies to invent new things about the new forms of electricity. Of course Tesla was a genius,but I think he had never run after such fantastic things. He devoted himself to find out brilliant inventions that will be really useful for the humanity.Let me come to technical details about the film. The story is unusual and mentally worked on it. Besides I want to celebrate the director by the methods that he used. Twists and turns got me amazed many times. Borden's and Angier's daily came to the screen by dividing the story skillfully.Hugh Jackman's performance as Angier is wonderful. Especially Christian Bale charmed me like in his role of Borden. A person could become identifical with his role merely as he did. Scarlett Johansson shows that she is the woman of attractive roles again. The sounds, effects and dialogs are so harmonious with it.The film also gives ideas about the fine points of illusion art. If you haven't watched a remarkable film in recent times, surely watch it.PS : If you didn't understand the film exactly for the first time like me, you may be bored for the second trial.",10,4,7,24 September 2007
Hotel Rwanda," Hotel Mille Collines
","That is the hotel where a man works for her family to survive during a civil war in Rwanda. The hotel that is the best in Rwanda and serving for rich Rwandians and BM staff happens most Rwandians' due to conscience of a man who is Paul Rusesabagina. So this film takes the name of 'Hotel Rwanda'.Starting from first moment, a man who believes that peace will be provided by BM soldiers, disappoints by the end of time. He devotes his all work and life for his family. But the time goes and people from two different parts of Rwanda, in other words Hutu's and Tutsi's struggle with each other, Paul allows mostly Tutsi's to accommodate in Hotel Rwanda. His wife is also a Tutsi and most of his relatives are Tutsi. So, Paul - is a Hutu man - hides Tutsi's from rebelliouses and erase the registry of ID informations of Tutsi's who accommodate in the Hotel.The letters which the people write to high positioned people, provide some of them to take refuge in other countries. One of them is Rusesabagina family. But Paul can't leave the people in such a poor and undefensed condition. But, short moment later he has to leave 'Hotel Rwanda'.So this film shows us that how a great feeling conscience is.Thanks a lot Paul Rusesabagina...",9,0,0,26 August 2007
Pan's Labyrinth," As real as life, as fascinating as fairy tale
","Describing the World War II's Spain condition, El Laberinto del Fauno is a great story for adults, a reality for children. I have never watched a Guillermo Del Toro film and it was the first trial. I have newly learned that he is a Mexican, but if I didn't know that information there would be no doubt for that he is a Spanish. Only one point that I can criticize is that praise of illegal organization's struggle against a legal state. I don't want to talk about it too much because I don't have too much information of Civil War in Spain.According to the story cruel Capitan vidal gets married to a woman whose husband priorly sews for also Capitan's uniforms. After her husband had died, she has got married to him and while reaching the last stage of pregnancy, he calls for her with her daughter Ofelia. Ofelia lives in dreamworld and now she finds a labyrinth in their new accommodation. Living in this labyrinth, the life continues with the whole cruelty. Capitan Vidal's assistant Mercedes and Dr. Ferreiro help people who fight against Vidal's union. After Vidal learnt this reality, he wants to torture Mercedes like the other people etc.Synchronization of Ofelia's dreamworld and real life is very impressive. If you ask me a scene that I could never forget is the Mercedes's attack to Vidal's mouth. I have never thought a person's mouth in such a bad condition.Don't wait a simple fairy tale story for this film. Too much violence that we used to see in Tarantino's actions and fareast films wait for you. Of course the most important point is that intersection of a little girl's dreamworld and painful truths of life.",8,1,3,12 December 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," Identity, Supremacy and Ultimatum all are the same
","After the last part of trio had been screened in Turkey, I was disappointed as I supposed. I hasn't commented for others so I try to summarize in last part. It'd be better this trio could be screened in one part. Because all of them have great effects, but and furthermore they don't contain any other amazing scenes. Just the people who chase Jason Bourne are different.Of course, there are too many things that I can admire. One of them is Bourne's fighting scenes with the agents, one is Bourne's speaking abilities of foreign languages. I don't know they are prepared or spontaneous(sound man's dictations) but the hard languages like arabic, Spanish and the others are pronounced very well by Bourne.One point that I perceive as nonsense is Bourne's passports which CIA can't prevent Bourne's movement ability.Anyway, it can't be said Bourne Ultimatum is a good final for totally, but it should be watched while looking at unproductiveness of Hollywood in recent times.",7,0,1,10 December 2007
Fargo," Undoubtedly a masterpiece...
","I am asking the question myself that how ominous place Minneapolis is. After I had seen the collapse of connection bridge of Minneapolis lastly on TV's, I had chance to watch this film.-spoiler- The film mainly describes a tragedy that happened in Minnesota in 1987. According to that a car sales manager needs money to found a new job. He chooses an incredible way to obtain the money of the father - also he is his boss - of his wife. He gets in touch with two tramps by means of his master and the facts take progress. I can't explain after that because I don't wanna you to lose your excitement about it.Such tragic facts exist all around the world. But, I think most of them wouldn't draw attention as Fargo, if they were realized on theaters.Starting with this natural scenario, I think, the spectators couldn't leave the screen even just one second. The director already created a movie that's harmonious with this scenario.I think there aren't many words to say for Steve Buscemi. Like always he lets his abilities speak.His appearance exactly fits with the role. But more than him, I admire the performance of his partner who is Peter Stormare as Gaear Grimsrud. Whatever necessary for playing a maniac, he displays and does his best. I think there is an interesting point to talk about it. The leading role players' names remind me Scandinavian people's names. Macy as Jerry Lundegaard, Stormare as Gaear Grimsrud and Presnell as Wade Gustafson are some of them.-spoiler- The main music continues from starting to end, it is good for action. Effects are also amazing, especially shootings of Grimsrud and sparing his friend's foot in wood carpenter.Details from film are so interesting. For example Grimsrud isn't very talkative and that fits with his frightening image. Fargo seems as the suburb part of the city where it is located.After all the comments I made above, the last sentences will be like that: Scenario is so fluent, it makes curious about the end of the film and it is hard to forget.Fargo rises with Buscemi's and Stormare's fascinating performance and it deserves absolutely nine points.",9,0,0,3 September 2007
Little Miss Sunshine," Little Miss Success
","Little Miss Sunshine:If you perceive this expression as a contest target sight at first sight,you may make a serious mistake.This film is great for me because it teaches the subject that is not important what people think about you.The dance figures that Olive's grandpa teaches her are in fact a viewpoint to life.If the life raise difficulties for you steadily,you must fight these factors even if you won't successful.Olive seems to be unseccessfull but she catches the most important success:'Family happiness'.The trip that her family gone with her for the contest in fact ensures that every individual to be tied up spontaneous.Purpose was Olive's to be in first rank,but result is 'Family happiness'.In other words,failure means success.The message that Dwayne gives to people who watch Olive,is the sign of rebel to world.In fact if only Grandpa was alive at ceremony,he would give it:)At the end of the film Richard also learns losing is a natural result as winning.A technical error from the film is that:When the car's gearbox broke down,it was suggested to run on third gear level to Richard.After the Richard firstly ran on car while leaving repairman's,second trial wasn't ran on third gear level and the car never pushed by the others.Watch te film,learn to lose sometimes and learn losing means winning sometimes.",8,1,4,23 July 2007
North by Northwest," in fact it's not necessary to say for North by Northwest
","Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint shine like a enormous star burned by Alfred Hitchcock in North by Northwest.Unfortunately,these kind of films are extinct because of the idea that is 'good film is dynamic film'.All the characters fit in with people who act for it.The mastery in playing George Kaplan of Cary Grant is incredible.The behaviours of Cary Grant in film shows that how he is an important actor.For example,the scene that after he gets alcohol by force is great.When driving to cliffs unconsciously,he keeps up appearances and drives till front of polices.I will never forget this scene because of his mimics while driving.Furthermore,it is admirable for Roger Thornhill that he acts as if he is George Kaplan after he learn this phenmenon from CIA agents.I suppose it is injustice not to talk about the acts of Eva Marie Saint with some words.When she came across with Roger Thornhill in train,I really didn't understand her position on CIA,but I was suspicious.To talk about other imporatant facts in film,the behaviours of Roger Thornhill in auction,the moments before and after learning the absence of George Kaplan,the moments in corn farms and the Eve's shooting at George.The facts that happened around an imaginary character that is George Kaplan add an exciting pleasure to the film.It's a mistake not to watch this film...",9,0,2,23 July 2007
The Shining," Shining shines...
","This film could be seen as a clacsical damned ghost-house film at the first moments of it.But the minutes goes you'll see it differs from the mentioned films by the method of 'Shining'.Jack Torrance's son is Danny,as he has two personalities,senses whatever lived in the past.He thinks that his family's faith will be same as the Grady's family who were employee in Overlook Hotel.Jack Torrance wants to advance writer abilities in times from rest times of maintenance.But the time goes,he'll just interested writing.This sentence found by his wife Wendy summarizes the process of Jack's going mad:'All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy'.Although he got warning the managers of hotel,he'll go forward in the way that he knows right.As a Stanley Kubrick film,it isn't necessary to say too many words.From the beginning to the end,it makes people curious.The character that is realized by Danny that is Tony, says the things those aren't said by Danny.In the role of Wendy,Shelley Duval completes Jack and Danny.When Jack Nicholson is a future-promising writer,he transforms into a wild murder.As a imaginary character Delbert Grady dominates Jack's feelings is fascinating. The 'Redrum' code that was said by Danny's second character Tony along the film,signs the danger.Finally,'The Shining' shines as a Kubrick classic.",8,1,2,23 July 2007

I specially enjoy the final scene in which the rat directs the whole kitchen and whole rats like a conductor.Of course this is the funniest animation that I have watched in recent times but I don't exaggerate my comments. By the way this isn't a masterpiece and doesn't deserve too many ratings.But I definitely suggest the film who wants to pass a good weekend.Lastly, there is a big logical error that is the most delicious meals of the world aren't cooked in France, they are completely cooked and eaten in Turkey.",7,0,3,11 March 2008

Rocket dreams to become a photographer and to escape the City of God.On contrary, Lil Ze becomes a powerful gang leader and drug dealer.The direction is absolutely Oscar-worthy. The success of small-age actors is also remarkable.The director rises from Brazil with the support of the novel and screenplay.The film is completely good but I think its' time is quiet long and boring like the other long-time films(exceptions are Godfather,Good Bad Ugly etc.) Watch it.But don't care the repeating fighting scenes.",7,1,3,14 November 2007
The Incredibles," I especially laughed at the name of baby that is Jack Jack. I am still laughing at :)
","This animation is really different from the other with theme. Mr Incredible and his wife Mrs Elastigirl let you pass good times. Mr Incredible who is a public hero works like a superpowered policeman. Wherever he is needed he appears there and helps the people. Our extraordinary hero is wanted to retire because his actions disturb some people and government. After that he starts to live like other people. But heroism instinct is hidden in a place where it waits for execution. A boy who names himself as Incrediboy grows up and kills all the super heroes. Just an ex-hero Mr Incredible remains to remove. At that point Mr Incerdible is trapped by the man who is oldly 'Incrediboy' or newly 'Syndrome'.That fantastic story make you lots of time laugh and you'll not regretful to watch it. Especially Incredible's son and daughter make the story more funny than as it is. Dash and Violet is very funny and the baby's name is just a reason to laugh. Yeah it is very funny to me, that is Jack Jack:) But he has a key position at the end of the film.If you want to complete whole good animations by watching them, Incredible mustn't be missing among them.Watch it, laugh it.8/10",8,0,1,8 October 2007
The Elephant Man," Lynch's most comprehensible film that I have ever seen
","A man who has a terrible defect on his face from birth, John Merrick lives in bad conditions and far from people. A well-known surgeon who is Frederick Treves discovers him and wants to take him under his protection. Just for protection, because there is no possibility to cure and improve shape of his face.Lynch teaches the subject that people could be mentally ill in comparison with people who are really have an excuse or defective. The behaviours which people show to 'The Elephant Man' is proof of this reality.Hopkins' appearance does remember Edward Norton. As if Norton acted in that role. Hopkins' role in this film touched my feelings and I prevented to cry with great difficulty.As an interesting point, I watched a Lynch film with contentment.Finally, the final scene in the theatre is wonderful. The announcement that the famous actress Mrs. Kendal made to Merrick who show her, is a good final for this film.",8,4,5,11 March 2008
The Illusionist," No comparison with The Prestige
","After I had watched 'The Prestige' in recent times, finally I had a chance to watch The 'Illusionist'. But I am now disappointed after seeing it because of recommendations of my friends. At that point, Christopher Nolan's difference appears. I think most of you, who watch The Illusionist after The Prestige, share the same feelings with me because there is no creativity, or kind of tricks or any other things which could put it into the top list. A simple story starts and continues during the whole film.According to story, Illusionist Eisenheim falls in love with Duchess of Teschen in the childhood. After that they have to leave each other and after years they come together by chance in his theatre. Their plan based upon deceiving the inspector and public appears at the end of the film. To this plan, everyone is believed that Duchess is killed by the prince and Eisenheim calls the spirit of Duchess in his shows. Revenge of The Illusionist is very deep but he has to do that if he wants to regain her.Anyway, I can't find remarkable scenes to comment on them. It's not fluent and playing performance aren't so good.",6,0,3,10 December 2007

Wherever you look at it the story is full of nonsense.I want my two hour back, too.I think the director includes Michael Caine to prevent that spectators should comment badly. I can't find any reasonable explanation.Children of Men:I suggest you shouldn't watch,loss of time,nonsense.Anyway,you know.Only thing I know about that is this film certainly doesn't deserve to be placed in top 250.",5,4,13,14 November 2007

",The film shapes around 1950's the press's condition under pressure. A classical black and white view film is directed by Clooney.The story that is chosen is good for this theme.It would be better than that if it was in 1970's.The direction is very poor.I think George Clooney isn't so successful as his role talent.Almost whole story continues in studio and it got me boring.I couldn't find so remarkable comments.My comments come to an end because there is not too much thing to comment.,6,2,5,11 September 2007

Blood Diamond," Not good, not bad...
","I confess that clearly after I had watched 'Hotel Rwanda' and 'God of War', Blood Diamond didn't become attractive for me. The subject of it is a little different from thoses. In this film, a chaos between Sierra Leone's people is described like most of the African's country.I think, the time of film was lengthened unnecesarrily and this condition gets me bored. But, Di Caprio plays very well his role that is a man who are working to gain something from the chaos. Also, Jennifer Connely became a good choice for the role of a journalist who does her best. His and her performance are also remarkable.The song that played in background for the struggle scenes fits with the theme. Effects aren't so charming to me. Details and dialogs aren't worthy to talk about them. The film isn't so fluent and most of times are passing so boring. I wasn't curious about the end of the film.Although there are such routine points about the film, it deserves seven point because it arouses interest the facts that happened in Sierra Leone.",7,0,1,3 September 2007
Singin' in the Rain," Most fascinating musical figures that I have ever seen, and dialogs as spices
","I have heart lots of eulogies about this film till now, but I could just find DVD. Before I started to watch it, I had had a thought that this was a ordinary musical like other films, but I was completely wrong. Don Lockwood, Lina Lamont, Cosmo Brown and Kathy Selden. All these characters deserve to take place in cinema history. The figures which trio (Don, Cosmo and Kathy) displayed are so amazing and also their transforming ability ordinary sentences to lyrics are also brilliant. For example, when studying diction technics they transform a sentence to a lyric.Story basically takes progress around the four characters that I said above. Don and Lina are known as darlings by public, but Don always says this relationship is just for advertisement. Only his near friend Cosmo know this. One day Don meets with Kathy who also knows dancing in the parties. After that Don's life changes.You can perceive this story very simple, but it isn't absolutely so.I store this for my boring times...",9,1,2,10 December 2007
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," 'Memory Erasing'
","We are used to hear this concept about chips or digitally worked microbrains. But, this concept is dealed with about humans in this film. Although the people whose brains are purified any kind of knowledge, 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' slips off and it goes to the fact that it should happen anyway. Joel and Clementine whose are the main characters of story realize that sentence in this film and teaches us 'how to reach special person'. According to story of film, Joel and Clementine meet nearby a coast coincidentally. By the time, their relation goes forward and comes to the point that is end. After both of them restarted their brains to forget about past, they meet each other again. Finally, we should present our thanks to director, scenarist, actors and actresses to create such an interesting film.",9,0,2,26 August 2007
Mystic River," I couldn't find a mystery
","Three childhood friend grow up an almost cut the relations between them. They have the harmonious jobs with their characters. Jimmy Markum is still a hard man, Dave Boyle is still mysterious and Sean Devine becomes a police. After Jimmy's daughter died in a riverside, the facts goes on. The police and Jimmy's friends investigate all people including Dave. Dave whose brain is unhealthy after a car abduction is suspected.Clint Eastwood who is famous with the roles of Western opens a new page which is directing. Mystic River should be examining by this way that's comparison with his performance in playing and directing. He was more successful in playing more than directing. I think this is the same as a top class footballer's failure in team coaching. The film's name made me curious about the mystery but I couldn't find a mystery. All facts related to its' end are completely predictable. This was a wrong mistake to present the film as Mystic River because the river has no mystery. All facts are related to three childhood friends' relations.However I admired especially the performances of Sean Penn and Kevin Bacon. Sean Penn and his crew display a good performance. But I can't the same words for other players.All criticism that I said above is not an obstacle to watch it.7/10",7,5,7,2 October 2007
The Departed," Reverse proportioned performance to the Cast
","It is one of the rare films that has an enormous Cast and bad performance at the same time in history. I didn't watch it in the cinema and I am not regretful not to do that. Because it is really 'disappointment' with one word. One positive side of it is about Di Caprio and he has started to become a candidate of most wanted actors in recent times. Nicholson is like always and he displays his skill in spite of all negative factors.The Director tries to use twist and turns but I think he isn't successful. Most of people could think that my comment is funny but I will say that : The last scenes in which everybody shoot everybody and the scene that detective has been thrown down remind me Tarantino's style.Lastly, it could be watched but it's not an obstacle to criticize Scorsese.",6,2,4,9 November 2007
Psycho," The best film that I have ever seen including thoses to Hitchcock films
","I have completed almost % 60 of IMDb's top 250 list and it may be big talk but as I said above this is the best film that I have ever seen. I read lots of comments related to it, but almost nobody emphasizes the conversations that psychiatrist made. This is why I praise as it is in title. Most people say that the scenes like that bathtub hole or murderer with knife make it enormous. I agree with the people who think like that but in fact there is a more important scene that you watch breathless. These scenes are that the psychiatrist made inferences from Norman Bates' view and words. I will never forget these scenes.According to the story, Marion Crane works in an estate agent and she is wanted to deposit 40.000 $. Crane doesn't return to the agent. Everybody believe that Crane runs away with his friend Sam Loomis but the truth isn't like that. Crane starts to stay in Bates Hotel that takes part in the way that goes to his friend's town. Afher even her sister lost the connection with her, a detective starts to search for her but he disappears like her, too.A man who has two personality that he switch one of them spontaneously. This man is Norman Bates that makes history in cinema by Hitchcock. If your list lacks this masterpiece like me, complete it the shortest time as you can.Quite impressive tension scenes and of course together with sounds, inferences made by the psychiatrist, scenes that make you ask Bates' mother all these are unforgettable about Psycho.My admiration to Hitchcock increases step by step. Thanks a lot for all of them.",10,0,2,27 December 2007
All Quiet on the Western Front," A rare film explaining the World War I
","There are lots of film which explain the realities of World War II and it's not common for me to read comments of top class films before watching them and so I thought it was a World War II film at the first moments of it. But I enjoyed for this fact because there are rare films about War I.There are too many scenes like the conversation of two enemies in a hole and the final scene all of which leaves a mark in cinema history. I especially won't forget Corporal Stanislaus Katczinsky who adapt young soldiers for army. According to the story, young men who study in schools are encouraged by their teachers to fight for Germany.Explaining the spiritual and physical conditions of soldiers, this film is a masterpiece for me. I had watched lots of film, but none of them could make such great effect in my mind. As the introduction paragraph said, 'it will try simply to tell of a generation of men who, even though they may have escaped its shells, were destroyed by the war.'The film also says the main themes in it from a soldier to another: 'The War don't ask the thoughts of tramps like you'. In fact, who the real tramps are, a man easily understand by watching it. In other words, is a man tramp for killing one or some men in the battlefield or is an emperor tramp to give a nonsense decision for killing lots of nations and together with hopes.One more comment that I admire from a critic: Year:2008 All Quiet On The World Front...",9,1,3,11 March 2008
To Kill a Mockingbird," Important for the messages that it gives
","I haven't read the novel that it is inspired from, but I think the film isn't as good as the book. Because long interrogation scenes in law court make you get asleep. Most remarkable thing that we can observe is that the film turns around Gregory Peck and two little stars.A widower lawyer Atticus Finch has got two little children who are Jem and Scout seeming like a boy. Atticus has to do his job in the town and also he takes cares of his little two children. The children are so naughty and disturb their mysterious neighbour Radley. At that point, name of the film appears with the words which spilled from Atticus' mouth. However much a mockingbird doesn't harm to nothing or nobody, there is no objection to shout it because of doing nothing from warbling. But at the end of the film, while Radley saves his children from Bob Ewell's attack because of Ewell's grudge for his defence of Tom Robinson, Radley becomes a mockingbird and Atticus feel a great regret.Examining the scenes partly, a man's payment to Atticus with crops because of his misery and children's efforts for defense their father who guard for his client Tom Robinson are so amazing.One criticize for the Robert Mulligan is the length of lawcourt scene and of course it deserves to be in 250's by the message that it gives.",7,0,3,27 December 2007
The Bridge on the River Kwai," A strange story about construction of a bridge for Japanese army by prisoners
","River Kwai:The whole facts go around this river during the film. British soldiers are taken prisoner by Japanese army and they are wanted to build a bridge on River Kwai. This order includes officers but Colonel Nicholson object this order because of international war rules those say officers can't work like soldiers. Obstinacy of Colonel Saito and Colonel Nicholson finishes with victory of Nicholson. Meanwhile, Major Shears who was previously taken prisoner in Saito's camp, he escapes from this camp but he finds himself willy-nilly in the place where he escapes. Mission is clear: To guide the team and helping to ruin the bridge by laying mines.The film has too many inqusitions: One of them is the pride of commanders, other is whether building of the bridge perfectly by Nicholson is a kind of collaboration or not, other is Nicholson's answer to doctor for this question(wouldn't you operate Saito if necessary?), other is Major Shears' efforts for escape and return to the camp.",8,1,3,25 March 2009
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Chirps of one Cuckoo's
","Describing the story of a man who is priorly condemned, this film certainly deserves to be placed at the top of IMDb's best rated films. While watching the fight between Miss Ratched and R.P. McMurphy, you have a chance to ask yourself how the docs and nurses should behave to psychopaths. Coming from jail for the observation, an extraordinary man who is R.P. McMurphy decides to make the medication central a social place in spite of Mrs. Ratched. In this way, Mrs. Ratched raises all kind of difficulties.R.P. McMurphy is a smart man and does his best to entertain his friends. He finds meeting times very absurd and thinks that the best medication is to do social activities. Boat trip, basketball match and even a party in nighttime in the central.R.P. McMurphy let you think and laugh, Harding reminds you to your obsessions, Chief for secret side of us and the other whole characters are excellent. I want confess that I swear Mrs. Ratched too much and I know such kind of people are real in the world.Billy's and McMurphy's touching ends make me sad st the end of the film but theses go wells with the theme of film.I start to hide this film in my library and I'll watch whenever I remember it.",9,0,2,15 October 2007
Shooter," Mark Wahlberg dominates almost the whole film
","I was like I would hear that 'Shooter' is same as 'Jackal'. Yeah, Shooter starts with this familiar subject and but the film shows that it is a big mistake comparing with 'Jackal'. In fact the director gives us some clues that sergeant Bob Lee Swagger is called out for this aim. But the film turns to a different shape differing from 'Jackal'. Bob Lee Swagger who is fighting for USA in Africa is now in his house to seclude himself because of losing his partner in Africa. He is deceived with the feeling of patriotism and he is wanted to develop a possible assassination plan to the president to prevent the real one. Colonel lsaac Johnson who is inside dirty works in Africa with a high level senator Charles Meachum persuades Swagger. Swagger works for that in such manners which will make him number one suspicious after the assassination. In fact assassination isn't against the president, it is against headpriest of an African's country because of the wish of destroying assassination reasons. Like everyone Swagger doesn't realise the real fact and moreover he is charged with the assassination because of his perfect assassination plan and he finds himself in a well-designed trap.The technical details got me amazed and I especially admire visual effects producer. According to me starting and finishing scenes are very important for a film to deserve good comments. 'Shooter' already deserves that. I think Antoine Fuqua did a good job with 'Shooter' and I will be waiting for the other ones to follow his line. Musics are also so creative.Let me talk to some players. As I said above Mark Wahlberg dominates almost the whole film. I don't remember such a film that Wahlberg completely carried it to the summit himself. But it is unjustice not to talk about Danny Glover's performance. As Colonel lsaac Johnson, Danny Glover really does his best. Michael Pena also fits in with beginner agent role and his role's form changes after assassination.Pointing my words, I touch on gun specialist's, crippled man's and Senator's talkings. These are all about USA's acts all around the world. USA people, I call out to you. Give ear these words and don't believe the people who govern you any more. Why? Because, there was no mass-destruction weapons in Iraq where people are hungry appeared during the invasion. Abu-Ghraib is not a terrorist capturing central where most innocent people is jailed. In fact, most important points that I will remember about the film are thoses.As a summary, 'Shooter' is a top-class film and surely watch it.",9,0,3,1 October 2007
The Terminal," The Terminal gives us important lessons about loyalty to a promise.
","The Terminal's theme is an extraordinary wherever you look at it. The JFK airport does landlordness to a unusual visitor who run after a special target. According to the story, an Asian man who is Viktor Navorski, wants to realize a promise that he gave to the father. The promise which Navorski works to realize is a deficient sign that wasn't only written a Jazz Legend Benny Golson who shares the same photo with Navorski's father like other Jazz masters. Upon his father will, Navorski must complete all the signs of people who take part in a special photo. Only Golson must be completed by him, but Golson lives in USA and Navorski goes a long trip. As a coquetry of faith, while he passes JFK's border, the government in his country is removed by rebellious people and his country is removed also from the list that USA accepts. In this condition Navorski happens stateless and JFK foreigners department seize the Navorski's position. Navorski starts to live in JFK as forming a living area with the hope of USA's accepting his country as a country. He waits for a long time and acquires good relationships with airport staff. Then the time turns and he reaches his purpose.I think there is a light similarity between Castaway and this film by the direction of survival effort.This amazing story got me amazed. Almost the whole story take place in an airport. Hanks' innocent behaviours fit in with his role like 'I am an Englishman in New York'. I didn't find so effective the performance of director. The time of it is too long as two hours.In spite of some long and boring scenes, The Terminal is worthy to watch. Because Viktor Navorski doesn't terminate his hopes about his target.",7,0,1,24 September 2007
Trainspotting," waste of time
","I think this film express for me just waste of time. Examining to the damages of heroin,this film may be evaluated as a trainer film. The main character of Renton,is a good example for the people who are addicted to it or people who are thinking to start it.But this film certainly doesn't deserve high points from IMDb and I didn't understand why the commentors are so interested in this film.The thing that interests me is that home life of Englih people is so disgusting.As a result of these factors,I can't find remarkable scenes or a theme to comment...",2,19,44,23 July 2007
Speed," good but old...
","I think that this film can be classified as a simple TV action movie.In our country,TV channels put it at broadcast so many times and I am bored watching the scenes that contains keanu,sandra and the other characters in bus.As comparison with the role of Neo,I laugh and laugh.I suppose that Keanu took an indispensable place in our brains with the Matrix film and so his other films and the roles in this films such as 'speed','sweet November' can be funny for us.Lastly it is a good action for weekend removing this film from the unseen action films file.",6,0,1,3 February 2007
Sin City," 'Sin City' describes the all things which should be in a Sin City with an amazing directing
","I haven't watched too many films which are based on the comics but I have a little information about them. So I can say that Sin City breaks new ground in this sector by many side. For example, the colours used in it are so amazing. White-black weighted film uses the red for the violence and sex and uses the yellow dirt. Hartigan's, Marv's and Dwight's actions are all MARVellous. You don't leave even just a second to the screen by watching them.Many people criticize the comment that Tarantino's affect is felt in the movie but he's really there. This staff had made me amazed before I watched it because Madsen, Willis and the others have the all properties for a spectator who follow the Tarantino's line.Sin City is candidate to enter to the mostly watched classicals.",9,4,5,15 October 2007
Goodfellas," Living in the Gangsta's paradise...
","Henry Hill : He is a kind of child who is inclined to disorder. So by the effect of surrondings he attended to a mafia. He was introduced with James Conway and Tommy DeVito. Before he got larger benefits with them, he had been directly working for Paul Cicero who is already a friend of Paul Cicero. I think Henry Hill ask himself that if I wasn't a gangster, what would I become? There is no answer for this question and so Henry found a way out to realize his dreams. Like most of the people who has got money and fame afterwards did, it isn't easy to get used to this kind of life. He came to the divorcing point and even he jailed after a fact that trio beated a man whose sister works in Federal Bureau. The time goes and Tommy is killed by the men of a killed mafia leader. After that the whole flow of facts change and Paul, Henry and Tommy's friendships are destroyed so that Henry squeals them to the police.Script and direction is upper-mediate. Actors and their performance are not needed to say lot of words. I especially admired Joe Pesci as Tommy DeVito who doesn't grudge his bullets from nobody. Even if he is simply ridiculed by someone, he shoots him and he draw a cruel man image. On the contrary, Henry and Jimmy uses their brains more than the bullets. The trio reflects the behaviours of a classic mafia group. The most fascinating scene is that when digging up a corpse which is buried six month before, the words Tommy said to Henry is 'My mom is preparing sausage and pepper for us'.Between the it's similars, Goodfellas could be a good example upon explaining for mafia formation. But Goodfellas never could be a 'Godfather'.",8,0,0,24 September 2007
Valkyrie," A common film based upon a real story
","There are too many World War II films in the cinema history. But it should be differed from the others by the story. Because, most of them are shaped around war tactics, strategies and struggle scenes with blood and gun. Any other facts from this direction are common for me. Directory, Directory of photography, music etc. don't become felt strongly. Characters excluding Tom Cruise don't shine as deserving to Cast's powerful elements. Such an interesting story would be reflected to cinematography according to me. I think, the director and the writer didn't show an amazing effort and they had a simple way to create a film. One important reason to watch it, may be how great organizations contain such great ambitions,fights for the sake of leadership or willing to have decision mechanism.",7,5,15,8 April 2009
