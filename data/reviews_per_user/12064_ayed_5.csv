The Blair Witch Project," Pseudo-documentary that is truly frightening
","Let me preface these comments by saying that I have never been scared by a movie in my 20 years of viewing.  Sure, isolated moments in some of the more effective films of the horror genre have made me jump, but I have never experienced the growing dread and unease inspired by The Blair Witch Project.By now, the media-hype surrounding the unprecedented box-office success of this shoestring budget indie film has begun to overshadow the power of the pure film experience.  This is a shame.  I wish everyone could come to this film as I did -- unaware of the hype, knowing just the barest plot details. Add to that mix a quiet, respectful audience (though very near the theatre's 500 seat capacity) in a Maryland cinema.... and you would have the ideal ambiance for enjoying (is that the right word?) this film.  Too many people are going to see Blair Witch with their expectations artificially inflated and, inevitably, many of them will be disappointed because this film does NOT hold your hand in the typical Hollywood fashion, revealing all its secrets and tying the plot's threads into a neat package at film's end.To those of you who have yet to see the film, these words of advice: do not immerse yourself in the media coverage before you go.  Do not seek out the 'answers' to the film's unresolved questions found on web pages and in the film's companion book.  The power of this movie is its ability to make you empathise with the fairly mundane yet primal emotions expressed by the actors.  As you follow the 'filmmakers' on their journey into the woods, you feel the characters' frustration, confusion, disorientation, and, most importantly, fear of the unknown.  The tangible 'horrors' of standard 'scary movies' -- the killer in the hockey mask, the monster stalking the summer camp -- are constrained the moment their image appears on film.  Blair Witch proves (as do the perpetually disappointing adaptations of Stephen King's genuinely frightening novels) that hinted-at, suggested horrors fleshed out by the viewer's (or reader's) imagination are far more powerful than the best work of Hollywood's special effects teams.",10,1,2,25 August 1999
Being John Malkovich," Metaphysical thrillride
","This movie was an amazing experience -- alternately hilarious, perplexing, dazzling, disturbing, surreal, moving, and intellectually engaging (frequently several of these within one scene).  I don't know how to describe the 'plot,' beyond the bits you no doubt have heard in the press, but I can say that it will take you through an amazing journey in two hours. The superb script challenges your notions of free will, sense of 'self,' and control -- but without seeming preachy or philosophically dry.  I am amazed that director Spike Jonze has created such a complex and layered work -- but one which is internally consistent -- in his first work that runs over 4 minutes.  The main themes are echoed throughout the film and by each of the main characters.  For example, the idea of 'control' is taken up with manipulative (sociopathic?) woman who views people as mere instruments to satisfy her desires, several characters who attempt varying degrees of emotional control over their partners, and in the actual and metaphorical 'puppet masters' at work in the film.It is interesting to note that Jonze and writer Charlie Kaufmann make light of the philosophical dimension to the film by having John Cusack's befuddled character give a confused take on the 'metaphysical implications' of his first experience 'being John Malkovich' early in the film.  In a way, this sets the tone for the film, as its creators say: 'this is serious stuff, but don't take us too seriously.'  I encourage everyone to seek out and enjoy the richness of this film.",10,0,1,22 November 1999
X-Men: The Last Stand," incoherent mess
","what a disappointment! while the first two installments of this series were far from classics, they at least stayed (relatively) true to the characters and were internally consistent, plot-wise (of course, they deviate quite a bit from the long and convoluted history of the X-Men in the comics, but that is to be expected -- and isn't a problem for me, as long as the stories make sense). you will search in vain for that kind of competent film-making here, as daytime scenes suddenly turn to night (for no reason & without time elapsing), characters come and go with little or no explanation or motive, and the plot 'develops' with no discernible reasons or direction. as always, there are some nifty special effects, but as g. lucas has amply proved, special effects wizardry in the absence of good dialogue and plot is an empty exercise indeed. amazingly, hack director brett ratner (who only took over this project after he nearly ruined the new Superman movie -- and ya gotta wonder why the producers would hire him after he got fired from that project) can't even coax good performances out of highly gifted actors like hugh jackman and halle berry (patrick stewart and ian mckellan were still good, although they had precious little to work with here).take my advice -- wait for the DVD if you must see this, it just isn't worth the money in the theatres. and make sure to RENT the DVD, you will not want to watch it more than once.",3,1,1,26 May 2006
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," perfect integration of technique and story
","what can i say that hasn't been said about this film? probably nothing, coming so late to the party. however, i will say this: like 'Memento,' this film deploys an inventive technical approach to the storytelling (time shifts, surreal editing and soundtrack effects, etc) that are decidedly NOT gimmicky. in the hands of lesser storytellers, devices such as these can come off as needlessly 'film school-ish' or simply confusing. here, however, form and content -- directing and scriptwriting -- compliment each other PERFECTLY. the WAY the story is told is integral, essential to the story itself; and vice versa.add to the above the fact that charlie kaufmann has truly hit his stride with this film. which is not to say that he has not produced excellent work in the past -- 'Being John Malkovich' and 'Adaptation' are both outstanding movies. However, 'Eternal Sunshine' adds an enormous, non-schmaltzy, non-rom-com element of HEART to kaufmann's usual bag of tricks (surreal story, highly inventive plotting, sparkly dialogue). the result is a masterpiece, the clear movie of the year. of course, that means it wasn't even nominated for that honor. (nor, for that matter, was the year's SECOND best film, 'Farenheit 911.') and add to both of the above, truly outstanding performances by both leads, Kate Winslet (deservedly nominated for an Academy Award) and Jim Carrey (once again snubbed, despite showing enormous depth and a gentle touch that could not contrast more with his over-the-top antics in his straight comedic roles). Winslet OUGHT to win this award, but i fear she will not. basically, the film is just TOO WEIRD for the largely staid membership in the Academy. Which is too bad, this kind of work should be recognized and encouraged. Winslet and Carrey took enormous pay cuts (Carrey was working for peanuts, compared to what he could command in a mindless slapstick role) in order to produce some excellent work. Good for them -- I wish they were both recognized and rewarded for their efforts. One day, we may look back on Jim Carrey's body of work the way we do Bill Murray's, and just shake our heads ruefully, knowing the Academy's prejudice against comedies and comedic actors have robbed another talented performer of his just due. Hopefully, however, Carrey will continue to produce quality works like this one, long enough for the 'old guard' to be replaced by younger, more open-minded judges. And when that day comes, Charlie Kauffman will also receive his due.",10,1,4,24 February 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Return of the FUN
","Well, i just got back from the midnight show and... wow.Let me try to break that down a little. First, the CGI work is fantastic, magical, and it feels real in a way that, say, jar jar never did. Besides the (very true) criticism of jar jar as being annoying and stupid, 'he' was also a bad effect -- he always seemed super-imposed on the film, not quite real (however good the animation, in isolation, may have been). This movie has conquered that problem. The equally-all-CGI General Grievous, for example, really feels like 'he' is sharing scenes with Ewen McGregor and Hayden Christensen. The battle scenes, especially the opening space battle, are astonishing, it's like being on a thrill ride. The light saber battles -- and there are many -- are far beyond any that have come before. The only one that even comes close is Luke-Vader in Ep. V -- and that was so good more for the emotional content than the sword-play.Which is a nice segue to: the emotional landscape. Lucas has received (much deserved) criticism for paying more attention to his special effects than to his actors, and this film doesn't completely turn that problem around. However, the film does have a powerful emotional pull. The friendship -- the love -- between Obi-Wan and Anakin is very well portrayed in the first half, which is essential to the overall film, or Anakin's fall into darkness wouldn't be so moving. It is surprisingly affecting -- I guess I didn't expect to feel upset about Anakin turning into Darth Vader, since I've known that fact for 25 years. But knowing it and seeing it play out on screen are very different things... there are many little moments where I found myself thinking 'if only...' or 'don't treat him like that! don't you know what you are driving him towards?' The only way to describe what is being portrayed is 'tragedy,' in the classical sense. Perhaps that's a little high-falutin' for a popcorn flick, but like I said, it was surprisingly moving.The Padme-Anakin 'love' affair (and its disintegration) is less-well realized, for two reasons -- first, Lucas has never (in this film or in Ep. II) shown us this supposed love, he just has the characters say 'I love you' a lot -- which is NOT the same thing. (By contrast, Obi-Wan and Anakin show that they love each other, without saying it -- which is much more effective.) Still, Lucas does a good job of linking Anakin's love for -- and, more importantly, fear of losing -- Padme to his descent to the dark side. Second, Natalie Portman just isn't as good as Ewen McGregor, who does a great job of communicating his love for Anakin -- and his anguish over what he becomes. Which leads me to...The acting. Well, Hayden is better than Ep. II, but still not great. He does a very good job in the first half, playing the charismatic hero, but can't fully pull off the (admittedly difficult) task of conveying Anakin's conflicting emotions, loyalties, fears, doubts... Still, he does a passable job. Natalie Portman is a fine actress, but in this film, she seems lost most of the time. In fact, she has taken a step backwards from Ep. II, where I actually believed she was a politician trying to solve the complexities of the Republic's dying days. Here, she seems passive, and can't negotiate the conflicting emotions her character is supposed to be feeling. She isn't a liability, however; it's just that she could have done more with the material (and probably would have in the hands of a more capable director). The two actors that shine are McGregor (as Obi-Wan) and Ian McDiarmid (as Palpatine). These two basically put the film on their backs and carry it throughout -- and a fine job they do of it, too. McDiarmid obviously relishes being able to blossom into the Emperor's full evil, but it is his subtle -- and not-so-subtle -- manipulation of Anakin, orchestrating his fall into the dark side, that really steals the show. Ewen McGregor is the best actor here, however (with all due deference to the amazing Samuel L. Jackson -- the Mace Windu role simply doesn't give him enough room to do what he does so well, although he does have more to work with in this film, compared to Eps. I and II). McGregor does an outstanding job of communicating the tragedy of Anakin's fall, through the prism of the man who knew -- and loved -- him the best. i can't say enough good things about him.Other elements: John Williams' score is top-notch, with more of the familiar themes from Eps. IV-VI cropping up. Everybody else involved in the production was either good or excellent, with the visual and audio FX taking top prizes. great cinematography, costumes, sets. it's really a visually stunning work.Bottom line: I say 8 out of 10 for this one, a thoroughly engrossing and enjoyable film (if not a classic destined to endure the ages...). The 'Saga' final rankings, best to worst (IMNSHO):1. The Empire Strikes Back (V) 2. A New Hope (IV) 3. Revenge of the Sith (III) 4. Return of the Jedi (VI) 5. Attack of the Clones (II) 6. The Phantom Menace (I)good job, George.edit: I am a parent of two boys (9, 6) who have been very excited to see this film, but I had to make the tough decision that my 6 year old cannot go, and my 9 year old can only go if we skip some of the most disturbing scenes. I would strongly advise parents of kids under 12 or 13 to see the movies first, THEN decide whether your kids can go.",8,5,9,19 May 2005
