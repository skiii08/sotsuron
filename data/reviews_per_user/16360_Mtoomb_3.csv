Iron Man 3," Iron Man 3 - Brilliant Despite Its Flaws
","Only because I've seen SO many bad reviews on here am I compelled to write an unbiased review. I'm not an Iron Man comic fan, but I'm a huge fan of the film franchise and Robert Downey Jr. So any hang ups others have with the storyline, I don't care.I can tell you that the script, the dialogue, and the Downey are brilliant. I'm giving away my old age when I say I had Lethal Weapon flashbacks through the entire movie. Iron Man 3 is truly a triumph for Shane Black, and I give him props for fighting back from the brink and coming through looking good! The plot is complicated and doesn't always seem like there is one, but that's only because Black is playing it close to the chest for the big twists toward the end.Tony Stark can't sleep in the wake of the Avengers, and he's having trouble coming to grips with his most selfless act at the end of that movie. Basically, he's a selfish guy, we love him for it... And yet here he has gone and given his life to save humanity (it was pretty much a fluke he survived, so I'm giving him props too for going all the way with it). You'd be pretty messed up too if you were a super-rich playboy one day, a introspective entrepreneur the next, and then nearly killed by sacrificing yourself to save Earth the last.This movie is all about personal demons. It says so from the start... And why wouldn't it be? Both Black and Downey probably share the same sponsor... These guys have been to hell and back... They know about demons. From the first frame Tony is fighting his demons, and since life has a funny way of knowing when you're struggling, events begin to unfold that have him questioning his very existence as Iron Man. Can he save the world and protect the woman he loves? Can he be a selfless protector and an OCD hermit crab at the same time? Can he move away from a past full of trampling over others to get to where he wants to be? I realize these are pretty big themes for a summer blockbuster, but Iron Man 3 isn't your every-day actioner. This isn't The Avengers. This is an intensely personal film that finalizes the 3-movie-arc of Tony Stark's transformation from what he was, into what he will be. For a solid hour in the middle of the movie he's not even in the suit. He's out solving a mystery, chasing leads, and chumming it up with a surrogate child/inner child in Tennessee. Throw in a maniacal terrorist, a power-hungry industrialist, and an army of T100-looking Extremis soldiers, and you've got yourself a summer movie! I would have like more exposition with Rebecca Hall's character and the background on Extremis, and I would've liked more of a fore-shadow than 'Mark 42' but all in all I have very little complaints about this film. It's well acted, it's hilarious, the Air Force One scene alone is worth price of admission, and I bit my nails the entire movie. I don't know why everyone seems to hate it, and by everyone I mean the few thousand people that troll IMDb... But I loved it.Every single choice the filmmakers had to do the same old thing, they chose something else. Just when you think clich√© is about to happen, Black spins it. It's really fun to watch. Plus like I said before, if you're a Lethal Weapon fan you'll love this flick. There's a Christmas theme, snappy one-liners, a buddy-cop-flick feel, and even an Xmas tree lot! Come on, how can I be the only one catching this?? The finale even takes place on a BOAT! (I realize that's Lethal Weapon 2, but you're getting my drift here right?) Brilliant movie. Don't believe the negative hype. It's smartly made, smartly written, and I think when all of these haters watch it again they'll realized what they missed before and change their minds. Go summer 2013 movie season!",9,1,6,4 May 2013
Captain Marvel," Better Than Wonder Woman
","THIS is how you do a female 'superhero' movie. First of all, it's not even a 'superhero' movie, it's a sci-fi action film that just so happens to take place in the Marvel MCU. More along the lines of Guardians of the Galaxy. In fact, this was funnier than GoG, Chris Pratt's schtick is getting stale.And how friggin amazing is it that actors don't have to worry about being old anymore? (lol) They can just put them in the computer and viola, digital de-aging! I knew Sam Jackson would steal the show, but I did not know that a 1998 Sam Jackson would. I grew up in the 80s/90s, I graduated in 94, this movie does for the 90s what Stranger Things did for the 80s. It makes me yearn for a simpler time when not everything was 'smart' yet.I digress. Brie was great, the story wasn't too cookie cutter, and the best Marvel special effects yet. I really liked the plot, a soldier on the wrong side of the war is a classic, and it's done well.On a personal note, this movie friggin rocked. To see my kids faces while they watched, and all the other girls in the theater, it almost brought me to tears. It has such a good message. Bravo Marvel.The Stan Lee tribute heels tears in the first 30 seconds, and sets the tone for the whole movie. Great stuff!",10,3,7,10 March 2019
The Babadook," Misunderstood Masterpiece of Psychological Terror
","Forget the silly name, The Babadook is an amazing little piece of film. It's not that people are disliking it, as I believe they are misunderstanding just how deep it is. I would bet money that most people missed the whole point of it because the director gives just tiny hints along the way.On the surface it comes across as the story of a mythical creature called Mister Babadook... A monster that somehow finds its way into the lives of the two characters. However, it's the 'somehow' that tips you off to the real story here. Don't just limit this movie to a haunted book, that's doing a disservice. Think of what the Babadook symbolizes during the film, there are a couple of very specific flashbacks and 'visions' that point to what exactly the monster might really be. I won't spoil it, but I guarantee it adds a whole new dimension to the story... And makes this slice of celluloid and tight little thriller that side steps the conventions and goes for the psychological scares. It reminded me of The Orphanage and Dark Water, with some Shining on top.The way she slowly becomes affected by the monster, and how it plays out in the end, all work perfectly due to some top notch acting by the two leads and a brilliant scriptwriter. This movie kicks but, and scared mine right off!",10,10,22,20 November 2014
