Catch Me If You Can," The Real Pretender
","For those who don't know the story behind Frank William Abagnale Jr I promise I won't disclose any information that can ruin your experience watching the movie. Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) was the greatest con in the history of the US. He decieved 12 countries and all 50 american states while running from an FBI team led by Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks). And guess what? He did this all before he was 19.Frank was probably one of the most gifted persons in American history - even though he used his gift for breaking the law - and it was only fair that he was portraied by a gifted actor. Leo DiCaprio gets into Frank's skin perfectly with, probably, the best performance in his career. Tom Hanks is the same great actor as usual and they both make a very funny and interesting duo throughout the film. The story is always interesting and keeps the viewer attached to the end. Of course, the directing is flawless by Steven Spielberg. He returns to the subjects that started his career - the broken home - and achieves one of the best films I've ever seen. A quick special mention has to be given to the author of the opening generic - sorry for not remembering his name. He achieves a masterpiece with an animation short film. An overall superb film. Don't miss it.",8,0,1,15 February 2003
Blade II," Pure nonsense
","Blade 2 is yet another Hollywood action-packed sequel that manages to both insult your intelligence and bore you to death at the same time. The good thing about Blade 2 is that it's not like other sequels made for money, it's actually not worse than its predecessor. It's just as bad. Realising that the movie doesn't quite try to depict reality in any way, it does have some insulting moments to the average human being that passed Physics class in high school. We are treated to several scenes that surely will go to the hall of fame of insulting science as we know it. As an example for the readers that haven't seen the film, in one particular shot the hero decides that the best way to deal with a horde of foes is to blow up an UV bomb. Unaware that such UV radiation would be deadly for any human being - I'm also aware that he's supposed to be half-human half-vampire but if the UV radiation doesn't affect him the same way it does the vampires then it must affect him like it does to humans! -, whoever decided this scene should be in this film also decides that UV radiation should travel in a purely fabricated way through tunnels and also that it wouldn't travel in water. Of course, one nonsense is not enough, and we're also treated to a couple of vampires spotting the light and managing to avoid being hit by the UV radiation by going underwater. Be aware that light travels at approximately three hundred thousand kilometres per second. Maybe it's the made-up material 'nitro-vacuum', whose name doesn't even make sense. Blade 2 is cinematic disaster, a film to avoid at all costs. Watch it only if you manage to shut your brain off during the whole duration of the movie.",4,5,10,11 September 2004
The Matrix Revolutions," This is Science Fiction
","The Matrix Revolutions is fabulous. No joke here, this movie is everything I hope for in a Science Fiction movie.I've read some pretty bad reviews about this movie and I can't seriously find what movie did those reviewers watch but I can't believe it was this one. The Matrix Revolutions is an amazing piece of cinematic history and closes the Matrix trilogy with the golden key. As anyone would expect this movie is Reloaded Part 2 so, if you didn't like/understand Reloaded, you won't like/understand this movie as well.The Wachowski's this time have fewer surprises in store so the story is pretty straight to the point in Revolutions. A noteworthy aspect to this movie is that all the questions that may have tormented you after seeing Reloaded are pretty well answered - there are those, of course, who will say they aren't simply because either they didn't understand, or it isn't how they expected.This movie is, for me, the definition of Science Fiction itself. Revolutionary special effects and a brilliant storyline that doesn't insult the audience's intelligence. Although I could have hoped for nothing better than this closure to the Matrix saga, I must warn those that didn't like or see either of the two first Matrix movies that they should watch it before Revolutions to properly enjoy this film.",9,2,4,5 November 2003
Spider-Man," Oh... they made a comic-book movie...
","This could have been it... it should have been the best comic-book adaptation to film ever. But it isn't. Why? Because it's a comic-book movie. I thought that when you put together such a high budget and expectations on a movie you should be obliged to, at least, do something really great. Sam Raimi didn't achieve what he should have achieved. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad movie, it just isn't likely to make you believe that Spider-Man could be real. X-Men makes us believe that, Batman (the first two, that is) makes us believe that. Spider-Man doesn't. The CG character is only average quality for nowaday's standards and the acting is pretty basic. The plot seems to take a leap sometimes with no understandable reason and they have altered the comic-books so much that it hurts. If you want to make a comic-book movie you MUST obey the comic-book's rules. They made Peter Parker a wimp. They made him Clark Kent. I am a fan of the Spider-Man comic books and I am disappointed with this movie. It could have been so much better. I hope Sam Raimi does read the books before he finished Spider-Man 2 and not just pretend he has been a fan all his life.",7,0,0,4 February 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Can it get better?
","I never thought a fantasy movie could achieve greatness after Star Wars (although Star Wars has his percentage of science-fiction, it still is a fantasy movie) but Peter Jackson seems to want me proven wrong. And he accomplished it. The Fellowship Of The Ring came pretty close to the top and The Matrix still has to pass the test of having a capable sequel, but The Two Towers can easilly be already acclaimed the best fantasy movie ever - at least until the release of Star Wars Episode III. If you are one of those die-hard book fans who can't stand when the wrong character says that favourite line of yours then you shouldn't watch this movie hoping that it is a perfect adaptation of the book. It isn't. It is based on the book, which is a great masterpiece in literature, but it can make it better and come to life. Viggo Mortensen does a great job with Aragorn and Ian McKellen is... well... Ian McKellen but the greatest of all actors in this movie is a CG character named Sm√©agol, or Gollum. This movie is worth paying the ticket just for watching Gollum come to life. Absolutely amazing work. If you think the CG characters in some popular movies like Star Wars or Spiderman looked real that is because you haven't seen Gollum yet. Gollum is the best actor in this movie and if it wasn't for being a CG creation then I would say give him the Oscar right away. Of course if the Academy Awards go on with the pathetic decisions they made last year The Two Towers will probably win nothing but technical awards. Go watch The Two Towers, go watch it again, and again. I'm sad that there isn't an 11 in IMDB's rating scale because this is the best fantasy movie ever. No doubts. It is fantastic, it is epic - and the soundtrack is brilliant -, it is beautiful. It is... precious. The wait for The Return Of The King is unbearable.",10,0,0,4 February 2003
X2: X-Men United," Xcentric
","I must confess that I was hoping for a lot better. This happens a lot to me because I watch some films with too many expectations - X2 was the case. I really loved the first movie although my favourite X-Men characters (which are Nightcrawler and Colossus) didn't take any part in it - in fact, only Nightcrawler takes active part of this movie since Colossus' role is more like a cameo. X2 isn't a bad movie, in fact it is quite good. The problem is that it isn't any better than the first one, but it isn't any worse as well. I was expecting some evolution other than a technical one and Matrix-lookalike special effects. The storyline is as good as you usually get in a comic book adaptation and the use (again) of black suits instead of the traditional Yellow-Blue X-Men suits adds a bit more reality to this movie. I liked this movie a lot although I think it could have been much better. Being a comic book fan and guessing what the story of X3 is going to be like - which is easilly guessable by any comic book fan just by watching the ending of X2 - the wait for the third installment will be unbearable.",9,0,0,17 May 2003
The Sixth Sense," The best horror movie of the last decade
","The Sixth Sense can achieve the title of best horror movie of the 90's with little trouble. Is has an amazing script, a brilliant director, and top-class performances. Haley Joel Osment does a fantastic job and presents himself as a firm promise for the future of acting. This movie will keep you interested to the end and awards should be given to those who anticipated the fabulous plot twist that the final ten minutes of this movie present us. Although this movie was released on what was probably the worst decade for horror movies ever, it will surely take his part in history as one of the best the world will lay their eyes on for many years. This is movie presents enormous maturity and interest and even those who are not fans of the genre will surely appreciate The Sixth Sense. You should take note that this movie is not frightening for its visuals though. It is frightening for its fabulous acting and the psychological fear it can induce on the viewer.",10,0,0,8 January 2003
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Horror movies as they should be
","First of all it should be noted that I am a big fan of the Nightmare On Elm Street series so I'm afraid that some readers may find these comments biased. A Nightmare On Elm Street is probably the second biggest reference in the world of modern horror movies - alongside with The Exorcist. Freddy Krueger is one the greatest horror characters ever to be created and that alone should attract you to watching this movie. Although this movie isn't really scary for The Exorcist's standards it still can give you a chill if you aren't an usual viewer of horror movies. This is the first of many sequels and I must say that it is, as usual, one of the best. It is purely original, defining an era of horror movies, and giving you a thrill that you won't find in any post-1990 horror movies. If you like horror movies - even if you don't - you will like this movie. If you find movies like Scream of I Know What You Did Last Summer frightening then you will have the fright of your life with A Nightmare On Elm Street.",7,0,0,8 January 2003
Cube," Overhyped
","Cube is usually hyped as being a cult horror movie but it clearly gets lost along the way. The problem with this movie is that it's way too long for what it offers the viewers: repetitive action, completely useless chat, characters that we just don't - and won't - care about, and extremely poor mathematics. In the end it's just another mindless low budget sci-fi movie that is commonly overhyped and definitely over rated (I am amazed how it has the same score as 28 Days Later, which is an absolutely superb movie by Danny Boyle and far superior to Cube). Cube has already spawned a sequel that is nothing but more of the same, and it seems like it will spawn a prequel which may be a ray of hope for this trilogy if the screenplay evolves in quality. Cube is not the worst movie you will ever see though, it's entertaining and it does bring curiousity to see what happens in the end, but it's also not a work of art. If you're a horror/sci-fi fan you'll enjoy this if you can look past the horrible mathematics displayed in this movie.",6,0,2,9 August 2004
