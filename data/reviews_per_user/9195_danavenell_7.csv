Iron Man 3," A lukewarm mess
","What is wrong with IM3? For a start, Iron Man is hardly in it. Shane Black, who wrote Lethal Weapon, of which/who I am no great fan, directs this one, and maybe was pressured to have more Downey Jr face-time or maybe he just wanted to do another Lethal Weapon movie. Or doesn't know how to do a super-hero movie, because this isn't really one. The film is probably a little better and smarter than Lethal Weapon, and has better action and acting (good acting all round is what saves the movie) and a movie where Stark has to survive on his wits without his armour MIGHT have been cool - but ultimately this is an Iron Man movie, I want Iron Man thanks. I want an incredible flying tech-suit, not Tony Stark with a gun. And when Iron Man is in it, Tony Stark is not in it. In the armour I mean. All the suits are remote controlled, or drones controlled by Jarvis, and that's boring. He's not in jeopardy if he's doing by remote in the back of a van somewhere, get it? And the slightly-tough-to- swallow idea that Iron Man can press a button and all his armour flies to him and wraps around him, seen in Avengers, is here taken to a newer, even less believable level. At the end he's falling from suit into suit and then that suit is chopped in half (by people with very hot hands - wait, I thought Thor's lightning barely scratched it - here the suits are shredded like paper) so he jumps into another suit that wraps around him... and it's all blurry like Transformers action sequences so you don't know what's going on. At one point it seems his leg is cut off, but apparently it wasn't, so like whatever.Some plot holes/stupid stuff/spoilers - Stark tells The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley out of Gandhi) his address on live TV, hoping he will attack him. He does with a bunch of helicopters shooting missiles and destroying Stark's home/base. This nearly kills everyone there, because Tony hasn't prepared for an attack at all. He could have had 30 Iron Men hidden around the nearby hills, underwater, whatever, and trapped/killed the attackers as they approached. He could've even called up SHIELD, seeing as this was national security, but SHIELD aren't in the movie. He could've made sure Pepper wasn't at home, but she nearly dies because he didn't think of planning any defence at all. He is supposed to be the smartest guy in the room at any time. Rarely in the movie was he shown to be very smart... Waking up in Tennessee, his suit broken, he must survive upon his wits, befriending a kid and trying to fix his suit with a car battery. Was every suit put out of action when his home was attacked? If so he's an idiot for keeping them all there. He has a place in NY, remember? No suits there? He could get one to him in five minutes.Big Spoiler! Mandarin isn't the Osama type terrorist mastermind we are led to believe, he's a silly, confused actor. What A Tweest! Ben Kinglsey makes it nearly work, but logically, would the real villainous mastermind entrust this role, integral to his taking over-the-presidency scheme to this clown? Unlikely.To enable the Stark attack on the villain's lair to find the Mandarin, suddenly Stark is like Jason Bourne (or John 'Commando' Matrix, the 80's Scwharzenegger movie, actually referenced in the film - 'I'm gonna kill you first') and the outside guards are easily defeated. Yeah, sure. But Stark is captured and chained to a bed, where he is brutally bummed by Guy Pearce. Not really. The villains, like they never do with James Bond, should shoot him in the head at this point, but of course do not.I could go on. But I'm bored. I would mention that Pepper Potts is captured, and to goad Stark, instead of say, brutally bumming her, they inject her with the hot-fingers-explode-and-maybe-regenerate-super-serum. Which while painful, as we know, ends up giving you super-powers, so brilliant idea there.The movie isn't dull. It's often funny (though some humour comes from a super-villain leaving a toilet smelly, and a very camp/gay man who has a crush on Tony ho ho not), but sometimes - often in fact - goes for funny when it would have been better to keep the action and suspense going. As I've said, it's biggest flaw is that it barely has any scenes with Iron Man, Stark inside, flying, looking cool, kicking ass, blasting people, maybe a bit drunk. And with Stark/Downey, the clumsily handled 'post-traumatic stress disorder' idea (he saw aliens in New York and nearly died... could be interesting but it goes nowhere) means he is rarely the cocky, over-confident Mr Know-It-All that charmed people in the first movie. He is rarely even dressed well!Oh and the bad guys can explode themselves and survive. At the end some are exploded, and the main baddie is hit with a bit of metal by Pepper Potts who has become a bit explode-y herself. And then I think she explodes him. It's a bit unclear as to who is dead and why they wouldn't be able to regenerate and perhaps a more imaginative way of defeating them could have been devised. It seems to come back to Shane Black, who like in Lethal Weapon, thinks all you need is an abandoned shipyard, a black guy with a gun and a white guy with a gun trading snappy one-liners and saying 'cover me!' and then everything exploding and there's your perfect ending.My review - Boo!",3,4,8,12 May 2013
Nightcrawler," Will be regarded as a classic, as will Gyllenhaal's performance.
","SPOILERS First, yup he is a textbook sociopath. It's underlined when his partner/employee says 'you just don't understand people,' but we really don't need telling. But we've seen sociopaths on screen before, so why is this one so much more compelling than most? Because it would have been such a lesser film if he was your typical evil psycho. He was like a mix of Travis Bickle and Ted Bundy (two very different characters). Plus his usually unintentionally bizarre or hilarious (verbal) responses to many situations.. I was laughing as much as finding him morbidly fascinating. I predict some will become classic movie quotes. He thought he was handling everything perfectly! Yet clearly (to us) was seriously not normal, as his boss finally saw with his completely misjudged attempt to woo her. Gyllenhaal was mesmerising so you could see why some characters saw his confidence as a positive trait - but we the audience could tell he was seriously screwed up, but in a way that was so uncliched, and ultimately much more realistic - and therefore genuinely chilling. There *are* people like this. Everywhere.Also, cinematography: one of the best things about the movie. The 'teal and orange' trend in so many movies is driving me mad! It's so distracting and annoying once you begin to notice it. But this movie had a broad range of colours, used very carefully, throughout that were just perfect. People often think great cinematography has to be 'showy' - here it just made a great movie a visual masterpiece too. Many scenes were much like paintings, by an artist that truly understands how to use colour. I wonder who wouldn't like this movie? I can only think 'idiots with no taste'. No offence, idiots with no taste, you have plenty of movies aimed at you anyway.",10,8,14,27 January 2015
The Amazing Spider-Man," A boring rushed mess.
","It's flat and boring, just copies badly bits from the first films, Uncle Ben's a jerk, Gwen Stacey works at Oscorp (because it really helps with the ending), everyone looks far too old to be at high school, the director seems completely unfamiliar with the comics, or more importantly how to shoot a good movie All the acting was horrible, except Dennis Leary. And I think those were good actors doing their best, but miscast and trying to inject life into a bad, empty script.I'll give it two points, At least they tried to make Spidey wise-cracky, and Spidey in action/just posing looked better than the Raimi movies sometimes.Can't be bothered to write a better review as they couldn't be bothered to make a decent movie. Two more of this version? I hope not.",2,10,28,17 July 2012
Avengers: Endgame," This was the one in 14 million chance?
","Seemed like there were many way Thanos could've been defeated at the end. Even more, what about a future where Nebula doesn't go on the mission where other Nebula can read her thoughts? Then there's no Thanos busting into the future and Iron Man doesn't have to die.
A huge disappointment, like a bad dream.",7,3,5,3 May 2019
Quantum of Solace," Terrible, Dull, and NOT BOND
","People say the Craig Bonds are more realistic... well to a point, as if that's a good thing anyway. But this 'realistic'Bond still has plenty of stupid scenes - they fall from a plane onto hard rocks with a parachute between them that barely opens at the last second, we see them hit the ground hard... then they are both fine. Eh? Bond needs to save the girl so he jumps his motorbike onto a boat, then another boat then uses that boat to rescue her in an unclear manner. Why not just take a nearer boat? The villain? Some slimy little Roman Polanski type? Who cares? And his plan sucks. And we don't see him die but apparently he drank the oil that Bond gave him because he was thirsty in the desert... would anyone do that? It's OIL.Bond rarely seems in danger. Just grumpy.He gets to bed a woman, but she just seems to be suddenly up for it. Usually he charms them, even if his charm is cheesy. Not this time, we just see her wake up with dull grumpy big ears.So what is good about it please? He's not a 'likable killer'. He kills people, but it's perfunctory. He's not at all charming. Cheesy jokes have been removed, but replaced with just dull, random pointless dialogue instead. There are no awesome set-piece stunts or action scenes, not one. There are some very average ones though. No gadgets at all, I mean who liked Bond's gadgets anyway, eh? Or the theme music? Get rid of that nonsense... (sarcasm btw) And the ending is just bleh. Sure, he's got some 'solace', it means little to him, it actually is a bit meaningful compared to the rest of the film. But its still a boring ending to a dull as hell movie.Oh I just remembered one redeeming feature - some of the cinematography and colours were nice. Woo, I suppose it gets the one star for that.",2,7,10,20 June 2012
Mamma Mia!," Oh Holy Tap-Dancing Moses!
","This is the worst movie ever made. It is the worst piece of art ever created by humans. That includes that album that Metallica & Lou Reed did together. It is possibly the worst thing humankind has ever done - yes that includes the holocaust. After watching this movie, about three men who are told they may have a daughter that the old 'goodtime'-mom never told them about and then sing ABBA SONGS ABOUT THAT NEWS, I was physically sick. I am now a heroin addict who blows other heroin addicts for small change because after watching this, I see life is a joke, there is no point to life, and I wish I was dead.Ten more words? OK. Bridges Of Madison County, again starring Streep, was some sick garbage also. (They made me change what I originally wrote there, use your imagination) Is that enough? Can I blow a homeless again now please?",1,3,4,26 July 2013
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Not SW, Call It Something Else - Popcorn Trash
","Warning! May Contain Spoilers!The Force Awakens was a huge con for many of us, they said it was Episode 7, with OT characters... that George Lucas wasn't involved seemed a good idea... but this was a soulless cash-grab rip- off that had somehow managed to buy the rights and stick the name Star Wars in the title and pay Harrison Ford to be in it. It's popcorn trash notable for featuring a character that will become known as the most famous Mary Sue in cinema history. The named writers were only on-board after a committee had worked up a lame feminist-pandering storyline, and they hid that pretending it was supposed to be a surprise, rather than something they were worried about. The first Star Wars film is full of great lines and snippets of dialogue, here's a few Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi: These aren't the droids you're looking for. Stormtrooper: These aren't the droids we're looking for. Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi: Use the Force, Luke. Han Solo: Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi: Mos Eisley spaceport: You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. Princess Leia Organa: Aren't you a little short for a stormtroopers? Luke Skywalker: I have a very bad feeling about this. Princess Leia Organa: Will someone get this big walking carpet out of my way? Han Solo: No reward is worth this.There are so many more. There is nothing whatsoever that comes CLOSE to any of that, maybe half a point for Solo's exasperated 'The Force doesn't work like that!' as it's the only one that is fit to lick the boots of the OT, and one of the few lines, especially from HAN SOLO FFS, that is not just a clunky reference to the OT, or to do with how awesome Disney Princess Rey is. The Tumblr-Feminists jumping around like... jumpy Tumblr-feminists about female protagonist, Do-Anything-Better-Than-You (If You Have A Penis) Rey, and how they at last have a strong independent woman in Star Wars seem to be ignoring Princess FREAKIN' Leia, and forgetting what a kick-ass character she was back in 1977 (through the two sequels too). Star Wars was never All About Luke, it was an ensemble piece where everyone regularly saved each other, regardless of gender. Leia was always in all the promotional material and a main member/equal leader of the team, shooting stormtroopers, telling Vader to get bent, killing Jabba... and now what? In The Force Farts In Its Sleep she is reduced to a tiny role - hey feminists, I thought you wanted more parts for older women? Because us True Star Wars Fans thought after thirty years after we'd last seen her, finding out Luke is her brother, she would've developed her force powers and be a mighty Jedi by now. Can you imagine a scene where That Shiny New One Who Is A Woman Under The Armor (don't go in thinking she'll be great, she's got two minutes of screen time tops) had Han & Chewie captives and in comes Leia and force throws her around the room? Instead we get not ONE action scene for Leia, and it turns out she hasn't developed as a Force user at all, just plays the same 'lets plan to blow the Death Star Up again' scene she did before. You wait Leia, next time there will be EIGHT Death Stars, then watchagonna do?? Instead while her brother develops has Force Powers, her SON develops his Force Powers, she is still fighting the Empire - I mean First Order - so it would make sense to have force powers, they wrote it so Leia never became a Jedi. Because as I said, the OT characters are just a lure, they are wasted or misused.Of course I wanted to like or love this movie, who didn't? But To be honest the only character I would watch the next movie for is Luke Skywalker, maybe they will have a good reason for why he ran away and hid from the galactic mess he's largely responsible for. Instead I'm sure there will be a Space Prince Charming for Rey to start liking, plus that Nasty Kylo will be in love with her too! Which one will she choose??? Jinkies! And there will still be fans promising 'er... they'll fix it all in the next episode!' TFA doesn't work as a reboot because the new characters are so unengaging, especially compared to the legendary OT characters they are supposed to replace. It doesn't work as the next episode because it jettisons all the character work and carelessly undoes how those characters got to where they did by the end of the REAL Star Wars.But hey, people lap it up. People lap up all kinds of fast food garbage, which is all this is.",2,80,101,9 January 2016
