Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A somewhat commercial treatment of the classic 'magic'
","This is a good movie, but some elements were seemingly put in for no other reason than to expand the fan base.  For instance, Jar Jar is annoying, but I figure is there to keep the kids' attention.Highlights: the pod races are great.  Saber duels are extremely well done. The 'droid designs are cool, and believable.  The ground combat scenes are pretty sweet.  I like the way they started to flush out the Jedi culture. This movie compares with The Matrix for CG visuals.Lowlights: Darth Maul, the big baddie, has one line; this is as little character development as I've seen.  He's such a hollow opponent that we just don't care what happens to him.  The space combat is weak compared to previous movies.  I hate movies where kids (e.g. Anakin) save the world instead of those who have committed their lives to it, and this is another movie that does that...  :-(",7,0,0,21 May 1999
X-Men," Solid film, but needed more action.
","The action sequences, particularly those involving Wolverine, could have benefitted greatly from a director and choreographer more focused on making those scenes shine.  While 'The Matrix' style action wouldn't have fit, the fights came off as flat. I'd put the plot on par with Jurassic Park.  Oh, and there _will_ be a sequel.",7,0,0,14 July 2000
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Save your money, EP1 was better
","The love story was painfully poorly acted, and the action choreography lacked any coherence or style.  This manages to be visually impressive, with some beautiful scenes. Too bad I found myself so bored with the movie that I had to stare at the backgrounds admiring the lighting.",1,0,1,17 May 2002
Dark City," A good, textured, sci-fi flick.
","I rented Dark City because people were proclaiming it to be like _The Matrix_ only better. It wasn't as engaging as _The Matrix_, but still a good, dark, sci-fi story with a great atmosphere.  It wasn't so laiden in special effects as to annoy me, and the 'tuning' effect is a little weak, but the transformation of the city is REALLY cool. Overall, a nice film, worth watching, but I'm not going to buy it.",Null,0,1,21 June 1999
