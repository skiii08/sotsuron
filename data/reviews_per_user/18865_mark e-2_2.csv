The Devil's Advocate," Interesting view of the devil
","Al Pacino as the devil? It was made for him, he's really believable and you can imagine yourself not being able to say no to him. Good acting and crisp photography add to an already edgy atmosphere. Great surprises at the end too. Check it out!",Null,0,0,20 May 1999
Contact," Stands up to repeated viewings
","I bought this film on DVD and watched it twice within 2 days, it was that good. I wasn't quite sure what to expect but I wasn't let down. The special effects are really cool and you can tell that a lot of effort has gone into making this picture. For me James Woods steals the show though.",9,0,2,20 May 1999
