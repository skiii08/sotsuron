10 Cloverfield Lane," Better as a thriller than a sci fi
","Just to clarify, I watched this movie without knowing it was a spiritual sequel to Cloverfield.Anyway, the majority of the movie isn't at all sci-fi but rather a claustrophobic, psychological thriller. And a quite good one at that. The acting and characters are well fleshed out and are believable and likable. Despite the confined space the story engages and always seems bigger then the setting. The plot twists and turns but never in a way that seems contrived and as a viewer you're always guessing and never knowing what's real and what isn't I found myself quite engaged in the plot and characters. Emmet is quite likable and given just enough back-story to be made human and worth caring about. The writing makes you really care about him and paints him out as a really nice guy which is why his death makes so much more of an impact. Howard morphs from psychopath to teddy bear right back to psychopath seamlessly and Michelle works just fine for most of the film. So approaching the end I was positively surprised and in my head starting to think it was a solid 8/10 or even a 9/10 film. That was before the rather disappointing and over-done ending that kind of spoiled it for me. I guess they felt they had to include more references to the original Cloverfield but I really think the movie suffers from it. The transition from psychological thriller to action sic-fi is about as subtle as a kick in the nuts. So suddenly our protagonist Michelle turns into Rambo and blows up an alien ship with a molotov cocktail and then goes off to join the resistance. A shame really because the first 95% of the movie is really solid and stands on its own without any references to Cloverfield. With a little more subtlety when wrapping the film up it could have been truly great.",5,2,4,14 June 2016
Split," Could have been decent
","So Split is the latest movie from M. Night Shyamalan. Not having seen any of his movies since The Village nor being that familiar with the actors I didn't really have any expectations about this movie. Anyway, Split is a classic kidnapping-thriller. Three girls are kidnapped by an unknown assailant with multiple personalities and spends the movie trying to escape. Along the way they uncover disturbing truths about their kidnapper. In a parallel story the kidnappers psychiatrist suspects something and starts investigating on her own. Hardly groundbreaking stuff, then again there are plenty of fantastic movies with unoriginal structures. I was quite drawn in by the first half of the movie. The gradual reveal of the plot works fairly well. Sure, the dialogue was fairly wooden and there was little to no background on the main characters. The flashbacks that was supposed to breathe some life into the main character didn't really add much to the story or give much nuance to the character so much as being a pretty cheap plot device to tie the cheap ending together. For all it's flaws the first two thirds of the movie worked for me. The gradual reveal of the main antagonists personalities and motivation along with some decent acting from James McAvoy makes for just enough suspense to keep the viewer hooked. Like so many other movies the end is where it all falls apart. There is a special place in hell for writers who incorporate supernatural elements where there is absolutely no need for them. This movie would probably have worked much better as a semi-realistic thriller. The foreshadowing of supernatural elements are vigorously shoved in the viewers face during the whole film but I didn't really suspect they would be so over the top. Subtlety doesn't so much get thrown out the window as shot in the chest with a shotgun. Not to mention the protagonists escape that is heavy handedly tied to the forced flashbacks that plague the film and makes the end both over the top and anti-climactic at the same time. Honorable mention goes to the cheap tie in to Unbreakable in the movies dying seconds that seems lifted from a superhero movie rather than a sort of serious thriller. A seriously bad ending destroys what could have been a decent film.",3,31,72,3 February 2017
Now You See Me," All style, no substance. All smoke and mirrors. All surface, no feeling.
","So what is there to say about this movie? What we get is a vague, overarching background plot, a contrived love-story that just kind of pops up for no apparent reason, a few predictable plot twists, a huge plot twist pulled out of thin air and some really overdone CGI magic. For a film boasting such a strong cast it falls surprisingly flat. I suppose someone has a lot of dirt on the main cast, or maybe they didn't read the script before signing on to this Titanic of a movie. First of all, there is no of urgency or excitement what so ever. The four horsemen are certainly closer to being super villains than actual human illusionists. The FBI and Interpol are no more than comic sidekicks, never ever getting close to catching the bank robbers/magicians/demigods. I get the feeling the writers want me to root for Jesse, Woody and the rest of the illusionists but they just come off as being so ridiculously overpowering and vastly superior to the police it's like rooting for a UFC fighter beating up a puppy. The would be heroes are at best people who the movie never tries to make the audience care about, at worst they are smug and utterly unlikable. There is no back story worth mentioning, all we get are some short intro sequences. The main characters meet and then the main plot just kind of fast-forwards off into action without any further explanation. The character development is so insignificant it cannot even be measured. There is no change and nothing is leaned. At the end of the film the characters are exactly the same as when we started. Yes, there are some references to a back story but that never effects the plot besides setting up a few one-liners and in a clumsily thrown together ending twist. I read quite a few reviews saying this movie thinks it is much smarter than it really is and I think that sums it up quite nicely. This movie is like a pompous street magician with a self satisfied grin, quite certain he's got the audience in awe when in reality everyone in the crowd has seen that he's got a card up his sleeve and that his fly is undone. I gave this movie 1/10, if only to balance the notoriously generous IMDb-crowd and lobbyists that for some reason beyond think this movie is worth 7.2/10. If I was drunk while watching and feeling particularly benevolent I might give it a weak 3/10.",1,2,3,27 September 2015
The Dark Knight," Great, but not that great
","It's hard not to get caught up in the hype surrounding this movie, and in all fairness it lives up to most of the high expectations I had. The acting is great, the action is great and Heath Ledgers take on the Joker certainly makes for one of the better villains in any 'hero' movie I've seen. But there is a BIG difference between great movies and GREAT movies. Let's be honest here... this movie shouldn't be on any 'greatest film of all time' top 10 list, nor does it belong there. It seems the voting on this one has been over-inflated and blown this movie up into something it's not. Sure it's yet another breath of fresh air into the batman story, and certainly a great follow up to Batman Begins (a slightly better movie in my book) but it certainly isn't the stellar masterpiece of a movie the hype claims it is.",8,0,3,2 November 2008
