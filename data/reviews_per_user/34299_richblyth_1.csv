Sucker Punch," I'm going to be sick
","I think I got to about half way through. The weedy covers of some of my favourite alt rock songs were bad enough. However, they were not a patch on the vapid, nauseating characters and tenuous storyline. I was so gobsmacked by the painfully tasteless opening scene that I had to watch it again to check that it had really happened.If you are a fifteen year old boy who loves Bayonetta, Muse videos and teenage girls in fetish wear this is the film for you. If you think mental health problems are edgy and cool and that Japanese stuff is awesome, this is the film for you.This film suffers, in the worst possible way, from style over substance. Zack has chosen to replace substance with stilted dialogue, a clichÃ© at every moment and characters with less dimensions than Pacman.The most unforgivable crime is that the film appears to take itself seriously. It lacks the tongue in cheek, B movie authenticity of films like 'Versus'. It is also devoid of any solid premise to act as an anchor for its massively over-produced action scenes.It feels like the Zackster has taken the blueprint of 'inception', written down a list of 'cool stuff' to include, sucked it dry of any meaning and shat some Kerrang over it. Pictures on a screen do not become profound by adding an Evanescence-esque soundtrack (in fact they become rubbish). I wont even get into the ideological issues I have with the film.The Z man should not be given money to make films. I actually feel less intelligent after watching this. He must be stopped.",1,10,20,26 August 2011
