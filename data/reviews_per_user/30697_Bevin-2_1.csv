Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," All in all, I was impressed, but ignore the hype.
","Okay, I'll admit it, I was camped out on the sidewalk for hours on Tuesday night for tickets.  I had quite an adventure (which I won't go into) but shuffling my way into the theater, my ticket in hand, I began to have doubts about if it was really worth it. I wanted so badly for it to be a great movie, to quell my fears, and as the Lucasfilms icon appeared on the screen I was so tense I wanted to scream.Well to make a long story short, I wasn't disappointed.  I felt my hours of cold and hunger had not been wasted.  I hadn't gone in expecting the movie to live up to it's massive expectations, no movie could possibly do that. We would all have had to have died and ascended to a higher spiritual plane halfway through the film to accomplish that.  I went in expecting a Star Wars movie, and that's what I got.  It's technically the first movie, the introduction to the universe we've all come to know and love, and as an intro, it does very well.  A visual feast, if I do say so myself, even if the marvelous cast was given very little to do.  I am greatly looking forward to the next two installments, as Ewan McGregor has surpassed my expectations as Obi-Wan Kenobi, and hoping that Liam Neeson will have a part.  Things have been set in motion now that will carry through into the Luke Trilogy and I'm very curious to see how all these puzzle pieces will fit together.",9,0,0,21 May 1999
