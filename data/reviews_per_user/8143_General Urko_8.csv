Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not As Good As The Classic Trilogy But An Entertaining Prologue To The Skywalker Saga.
","Two Jedi Knights are sent to bring a peaceful resolution to a galactic trade dispute but it is the beginning of an epic conflict which will bring together a Jedi master & a young slave boy with unusual talents named Anakin Skywalker.This film is of course the much anticipated & much maligned first chapter in the Star Wars Saga. After a 16 year wait could anything live up to the hype & anticipation of millions of fans? No. If this film had been released only a couple of years after Return Of The Jedi then maybe it would not have got as much of a negative reaction from hardcore fans. Yes the pace seems wrong for the first 20 minutes or so but after that it settles down considerably. Then again all the films in the Saga have had opening action scenes before plot & characterization has been developed so it is in keeping with the Star Wars style.This film is an entertaining first chapter & the acting is consistent from most if not all involved despite George Lucas' trademark flat dialogue. Who better than Liam Neeson to play the maverick Jedi Knight Qui Gon-Jin? Even Ewan McGregor who can sometimes be found wanting when having to forgo his native accent is good, bringing a youthful vigor to the apprentice Kenobi.As mentioned The Phantom Menace has some pretty wooden dialogue & some acting to match but this is familiar to any Star Wars afficionado. What is good about this film is that it is a seemingly small event which is the catalyst for the galactic tyranny to come. This film is concerned with unseen manipulation of events & as such the title is perfect, with prior knowledge of what is to come it is enjoyable for the audience, helped by Ian McDairmid who is superb as Senator Palpatine who may not be all that he seems.Now we come to Jar Jar Binks, a marvel of CGI technology or an embarrassing comedy character? Not quite as annoying as many claim it is the frequency of his appearances rather than his comic nature that is the problem but he doesn't ruin the film. After all the Star Wars movies are kids films, entertaining to a wider audience but aimed at a young market & there is nothing wrong with that. The Star Wars movies are born out of a love of the old Saturday morning serials such as Flash Gordon & Buck Rogers & The Phantom Menace seems to have the most in common with these entertaining tales of yesteryear. But here are special effects which no one could have dreamt of in the thirties. From breathtaking cities to fully realized alien characters the full pallette of CGI has been used well here as a tool to tell a tale in a way unimaginable even a decade or so before it was made. There are many brilliant set pieces in this film such as the Pod Race but the stand-out has to be the final lightsaber battle which will be remembered as one of the best action-scenes in any Star Wars film to date. This is what fans have wanted to see ever since the prequels were first hinted at. Full on Jedi knights in their prime. Lucas doesn't fail the audience here, although the climactic space battle is not on a par with that in Return Of The Jedi. However, another gem from George is the excellent foreshadowing of future events with many craft, costumes & characters bearing similar designs to their more familiar counterparts in the classic trilogy.
Overall The Phantom Menace is a great if slightly flawed summer blockbuster & whilst it doesn't quite capture the magic of the trilogy fans know & love it is Star Wars & sets in motion the events which will change one mans destiny & the fate of a galaxy!",Null,0,1,19 April 2002
Alien: Resurrection," The final resurrection? Lets hope so!
","Not another bad review, well yes. I was in the minority of people that enjoyed Alien 3, yes it was flawed but it tried something different & in the final scene the Alien saga was brought to a fitting conclusion. It also didn't resort to ripping off the death-by-airlock idea from the original which was stolen for the sequel. The fourth instalment again has a variation on the originals ending but this is not the greatest of its crimes. It is set for some unknown reason 200 years after Alien 3. I say unknown as neither the sets or the hardware reflect any significant advancement from the other films in the franchise. Yet again we have blokes with guns running through industrial pipe n smoke filled corridors but these individuals we neither care for or understand. They are sketchy characters at best, cliched bad guys with ricocheting bullets & other comic book tricks. This whole film is like a cartoon version of Alien aimed at the MTV generation. This is not surprising considering it was scripted by Joss Whedon. If you wade through the dross there is the hint of a good film in here. Bringing Ripley back was really the only thing they could do as an Alien film without her would be even worse (is that possible). The Ripley clone with Alien characteristic is an enticing idea but one that is wasted here. Maybe she should have been the bad guy, the Alien species absent? The scene in which she destroys here clone 'sister' was what I thought would be a turning point for the movie but alas this was not to be. Now we come to this films crowning glory the woeful, laughable alien/human hybrid. What on earth was that THING? Were the designers actually proud of creating this? What did they think an audiences reaction to it would be other than laughter? A truly terrible climax to a terrible film.",1,6,13,8 November 2001
"Monsters, Inc."," Coming Out Of The Closet
","Check that the closet is closed & hope that mummy has left your door open so you can see the landing light! Yes the monsters are back to scare you, but don't take it personally its just their job or so Pixar claim in their latest triumph Monsters Inc.Rather than aim for the teen/adult market as Shrek did with its constant reliance on knowing in jokes Monsters Inc is a classic children's tale and the spirit of such tales appeals to all. Playing on every child's fear, not only are the monsters employed to frighten children  - collecting screams as an energy source for their home of Monstropolis - but they are actually scared of kids and once a child escapes into their world the chaos begins!As with the Toy Story movies at the core of this film is a great double act, here between co-workers Sulley (John Goodman) & Mike (Billy Crystal). Other great actors bring their vocal talents to the supporting cast such as Steve Buscemi & James Coburn although this film is more a two man show than previous Pixar releases. Goodman & Crystal make great leads, Goodman the more laid back thoughtful beast with Crystal his hyperactive, excitable sidekick, a perfect marriage between actor and character. It goes without saying that the world of Monsters Inc looks breathtaking, a fully believable world with monsters of all shapes & sizes everywhere, indeed like all of Pixars movies repeated viewing is a must so rich in background detail is the film.Unlike the failure that was Final Fantasy this film not only delivers the goods visually but also story wise. Another trademark of Pixar is that the plot is the most important thing, the animation complementing & being used for the good of that. This is no more apparent than in Monsters Inc, which despite not being quite as laugh out loud funny as the Toy Story films has an unparalleled richness of character & plot. There are too many highlights, the Child Detection Agency, the cameo appearance of the Yeti - voiced by the excellent Pixar regular John Ratzenberg. But the climatic door-to-door chase scene stands out, rivalling anything that live action cinema let alone animation offers us for thrills. All in all not only an excellent animated movie, but an excellent movie full stop and a great cinematic start to 2002.",Null,0,1,30 January 2002
Resident Evil," See No Evil?
","A young woman with amnesia awakens in an empty mansion, alone she is soon joined by a SWAT team sent to investigate a mysterious occurrence in the mansions subterranean secret labs. An occurrence which will bring her face to face with not only her true identity. . . but the undead!In recent cinematic history the number of films based on computer games has increased & another such film can be added to the list with Resident Evil. Its far better than most game-to-film translations but is not exactly a classic cinematic experience. The games were heavily influenced by the work of George Romero & it is this cinematic inspiration which is beneficial to the movie version. Indeed Romero was approached to make the movie but his version was deemed too gory for a mainstream audience & hence not profitable enough. His replacement was Paul Anderson responsible for such movies as Event Horizon, Soldier & another computer game adaptation Mortal Kombat.Anyone familiar with Andersons films will know what to expect. A B movie version of James Cameron style cinema with characters to match & a techno-soundtrack. As well as action the games have a suspenseful spooky atmosphere but the film concentrates on the action elements & yes, with a techno soundtrack. It doesn't send shivers up your spine nor is it gory enough for the hardcore horror fan but is entertaining in an undemanding sort of way.Resident Evil the film is a low budget action-movie 'inspired' by Aliens & early John Carpenter with zombies instead of extraterrestrials & a SWAT team in place of futuristic marines. Also like the work of Cameron it has a strong female lead in the form of Milla Jovovich (Alice). She is good in a pretty undemanding role as is Michelle Rodriguez but most of the characters are stock action movie types & the audience doesn't care to much what happens to them.The script whilst not Oscar worthy even by action movie standards does work. The main characters amnesia adds to the run of the mill plot & gives a hook to drive the movie forward. Just what does Alice have to do with the situation? The narrative is not based on any single Resident Evil game & is all the better for it. The games are heavily plot driven so less surprises would be up on the screen if it was a faithful adaptation of the console smash. What it does do is capture the spirit of the game. The silver screen version gives us the Umbrella corporation, secret labs, empty mansions, mutant dogs & of course lots of zombies - all stock elements of the Resident Evil series. There are many other familiar locales, scenes & images to raise a knowing smile for fans particularly in the sequel prompting climax.The direction is solid if not groundbreaking & the sets are suitably dark & foreboding but Resident Evil doesn't have the superb set design found in Andersons earlier film Event Horizon. The zombies themselves look OK although they are not gory enough, a general complaint against the film. Where are the exploding zombie heads, the result of close range shotgun fire? Where are the zombie hoards feasting on McHuman Happy Meals? Also the CGI effects are pretty poor during the climactic big boss battle but this is probably due to budgetary limitations. That said it does end with a great closing shot which bodes well for the inevitable sequel, just so long as Anderson is allowed to up the anti in the blood 'n guts stakes. There is also a nod to the work of Romero to be found in the movies closing moments.Overall with Resident Evil you get what you pay for. Movies based on computer games don't exactly promise much & anyone familiar with the work of Paul Anderson will not be surprised by this film. A modern B movie with all that entails. Its fairly enjoyable rubbish, perfect for a wet-afternoon on video rather than a must see cinematic experience.",Null,0,0,8 July 2002
Men in Black II," Same Planet. New Scum. Same Film?
","Evil alien Serleena has arrived on Earth seeking the light of Zartha. Only one agent can stop her, K. But he has been neuralised so it is up to his former partner J to get him back & together they can save the world!In 1997 Men In Black blasted onto cinema screens from out of nowhere. It was a great summer movie reminiscent of Ghostbusters but bringing its own fresh, fun feel. The pairing of Tommy Lee Jones & Will Smith was inspired & they are together again in MIB II.As the saying goes, if it ain't broke don't fix it. That seems to have been foremost in the minds of all involved with this ok if decidedly average sequel. This movie will have an all too familiar feel to fans of the original. Yes a sequel should retain all the good things that made the original a hit but must also add some new ideas of its own. On this front MIB II is lacking. The plot is almost identical to the first film - evil alien in human form arrives on Earth seeking mysterious artifact & two MIB agents must not only stop the alien but find out what exactly the artifact is, all within a tight time limit of course!Much of this film feels like it was written after market research. What did fans like about the first film? Well lets just put all that in this one! Characters such as Frank the pugdog, the worm guys & Jeebs all make a return here to varying degrees of success. Frank is good but the other old characters just seem like that, lets have some new ones! Once J & K are reunited the film gets better, they are as good as ever & you can forgive the lazy plot whenever they are on screen. The banter between the two is as good as before with a slightly different dynamic to start with. The rest of the cast are nothing more than ok, Lara Flynn Boyle pretty much miscast as a not very threatening or nasty alien.Apart from Tommy Lee & Will this film is saved by a couple of good little action set pieces & also one or two really funny gags such as one locker joke at Grand Central Station. But a film that is supposed to be a comedy should have much more than one or two comedic highlights! FX were also a highlight of the original MIB & its a bit of a mixed bag. The CGI looks a bit rushed but Rick Bakers imaginative & skilled work is again first rate.In conclusion this is ok. . . for a sequel. There have been many good ones like Empire Strikes Back, or sequels which have taken the original concept & advanced it, adding a new dimension such as Aliens or T2. MIB II,  whilst not a terrible film is far from brilliant. It is the rehashed plot which lets it down, especially considering the 5 year gap between the movies. Fans will enjoy it for some funny scenes & the return of the Will Smith/Tommy Lee Jones double act but will leave the cinema slightly underwhelmed.",Null,0,0,20 August 2002
Black Hawk Down," Great Scott!
","After the serial killer panto shambles that was Hannibal Ridley Scott returns to form with Black Hawk Down, a visually spectacular if morally redundant 'account' of a botched mission into war torn Somalia. There is a small attempt to put the mission into some kind of political context with an extended prologue but this is really just an old-fashioned action war movie & should be treated as such. Indeed for all Ridleys protestations that he has made an anti-war film this is a movie about big guns, explosions & 'never leave a man behind!' Not so much a series of set-pieces more one elongated action scene which doesn't quit. Despite its avoidance of politics what this film does convey is the sheer intensity & relentlessness of battle much like the opening of Saving Private Ryan. Unlike Spielbergs movie however we don't really care for the individuals under fire here & this is the films major flaw. But this film was never going to be about character development. Scott brings all his talents as a visual director to the conflict the soldiers find themselves in here with helicopters crashing, bullets flying & buildings exploding all around you. Unfortunately the score is strictly  by the numbers.
As for the acting? Well we have passable performances from the majority with only the two Ewans standing out, Bremner for the right reasons & McGregor for his awful performance. The rest of the cast suffer amongst all the action & you really can't tell who is who. Overall this film is a bit of a guilty pleasure, turning a very recent & dubious military manouevre into an action movie. Then again its a bit naive to expect Hollywood blockbusters to explore the political background to any conflict.",Null,0,0,13 February 2002
The Mummy Returns," Stop returning already!
","This film began okay. I enjoyed the original & was looking forward to this & the opening scenes with the Scorpion King didn't disappoint. But then. Oh Boy! This has to be a prime example of all that is wrong with the Hollywood summer blockbuster. Yes you must suspend disbelief & go with the flow but this film has nothing of merit. The acting is awful with wooden performances all-round amidst very poor (not so) special effects, in particular the laughable Scorpion King at the end. Most of the effects would not look out of place on your standard games console & look rushed & cheap. I wouldn't be surprised if they were quickly done to get the film out. Its a movie made by special effects geeks for special effects geeks. The original was a pretty good adventure film but this is a real Indiana Jones wannabe without the likable characters,wit,style or coherent plot just a series of set-pieces cut together. As early scenes with the Scorpion King were good I have some hope for his solo movie but to those that haven't seen this stick with the original.",1,3,6,7 November 2001
The Sixth Sense," Great cast. Great Direction. Shame about the plot. *SPOILERS*
",This film has a first rate cast giving first rate performances. The cinematography & style of directing is also first rate. Unfortunately the same can't be said of the script. The twist is very obvious & the film does not have anything else to say really in terms of plot. Also what I found annoying was the way the script tried to compensate for the holes in the twist. How could a man not know he is dead? Why can't he see other dead people? Well lets neatly answer that one for you!  'They don't see each other. They only see what they want to see. They don't know they're dead.' Despite this it is worth seeing. As already mentioned the cast are all excellent & although this is his first major feature Shyamalan has already established a distinct directorial style. His next film Unbreakable is a far better movie which doesn't just rely on a gimmicky twist ending .Although it does come with a twist in the tail its plot has much more to offer.,6,1,2,8 November 2001
