First Man," Excellent remake of a true story!
","***********CONTAIN HEAVEY SPOILERS!!! READ ON YOUR OWN RISK!!!!***********First of all, I don't write reviews a lot. In fact, it's very rare it comes from me. Usually I write them if I am wondering about something or if I get really impressed about the movie. In this case, it's the latter one. From the moment this came on the cinema I wanted to watch it. I didn't believe it would be so good, but I had some hopes for it. I got really impressed after watching the movie. Damien Chazelle (director) did a excellent work with the timing of the music, the camera angles, the shadowing, etc. I.e. points that really matters. I think they did a great job not only on the developement of the NASA technology, but it also showed us the situation of the people and how they reacted to this project. I am glad that they told the story mostly how it really was, though I agree things got a bit dramatic and exaggerated. But then again this is a movie, you have to twist it somehow from the reality. Usually Ryan Gosling (Neil Armstrong - actor) don't impress me very often. He is an alright actor, but here he did a great job. In my view he carried the movie. He did, in fact, a great job. His acting was superb and he did really a good job. I have talked to my friends about how exaggerated they made it with the loss of his daughter. A friend meant that he got the impression that he went to the moon because he lost his daughter. However, I got another impression. In my view, the loss of his daughter was quite heavy. We saw that he didn't talk about Karen (his daughter)'s death to anyone. In other words, he kept the sorrow of his loss all to himself. This affected him very much. To me, his dream about going to the moon was always there. He loved being an astronaut, but after the loss of his daughter this disturbed him both on job and funerals. This is something he had on his mind for a long. What I really liked is how they symbolized that he accepted her death and let her go once he threw away her bracelet. At that point he accepted the fact that his daughter is gone and wanted to start a new life. It may have been a bit exaggerated, with that we saw her in his eyes a lot, but I feel like this was necessary to make us understand how heavy the loss of his daughter was for him. There were one thing I didn't like in the movie. Personally, I believe it should have ended with once he threw away the bracelet. This would symbolize that he accepted her death and let it go from his mind. This would also symbolize that he wanted to start a new start with his family. Overall, I found this movie very good. It was good in many ways. 7/9 is a fair rating from (which would be 5/6). I would recommend people to watch it! It may be one of the best movies of 2018, if not the best.",7,0,1,15 October 2018
The Big Lebowski," Overrated movie that doesn't deserve to be in the top list!
",The jokes were really bad. I don't really get what's so good about this. Overrated and not got the praise it doesn't deserve. ^^,2,0,2,13 April 2020
Bohemian Rhapsody," Amazing way to bring the legend back!
","For a person that doesn't listen to a lot English music Queen's name was distant for me, though I had heard the name. By watching this movie I realized how big this band was in their prime time. Freddie Mercury (Rami Malek) really carried this movie. His acting was just amazing. He did a superb job in this movie.What I really missed in this movie was the less screen time for the other movies. Since this was a biography about the band Queen and not Freddie, the other members should also had more screen time. However, since Freddie was the artist in the band I think he deserved a lot concern. Nevertheless, I also think the other members should have got more screen time. For instance, they should have shown shortly what happened with the other members while Freddie was a solo artist.Overall, a great acting by Rami. So a big applause to him and what a great movie. If you love music from the 80s and Queen, this is a movie for you! Totally recommend. :D",8,2,2,20 November 2018
Justice League," Great super effect, but it could have a better plot development.
","I have never watched the other Superman movies and I only watched it to fulfill a family members request. I aren't so in super hero movies, but this was actually not so bad, but not the best either. I think it had good with super effects. The action were actually good, but I would like more development between the characters. The plot could have been made better. I think they focused more on the action part than the plot part. I think it would have been better if we could see more interaction between the different superheros due to the fact that most of them had never meet each other before. I also think the superman entrance were not that good. Would have been a lot more epic if he had came to save Batman or someone else in the last moment. In addition, the enemy had a bigger boost when he collected the three stones together. And it weren't that good plot development when they had access to his power source so easy. I really didn't expect a lot from this movie, so actually I am not that surprised. But overall it was good movie to watch in the cinema and it was entertaining. A fair rating is 5/9 (I only rate movies up to 9, though IMDb have rating system up to 10).",2,9,19,16 November 2017
