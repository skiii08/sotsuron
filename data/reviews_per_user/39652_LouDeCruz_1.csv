Marie Antoinette," Converse boots?
","Loved it... but as a wacky artists impression, NOT a real biopic. I thought it was about crazy consumerism in a doomed world - dancing while Rome burns - and the modern-day soundtrack was a give-away that this was the intent. Only the fashions have changed...Sweet spoilt little Marie-A in her pink bedroom with her cute doggy - something of the JonBenet-image about her? - then she's transformed to another pointless existence, teen queen of Versailles, party animal on the loose, no brain cells required. (Though she had them all along...)-Kept feeling there was something missing - oh yeah, where are their mobiles? There was a shot of heaps of shoes a la Imelda Marcos - did anyone notice a pair of black Converses in amongst them? Or was it just the soundtrack getting in my eyes? Viva Marianne Faithful! (she should have been in it longer...)",7,0,1,7 December 2006
