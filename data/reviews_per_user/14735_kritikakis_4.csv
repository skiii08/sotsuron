First Man," Consider the perspective
","I want to meet the guy who invented the 'camera shake' thing. The human head, in reality, is able to (and does) maintain stability, otherwise we would be seeing a shaken movie every time we walked. Photographers/Videographers sometimes use loupes in order to use their head as a strong stabilization point, because the head maintains stability remarkably better than the rest of the body.
Now, on the content: to clear the air, I say that I'm European. The pursuit to land on the moon was, in reality, not a random adventure, but a strictly political move by the US government, in its space competition with the USSR. It was NOT an international discovery adventure - it was a purely political move by only one country. (The following phrase is not a spoiler, because everyone knows this already:) Thus, to purposefully omit the flag from the moon site, for 'politically correct reasons', classifies this omission as pure propaganda, by definition!
This would not be the case if the moon landing happened today as an international project - however, when it happened, it was not. It was a 100% political move by only 1 country.
The slow and washed out scenario makes things even worse. We all know that politically correct art is boring and only noises and special effects save it from being a sleeping pill. Therefore, I cannot recommend this film to anyone, especially to adults.",3,61,105,16 October 2018
Fight Club," Over-rated
","Pros: i) A few really smart lines here and there ii) Excellent actingCons: i) The only way the guy found to 'rebel', was through boxing and sex. Nothing good, just release.ii) The movie doesn't give you a good break once in a while - it's dark throughout, and portrays men as either inherently violent leaders, or inherently violent soldiers. The protagonist is a very limited personality, only one in a hundred thousand could identify even by half. An over-inflated ego that finds his alter ego as a 'charming, highly sexual gangster'. Big ... deal.Conclusion: if you hate your corporate office and your IKEA furniture, you can move to Alabama or North Dakota, no need to become a gangster.",5,0,4,4 May 2013
Into the Wild," This is not about 'social criticism' at all
","I do not think this movie is about criticizing society or the parents etc. It is 'based' on a true story, not the story itself.I see Christopher afraid/unsatisfied, because he wants to do something that is entirely his own, without the help of others or the continuous help of the towering figure of the genius father. A desire to be as independent as possible, not from civilization (he uses a gun to hunt), but from the people he knows. He wants to create his own society and his own self, and challenge both.Yes, he is naive, but that's not a reason to criticize him. In my life I have seen most entrepreneurs and investors analyze all the risks before jumping into a new business/investment, and the vast majority of them fail, even in a protected environment, and they put others into risk as well. That is the nature of exploration in areas you have not lived before. Chris is not doing anything different than any daredevil, he just does it by himself, doesn't put others into immediate danger.Chris wants to put things 'under his belt', experiences that are his own, without the protective measures that others have already put in place. He knows this is not his natural terrain, yet he throws himself into it, with a childish enthusiasm. You know, sometimes it works. When the American rebels wanted to be independent from England, the vast majority of Europeans believed that they won't make it by themselves, without the protection and know-how of the king and Europe.This is a very tender, beautiful and emotional story, and there's something about the acting, the cinematography, the plot, that kept me watching myself with admiration, even if I'm generally not interested about such stories or about Alaska. An excellent movie.",9,0,2,22 April 2013
The Godfather," One of the top movies
","A bit over-glorified as far as 'crime families' are concerned, nevertheless, acting is top, cinematography is top, and it does have characteristics that made it part of modern Western culture. This movie has no flaws, even as far as its 'message' is concerned.I do believe though that it's incomplete without 'part II' (part III was an appendix). I'm a Mediterranean and I can understand 'why this and why that', and an American can understand the 'why's' by watching Part II, then watch Part I again. There are many shades of gray in the personalities of immigrants, especially the most ambitious of them. In the eyes of an American, Part I is a crime movie, but with Part II it also becomes a cultural movie, and the main focus switches from 'crime' to something more cultural - integration and part of American history, through the story of an Italian family. Highly recommended to people who would read a book again, and would see a movie again.",10,0,1,4 May 2013
