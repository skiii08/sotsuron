First Man," Wasted great cast and subject
","Out of focus, jiggling camerawork to the point of making me motion sick. It's not edgy, it's just annoying. The movie drags with a dark amateur documentary tone until it drops over the line to simply boring. Loved the cast. What a waste.",3,2,4,5 November 2018
