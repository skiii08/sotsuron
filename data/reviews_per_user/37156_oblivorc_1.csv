The Avengers," Flawless and extremely entertaining!
","Flawless is a heavy word for a movie these days, and coming from a pure comic/super hero fan it adds even more weight to it. But yes, this movie exceeded all my expectations by far, didn't have a single mistake or awkward moment, and i have already watched it 2 times and i am planning for a 3rd soon! From the dialog to the cast choices to the fight scenes it was a celebration of Marvel comic books that only a guy like Whedon could achieve! But what about people that don't read comic books or just don't like super heroes that much? Well, for them, The Avengers will be one of the best blockbuster movies this year and they will leave the cinema in pure exhilaration!!! Go watch this movie NOW if you haven't already for some strange reason!",10,3,8,13 May 2012
