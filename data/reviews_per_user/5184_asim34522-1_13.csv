The Blair Witch Project," what the FU*K was this?
","I had heard that this movie was a highly scary, very suspenseful and intense movie. Instead I get FU*KING NOTHING!!!!! No WAY should this film have been made. All it is is two lowlife idiots and an obsessed bitch who go into the forest to look for a 'Blaire Witch' What happens? They get lost in the forest, one of the stupid moronic dimwits decided to throw the map (the only thing that even remotely gives them a chance of getting out) in the creek. After that they decide to head south but they keep ending up back in the same place. The only thing is that this film has a slight suspenseful atmosphere but apart form that...nothing. I saw just about under half of the movie and i couldn't go on, it was so boring. What else I don't understand is that there are two guys and a girl in the forest. Obviously they're going to stressed. No sex? I mean come on, they had the best stress reliever right at their fingertips and nothing? Not even a kiss for fuc*s sake!No Horror, no sex...nothing. If you like watching horror movies then don't even glance at the movie. It was an insult for this to be considered a horror. 2/10",2,13,24,3 May 2009
The Ring," What the hell was this?!
","I saw the movie Ringu back in 2006 which is the Japanese version of the Ring and it was a hell lot better than this crap! I've seen the proper Ring 2 and that was actually good as well. So why isn't this. I had to watch it in school because we're doing a Media project and this was absolute shi* It's not scary, it's not that intense and all me mates in class hated it. And who can blame them! I actually thought it would be good but it wasn't. The only bit that entertained me from killing myself was when Samara (what a shi* name) comes out the TV and kills the man. Apart from that it was rubbish. The stupid woman (Noami Watts) keeps on making copies of the film and then watches them! She even makes a copy so that her son watches it. Doesn't the fuc*ing phrase 'You will die in seven days' scare her! Overall this was shi* 2/10",2,0,1,7 December 2008
Fight Club," very violent movie (absolutley not for the faint-hearted)
","First of all this movie is...well it's fu*king EXCELLENT! This movie is so good and the twist at the end and the plot twist is excellent. There is strong sex in this movie but this movie is not for the faint-hearted because of the very strong blood violence because it is so graphically bloody. I loved this movie, it was recommended by a friend and I have to say, Brad Pitt and Edward Norton SHOULD make more movies like this. Brad Pitt plays a bad boy soap salesman and Edward Norton plays a bored office worker with insomnia. The plot twist was good but the twist at the end was absolutely shocking. I loved this movie.I give this movie a good 10/10",10,1,3,13 August 2008
Spider-Man 3," very good
","for starters this movie is much funnier than the first two, second it has strong fantasy violence which is the best part. I loved the battles in it and the best one was Spider-Man vs. Venom, good God did spidey take a beating from Venom. I mean in the first one he got a beating from Green Goblin but my God, Venom beat the crap out of him. The one flaw in the movie was that Venom was introduced at the end and Sand-man was a bad guy trying to be good. What's the point of that? I loved this movie but the game was absolutely rubbish-the storyline only lasted for half of the game. Watch the movie, don't play the game in my opinion. 9/10 is my rating for this movie",10,2,3,23 March 2008
Cloverfield," This disappointed me
","Since I took a GCSE Media course, we get to watch loads of films. Unfortunately we had to watch this. Rubbish ending, hardly get to see the monster until somewhere at the end where it eats that man up then spits him out. Also the camera was annoying. There were SOME decent parts in but overall...it was rubbish. I expected it to be good but after 45 mins of watching it...I knew it was a failure. Most of the people in my class thought it was rubbish and so did I. The girls were fit in the film...we agreed to that but overall...not as good as expected. I was fairly disappointed at the ending. It was rubbish. Overall I personally think this film deserves a 3/10.",3,2,2,7 July 2009
Quantum of Solace," Good Bond film
","I'm not a fan of Bond and the only MAIN reason I watched this film was because I'm reviewing this movie for my English GCSE coursework and the trailer looked alright. This film delivered for than I expected. Quantum of Solace is a high-octane action film and is very good. I haven't seen Casino Royale and I don't intend to (as I pointed out - I'm not a fan of Bond). I would've given it a 10/10 but in my opinion I think it needed more sex in the movie. As it is a James Bond film I would've thought it would have had a lot more sex in than just one scene and all you see in that is him and Fields naked in bed, him kissing her back then her neck and they move into bed and that's the end of the scene. Overall it is a good film - I recommend it to any Bond fan (which I am not for the third time) but it needs more sex. (The ladies are fit though) 9/10",9,5,13,31 October 2008
The Dark Knight," much much better than the first one
","I thought the first one was good but compared to The Dark Knight, Batman Begins is shi*. This movie was excellent, Batman was great and Joker proved a physcotic villain for Gotham City. Scarecrow was only in it for fifteen minuets so I didn't really see the point of putting him in the movie and Harvey Dent played Gotham's White Knight great but I think he became Two-Face a bit late in the movie in my opinion. I thought Joker was THE best villain ever, his jokes mainly consist on hurting/killing people and blowing up buildings. There is some humour with Joker in the movie. Two-Face appeared quite late in the movie but still I was shocked at the way he looked, in the old movies he was just a different colour but in The Dark Knight he was burned flesh and you can see his jaw and bones. Excellent movie, 10/10 for the movie, 10/10 for Joker, 8/10 for Two-Face but Scarecrow isn't included. 10/10",10,6,14,29 July 2008
Saw," alright for a gore movie
","When I first was about to watch this movie I was really thrilled but at the end I wasn't really... 'satisfied' if you know what I mean. Sure come on it's a good film with a twist at the end (my friend James told me the twists for the first, second and third before I actually watched them) but there really was no real gore in. There was only the intestines being torn out and where he saws his leg but that was it. I would NOT give this movie an 18 certificate, most probably a 15. Alright movie 6/10 is my rating; could have more gore. At more disgusting traps like one of them should a machine that will shove a machete up the guys penis and he should have to tear open his penis to get something like a key and stop the machine.",6,2,3,25 March 2008
The Descent," Pretty good
",This is a pretty good movie. At first I was bored and wanted to watch something else because I thought that ALL this movie that this movie is about is some girls that trapped in a cave. But then that boredom feeling went away. This is a good horror. Lots of bloody violence. The one flaw in the movie is the ending. It leaves you with a question - So do they all die or does she get away? The Crawlers (thats the monsters in the cave) aren't really that scary but overall: it's a pretty good movie. I don't know how this movie got an 18 certificate rating - I've seen loads of other horrors and they're a thousand times more horrific than this one. If movies were judged by my standard - this would have gotten a 15 certificate or a 12 certificate if some of the scenes had been deleted. 8/10.,8,0,1,29 August 2009
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," I thought it really good
","I'm not a fan of Transformers, I haven't even seen the animated cartoons OR the 1st Transformers movie which came out in 2007. I saw the trailer for this movie and it pretty good and considering that many people said that the 1st one was absolutely excellent, I went and saw this one. I haven't seen the 1st Transformers movie but this was really good. Great effects, intense fighting scenes and Megan Fox. Megan Fox is well fit, she's probably one of the most sexiest actresses I've ever seen. The one bad this about the film is that the plot is unclear. Apart from that, well done Michael Bay for making this good piece of work. If there is a 3rd Transformers movie coming into cinemas and I sure hope there is, I'm going definitely going to watch it. Many people who have seen the 1st Transformers say that this is not as good but I haven't seen the n1st one and yet I think this is really good.8/10",8,10,23,16 July 2009
Hancock," hilarious
","I saw this movie and I have to say-Will Smith has done it again! Almost everyone Will Smith movie is funny and this is no different. This is a hilarious movie and for all Will Smith fans GO WATCH THIS MOVIE. I loved it, intense violence and a little surprise at the end. This is a funny movie, I loved the bit when Hancock is in prison and he sticks a man's head up another man's as*. Proper funny and the suspense between Hancock and the lady who is another one of his kind is great. This movie deserves a good 10/10 for comedy and 10/10 for intense violence. The great thing about this movie is it's about what a modern day superhero would be like e.g. crashing into things and causing chaos. 10/10",10,0,2,13 July 2008
Iron Man," great movie
","I can't start to tell you how happy I am to see a very good movie like this. After I had seen that shi* movie Golden Compass I had lost faith in the cinema now Iron Man has restored it. Compelling action and a great plot. The Iron Monger plays a great bad guy in the movie. Not only does it have action but in various scenes I laughed, this movie is actually quite funny at times! I really hope they make an Iron Man 2 because this movie is a great thing to watch. Go to cinema and watch Iron Man, believe me you will NOT be disappointed. 10/10 is my rating for this superb movie.I LOVED IT",10,1,4,3 May 2008
Coach Carter," inspiring story
","I was expecting nothing more than a basketball movie and at first was only going to watch this because there was nothing to do. At the end of the movie I was almost going to cry. I loved the movie so much. It wasn't just about basketball, about the story of the greatest basketball coach that ever lived. I loved the move, it was inspiring sad movie with some violence. I think there were about 80 people in the theatre and about 75 ended up crying at the end of the movie. It was detailed and shows how far a coach would go in order to put his team on the path of discipline, honour and commitment. My rating for this movie is an absolute 10/10. Watch this movie-I loved it",10,6,6,29 March 2008
