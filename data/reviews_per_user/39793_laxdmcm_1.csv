Requiem for a Dream," Incredible
","Requiem for a Dream is not a merely a film but a jagged, unrelenting decent into the desperate world of addiction. Shrouded by denial and a longing for fulfillment, the characters in this story feed their vices and insecurities until they are consumed by them. Aronofsky fuses his creative genius (i.e. 'Hip-hop montages') with Selbey's macabre and emotionally ravaging writing to produce a work of art that brands itself to the minds of its viewers. Augmented with a stunning soundtrack this is the complete package. Inducing empathy and sympathy for people you would usually scorn, this is a shining example of the modern anti-hero. Though at times the imagery is gruesome, this only amplifies the pervasive motif of desperation. In my opinion, it should be required viewing for all high school drug prevention programs.",10,4,7,26 October 2006
