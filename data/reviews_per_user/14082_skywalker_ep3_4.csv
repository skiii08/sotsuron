Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," One Of My Favorite Film.
","Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace is a non stop spirit of fun and adventure. To be honest, i didn't watch the original trilogy until my father took me to see The Phantom Menace. First though, there were so many peoples dressing oddly but i assume it's from the characters in the movie that me and my dad is about to watch. When the lights go out, 20th fox logo fades out...and Along Time Ago In The Galaxy Far Far Away fades in.After about 2 hours, only one words come out from my mouth... WOW!This movie is totally awesome. Great story and many likable characters such as the wise Jedi Master, Qui-Gon Jinn and his protégé, young Obi-Wan Kenobi. This movie is fill with glorious and beautiful visual effects with some of the best action scene i've seen in years. The only complain, Why are u guys talking about?! Jar-Jar is a bit annoying at a time...but i really Like HIM very much! I do! He made me laugh all the time!The Phantom Menace made me want to watch the original trilogy, which was acclaimed to be one of the best trilogy ever made. Wow, the original trilogy is MUCH MUCH better but i still think the prequels are my favorite of all. In my opinion, i think i was born in the prequel-era and the first time i watched these films, i adore these amazing films so much.Attack Of The Clones is better that The Phantom Menace and i hope that Episode 3 will be the best of the bunch.",9,4,8,24 June 2004
Spider-Man 3," Quick review of Spider-Man 3
","Well, your friendly neighbourhood superhero is back! Its a different time now for Peter Parker as Spider-Man now becoming an icon,hero and idol for the people of New York. Consequently, it makes Parker become egoistic and arrogant and thus lead to many conflicts that he need to overcome as a human and a hero.The good aspects about this film are : 1-The action sequences are stylish, brilliantly done and intense as hell. You need to see to believe it! The used of CGI here deserve an applause.2- For a superhero flick, it balance its heart-pumping action scenes and well written drama with flair.3- The creation of Sandman and Venom are very memorable and astounding.4- J. Jonah Jameson and the Maître d' (brilliantly played by Bruce Campbell) really steal every scenes their in! Pure classic comedy moment.5- The ending. A bit cliché but still sum up the trilogy quite nicely. It also provide hints that the future of this franchise is still bright.The negative aspects of this flick: 1- The pacing. It felt rush ( not as smooth as Spider-Man 2) and there is little character development, especially from the villains. I felt for Dr.Ock from spider-man 2 far more than Sandman and Venom combine. The beautiful Gwen Stacy doesn't contribute much to the film. A waste of time for her actually. They should save this girl for the next film to produce more tension for Parker and Mary Jane.2-Lots of crying and disco dancing. The scene in the club, where Parker (his dark side) expose his talent in dancing ( Fez from That 70's Show comes to my mind immediately when i watched this scene)is overlong. They should just cut it a bit and add more character development.3-The climax. It so predictable and the dialogues from the female reporter are cringe-inducing . ' Oh, the brutality.' Enough said.Overall, its still an enjoyable movie. I enjoyed it better than Spider-Man 1 but I think it cannot top the brilliant of Spider-Man 2. I hope if there is a Spider-Man 4, there should stick to one villain in that movie. It really makes all the different.",8,272,445,4 May 2007
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," My quick take on Attack Of The Clones.
","Believe it or not, my love for Star Wars began when the first time I watched the over-hyped first prequel of this beloved saga, The Phantom Menace. 10 years has passed since the event of The Phantom Menace, 3 years has passed since the premier of The Phantom Menace. Was it worth the wait for Episode 2? In my opinion, hell yeah!I watched Attack Of The Clones when i was 13 years old. Despite it flaws,noticeably in terms of the duologue's and acting, its still managed to capture the spirit of fun and excitement from the earlier trilogy. The story is good enough, the visual effects are glorious to the eyes while the musics are soothing to the ears. Overall, its not a perfect film, (well there's nothing perfect!) but its definitely a worthy addition to the saga. (^-^)",9,1,2,16 December 2005
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," - Rank in no.3 in my list for favourite HP movie --
","mini review! I've just got back from watching the movie, and IMO it was a great Harry Potter film. It ranks in third place behind POA and GOF IMO.As you all know,It continues it trend to become a much more darker film than GOF and much more serious! Harry rarely cracked up a smile, but hey! It was needed in this film to match the dark story and the overall tone that this series is taking.Pros: 1- The dark tone is handled well in this movie, kudos to Yates and his crew of wizards.2- Sirius Black has more screen time here, and his presence is one of the best parts in this movie. His relationship with Harry is done very well and the chemistry between them is great.3- Its good to see Lupin and Mad-Eye Moody return! Fighting the Death Eaters and stuff, but sadly there's little of them in here. Although its necessarily but I really want to see them more! One can hope! 4- The whole rebellion and the formation of Dumbledore Army is cool to watch. It builds up nicely. Wicked stuff.5- Dolores Umbridge. I hated her but Imelda Staunton plays her very well! Watching her performance makes me really want to cast Stupefly at her. She's that good of being evil and corrupt.6.Fred and George. Funny duo.7- Snapes flashback. Harry's dad bullying Snape. No wonder Snape really hate Harry Potter! Cool stuff! 8. The climatic battle between Dumbledore and Voldemort. Mesemrizing to watch. Loud and exhilariting.9. Well, it has a proper ending this time around. An ending that left me wanting to watch HBP. So this movie is basically a set up the other two movies to come.Cons: 1- The music. It doesn't have many impact and some of them are forgettable. Whenever I think of any HP movies, POA for instance, I can easily recognize many of its memorable themes. Even when John Williams step out and Patrick Doyle step in for GOF, his musical score nearly matches the same level of William's in POA. Nicholas Hooper score is mediocre at best. It hurts the film magical moments.2- Although I like the ending, but it felt rushed when getting there. They should stretch it out a bit so that it will have a longer satisfaction.Well for the moment, that's all the negative aspects that I can think of. Again, its a great HP movie but I'm little less satisfied when leaving the theater. Maybe when HBP and DH comes out, it will make me appreciate OOTP much more. Only time will tell! *** out ****",8,0,1,11 July 2007
