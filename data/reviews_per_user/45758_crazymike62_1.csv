Saturday Night Fever," An American Classic
","Ahh Saturday Night Fever.. Polyester 3 piece Disco Suits.. Hittin the Oddysey Nightclub on a Saturday Night.. Carousing the streets of Brooklyn.. Saturday Night Fever tells the story of Tony Manero- a slick, good looking guy from Brooklyn who has a gift for dancing.. By day he works for small pay at a local hardware store.. He lives at home with his less than supportive, hair slapping father, and a mother who prays that her other son, the priest and their savior will call home... Tony pals around with a small group of buddies- Joey C, the hot headed Double J, and the eternally conflicted Bobby, and together they hit the local Oddysey nightclub every Saturday night where Tony rules the dancefloor.. He encounters a dancer named Stephanie one night and is instantly taken by her, moved to wanting to meet and partner with her in an upcoming dance contest.. Along the way,a budding friendship/romance ensues between the two as Tony learns more about himself and life. At first glance, Saturday Night Fever is about the Disco scene, and the great soundtrack featuring Bee Gees Music with songs like How Deep is Your Love, More than a Woman, Night Fever, and Stayin Alive.. But the film is much more than that.. There's several characters that bring provocative subplots to the story.. There's Annette- so enamored with Tony she'll do anything to 'make it' with him.. There's Bobby C- the weak minded kid who the fellows let hang around for the use of his car, and who is obsessed with what he should do about the pregnancy of his girlfriend Pauline.. There's Tony's brother- Father Frank Jr.. also conflicted about remaining in the priesthood.. And then there's the budding relationship between Tony and Stephanie, as they prepare for the dance contest.. But above it all, and at the heart of the story is our hero- Tony, played convincingly by an underrated John Travolta.. We immediately assume that Travolta is just playing himself in this role, but isn't that the job of a good actor- to portray a character so convincingly that we believe that's the actual person.. Travolta's Manero commands the screen as he does on the dance floor.. Several scenes stand out as some of my favorites.. The line dance in the night club- where it seems the whole cast takes part in it.. The dance contest, where Stephanie and Tony kiss for the only time through the magic of dance.. And the camaraderie of Tony and his pals..Movie Mike gives Saturday Night Fever a rating of Very Satisfied.. Thanks and have a great day!",9,0,1,23 December 2013
