The Blair Witch Project," Excruciating... in ALL the wrong ways
","I watched 'The Blair Witch Project' for the first time this evening, almost 10 years after its theatrical release. I've read a lot about this film and many of the commentaries, especially on IMDb, were positive to the point of ecstatic. I wanted to be scared out of my wits, like the original 'Night of the Living Dead' caused me to be. Perhaps this expectation and hope is largely responsible for my deep disappointment. It starts off fairly promisingly with interviews with the locals of the town on the edge of the haunted woods. There is humor and believability in these first minutes, then it all goes down the tube as soon as the three students enter the woods. The last hour of this movie is boring as can be and I found it very difficult to convince myself that these actors were really alone in the woods without some sort of pre-conceived guidance. How else could they have made their way to the house at the end?And the bobbing and lurching cameras caused me to have to take a break in the middle to go lie down and relax my stiff neck. The feeling was very much like being in a small launch in the Gulf of Mexico in a 9 foot swell. The best aspects of this film are the interesting folk art elements scattered around in the woods. Beyond that I give this effort a 4 out of 10 for chuzpah and little else.",4,2,4,13 February 2009
Finding Neverland," On second thought...
","I submitted a commentary, since deleted, on 'Finding Neverland' after I first saw it. Now I've seen it again and have altered my initial opinion substantially. The first viewing left me feeling a bit bored, albeit intrigued, and finally moved, as the makers intended me to be. I was charmed, and that's not a bad thing. Upon second viewing I am confirmed in my earlier suspicions that there is much less to this movie than meets the eye, mind or heart.I was, and still am, impressed by Johnny Depp who turns in yet another fine performance, delivering his lines with a natural Scottish brogue. There are other fine performances, notably Kelly MacDonald's Peter Pan. Kate Winslet is a fine actress and does what she can with the one-dimensional character written for her. And it's good to see Julie Christie still at her most acerbic. I sensed she was holding in laughter the whole time for some reason. She plays a tinsel gorgon and seems to not really believe in the character's motivations. This isn't surprising as none of the characters seem to evolve out of any sort of authentic human spark. They are all cardboard cutouts. The usual portrayal of 'uptight' Victorians as seen by Hollywood is in full evidence. Even the children are too clean, their little pranks and fights all choreographed and careful. Fortunately the four Davies boys are played by fairly natural actors who are happily free of cuteness or obnoxious precociousness. Young Michael is especially engaging. The focus boy, Peter, is too glum by half but well acted.The story is interesting but has not been brought very effectively to the screen in this movie. It's a surprisingly 'down' film with little humor. It has charm of a Disney-esquire nature but it rings false most of the time. The writer has attempted to manipulate emotions from the viewer, leaving one feeling a bit conned in the end.I can't put my finger on it other than to say something went awry in the conceptualization meetings in pre-production. A wrong turn was taken somewhere and the result is an oddly shallow and predictable charade. A high-tech panto for adults.It's all a pity because the cast is very good. The technical side, of which the production team seemed especially proud of themselves in the 'special feature' sections on the DVD, is also good. But that's what this film feels like, a show-off piece for fancy camera/ computer work and cleverly edited scenes. The movie flows like a very shallow rivulet when I really would have liked a more deeply flowing river. Charles Sturridge did it better in 'A Fairy Tale' and without the blatant emotional manipulation.I didn't dislike 'Finding Neverland' but I think I'll just read the play 'Peter Pan' next time. But then there is Johnny Depp's Barrie and Kelly MacDonald's Peter Pan that will probably charm me back to the DVD again.",5,1,6,1 April 2005
12 Monkeys," Try to blend in
","I'm way behind the times because I've just watched 'Twelve Monkeys' for the first time, 14 years after it was released in the theaters. I went off Terry Gilliam for awhile, can't really say why. I got involved in other stuff, I guess. Anyway, I missed having this masterful film under my belt all these years.Recently I proclaimed 'Tideland' as having superseded 'Brazil' as his masterpiece. Now, in so short a time, 'Twelve Monkey's has snatched the crown from 'Tideland'. All three of these films are solid evidence of Gilliam being one of the great living directors.What is most great about this movie, for me, is that I didn't know what was going to happen next. Nothing about it is predictable, even to the very last shot on the airplane to San Francisco.I began to think this was a modern version of the nightmare classic 'Dead of Night', then, at the very end it turned out to be something quite different. Gilliam has never been a director to explain everything to a supposedly gawp-mouthed public, but relies upon them to be capable of rubbing a couple of brain cells together and figuring it out on their own.My brain cells were so fuddled until the last scene that I gave up trying to second guess the ending. It's a frequently depressing movie, showing modern society as corrupt and violent and cynical. It even began to seem preferable that 99% of the world population should be destroyed by a virus, but somehow, when the credits were running I abandoned that dark thought. It's also a very funny movie, thanks to the very subtle performances of Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt and the scientists living in the future, all of whom seem slightly cracked, like the psychiatrists in the present time. Madelyn Stowe is superb throughout, and near the end of the movie becomes a tremendously moving presence.This story blows holes in all the political-socio bickering that goes on between various factions with their hidden agendas and brings the viewer back to the main point, which is: we are alive and it's a miracle, and that's all that matters... make the most of it.Brilliant cast, brilliant music, direction, cinematography, art direction... the whole ball of wax.And Brad Pitt really CAN act when he's working with a great director.A great film.",10,0,0,13 November 2009
Elizabeth," An old fashioned 'star' vehicle
","Shekhar Kapur's version of 'Elizabeth' is a fine vehicle to showcase the blindingly talented Cate Blanchett as Queen Elizabeth I. Her portrayal of the great monarch places largely excellent co-stars in danger of being completely swamped by her charisma and total identification and interpretation of the character. An astounding portrayal taking Elizabeth from beautiful young princess to her final transformation into the white-faced doll we have all become familiar with.Kathy Burke (Queen Mary) is just about equal to Blanchett in every regard. Her portrayal of the tortured 'Bloody' Mary in the last days of her murderous reign is touching and powerful. Geoffrey Rush (Walshingham) and Fanny Ardant (Mary de Guise) are superb as well. She is especially serpentine and fascinating. Her nephew, the Duc d'Anjou, is hilariously performed by Vincent Cassel. Of all the fine actors in this ensemble his scenes with Blanchett are the most memorable. His raucous prince is a perfect foil for Blanchett's dry humor. The scene when he appears in drag before the queen is a priceless classic of comedy. Terence Rigby is a wonderfully vile, malevolent Bishop Gardiner, more a demon from hell than a Christian icon. Christopher Eccleston plays the 'villainous' Duke of Norfolk with a sexy swagger. He seems to have a brilliant career ahead of him as a modern Basil Rathbone. Kelly Mcdonald, in an early appearance in a secondary role in film, stands out as the doomed lady-in-waiting. The balance of the cast is quite good with the one glaring exception of Joseph Fiennes. It is a total mystery to me how he lands so many high-profile roles in major films. His acting abilities run the gamut from 'A' to 'B'. When he's not pouting he's smirking and smug. His smarmy delivery of his lines is irritating in the extreme and his attempts to play the 'laughing cavalier' are pathetic and he comes off as an annoying pipsqueak. It was a great shame that the handsome and sexy fine actor, Eric Cantona (here the French Ambassador) was not cast as Dudley.The technical side of this show is good if a bit artsy-fartsy. The myriad of tricky camera angles is more reminiscent of a PBS travel documentary than a major motion picture, but it is pleasant to look at.Even if historical drama is not your cuppa I recommend this film for the tremendous performance by Cate Blanchett. I long for a film that would pit her and her Antipodean colleague, Russell Crowe, together in a love story. Perhaps another historical saga, or something legendary like 'Tristan and Isolde'.",Null,2,3,10 December 2004
Brokeback Mountain," Beautiful melancholy
","I am one of those film lovers who never goes to first runs in the theater or pays all that much attention to critics' reviews, industry hype and, more often than not, the opinions of people I know. I wait until all the hubbub dies down and after time if the film is still being discussed and seems to have a real lasting effect in peoples' minds then I rent it (sometimes I buy it if my instincts tell me to). Just this week I found a copy of 'Brokeback Mountain' in my late mothers' DVD drawer. Was I surprised!? Yes. This movie was on my short list of 'must sees' sooner rather than later. So I watched it and have to agree completely with all the raves of the past 4 years since its initial release. Heath Ledger is great in this film. His mumbling, shy yet tough Ennis is a multi-faceted, subtle and deeply moving performance. Jake Gyllenhaal's Jack is less faceted but then his character knows what he wants, at least more than Ennis does, at first. There is less room in the role for Gyllenhaal to grow as a character which is mostly set from the start. Even more impressive than the leading men are the leading women. Michelle Williams gives a very nuanced and lived-in performance of Ennis's wife, Alma. And Anne Hathaway's Lureen Newsome is also superb as the more controlled and worldly Mrs Jack Twist.The actress playing the 19 year-old Alma jnr, whose name I can't remember at the moment, stands out as well in a very strong cast.Music, cinematography, editing... everything, about this film qualifies it as one of the icons of great film-making in the United States. I'm glad I waited to see it without all the pop hype rolling around in my head.",10,7,9,28 May 2009
Ed Wood," It's becoming a classic
","It's hard to believe 'Ed Wood' was released 15 years ago. It went on to my instant favorites list the first time I watched it and seems as fresh and brilliant now as it did way back when. It was an inspired idea for a Tim Burton film and it is about as close to perfection as a film from Hollywood can get. The casting is beyond criticism, Howard Shore's musical score is one of his very best, full of memorable moments and catchy tunes (especially the opening credits with the bongos), the costumes and makeup, camera work, the whole ball of wax is beautifully conceived and executed. The f/x are great because they are just as seedy and ridiculous as Ed Wood's on when he filmed 'Plan 9 from Outer Space', paper plates as flying saucers, school room teachers' desks for control consoles within the space ships, stewardess uniform for the female E.T., rubber octopuses etc. It is all very funny. Ed Wood's cross dressing does not come off as eye-rolling ridiculous, it too is very funny. Ed, played by the ever-wonderful Johnny Depp, is a fundamentally kind man, full of ambitions and drive to succeed against horrendous odds, his biggest obstacle being his own lack of talent. But now he is a Hollywood immortal, along with Vampira, played by the marvelous Lisa Marie, and, of course, Bela Legosi at the very trashed-out end of his long career; an astonishing, moving and often hilarious performance by Martin Landau.Bill Murray and Jeffrey Jones add to the extremely funny cast of main characters. Patricia Arquette and Sarah Jessica Parker are Ed's two girlfriends, Arquette playing his eventual wife, Kathy, a lovely performance, the one quiet and relatively sane person in the entire movie.This is not just a very sophisticated adult comedy it is also recommendable to kids who are old enough to have developed a sense of humor, though the cross- dressing angle may cause some parents to give pause before allowing their 12 year old boys watch it. And the drug-rehab scene with Bela Lugosi is intense, but perhaps a good object lesson for youngsters who may be thinking shooting up heroin might be cool.I think 'Ed Wood' is Burton's best movie, so far.",10,5,6,15 September 2009
Orphan," Rhoda Penmark, hang your head in shame.
","It's Halloween, a night that I have, traditionally for the past 20 years, set aside to watch the latest scary flick. This year's selection was Jaume Collet-Serra's film 'Orphan'. All those cute little tikes were outside dressed like Princesses at the 4-H children's' beauty contest, their parents tailing them like hawks, with cigarettes hanging out of their mouths; the perfect setting to scare the pants off me as this brilliant psychological thriller unfolded before my ever widening eyeballs. Esther, oh, Esther Esther Esther... I can't possibly reveal anything that happens in this film. This is one of the most spectacular screenplays I've watched in ages, written by David Leslie Johnson based on a story by Alex Mace. This should be a prime contender for best screenplay in 2010. It is gripping from start to finish. It begins quietly with the beguiling Esther being adopted by an upscale couple who've had their share of tribulations with children. These are average, successful Americans we're talking about here, bringing this hair-raising story very close to home for millions of viewers who have the guts to see it. Little moments of seemingly insignificant tension and release take place but build cumulatively until, at about 80 minutes into watching it, I had to put the thing on pause so I could blink and walk around the house to see if the doors were locked against those dreadful trick-or-treating beasts and that the back light was on for the night, something I never bother with, normally.Make no mistake, this is one bloody, ruthless film and Esther is one scary little bitch. She's cute as a spooky cat, until she begins her little tricks. I began to dread what was coming when about 40 minutes into the film Esther says f**k in such a way as to cause my hair to stand on end. We hear kids say that word all the time, trying to show off and sound tough. Not Esther. She just says it and it is like a nuclear blast to the senses.The ending, the one used in the final cut, is harrowing, following a climactic twist in the story that is truly shocking.The actors are excellent. Peter Sarsgaard is his usual laid-back persona and a bit one dimensional, but it suits this smug, rather weak character whose mother, Gramma, on the evidence of her personality here, is a classic monstre sacré, adding speculative dimensions to the highly charged sexual undertone of the entire film. If Vera Farmiga doesn't win best actress for her role as his wife there is no justice or fairness in Hollywood. She is magnificent as the adoptive mother. And she is a fine pianist as well.Her two natural children, Max, her deaf little girl, and Daniel her pre-teen son, are played with a naturalism and surety that can't be taught in any method acting class. The young actors are Aryana Enginner and Jimmy Bennett. But even more astounding is the performance by Isabelle Fuhrman as the eponymous 'heroine' Esther. To describe the range of her performance would cause me to include a spoiler, or at least a too close to the bone hint that might ruin this film for those who haven't seen it yet.She, too, would be a close contender to Vera Farmiga as best actress in 2010. A great great cast! The music is minimalist but perfect for this tense story. The cinematography is wholly naturalistic, the most high-tech aspect of the film being the use of black lites in Esther's bedroom. There is none of the over-used CGI or any of those tiresome tricks that are so prevalent in the junk coming out of Hollywood these days. 'Orphan' is a straight-ahead horror flick like 'Night of the Living Dead' only it has no fantasy elements in it at all. And like all great horror flicks the viewer has sympathy for the tragedy of the 'monster'. And Esther's life is a tragedy in spite of everything.I expect the Academy of Motion Sickness Pictures will ignore this masterpiece because it probably didn't make enough money, but I predict the DVD will sell millions as the years pass and the perfection of this classic film is recognized by more and more people.'Orphan' is definitely for adults only. There is no nudity and the 'bad' words are not really offensive in any vulgar or pornographic sense, and the bloody bits are not sickening or over-abundant, but it's far too intense for pre-teens. I keep calling 'Orphan' a horror but it isn't. It's a very disturbing and complex psychological thriller. Hitchcock would probably have been proud to have made this film. It's almost as good as 'Psycho'. I don't think 'Orphan' is a 'B' movie at all. If it is then so is all of Hitchock's output.",10,12,21,31 October 2009
Sleepy Hollow," More from Burton's bag of tricks
","'Sleepy Hollow' is right up Tim Burton's alley and he's made a visually beautiful and gripping film of it. I'm not sure why he decided to make Ichabod Crane such a wuss but Johnny Depp's interpretation of the character has charm and mild pathos which make for a rounded believable character and displays Crane's queasiness about blood and decapitated bodies without making him a city sissy. The cinematography is the most beautiful in any of Burton's films, all sepia and silver-toned grays. I'm not sure how much (if any) of this was filmed in the Hudson Valley of NY but it certainly looks real enough in the outdoor scenes. The studio sets are obvious enough when Burton's signature gnarled, beast-like trees start popping up in the landscape, and as usual the sets are just as beautiful and fascinating as the spooky woods surrounding Sleepy Hollow.Elfman's scores are always great enhancements to Burton's films and this one is one of his better and more hard-hitting compositions, but still with the charm of boy sopranos and eerie violins at the top of their range.The cast is stellar, as in full of stars, English mostly, who will be familiar to film buffs who watch a lot of BBC and Masterpiece Theatre as well as feature films from the U.K. They are all so good that none stand out above the others. Unfortunately Christina Ricci, as the romantic heroine, is not up to the same level simply because she's too modern in her delivery. She looks great but she delivers many of her lines in a quick and robotic manner that jars after so much eloquence from her colleagues, occasionally speaking so fast that she slurs her words together and is almost unintelligible if your not listening closely. But she is not exactly a detraction, simply a cut below the others. I'm still waiting for Burton's perfect nightmare legend to hit the screen. The upcoming 'Alice in Wonderland' looks like it is animation so I don't think it will be the ONE. Sometimes I think Burton might do well to do a couple of remakes, like the Invisible Man or Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, or maybe even Dracula... ALL with Johnny Depp!This is a very good movie but not for young children. The blood and chopped heads are typically Burton-style and not sickening but the abundance of both do have a cumulative effect, especially as its a veritable blood bath at the end.Not one of his greats, those kudos go to 'Ed Wood', 'Edward Scissorhands' and 'Big Fish', but it is one of his better films, and the visual aspects of it are splendid.",7,0,0,24 September 2009
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," A Musical Splatter Flick
","Tim Burton says he loves musicals, his partner, Helena Bonham Carter says he does not like musicals. Whatever the truth may be the results of his filming of 'Sweeney Todd' are ambivalent.It looks like a Burton film, the sets are great (studio bond) and the costumes and makeup out of his top drawer. The film is similar to 'Sleepy Hollow' in that the colors are muted, mostly sepia, browns, gray and black with emphasis placed on the bright red blood (lots of it) and yellow, for the charlatan's elixir of urine at the street fair. Sasha Baron Cohen shines as this character and is the most entertaining of all the cast, and he can sing!Johnny Depp sings well too, though obviously he's not all that comfortable with it, this being his first filmed singing role. Helena Bonham Carter is also good, and she seems better at acting and singing at the same time than Depp. But as they are both duffers at musicals they are well-matched together and make a compelling couple in their dark machinations. The supporting cast is good if only amounting to stock character acting. It was type casting to have Alan Rickman as Judge Turpin. He gives his trademark mush mouthed performance and sings okay. Timothy Spall is rather wasted as Turpin's brutal flunky but he does what he can. The star is Edward Sanders as Toby, the young lad who is taken on by Mrs Lovett as her shop assistant and in the end dispatches Sweeney Todd. The kid can sing and act with beguiling aplomb. The minor love interest is totally dull, the two young actors hardly having a chance to create any chemistry between them. Joanna, Todd's long lost daughter, is an empty vessel, there simply for the plot, and the actress can't sing for beans. I don't understand the great popularity of this Broadway show. Sondheim's lyrics are the strongest points, but the music is largely unmemorable, containing not a single memorable tune. It's the lyrics that stick in the mind. 'Sweeney Todd' is nowhere near Sondheim's greatest musical (to my way of thinking) 'A Little Night Music'.The comedy is almost non-existent, and I don't see what could possibly be funny about this gruesome tale in the first place. I haven't seen the musical play which may be funny, I don't know. This film is not. It's gory, in Burton's usual manner. The blood looks more realistic than it did in, say, 'Sleepy Hollow' and there are copious quantities of it, the cumulative effect of which is indeed rather sickening. Something about razors, I suppose, that makes it very squirmy watching.I liked Bonham Carter's Mrs Lovett. She's on the young side, compared with Angela Lansbury, and is beautiful in a decayed way, and she does add some comedy at moments with her wide range of subtle facial expressions. I enjoyed her very much. Depp is not so satisfying, though good. He looks the part and expresses the anger and murderous intent very clearly, but he's more down the lines of a dark Jack the Ripper than the, supposedly, more buffo Todd.Victorian London is evoked beautifully, too beautifully. The streets are clear of horse manure and other offal and it doesn't 'smell' visually as it should. Mary Poppins would have been quite at home in the pristine throngs of these London streets and byways. There is one glaring spacial mistake with Mrs Lovett's shop. Sweeney's trick chair upstairs is placed so that, in reality, it would dump his victims directly into Mrs Lovett's pie shop by the front door. Ultimately, I can't see the point of this film, other than to get Sondheim's mediocre score on celluloid with big name stars, and for Burton to show off his best trademark features. The blood is gratuitously over-bearing and the plot line is very thin and the script is very weak.If I watch it again it will be for Bonham Carter, Cohen and young Sanders displaying their talents under Tim Burton's meticulous direction.I look forward now, more than ever, to Burton's upcoming 'Alice in Wonderland' to redeem him of this relative failure. 'Sweeney Todd' is Burton's least successful film and I hope he never sinks to this level again.Lastly, I missed the music of Danny Elfman in a Burton feature. He and Tim Burton are as strongly associated with one another as were Bernard Hermann and Alfred Hitchcock.",5,1,1,29 September 2009
Edward Scissorhands," A Beautiful Fantasy Classic
","I've been on a Tim Burton binge for a couple of weeks and just finished watching 'Edward Scissorhands' after not having seen it for over 15 years (!). I have been depriving myself of a wonderful film and am happy to have rediscovered its magic.As with all Burton films you have to suspend disbelief and simply enter his world. For instance, it makes no sense that there should be an ancient Gothic castle on a mountain on the outskirts of a Florida suburb, or that a Frankenstein's monster like Edward should be so human, yet, apparently, immortal.There are more levels to this film than meets the eye and I must watch it over and over, that is clear to me, and delve deeper into the visionary imagination of Tim Burton.Johnny Depp is deeply moving as Edward, his facial expressions and the slightest movements of his scissor hands leave most actors in the dust, even when unencumbered with such foreign objects attached to their bodies. And I loved seeing Dianne Wiest in this film playing Winona Ryder's (Kim's) mother Peg. She is sweet and deeply kind without being saccharin. She is also very funny in the bewildered, innocent manner Wiest is so good at. And Alan Arkin is a great foil as Peg's husband, a long-suffering but non-complaining worker bee, like all the other men in their neighborhood of pastel houses and cars, into which Edward brings his magic, for awhile, by carving topiary in all the yards and cutting the dogs' hair, as well as the housewives'. Winona Ryder has great chemistry with Depp and their few moments together at the end are heart-rending.I wouldn't call this a happy movie, because it isn't. There is a murder at the end, for which the viewer can't help but cheer about, that throws the film out of the park if you're looking for a kids' Christmas flick. This is an adult film suitable for more mature children and teens. Especially teens, who Burton always seems to view through a glass darkly.'Edward Scissorhands' isn't a morality play or a sermon about right and wrong, it's more than those things but Burton doesn't shove it in our faces. He leaves us to come to our own conclusions with what appears to be a straightforward tale of good vs bad; it isn't entirely that either, though good and bad comes into it a lot in the script.It's a tearjerker to be sure but I never felt manipulated by the film-maker in any way, though clearly he intended the poignance to rise up and overwhelm at the end. The beautiful music of Danny Elfman contributes a great deal, as always with that wonderful composer, to the atmosphere. 'Edward Scissorhands' is now a classic fantasy of American film-making and should be seen by all movie lovers. It's right up there with 'It's a Wonderful Life' but without the 40's schmalz.One of Tim Burton's best.",10,1,2,22 September 2009
Mulholland Drive," Hey, pretty girl... time to wake up.
","Mulholland Drive is, to date, David Lynch's most perfectly executed film. It is the most effective demonstration of alternative universes he's yet accomplished.The first two times I viewed Mulholland Drive I was trying to figure something out. I put it away for a long time. Several years later, now, I have re-watched it, after a marathon viewing of the entire Twin Peaks series. This inundation of Lynch-World helped me to relax into Mulholland Drive and let it flow over me. I simply watched without thinking and, though nothing was made clear, it did make some sort of profound sense. It is about dreams, about who we think we are, who we actually might be, who we want to be and who we really are NOT. Numerology, magic, astrology and Eastern mysticism have always played a part in Lynch's work. In Mulholland Drive those elements fuse and result in a perfect whole, perfect within the context of its own existence. There is no mystery beyond what the viewers create in their own minds out their own pre- dispositions and prejudices. To have chosen Hollywood, especially Mulholland Drive, as the focus for this vision was particularly stunning for someone, like me, who worked and lived there for several years, experiencing the complete delusion of the place, the profound sadness of most of its inhabitants and the vaingloriousness of its masters. Hollywood is heaven and hell, mostly the latter, for people like 'Betty/Diane' (Naomi Watts).Nothing more can be said about the plot. The bits and pieces of it are beautiful, evocative. Scenes like that at the Silenzio Club with Rebecca del Rio singing that haunting acapella song. The moment when the girls open the blue box and 'Betty' vanishes, changing time and space in a moment. All that has gone before has been a dream leading to another dream. It's lovely to behold and is deeply satisfying, once you have let go of trying to figure out what, if anything, is going on, plot- wise.There are some splendid performances to enjoy. Naomi Watts is astonishing, a range like no other actress I can think of off-hand. Laura Harring is not only fabulously beautiful but also as great an actress as Watts, well almost. And it is SO wonderful that Lynch brought in Ann Miller for her last stand on film. The best way to approach this film is to watch it like Disney's 'Fantasia' and forget all pre- conceived notions of what a movie is supposed to be, based on all the mediocre, fatuous and vanity-driven crap coming at us out of Hollywood all the time. When the sad day comes when we will sum up David Lynch's work 'Mulholland Drive' will, I predict, be assessed as his greatest masterpiece.My favorite bit, of many, is when Angelo Badalamenti (playing, Luigi Catigliani) spits out his espresso into a handkerchief. An immortal Lynch moment.",10,2,3,16 June 2008
Thor," Kinda boring
","I am not a comic book fan, let alone an aficionado, so I have nothing to compare this adaptation of The Mighty Thor with, beyond all the literature and legend I am aware of from which this movie derives its characters. Derive is the operative word here in this entirely predictable, rather dull script.There are some excellent things about Kenneth Branagh's movie Thor. The artistic vision and f/x for the 'gods' planet Asgard are evocative and beautiful, reminding me, however, of the computer game Diablo, Lord of Destruction and other computer art I've seen. Nothing wrong with that, this is just a movie for mindless entertainment and the more visual distractions the better. Especially since the script is so utterly banal and dully acted, for the most part.It's all very professional and Hollywood, aimed at 13 year old boys. The love interest, for the 13 year old girls, in the body of Natalie Portman's Jane, is pretty much of a flop as she and Thor, Chris Hemsworth, have absolutely not a single shred of erotic chemistry between them. But then I've never understood the popularity and admiration for Natalie Portman who strikes me as a singularly mediocre talent.Hemsworth is good, however, as Thor. He looks terrific and he's an effective actor, but lacks that last ounce of cosmic charisma that I expected to see in this role. He is completely overshadowed by Tom Hiddleston as his brother Loki. Hiddleston is also better looking in a very sensuous way and his scenes were by far the most interesting and well-acted. The other outstanding actor here, or character I should say, is that of the Gate Keeper on Asgard, played by Idris Elba. The ubiquitous and seemingly ageless Anthony Hopkins is also good as Odin, but he has too little to do, spending most of the movie in a coma. Renée Russo is wasted as Frigga, Odin's wife. None of the other gods are very interesting which was disappointing as I loved Ray Stevenson in Rome. He does not translate well to the big screen, and his character is anonymous, leaving him little to develop, and he IS a good actor, within his limits.The music is nondescript action stuff, nothing memorable. The technical aspects are all first rate, but the entire effort is hobbled by the comic-book caliber script. So if you are a fan of the comics you'll probably feel right at home here, but if you are more interested in the Norse legends from which these characters are mined I recommend you buy a set of Richard Wagner's Ring cycle and start listening to those. THEY are truly epic and deeply moving experiences. Thor isn't a major part in that, appearing only in Das Rheingold as Donner, the god of thunder, but Wotan (Odin) is there and those four operas are some of the towering masterpieces in human creativity. The ultimate comic book adventure.",Null,0,2,14 October 2011
A Beautiful Mind," Finally a good bio flick
","Ron Howard continues to impress and surprise. Russell Crowe is, to my way of thinking, the finest screen actor before us at the moment, possessing a range of versatility unknown by any other male 'star' of the day. Comparing his portrayal here with his other work, notably 'Master and Commander' and 'Gladiator' it is astonishing to believe one man can encompass so successfully such a wide variety of roles within such a short span of years.Unlike the current crop of bio-historical cow flop like 'Troy' and 'Alexander' Ron Howard's fascinating journey along the razor's edge between madness and genius proves that good cinema need not involve gratuitous violence, sex or profanity, not that those things in and of themselves cannot add to a film's relevancy, but they usually don't.The entire cast is excellent, notably Jennifer Connelly's magnetic performance as the mad professor's long-suffering and loyal wife. She embodies the 'love conquers all' message of the movie in a way that is never saccharine or mawkish.This movie is a very good mystery for the first time viewer. Further viewings uncover more depth in the story which is always a sign of good craftsmanship on the part of the script writer, director and actors.The technical aspects never intrude on the action (please note this Bertolucci!) and the story flows naturally from start to finish without a hiccup.It is gratifying to see that a Hollywood production can have some depth to it without resorting to coy sexuality and meaningless vulgarity.I don't buy many dvds but this one is a keeper.",Null,0,2,26 November 2004
Downfall," A great anti-war film
","I can't see anything controversial about Oliver Hirschbiegel's film Der Untergang (Downfall). Perhaps some find it so because it has deeply human underpinnings on which the entire story rests. We all know Hitler was a monstrous mediocrity as a politician and some, who knew him personally, claim he was a soft-spoken, cultured and intelligent man who became something else when he became Das Führer for public events. That last group is usually dismissed as unrepentant beasts and nothing they say holds any water with the popular media.This film does not dismiss those who had not entirely unfavorable views of Adolf Hitler. I suppose that is what has enraged some people. If you can get passed the powerful emotional knee-jerk reaction to anything related to the man you will find a deeply moving story of the frailty and imperfection of our species. Hircshbiegel does not sugar-coat Hitler's manic personality but neither does he show a Hitler who goes insane and blows his brains out in a last-ditch panic. The methodical and precise aspect of Hitler's mind is on exhibit here and that alone is frightening. At one point he holds forth about the sin of compassion, to his way of thinking. Compassion only protects the weak and, like the apes, the human being must crush the weaker if the race is to survive. This is brutal stuff and unpleasant to hear let alone contemplate. This film sheds a new light on the last days in the bunker in Berlin before the war ended. There are many powerful scenes that stick in the mind. This story is based upon the memories of Trudl Junge, Hitler's last secretary. You could possibly call this film Hitler from a feminine point of view but that wouldn't be entirely accurate. Young German women during the Third Reich who committed themselves to The Cause of National Socialism were clear- eyed and truthful, except perhaps with themselves. The real Trudl Junge admits at the end of the film, as an old lady, that she was wrong to not have known about the murders of millions of foreigners as she calls them and that youth was no excuse for Not Finding Out.There is nothing neo-Nazi about this film. It isn't that kind of thing. Downfall is one of the greatest anti-war movies there is. The overwhelming tragedy that is any war hits with great force here. The personal events are harrowing. In the case of Magda Goebbels unbelievably and unbearably so as she must kill her six youngest children with her own hand, using a sleeping draft and then cyanide capsules. It is a unique and unforgettable sequence of scenes. Corinna Harouch (Magda Goebbels) turns in one of those quietly volcanic performances that are rarely scene in film. Bruno Ganz plays Hitler as a second cousin to Nosferatu, his hands constantly twitching behind his hunched-over shoulders. I am no Hitler scholar but I've read a fair amount of literature on the era and about people loosely associated with the inner sanctum and I don't recall anyone mentioning this physical twitch of his. More than one person has mentioned that near the end Hitler was zonked on drugs most of the time. He is not shown as a morphine addict in this film but as a puritanical vegan who drank nothing but bottled water. There's food for thought.Alexandra Maria Lara plays Trudl Junge and she is a magnetic personality who quietly carries the film on her lovely shoulders. Her story is told with elegance and subtly conveys the imperceptible vortex of apocalypse without the use of a blasting militaristic score or scene after scene of carnage, though there is a fair amount of that, but it is never gratuitous.There are moments of utter rest and calm and beauty but they are few and far between. A very wonderful scene happens when Eva Braun (Juliane Köhler) takes Trudl and Gerda, another of Hiter's secretaries, out of the bunker during a lull in the artillery bombardment of Berlin. The three young women sit quietly on stone benches amidst newly blossoming bulbs in a courtyard above the bunker. A melodious bird sings idyllically in the trees and the sky is blue and the sun is shining. Normalcy. Then the sirens begin and the cigarettes are carefully stubbed out and the women retreat back underground, for the last time in Eva Braun's case.The film is full of wonderful scenes and episodes and I found myself forgetting it was about Hitler at all. Perhaps that too is what enrages some people. We mustn't ever forget Hitler.Well, how can we?The cinematography, music, costumes, claustrophobic sets and the entire cast of fine German actors, beautifully but unobtrusively directed, is a fine work of art and should be seen by all film and 20th century European history buffs.",10,0,1,25 October 2010
Bram Stoker's Dracula," It leaves a bad taste in your mouth
","Simply in terms of fidelity to the original material, Bram Stoker's classic story of 'Dracula', Francis Ford Coppola has made a hashish smoker's ideal adaptation of a story that could have been truly horrifying by being realistic. What we have here is a Playboy version for adolescent adults (and real adolescents) who are dazzled by anachronistic costuming and hairstyles and bits and pieces of carnival sideshow trickery.There is much that is beautiful in this film, notably the musical score by Wojciech Kilar and Michael Ballhaus's cinematography. The set designs for Dracula's Transylvanian castle are fascinating in a sort of Edward Gory-esquire way but not at all scarifying. The back lot sets for Victorian London are equally fake-looking but nicely detailed and well-populated with immaculate extras all acting like perfect ladies and gentlemen. A far cry from the real streets of 19th century London. This is another studio bound evocation of a period, as in Tim Burton's flop 'Sweeney Todd', which would have made Mary Poppins feel right at home.The cast has difficulties mostly due to the sophomoric script. Only Gary Oldman (Dracula), Anthony Hopkins (Van Helsing) and, surprisingly, Tom Waits (Renfrew) are able to deliver potent performances with the words provided.Some people don't like Gary Oldman's Dracula. I do, very much. He rises above the defeating script to deliver at times a powerfully touching portrait of a tragic man. Whether the character he plays is authentically Stoker's is not Oldman's fault. He does his very best and for him alone I keep returning, periodically, to watch this adult fairy tale.Anthony Hopkins is quite weird and spooky as Van Helsing, scarier than Dracula to my way of thinking. The shade of Hannibal Lecter, which he filmed the year before this role, is ever- present in his threatening and eccentric man of science. But Hopkins doesn't appear to be taking this role seriously. He's camping it up throughout.Tom Waits' insane Renfrew has entered the annals as one of the most memorable bizarre characters on screen, right up there with Jack Nicholson's Joker in 'Batman' and Klaus Kinski's Dracula in Werner Herzog's 'Nosferatu' (now THAT is one frightening and creepy movie).I also enjoyed Sadie Frost's Lucy. This character, as interpreted by Coppola, is completely out of place, far too modern and slutty, especially for a well-brought up English maiden of the aristocracy. And where could she have come up with the red, dominatrix teddy she wears to her first encounter with Dracula at the bottom of the garden? The original Victoria's Secret? Her costumes are totally ridiculous, if gorgeous, but she looks wonderful in them and goes with the flow, turning in the most camp and over-the-top performance of the entire cast. Cary Elwes is a total stick as Lucy's fiancé but, again, not his fault; it's the lame script which reduces him to human wallpaper. I liked Bill Campbell's Quincy, the handsome, sexy Texan, but there is something a bit too cartoony about his character. But, this is a human cartoon version of this story so his Quincey doesn't seem so very out of place. Normally I enjoy Richard E. Grant, who plays the morphine addicted student doctor who runs the insane asylum, a place that he belongs in himself, but not as the manager. Again, a fine actor is reduced to stock melodramatics in the face of the fatuous script.Worst of all are the two romantic leads, Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder. They are both stiff and self-conscious, as they attempt to spit out their ideas of upper crust English accents and in the process crippling what little acting ability either of them ever possessed in the first place. They look beautiful, especially him, but they are painful to watch and, especially, listen to. Why does Winona Ryder slur her 'S's all the time? She sounds slightly drugged when she does this and it's terrificly annoying.Coppola has now retired to the vineyard in Napa County from where he sententiously pronounces on the imminent demise of Hollywood, and appears to have made his last movie, at least for the moment. If so, he will go down in celluloid history as having been a four flick phenomenon, 'The Conversation', 'The Godfather' (I & II) and 'Apocalypse Now'. This would be tragic if he were a great auteur who shunned the public eye, but he's not and he doesn't.A disappointing director, all in all, as proved by his over-bearing and self-indulgent work in this 'Dracula' which smacks of amateurishness and too much ganja at the planning stage. He and Reeves and Ryder deserved one another, but the rest of his fine cast is criminally wasted.But I repeat, Gary Oldman is fantastic as Dracula and worth seeing. He deserves another shot at this role in a faithful, realistic adaptation, and without the silly wig he is made to wear in Castle Dracula, but it will never happen now.If you're looking for a good, modern vampire movie, try Herzog's 'Nosferatu' or Tony Scott's 'The Hunger' or Neil Jordan's 'Interview with the Vampire' or, best of all in spite of the awful dubbing, Tomas Alfredson's 'Let the Right One In'. All of them succeed where Coppola fails.",5,4,8,22 October 2009
Dark Shadows," There is no where to go but up.
","I love Tim Burton. Several of his movies rank in my top 100 of all time. Sadly his adaptation of a popular television cult series, Dark Shadows, skirts the borders of Amateur land.There are numerous touches of the Burton dark humor, and his casting is, once again, beyond criticism, but they are ALL wasted on what has to be one of the worst scripted screenplays I've sat through since Ed Wood's (ironically enough) Plan 9 from Outer Space. The difference is that old classic of bad movie-making is funny and memorable, this hollow mess is instantly forgettable. The cast is wasted. Johnny Depp does his best, which is very good, with very little. This man is funny, one of the great comedians, and his timing of lines is perfect, yet, he cannot save this movie all by himself, from being interminable at 113 minutes, and boring beyond belief. It took me 4 days to get through it, turning it on and off, finally forcing myself to watch the incredibly lame climactic battle and limp ending. It is as if the production team simply gave up after the death of Dr Julia Hoffman (the splendidly funny Helena Bonham-Carter). Michelle Pfeiffer makes almost no impression at all as Elizabeth Collins. This isn't her fault, she has nothing much to work with as far as character development (as in ZERO) and the fabulously beautiful Eva Green looks absurd in a very bad blonde wig. Her American accent comes and goes as well. The CGI effects are okay, nothing special. I realize this movie is a probably intended as a send- up of the original kitschy TV show, a program I watched religiously as a kid, but I was never certain, watching Burton's effort, whether it was meant to be this stupid or not.The most interesting performance, and one of the funniest, is by the girl who plays Caroline Collins, (sorry I've forgotten her name). She has a future in Burton movies I hope.The whole concept should have been chucked in the shredder on Day One of the initial pitch.Even the mighty slip and fall on their faces once in awhile. I hope it never happens again to Tim Burton. I feel his pain.",1,3,6,10 August 2013
The Queen," Surprisingly fair assessment of the times
","I was expecting a hatchet job on the royal family when this film was first announced. My interest in seeing it was increased mainly because Helen Mirren was playing Queen Elizabeth II and Stephen Frears was directing. I wasn't sure how Frears views the royal family so I was still anticipating a negative 'take' in the film. I was very surprised by the final result. Frears gives a pretty fair and unbiased representation of the events surrounding the death of Princess Diana without throwing in too much street legend stuff, such as the popular, at the time, belief that the Queen had had Diana's car booby-trapped, and other such nonsense. And Tony Blair was presented in a most interesting light.One of the best scenes was when he lashes out at Alastair Campbell (Mark Bazeley) and defends the Queen against the blind bias against all the so-called royal parasites that is promulgated by the mainstream press. Michael Sheen is very good as the Prime Minister and Mark Bazeley's snaky Campbell is utterly loathsome in his Machiovellian manoeuvrings.It was also gratifying to see Princess Diana presented in a more objective light. Her public image was much different from her real self. Those who knew her, and have written or commented about her, often say that Princess 'Di' was neurotic, manipulative and, some said, quite mad. There is a telling photograph of her near the end of the film that shows her looking side-wise at the camera with a really knowing and nasty look in her eye. She was no angel and it was about time someone had the guts to say it. Frears did this and for that he has risen in my estimation of his cinematic integrity.Helen Mirren is sensational as the Queen. I also liked the smug, cynical Cherie Blair of Helen McCrory whose home life centers around the kitchen table, with Cherie doing the cooking and Tony the washing-up; at odds with her liberated woman image. She reminded me of Mme. Krupskaya, Lenin's wife; full of ambition and slavish devotion, larded with henpecking pinpricks delivered with balls and impertinence.The only aspect of this film I did not like was the presentation of the Queen Mother as an alcoholic. She was not an alcoholic, though she, like countless millions of us, liked her cocktails. I thought the emphasis on her drinking was unworthy of the film-makers and certainly undeserved by the late Queen Mother. I have noticed other films involving her character, like 'The Cambridge Spies' also present her as a constantly tippling lush.It's a good film and provides a lot of unexpected food for thought without slamming a lot of anti-Royalist rubbish in your face. Something, then, to watch with great pleasure on occasion.",8,2,3,11 September 2009
Casino Royale," Predictable, Humorless and Boring travel log
","This latest version of Ian Fleming's novel 'Casino Royale' is the most over- rated, multi-million dollar snore I've ever seen. The charm, yes, charm of the old Bond movies with Sean Connery, still unrivaled in the role, was the tongue-in-cheek humor that is nowhere in evidence in this new version. This turkey is 2 hours of a James Bond who must really be Spider-man and Batman all rolled into one given his super-human feats of strength, agility and breath-control, coolly intoning one of the worst scripts I've sat through since Zardoz. The settings and women are gorgeous to be sure. Eva Green is an intriguing actress and I hope to see her again elsewhere, in a better movie, but she is here merely a mannequin for some great designer gowns and tip-top make-up and hairdos. The villain, LeChiffre, is played well by Mads Mikkelsen, but he hasn't much else to do other than look wicked and rub his bloody eye. He's no where close to the being in the league of classic villains like Dr No or Goldfinger and his big white cat.I did enjoy getting a glimpse of old Verushka at the gambling table, with no lines beyond those on her face. Giancarlo Giannini plays his part well-enough but his lines seem to be designed solely to inform the audience what is going on at the card table.Judi Dench, the female 'M', is good in the part but too little in evidence. And she certainly lives like a queen for a government official, a far cry from Control's austere digs in the LeCarré novels, which are much more authentic in their telling of spy stories. This film falls way short of the TV versions of 'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy' and 'Smiley's People.' But then, Fleming wasn't trying to be as serious as LeCarré. The producers of this 'Casino Royale' lost the plot completely when they chose to make this a relevant spy vs terrorist organization nail-biter.The music is mediocre but fills in the long, drawn-out boring chases with lots of noisy brass and screeching violins. The F/X look expensive and there must have been an army of stunt extras to keep the viewers awake with their leapings about and dodging of bullets.The whole film looked like a promo for a super computer action/thriller game for the 13 year olds with ADD.Daniel Craig is pretty good as Bond. He even gives hints at a sense of humor when the Swiss banker comes to transfer the money to Bond's bank account. The banker has funny teeth. Ha-ha. That's where the humor ends in this bomb.I'll take the old, corny but clever old Bond flicks from the 60s any day over this gilded, hair-ball of a flick.I give it 4 out of 10 simply for the production values. I enjoyed seeing bits of Venice and the Bahamas, sort-of.Skip it, if you haven't seen it. You aren't missing a thing.",4,2,4,1 December 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Errol Flynn meets JRR Tolkien
","This commentary on 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' is really a summary on the entire trilogy as filmed by Peter Jackson. This was a mighty effort on the part of Jackson's production team and it deserved all the awards it has received. The art direction, cinematography, costumes, music (especially the music by Howard Shore), the editing... every aspect of this monumental creation is not to be faulted, unless it be the screen writing, but even that is so expert that it would be unfair to single those people out for criticism. They have made an unfilmable book into an exciting and compelling experience, and it is clear that they love the original stories and did their best to be faithful to the spirit of Tolkien.But Tolkien's 'The Lord of the Rings' has been greatly altered to make it more cinematic. Many characters have been cut for the film version, the shape of the original story has been altered almost beyond recognition for people who have been long familiar with the books, as I have for over 40 years. Events have been added to make the movie more exciting and emotional. I am not a purist, however, and I don't mind that Jackson has made these extensive changes, adding modern psychological elements to the story line to justify these changes, but sometimes I wished he had perhaps taken a different, less battle-focused and sentimental approach to this epic tale.For instance, turning Arwen into a soap-opera-ish figure with her self-sacrificing devotion to Aragorn, appearing as a major character in all three films, was almost a betrayal of the original point of the drama. In Tolkien's book 'The Fellowship of the Ring' Arwen does not speak a single word. Nevertheless, Jackson and his co-writers make it work, and the love of Arwen and Aragorn does not slow down the action or become overly maudlin, out of keeping with the more cut and dryed story-telling of the books. I suppose the film-makers felt compelled to include the usual romantic interest which, to be quite frank, keeps these movies from attaining true greatness. This is formula screen-writing 101, but it's masterfully done within that context.Much dialogue has been invented, and much has been switched from character to character, from the books to film. I think too much emphasis has been put on the battle scenes, which are very long (in the uncut version) and almost boring, if they weren't so hair-raising and grippingly done. These movies were written as action-adventure epics and they succeed brilliantly in that respect. It is understandable that the melodrama had to be 'upped' to keep the audience from dozing off with too many council scenes and the like, but much subtlety is lost in the translation.The acting is mostly excellent. Best is Viggo Mortensen's complex and quietly virile performance of Aragorn, the lost King of the North, part elf, part man. He is partnered by strong performances from Orlando Bloom as Legolas, the wood elf, and most especially by the wonderful and very funny John Rhys-Davies as Gimli the dwarf. And casting Christopher Lee as Saruman was divine inspiration. And Andy Serkis is incredible, no other word for it, as Gollum.Cate Blanchett is perfectly cast as Galadriel, and Ian McKellen is a joy to watch as Gandalf. Mirando Otto Shines as the Valkyrie like Éowyn and Craig Parker makes much of the small role of Haldir, an elf from Lothlorién. The four Hobbits are good. Sean Astin is the most convincing little person, as Samwise Gamgee. Elijah Wood is oddly irritating as Frodo. There is something too smug about him, but Frodo is not the endearing creature his Uncle Bilbo (Ian Holm) is. Only Brad Dourif's Wormtongue seems out of place. His acting is straight out of Stella Adler's method classes and it jars.I don't think I will live to see this gargantuan tale filmed again so splendidly as Jackson has done. I can read the books when I need to experience Tolkien's Middle Earth.Not recommended for young children.",9,1,3,29 September 2009
Braveheart," A rare great film
","It isn't often that a masterpiece emerges on the silver screen and even less often that it is directed by an American, but happily Mel Gibson's 'Braveheart' is one of them.It's basically a rip-snorting yarn about factual events in 13th century Scotland. Along with the blood and guts, realistically but not obnoxiously nauseating, is a stirring story of integrity and love. What makes this bit of history so fascinating is to also know the story of Edward II, the Prince of Wales in this film, and his Queen, Isabelle, a princess of France who later took hold of the reigns during Edward II's feeble reign. Remember, he's the one who died by having a red-hot iron inserted in his rear-end. A fitting, if extreme, conclusion to his life. Marlowe's play presents Edward II as some kind of victim of a conspiracy, which is true up to a point, but he was also a very corrupt and irresponsible monarch who needed to be removed. Those were rough times indeed.The comparison between Tilda Swinton's Queen Isabelle in Jarman's film 'Edward II' and Sophie Morceau's Princess is telling. I was left thinking that she was a woman starved for love and affection in a court of ruthless betrayal and cold-heartedness. There is much food for thought of this nature in 'Braveheart.' Mel Gibson is superb as William Wallace, the great Scots hero who died horribly at the hands of English torturers. The supporting cast is equal to Gibson's intensity.This film was so good I didn't even notice the score or cinematography or editing... but all technical aspects are very fine. Maudlin sentimentality is also avoided; this film could have been a real wallow in lesser hands and would have lost a great deal of its impact as a result. The makers of more recent epics like 'Alexander' and 'Troy' could learn a much by studying Gibson's film. Those recent duds pale into insignificance by comparison with this spectacular film.Buy it!",10,3,5,13 June 2005
Gladiator," Historically inaccurate but entertaining
","This Roman extravaganza is fun to watch but bowderlized in typical 'Hollywood' fashion. The final scene in the Roman Coliseum is ridiculous and descends to the level of a Cecil B. De Mille circus. Aside from that the story is entertaining and the acting, generally, very good. Russell Crowe began his international film career with this movie and has gone from strength to strength in subsequent roles. An amazingly versatile actor, he holds the film together. The other strong performance is from the stunning looking Connie Nielsen's Lucilla, she is pure eye-candy. The two of them just about manage to blot out the miscast Joaquin Phoenix.Bit parts are cast from the usual suspects; Derek Jacobi's predictable performance as the ersatz I Claudius senator and Oliver Reed's slovenly and decadent Proximo. Worth a look-see but I got rid of the VHS I bought. The distortions of the truth about Emperor Comodus are just too much for this film to be taken seriously as an historical drama. It's blood and guts fantasy, nothing more.The technical aspects are excellent.",5,1,2,10 December 2004
Beetlejuice," I feel a little .... anxious
","It is probably redundant at this point, 21 years after the initial release of 'Beetlejuice', to proclaim its status as a modern comedy classic, but it IS. This is probably Tim Burton's most commercially successful film after the two 'Batman' movies, airing on the cable channels on a regular basis and still as fresh and funny as ever.I think the Hollywood money people are finally coming around to the fact that Burton has become a very bankable director, if they are willing to indulge him in the occasional outré production, like 'Mars Attacks!', for his loyal fans who long ago recognized a true 'auteur' (I don't like that word but...). Few directors have put their individual stamps on their films that are instantly recognizable; Hitchock, Bergman, von Trier, Herzog, Fellini, Tarnatino and some others, and now Tim Burton. In 50 years we will still be watching Burton films while many other current darlings of Hollywood will be forgotten.'Beetlejuice' might seem like a dark, ill-tempered story to those who haven't seen it, but it is one of Burton's most light-hearted creations, in spite of the fact that the lead characters are killed at the beginning of the movie and, like 'Topper Returns', appear as ghosts who are instrumental in changing earthly affairs for the still living.Michael Keaton is hilarious as the eponymous lead, supported by some great comedians at their best, notably Catherine O'Hara (what has happened to her?), Jeffrey Jones, Glenn Shadix and the late, great Sylvia Sidney as the chain-smoking, tough-nosed, abrasive-tongued spiritual guide.There is one unforgettably hilarious scene set at the dinner table and all the guests are possessed by Beetlejuice and sing 'Day-oh-dayayay-oh!' while being manipulated like marionettes around the table. The climax of this scene is classic.This film is highly recommended for all ages, even very young children will like it, though some of the facial f/x are a bit scary, and the scene in the heavenly waiting room, though screamingly funny, may not sit well with youngsters trying to go to sleep in a dark room afterwards. Depends on the kid, I suppose. Another Burton off-the-wall masterwork.",10,1,3,23 September 2009
