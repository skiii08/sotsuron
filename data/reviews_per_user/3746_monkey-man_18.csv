"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," A really great movie that i love
","The Chronicles of Narnia The Lion The Witch And The Wardrobe is a really great movie based on a really great book that i read when i was a child written by the great author C.s Lewis.The plot for this movie is about how in world war 2 children where send away into the country for there safety and four of these children Peter Pevensie,Susan Pevensie,Edmund Pevensie and Lucy Pevensie where sent to live with a Professer at his house.As the children where playing hide and seek they come across a large wardrobe and they went inside to discover the land of Narnia which is stuck in a permanent winter because of the evil White Whitch.And then the children join forces with the real king of Narnia a great lion called Aslan and with Aslan and his army they are going to over throw the Evil White Witch and her army and restore happiness to the people of Narina.The acting in this movie is great by the hole cast and i think that the four Children in this movie acted really well but the stand out performance in this movie is by the good actress Tilda Swint who plays the white witch and the good actor Liam Nelson voices the lion Aslan.The special effects in this movie are so great and the best scene in this movie was the huge battle scene near the end of the movie.Over all this movie is great and this movie is one of the best family movies of 2005.I really hope that the rest of the books in the series get made into movies and i highly recommend this movie to watch and buy on DVD and the made for TV Narnia movies are not as good as this movie but they are still worth a look.My rating for this movie is 8 out of 10.",8,0,1,5 January 2006
