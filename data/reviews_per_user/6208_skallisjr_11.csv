Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Animators' Delight
","This film is a good entertainment, with detective Eddie Valient suffering the slings and arrows of trying to solve a crime in a town where logic goes out the window. Although I don't consider it a family film, most of the stuff that likely might concern parents would probably go over the heads of the little children watching it.The film, though, is full of animators' in-jokes. Only someone with an historical perspective of cartoons is likely to get some of the throwaways sneaked into the film. For instance, at one point, Valiant is falling from a height in Toontown, and He's saved by being caught by a Toon woman. We first see her from the back, and we think that possibly she might be Jessica Rabbit. But then we see her face, which is Coyote ugly.Spoilers follow: That's a funny enough sight gag, but the capper is that her face was the winning entry in a contest run by the newspaper comic strip, Li'l Abner. In that strip, there was supposed to be a woman so ugly that her face was never shown. She was Lena the Hyena. Finally, the strip ran a contest to see who could come up with the best face for her, and the result, which I seem to recall, may have been drawn by Basil Wolverton, was what you saw on the screen.Another: near the close of the film, after the brick wall of the warehouse broke open, the first glimpse of the Toontown area we see shows trees and flowers swaying in the breeze. That view was from the first Disney color cartoon, Trees and Flowers. There are other cartoon tidbits scattered throughout the film, and they're fun to spot.A really good film for animation historians, as well as being entertaining.",8,6,7,20 August 2005
Alexander," A Kinder, Gentler Alexander
","Having seen the Richard Burton version of Alexander's biography, I waited for the 'Director's Cut' DVD/VHS release to see what the newer film did.On the plus side: Philip and Olympias. Philip was an alcoholic, and Olympias did dig snakes ('Keeping real snakes in the house of an alcoholic is not a good idea. It just complicates matters.' -- Will Cuppy). (Possible spoiler) That Olympias didn't seem to age could underscore her potential 'supernatural' reputation, as presented in the film.On the minus side: historic detail. Not only did we learn little of Alexander's military strategy (rather than seeming to know exactly what he was doing, we just see him as impulsive and headstrong). Further, prior to his battle with Darius, Alexander was overmatched in manpower by Darius, but Darius had troops up all night roaring defiance at the Macedonians to unnerve them. But that also exhausted his own men, leaving them to go into battle sleep-deprived. This was all overlooked in the film.The movie jumped around in time, and thus we're deprived of many of Alexander's conquests, such as Egypt (which explains, as the film doesn't really, how Ptolemy became Pharoah). As a general, Alexander was a military genius, and this isn't clear in the film.The epic of Alexander, as has been noted, included the fact that he could be as brutal as a velociraptor, but only his good side was shown. More's the pity; he was complex.Nonetheless, as historical fiction, the film entertains.",6,0,0,4 August 2005
Silent Hill," Disappointing
","My wife and I saw the film with no foreknowledge that it was based on a video game. And just as well: any film should stand on its own merits, not what it was derived from.The story, while not incoherent, was a tad illogical. A woman has a young daughter who sleepwalks and who mentions a town, Silent Hill, while in a trance. So the lady decides to take the obviously disturbed young girl to Silent Hill, despite that her husband doesn't think it's a good idea (to the point of canceling her credit card -- and how did she pay for the gas?). At a store, she asks the lady behind the counter about how to reach Silent Hill, and was given an evasive answer. So a lady cop approaches her outside the store, and asks if everything is okay. The mother doesn't ask her how to get to Silent Hill or anything like that, but takes off.For no known reason at the time, the cop follows her (and why not interrogate her at the store?) and after stopping, the mother gets away, reaching Silent Hill, but getting knocked out in the process. When she regains consciousness, she discovers her daughter is gone, and settles on the strategy of running through the streets of the town at random, calling for her daughter, who of course doesn't answer.Eventually, she's joined by the cop, and the two of them hunt inside deserted (?) buildings for the daughter, but with no coherent plan. They first encounter some sort of monster, but rather than regrouping and getting backup, the two press on.Eventually, they find some religious fanatics who take shelter in a church, and the mother 'goes underground' to reach the Demon. There, she's exposed to an Answer that's supposed to be Profound, and she returns to the church, not in time to save the lady cop, but in time to save the daughter, and to attack the fanatics (who are the real sinners, get it?) with killer barbed wire.Interesting CGI visuals, silly plot. I suppose if you're into the game, it means more, but for pure moviegoers, it leaves a lot to be desired.",4,2,4,23 August 2006
Die Hard 2," Beyond Belief for Pilots
","Having seen the first, we rented the second. As the film played, my wife noted I was mumbling under my breath and making spluttering sounds. For a film to be effective, it has to 'bring the viewer into it,' and to do this, it must be convincingly realistic. This one isn't.To pilots, this film is totally unbelievable. All airliners fly under Instrument Flight Rules, which means that they are in continual radio contact from the time they taxi before takeoff until after they've cleared the active runway at the destination airport. So presuming the tower at Dulles was taken over by terrorists and couldn't communicate, after a pilot tried to reach the tower (or more likely Approach Control), they'd merely switch back to en route control and advise them that they couldn't reach Dulles, and request to be vectored to another airport (with the snow conditions, Bermuda might have had a lot of visitors were that done).Well, let's say that all the airline captains aloft were simultaneously struck with the stupids and decided to orbit Dulles in a stack. Without direction from a controller, just how are they supposed to get into a safe stack, and without running into each other? More likely, they'd talk to each other on the tower frequency and decide to go elsewhere. (A previous reviewer pointed out that any aircraft on the field could be used to transmit The Message McClain was trying to get to the pilots, so there was no real problem.)The 'electronically lowering the glidepath' trick wouldn't work, either. If it could have been done, the pilot before landing would check the altimeter(s) in the aircraft and would notice the height discrepancies. Nobody's going to plan a flare below ground level.There's so much of that stuff in the picture that I was getting increasingly irritated as the film dragged on. Liked One and Three, but the errors are so glaring that I couldn't stand the thought of seeing it again.",5,4,9,19 March 2004
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Complement to the Book
","Those who read the books first may be disappointed in the film. Those who haven't may be puzzled by some of the plot. But reading the book first makes some of the action in the film more understandable.For starters: the dementor attack and what led up to it in the film came nowhere near what was in the book. More important, the aftermath of the attack just had the Dursleys learn that Harry apparently had been expelled from Hogwarts, and were absent to take Dudley to the hospital, never being told that Harry had to stay in the house when away from Hogwarts until his 17th birthday. Nor, to jump to the end of the film, did the Order members confront the Dursleys on how they were treating Harry.Naturally, a book as long as 'Order of the Phoenix' has to be truncated to squeeze the results into a 2.5-hour film. Yet some of the action would be just perplexing to those who haven't read the book. For example, it's been established that the vast majority of Hogwarts' students cannot see Thestrals, yet when Luna suggests that they can be used for transportation, there's no point of awkwardness (as in the book) where some of the students with Harry don't know how to mount invisible critters.A critical event in the Harry Potter saga was when Harry gets one of Snape's memories while he was studying Occulimancy; however, in the film, *why* he was studying the discipline was a tad vague.The basic thrust of the film plot is close enough to the book for transition to that of the book so that there can be a reasonable move to the next year's story ('Half-Blood Prince').Having said all of the above, the film is reasonably good in imagery. Visually, my favorite scene was Harry and the Order folk flying by broomstick to London and along the Thames after dark. I suspect the magical duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort was added for visual effect, but it was a little long.A nice view, but better viewed after reading the book.",8,1,1,13 December 2007
National Treasure," Good Fun
","This was an enjoyable film that I will add to my library. The Masons, Knights Templar, and the like, as guardians of secret treasures, has been in the literature for centuries, so it's a good foundation for a story.Young Benjamin wanting to become a knight was a nice touch, but apparently Grandpa didn't really explain much about knights when he 'knighted' the boy. A little more of that would have been nice.Possible spoilers: One thing about Benjamin was his unerring ability to figure out complex problems in seconds. He knows that his former 'partner' is going to steal the Declaration of Independence, so he figures out the only way to prevent that would be for him to steal it himself! Nothing wrong with that, but he hatches out the idea rapidly. He's portrayed as bright, but this ability is astonishing.No matter; everything is neatly packaged. A nice view.",8,1,1,9 May 2005
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Fine Effort, Mostly Pays Off
","There are well over 1,100 comments preceding thus one. Everything from praise to condemnation has already been voiced. So why another comment? Why not? The film isn't faithful to the text of the book, though it's fairly faithful to the spirit behind the book. As the opening of the Harry Potter saga, a lot of the film, as with the book, is introducing newcomers to the world of the young wizard. Meeting the characters -- Harrym Hagridm Ron, Hermione, and the like -- is important, and in the film, they're fairly well established. The whole magical world of Wizardkind is introduced, but shortcuts had to be made.Harry's flying sequences had to be trimmed, though his elation at being a natural flayers, and some of his Quidditch practice were excised, more's the pity. Likewise, Harry becoming Seeker was a secret in the book, but the talk of the school in the film.The fundamentals remain. The film is not the book, but it's close enough so that someone who's not roast the books first could be charmed by the film into starting to read them.",10,0,1,13 December 2008
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Disappointing Adaptation
","In the Harry Potter series, 'Goblet of Fire' was perhaps the pivotal book, leading to the more grownup aspects of the later stories. The film perhaps couldn't do that, but it didn't even try.The film starts at the International Quiddich Match, but the whole game was sidestepped, including the introduction of the Veelas, who were supposed to be stupefyingly beautiful ladies. In the book, Fleur was supposed to have a Veela in her ancestry, but that whole aspect was sidestepped in the film, leading to minor complications two books down.But in the film, the match wasn't even finished, so its whole purpose was to introduce an idea that was utilized later in the film.Then, the school year begins, and Harry finds himself an unexpected contender in the Twiwizard Tournament, a dangerous contest where the players -- ordinarily limited to one student per school -- vie for the cup/trophy that will, in one sense, transform their lives. There were two visiting schools, each of which had an entry into the tournament, and Hogwarts, which had its champion, and inexplicably, also Harry.Spoilers follow. The contenders have to face three trials, and for two of them deviate significantly from the book. Harry has to face a dragon, and in the book he uses extremely skillful flying on his broom to snatch the egg. In the film, he uses more luck than skill to outlast the dragon, with most of the action well outside the contending area, and some offscreen.Likewise with the underwater sequence. In the book, Harry (and Dumbledore) can communicate with the mer-people; in the film, little of that.The film has some entertaining sequences, but with the truncation of the story elements from the book, a lot is lost. Some of what's left becomes rather confusing if you're trying to follow the book series' grand scheme.",7,0,0,9 March 2006
War of the Worlds," Painful, But Dull
","War of the Worlds was, not counting the original novel, done three times: the radio broadcast, the 1953 film, and the current version. Both predecessors have fine moments, and this borrowed significantly from the 1953 film.In the broadcast, and the first film, Professor Forrester (Pierson in the radio version) was the major character, and he was a thinking man. In this film, there was no professor, and little thought. Everyman facing an Alien Menace would just run away, and in this film, so he did. That didn't help the story much, and made what plot was left pretty minimal.Some things were taken directly from the 1953 film. The alien TV camera on an extension from the spacecraft was in the 1953 film, and in this one, too -- even to the point of chopping it off with an axe. Yet since Everyman rather than the Brave Scientist was involved, he didn't get a clue about the aliens' weakness, or harvest the TV camera to study it.Much of the really good stuff from the 1953 film, such as the futility of modern weaponry against the aliens was missing from the film, save inferentially. It was even clearer in the radio show. Sure, the Big Alien Tripods looked menacing, but they were basically seen at a distance.When, in the 1953 film, looters stole the University's bus, that was more than an act of a mindless mob: it dashed the hopes of the scientists trying to fabricate a weapon. Here, someone in a mob just stole a car, putting our hero and his kids on foot.If you want to see a good War of the Worlds film, try the 1953 version. At least it had a discernible plot.",2,3,5,27 November 2005
Fantastic Four," Tepid Actioner
","This could have been a lot better, but it isn't butt ugly. I think that one aspect of the film that was overdone was the CGI, and suspect that the filmmakers subordinated the writing to the visuals.The story we know from the comics: people are in space and get hit by a storm of radiation. This affects them, and they become imbued with superpowers. Some of the film was them just getting used to their new powers. (Johnny storm hangs their titles on them in the film. In the comic books, each chose his or her own name.) The closest thing to an ordinary story is Ben Grimm's coping with his metamorphosis. And it was the most poignant part of the film.Victor von Doom, in the film, was also caught in the storm. He got 'scarred,' but the scar really was the manifestation of something more sinister: his own metamorphosis. As he learns of his powers, he decides to remove the competition, and develops a plot to take care of the Four, one by one.Major spoiler: Reed Richards was trying to construct a chamber where he could recreate the 'cosmic storm.' However, in the film it had previously been established that the radiation in question was 'unknown,' and the time before the storm was so short that there was no time to record all its characteristics, so how could Richards duplicate it in the chamber? The part about The Thing's 'cure' and what he did about it was reminiscent of Superman's 'de-supering' in Superman II, and how he got his powers back.The film was more show than substance, but it is watchable.",5,5,10,7 December 2005
Sin City," Not At All Bad
","I have never read Frank Miller's comics, so I came into this with an open mind .. a clean slate. The look and feel of the film was excellent, and the stories were more than gritty.That being said, there was one thing I found rather annoying.Major (if trivial) Spoiler: The film had a lot of voice-over narration, and the narrators, in two cases, died on screen. Admittedly, there's nothing wrong in doing this in a literary device that has been used for ages in books and short stories, but it seemed to me a bit out of place in the film context.Probably the highpoint of the stories was the Marv story, with a vengeance tale that just kept going. It's something of a pity that Marv's ultimate vengeance was displayed indirectly.This is not a film for everyone. But it's rather good for some.",7,0,1,19 August 2005
