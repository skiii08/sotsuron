The Avengers," A perfect summary of cinematographic clichés
","I honestly don't understand why such an endless parade of cinematographic clichés is being hailed as one of the best movies of all time. Evil villain trying to conquer the planet? Check. Hot clever chick in tight clothes? Check. Battle in Manhattan? Check. And I can go on, from dialogue, to set dressing, alien design, blockbuster action clichés... Nothing in this movie triggered me whatsoever, except maybe Robert Downey Jr.'s performance.Nice bubblegum-popcorn action flick for a rainy Sunday, and maybe something for comic book fans. For all other occasions: Yawn.",4,2,10,25 August 2012
American Pie," One of my favorites.
","American Pie is one of my favorite movies every, that is why I am so amazed when I read all the reviews here. I first saw this movie about a year ago, and have seen it about 10 times over again. The thing that spoke to me most was the excellent casting of all the actors and their interaction. They really looked like good friends who grew up together, and whole picture of them working their way through the end of High School was so familiar to me. I felt with those guys, and could image myself in the same spot. Added to that is a healthy dose of good humour (in its genre), making it a movie that amuses me over and over again.And please, do not say that you're grossed out by it, that's about the same as saying that you went to see Nightmare on Elm Street and got scared. This movie is MENT to gross people out, probably especially Americans, for whom sex is still a big taboo. I wasn't grossed out by a masturbation scene, of course not, the only thing one could see even were some boobs, and I've seen those before. The pie scene was, in my opinion, just funny because of its oddness, and because of the great acting of Jason Biggs and Eugene Levy.Yep, this is certainly one of my favorites, I can watch this thing over and over again, and still be amused. A big 10/10.",8,0,0,20 August 2001
