The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," 'Mockingjay Part 1 is still The Hunger Games movie that we know and love but by cutting it to 2 Part hurts the movie more than just another year of waiting'
","The Hunger Games is an undeniably successful franchise right now whatever you maybe like it or hate it , so here we are having a third movie already.Mockingjay is suppose to be the last final movie of the franchise like the book but the movie just can't help but to follow the hype train about cutting the last final part to 2 parts like Harry Potter or Twilight Saga and this time it's actually hurt the movie more than another year of waiting the Part 2 .First of all i have to say that Mockingjay Part 1 is not a bad movie at all it's still pretty decent but it's probably the worst part of all the three movie in the franchise , and i think because by cutting the movie to 2 parts it's hurt the movie by 1. the director Francis Lawrence can't tell the story freely because he have to spare a lot of stuff to the part 2 which makes his storytelling feels boring and too slow even though the script in this part 1 is not actually that interesting it's talk about the same thing we have been heard like hundred times like love , war , peace and it's not interesting at all .The second reason why cutting the movie to 2 parts hurt the movie is it's lack of moment that represent the unique story about the hunger games franchise , personally i think it is 'the game' yes the game about people goes to a play ground and start killing each other while the danger is all around and you can trust no one that part i think is the best thing about The Hunger Games especially in Catching Fire which director Francis Lawrence does a wonderful job but this time none of these emotion is in the movie because the movie have to spare that part to part 2 and force that story about war , love and rebel to us which makes it predictable and boring.In the end The Hunger Games : Mockingjay Part 1 is still a decent movie it's not bad at any means but when you compare it to others 2 movie in the franchise it is undeniable worst of all it's seems that by cutting it to 2 parts really hurt the movie.",6,17,33,20 November 2014
The Equalizer," The Equalizer for sure has it's own problem but it's just doesn't change the fact that it's just fun and entertaining all the time
","In my country (Thailand) it's pretty bad luck for The Equalizer to hit the Cinema when John Wick a very success action movie staring Keanu Reeves just came out last week because of that it's just make everyone compare The Equalizer to John Wick instantly and that's pretty unfortunate for The Equalizer.The problem that The Equalizer has but John Wick does not is John Wick is a Action movie that know it self really well , it doesn't try to be anything else other than an fully action kicking-ass movie but The Equalizer just trying and push the script and it's dramatic too hard despite the script is not actually that good or even that much interesting and with the slow style of storytelling by Antoine Fuqua the director of this movie it's just make it even worst because not only the plot is not interesting and you don't really care it that much the movie just force you to eat it anyway and very slowly too and that's make the first half of this movie fells boring.BUT... when the first half is actually over and Denzel Washington goes to kicking someone the movie just come back to the right track instantly , the action scene is pretty good and really entertaining but it's more like a close combat rather than shoot everything in John Wick but i personally like the action scene in The Equalizer more.Denzel Washington himself again really bad-ass in this movie with his cold brutal meaning style of acting makes this movie really fun to watch , there's also Chloe Grace Moretz in this movie she's pretty good in it but unfortunately the role she got just really not good enough so she's not that memorable as she should be but despite characters she doing pretty good in this movie.Overall The Equalizer is still a really fun bad-ass action movie staring Denzel Washington it has it's own problem for sure and a Huge problem too but that doesn't change the fact that the movie is fun and entertaining to watch a lot .",8,1,4,1 November 2014
Iron Man 3," It's good but not great
","Iron Man 3 is another Super Hero Movies from Marvel and it's in the 'Phase 2' So it's another setup for The Avengers 2 or maybe some others Marvel movies , so we've already saw 2 movies of Iron Man this is the third time (and lots of people thinks that this is a final one of Iron Man ) the question is , is it good ? Yeah it's pretty good The Things I Like : I just really liked the Action Scene in the Climax it's just so smooth and so connected even it's really fast action. The Second things that i liked is the story about Tony that after The Avengers he's just kind of damaged he's not the same and i really like that. There's some cool stuff and exciting scene in there too. Ben Kingsley OMG he's just did a great great job in acting.The Things I Don't Like : The villains is just so disappointed when i saw the trailer i just so exciting about this new villains calls 'Mandarin' but when it came out it's just so disappointed. And the story is a bit of predictable.And the last things i want to talk is about some story about villains i kind of a halfway of it , i mean i don't like it but i don't hate it too that things is about this ' Mandarin ' things i liked that they just caught people of guard and surprise the fans of Iron Man and they just turned this in to villains fakes things. But the others half i kind of a don't like it because when i saw the trailer i hope that i'll see this new villain that just beat Iron Man because now he's not 100% yet or something and he's seems powerful but instead they give me this. I kind of a halfway here again i don't know that this is bad idea ? maybe ? or maybe this is a good fresh idea ? yeah probably i mean it's up to you too.Overall i just liked the new Iron Man but i think the first one is a bit better IMO.",7,1,4,8 May 2013
John Wick," 'John Wick is a movie that know it self really well and don't try to be other things makes it fun and entertaining to watch all the time'
","After his role as Director and Actor in Man of Taichi and Actor in 47 Ronin which both are pretty bad Keanu Reeves are back to his greatest zone which is 'Action Movie' i can still remember picture of him as Neo in the matrix.The thing that makes John Wick stand-out from others Action movie is , it know itself really well it know that this movie will be an Action shoot everything and Keanu Reeves as a bad-ass characters , so it don't try to be other things like insert too much drama story and this make John Wick fun and entertaining to watch because it give the audience what they really want.Keanu Reeves himself is also really bad-ass in this movie , i think this role is perfect for him i can't think any others actor to play this role other than him , it's like this script and this role just wrote for him and him only , so i have to say after watched this movie Keanu Reeves is back guys he's official back to bad-ass now !!.Also another actor that i personally really like in this movie is Michael Nyqvist as a main villain after i saw him in Abduction and Mission Impossible : Ghost Protocol i have to say that this is by far his best performance as a main villain , he added so much to the characters making it interesting and fun to watch.There's also a lot of supporting cast and some are really cool like Adrianne Palicki , Williem Dafoe or even Ian Mcshane which is really cool and added so much more worth of your ticket price.Overall John Wick is a really fun action movie , it doesn't bring a great script or great story telling but it give us just what we want from action movie and don't try to be other things things , if you're a fan of action movie or Keanu Reeves just go and watch it you will not be disappointed .",7,9,24,23 October 2014
Fury," 'In the end Fury is just another WW2 movie that failed to deliver something new at all'
","Fury is a movie about World War 2 that has a lot of famous actor like Brad Pitt , Shia LaBeouf , Logan Lerman or Jon Bernthal and they're all in the same team together in the movie which makes it kind a interesting .David Ayer the director and writer in this movie doing one thing really good and that is the feel of the war , it's intense it's brutal it's about people killing each other and i have to give him the credit.He also directed the action scene pretty well even though it's just look fake and too much heroic but it's fun and entertaining.But other than that the movie just falls flat , the plot is just mediocre and predictable and the characters is just meh i mean the movie try to make us care about them but the problem is they're just a bunch of a-hole which makes it's hard for me to even liked them and the movie doesn't give enough time to tell their background which makes the characters even worst they fell bland and i didn't care them that much even though i have to say that Shia LaBeouf show really good performance in this movie.Overall Fury is just another WW2 movie that fun to watch but that's it you will not remember it in the end of the year because it's does nothing new at all and the characters and plot just too mediocre and bland to actually make us memorable.",6,8,19,25 October 2014
The Maze Runner," 'The Runner Without a Maze'
","Well another movie that based upon another best-selling novel , it seems that Hollywood are full of this kind of movie now days such as Beautiful Creatures , Mortal Instrument , I Am Number Four or even The Hunger Games .The Problem is yes some of this type of movie works but much more of it fails to deliver for example Beautiful Creatures that actually has an interesting idea but the way it tell the story is just not working when it on the screen and it's pretty much failed.I have to say that i haven't read the book before so this review will come from my experience entirely on the movie (Even though i know before go to see it that it actually has a sequel) .The Maze Runner is a movie that's actually has an interesting idea like others Bases upon Novel movies , It talks about Thomas who trapped in this Huge Maze and they has to find the way out of this Maze.So the idea of unique and complicated Maze is there but the problem with this movie is it's has a really bad mindset of which way it's going to go , it's like the movie know that it have to have another sequel so they focus and spend a lot of time to set-up the sequel and that's okay but the problem is when they focus too much and spend too much time on set-up the sequel , they actually forget to spend time in this movie as well which mean everything in this movie feel rush and half-ass instantly , everything just come and goes really quickly without you really knowing why and that's not only affect on the story telling it also affect everything in this movie.Such as the characters that feels rush and you just barely even know anyone at all you maybe remember 3 or 4 characters but that's actually it , meanwhile when other characters dies you will just like 'who the hell is that' and the main character Thomas even call their name which makes me think ' Exactly when did they even talk to each other ?' .Another Hugh Problem with this movie is the main reason behind all of this event that happen in the movie is just 'Absurd' i'm not sure when you read the book you maybe can understand and get that but when it actually on the movie it's just feels so over the top non-sense and when you top that up with rushing storytelling it become even worst.Even though the movie has a pretty good chasing/running scene that pretty exciting and the leading actor Dylan O'Brien doing pretty good job , it's just not enough to make up for really rushing storytelling that just ruined everything in the movie especially The Maze that feels nothing like a Maze it's has no complicated and mystery what so ever in the last 30 minutes of the movie you will even see the characters just walk in and out like shopping mall this is by far the most unforgiving thing in this movie , if your movie call 'The Maze Runner' make sure you make the Maze actually a Maze not just some hallway stuff that have no unique to each area and boring as much as possible.When i'm reviewing this it's actually announced that this movie will have at least another sequel coming 2015 and that's makes me concern , i have to say that The Maze Runner have a HUGE potential but it just failed really hard to deliver because of how much they rush the storytelling to set-up another sequel , i hope they will spend more time on next one and actually make it works or else it will fall to the same problem over and over again.",6,0,1,23 September 2014
Star Trek Into Darkness," I cannot asked more.
","Star Trek : Into Darkness is one of the lots of movies this year that i really really hope it to be good and when it came out it just more than good it's Excellent !I think the things that just makes Star Trek : Into Darkness shines is the characters everyone has a part of this movie and the story about main characters like Kirk or Spock are just so great and well-done executed.I have to talk about the villains of Star Trek : Into Darkness OMG this villains are just again so well-done executed he just full of violence and no hesitate to kill everybody but there's a reason why he doing this and the acting from Benedict Cumberbatch is just fantastic in one scene he just make you believe what he saying even he's a villains the last person you will believe in the movie.The script is amazing i liked how J.J. use it so wisely he just setup things a little bit there a little bit here and when it came out and smash in your face , you'll never see it coming .The CG is great everything just looks perfect and realistic (i mean in star trek world) and some scene it's just so amazing you just say 'WOW' Into Darkness is a bit of lack of adventure if you're looking forward to see the adventure go to no man has go before you'll disappointed.But overall everything is just so great well-done executed the story the characters is just so well-done and when it combine together it's just make Star Trek : Into Darkness just masterpiece .I cannot wait for new Star Trek movies or Star Wars Movies from J.J. Abrams in Star Trek : Into Darkness he just shows what he can do.",10,6,19,11 May 2013
The Babadook," 'The Babadook use elements of Horror movies to explain the Psychological of Human Perfectly'
","The Babadook is a Horror movie that really interested me from what i heard critics really love this movie and also it is a Australia movie so i really looking forward to see this movie.This movie is pretty amazing actually i think it's almost like Black Swan + Conjuring in someway it's a Horror movie that uses it's Horror elements to explain the Psychological of characters and that's make this movie really interesting all the time , it's not just a dumb horror movie that fills with stupid jump scare or some ghost that the movies doesn't even explain why.The Director and screen writer Jennifer Kent doing a amazing job her directing is really good and unique despite this is her first really huge movie , her screen writer skills and script is really interesting it's mirror the problem in the social really well , i think the fact that she is a female makes her directing and screen writing more unique because the way her telling the story and the story itself is really really fells like a feminist movie in a lot of ways.The 2 main actor/actress are also pretty good , Essie Davis she is pretty amazing playing a role that i think it's pretty hard but playing so well that it's just really work or Noah Wiseman who play as a son in the movie i think he's good but sometimes his acting is kind of annoying i know his characters has to be that way but sometimes it's just too much.Overall The Babadook is by far the number 1 Horror movie of this year and i think it's really hard to find another Horror movies to dethrone The Babadook because it's use it's Horror Elements really really well like no others Horror movies can do.",9,13,30,12 October 2014
Interstellar," 'Interstellar is undeniable beautiful movie with interesting story about space but without it the movie start to fall apart'
","This movie probably has a lot of hype around it and it probably deserve it too because the director is Christopher Nolan ( The Dark Knight , Momento ) and he's probably one of the most innovative director of the main stream cinema right now.Interstellar is a beautiful movie i can't say otherwise at all with it's space CG and cinematography it's a really good looking movie with a lot of theory about space , time and black hole to find the way to help our world that dying in the future.The soundtrack of the movie by Hans Zimmer is still really good and when combine his soundtrack to the beautiful CG of the movie make it's so exciting and fun movie to watch .But honestly when you remove that CG and soundtrack out of the movie it start to fall apart because it's own script and theme is still pretty predictable and kind of a repetitive to i mean the story about 'save the world' and have to go out to space isn't that kind of a remind you of a lot of movie for example Armageddon , 2001 Space odyssey etc. ? i mean i like it's idea about family and love is the main idea but the problem is the movie just doesn't do enough job to make me care about the characters that much especially female characters in this movie which treated like the emotional out of reason sex which is kind of a not fair .Overall Interstellar is a movie that stun you with it's visual , emotional and theory about space but when you actually see through all of it's visual to it's core script and main idea it's still predictable and repetitive , is it fun movie ? yes Is it a good movie ? yes but is it the best movie of Christopher Nolan and the best movie of this year ? i have to say no.",7,1,4,9 November 2014
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Mission Success
","Honestly action movie these days is so hard to find an actual good one especially the one that already exist , i'm talking about movie like A Good Day To Die Hard that totally garbage.yet somehow someway Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation manage to maintain it's fun and unique action scene with Tom Cruise still being bad-ass with addition of new cool characters .The script is okay it's not that great pretty linear and predictable but it's still fun movie even though main bad guy is kind a terrible , this is a movie that you should watch not only action movie fan but all of the movie fan.",7,1,4,8 August 2015
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Good but not Great
","Hey it's X-Men again !! Days of Future Past has a lots of great stuff like cool action scene , great actors/actress and really great characters but the movie suffers a lot at script because it's really just an 'Okay' with over-the top non sense and bad explanation of time travelling stuff , this doesn't even count a bit of cliché and repetitive in the movie .another thing is the movie has no memorable moment what so ever , in X- men : First Class even now i still can remember the memorable moment in that movie like the really awesome scene with Magneto stopping a missiles but Days of Future Past doesn't have that moment , i mean it's not bad but just doesn't memorable or can put a 'WOW' at your face at all.Overall it's a bit disappointment from the First Class but still a worth to watch.",7,3,5,30 May 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," The Grand Budapest Hotel is the greatest hotel ever.
","The Grand Budapest Hotel is a movie directed by Wes Anderson who is a really extraordinary director for sure and this movie have a lots of actors / actress and when i say a lot i mean it , There is so much actors and actress in this movie such as Tilda Swinton , Bill Murray , Tom Wilkinson , Jeff Goldblum , Harvel Keitel and a lot more but the really main actor or actress in the movie is actually Ralph Fiennes , Saoirse Ronan and Tony Revolori but don't mind the screen time for your favorite actors or actress just go for it , everyone in this movie is pretty awesome and really great in it.I have to say that this movie have a really really great Production Design they doing such a perfect job on it , every single piece in the movie are all really well crafted and you can see every detail on every scene in the movie which is really impressive.Director Wes Anderson in this movie also does a really really great job with amazing camera movement and unique storytelling that just blow my minds with this art style from him , even though the movie falls off a bit in plot which is kind of a cliché , repetitive and not much to say but when it combines with Wes Anderson work and really amazing production design you just doesn't notice the bad stuff at all because you're enjoying it so much .In the end The Grand Budapest Hotel is a must see movie for sure with really awesome and great actors and actress all around combine with amazing works from director Wes Anderson and stunning Production Design makes this movie really one of the most ( if not the most ) memorable movie of this year for sure .",9,3,7,9 June 2014
22 Jump Street," Example of Really Great Sequel Movie.
","'22 Jump Street is a great example of movie that know it self very well and not trying to be something else , it's over-the top and ridiculous but that's all we want from this movie isn't that true ?'22 Jump Street is the sequel to 21 Jump Street two years ago and it comes with pretty much the same plot and screenplay but changing a few things , you can tell that they kind of in the 'Play Safe' Mode but the few thing they changed just work really well with the movie and i have to say that i rather have the sequel the fells almost the same as the first movie instead of something new and it's just completely sucks like a lot of sequel movies.The thing that make this movie more fun and memorable is how it make fun of it self for the fact that this is a 'sequel' movie and these jokes are really creative and really fun to watch , also Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum still works really well together their chemistry is just too great which i have to give a credit to them.The thing that i really liked about 22 Jump Street is it's just don't try to be something else it is a comedy movie with a lot of over-the top and ridiculous scene but who cares ? because that's exactly what makes this movie funny and memorable , it's not trying to be the smartest movie ever , it's not trying to be the best script ever , it's not trying anything , the movie just be itself be that over-the top stupid and ridiculous like teenager and that's what make this movie unique and satisfying and with that i have to give credit to both director Phil Lord and Chris Miller for knowing exactly what it is and what we want.Overall 22 Jump Street is a really good sequel it's funny and memorable but also fill with hearth and soul , it's not trying to be Oscar nominee but it's just be it self and that's what we really want in the end. If you love 21 Jump Street you will love 22 Jump Street also , so go check it out i recommend this movie !! [ B+ ]",8,3,9,27 August 2014
Big Hero 6," 'Big Hero 6 is a movie that combine America Super Hero with Japanese Culture but that doesn't help it self from the repetitive and predictable plot'
","Big Hero 6 is the newest animation movie from Disney who last year successfully with Frozen in Box office and Award and this year Disney tries to do the same with Big Hero 6.This movie is really interesting for sure with it's America Super Hero Element which you can say that it's really similar to Marvel (and Marvel is now own by Disney so....) and the movie combine that with Japanese element and makes it's interesting.And that's not a coincident at all because a lot of stuff in the movie is screaming this Culture fusion like the town is name 'SanfranTokyo' or Kabuki mask that the bad guy in this movie use.The problem is even that culture fusion , it's doesn't help the movie from it's repetitive and predictable script which i think is really a problem of Superheroes movies now days and Big Hero 6 offers nothing new at all.Fortunately the animation part of Disney really help the movie from it's repetitive with it's stunning Visual Design , The movement of characters and that light-heart family theme from Disney which makes the movie enjoy to watch.Overall Big Hero 6 is another good animation movie from Disney but don't expect anything new because you will find nothing here.",7,4,20,6 December 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," Guardian of the Galaxy is just another Marvel movie you expected it to be , it's explosive and fun but nothing new to deliver
","So Guardian of the Galaxy is another Marvel movies that try to introduce us to the new dimension new aspect of Marvel Universe and characters.If you expected it to be explosive and just beautiful CG everywhere you'll get it but the problem for me is almost everything in this movie is just so repetitive the characters that just almost one-dimensional black and white , the plot that just offers nothing new at all even if you don't see this movie , i'm sure you probably can expected how it going to end and the villain is just terrible he just doing nothing the entire movie.I think the director of this movie James Gunn is just trying too hard to make jokes and makes the movie fun to watch like he threw jokes almost every 5 second but the problem is a lot of them is not funny and the amount of jokes in this movie is just too much and it's annoying me.I mean i don't expect a Oscar worthy screen writing from Marvel movies but i think James Gunn he's just not experience enough to hold the entire movie by himself , everything in this movie is just fell mediocre the plot , the characters even the action scene.In the end Guardian of the Galaxy is a pretty mediocre movie it's offers nothing new but if you want to have some fun then go for it !",6,3,11,2 August 2014
Jurassic World," 'Jurassic World is the ultimate Hollywood popcorn movie, it's loud it's dumb and stupid but a lot of fun.'
","If someone mention the name of movie they have a bond with i think one in hundred will probably say Jurassic Park and sure i mean who can denied the magic that movie has , so there's go Jurassic World another sequel trying capture that elements of magic again.The problem is it just failed pretty hard in almost every single element , one thing that they really doing fantastic is the CGI and production design it's amazing , it's stunning.But that's it everything else of Jurassic World is just falling apart in to pieces from boring cliché and stupid character that sometimes can be annoying to really force the 'Family Bond' theme in to your mouth and that screenplay oh god... i mean it's like they borrow script from movie Dinocroc or something it's just really terrible , i mean it's okay in that B grade low-production value movie BUT not in the $150 million dollars budget movie and definitely not in 'Jurassic' movies.Off course Jurassic World can be fun and for sure you will probably have a good time with it but because of it's 'Monsters Fight' scene not because it's magic elements that Jurassic Park has , this is for sure a fun popcorn movie to watch but not the 'Jurassic' movie we hope it could be not even with Chris Pratt .",6,7,17,16 June 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Cheap Snack
","Here we are really near to the 'Phase 3' of Marvel movies that leads to Infinity War in 2018 and 2019I have to say that i really love the first Avenger movie because not only it's fun but it's also fill with amazing characters.With that said though Avengers 2 is not like that , actually it's worse than the first Avengers.Why ? because almost everything in this sequel is just exactly the same , the plot , the conflict or the characters , yes it's still fun popcorn movie to watch with great action scene BUT right now we are in the 'Avengers 2' we should have more than just great action scene or mediocre characters or super cliché conflict.and The worst part of the movie itself is it Villain 'Ultron' he is just terrible trying so hard to be this super bad guy but not only he's super cliché but the movie just hype him to be this bad-ass character too much when what we saw now is that he's just another bad guy that just complain about everything and doing nothing , he could possibly be okay in stand-alone movie like Iron Man 4 but not in the Avengers , This is not even count the fact that Ultron in comic is actually really really powerful character while in the movie he fells boring and lackluster.Overall Avengers: Age of Ultron fells mediocre at best everything is just exactly the same and sometimes even worse than the first Avengers or even Captain American: Winter Soldier a lot of thing fells like Marvel just keeping good stuff out of us too much for this 'Infinity War' movies than will hit us in 2018 that is like 3 years from now and if this happen again and again i will probably be bored before this Infinity War movie happen.",6,3,8,3 May 2015
Beauty and the Beast," The Trade-off that's not worth it
","When i was a kid Beauty and the Beast (1991) is one of my most favorite animated films of all time (followed by Mulan and Toy Story 2) so there's no denying that this review is going to be a little bias.Why is that ? you might asked, it's because this Beauty and the Beast basically try to do exactly what the animated version do like literally almost copy and pasted frame by frame and this became the most negative things about this Live Action version even though it adds a few backstory here and there (which i appreciated) the part where it's exactly the same lacks the emotion or authenticity like 1991 version did.A lot of iconic scene came out kind a bland because it can't go crazy like the animated film did instead it just move there in a frame called 'Beauty and the Beast 1991 version' in a way that there's so few room left to actually breathe (or dare i say they too scared to actually do something new?), sure production design is so beautiful sometimes even more than the original but when the emotion is not there at all it's pointless.one thing that i really need to gave credit to is Luke Evans like wow he's really really great as Gaston, honestly he's one of the best thing about this version.If we judge Beauty and the Beast ( 2017 ) by it's own without comparing it to the original movie it's a pretty good movie but still i think that's impossible because in the end it's a remake, and few of new backstory is not worth to trade with emotion and authenticity than the original has.",6,1,4,22 March 2017
Edge of Tomorrow," Edge of Tomorrow is like a fast food sci-fi movie , it's delicious but worthless.
","Edge of Tomorrow is another Action / Sci-Fi movie with Tom Cruise starring in it this movie i have to say that it's really fun and entertaining with really great action scene that compose by really really great camera angle , the director Doug Liman really know how to make a fun and thrilling action scene for sure .'Live Die Repeat' is actually quite accurate of this movie it's storytelling by uses of these Live Die Repeat thing is really fun and keep you interesting all the time and all of the actors / actress like Tom Cruise , Emily Blunt are giving us really good performance here but my favorite one is Bill Paxton for sure he's just bad-ass all the time .but again the movie have a lots of problem for sure first of all the plot / script when you remove those recycle live die repeat stuff out of it , it's actually just straight forward plot , Point A to Point B and these Live Die Repeat stuff the reason behind it , is just really too convenient without giving us much reason to believe why this and those happens.The Second thing the really wrong with this movie is characterization. it's just really copy/past straight forward cookie cutter characters that you can see in pretty much every action movies and the thing that make it worse is the movie spend time a lot on the 'recycle Live Die Repeat' stuff and forgot to telling us about these characters more and in the end it's just make these characters boring and uninteresting.and when your movie have a really uninteresting characters it's just makes those scene that you suppose to care about these characters doesn't work at all , you will just like 'whatever' because you don't care about them at all .In the end Edge of Tomorrow is a fun and entertaining movie but it's falls off a lot on plot and script , especially characterization that just really really bad which is really unfortunate.",6,1,8,5 June 2014

","This is probably the best if not the Best film of 2014 for my personally. It's a movie that keep it's simple plot but use it in very subtle way to avoid the cliché and repetitive.Not only that Whiplash is a movie that i have so much fun , with it's intense scene between Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons characters makes this movie an explosive fun to watch.Also i have to say that i'm kind of a surprise the performance by Miles Teller last time i saw him on screen is in Divergent movie which he's not memorable at all but in this movie he's doing really good job and prove himself a bit too .BUT the real star of this movie is J.K. Simmons his performance is so amazing and stunning all the time he just control the movie in his own hand and i will be surprise if his name is not in a contender list in Oscar this year.In the end Whiplash is a Blast to watch with it's subtle script , explosive fun scene between Miles Teller and J.K Simmons and a amazing performance by J.K.

","It's seems like the actor / actress changing to director hype train is so real right now for example Ben Affleck with his Argo , Angelina Jolie with her Unbroken and now The Water Diviner directed by Russell Crowe.Even though Russell Crowe gave us an good or great performance as an actor but his directing is so much different as day and night , it's seems like he doesn't know the proper or the correct way to tell the story and make it interesting since the way of his storytelling now is so out dated feels empty and lack of creativity which is the worst thing that can happen when you're the director.To add more sad thing about this movie is how much i got interest in the story and theme of the movie , this is a pretty much another Anti-War movie with it's story about War between country that cost the life of father mother or even brother , the story it self is so much interesting but the problem is like i said earlier Russell Crowe doesn't know how to tell the story properly so a lot of scene that should be dramatic that should be memorable end up feels empty and boring with is a shame since the story is so good.In the end The Water Diviner is not a good movie but it's not completely terrible it has it moment with great screenplay but the movie start to fall apart since the beginning of the movie because how bad Russell Crowe is in directing , this is another wasted potential movie which make me sad.",5,13,35,25 January 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Return of The King ?
","Well i think this is gonna be kind a weird that i gave The Force Awakens only 7 out of 10 but please hear my perspective.Okay i must admit i'm not really a Star Wars fan (or Star Trek neither if you wonder) i'm just a movie maniac but i must admit Star Wars is a special franchise it's not only the franchise that huge amount of people love but it's the franchise that inspire a lot of movies today.So after i take that out of the way let's go the my thoughts of The Force Awakens i think it's a pretty good movie but great or perfect ? not reallyThe bright site is this is probably exactly what Star Wars fan wants not only the return of franchise they love but the return of something big something Epic and J.J. Abrams definitely delivers that he proof once again that he's such a visionary director his creativity and storytelling is just so good not only that the movie epic but he just doing such a perfect job of introducing new character to the universe and make those character so interesting , without a doubt J.J. Abrams brings the old Star Wars fan know and love back and fill it with a new exciting energy like a Phoenix that came back from ashesNow here's come the dark site The Force Awakens is not perfect it's a flaws and a huge one too and that's the villain the bad guy the dark power or whatever you want to call them, while the new hero character introduce really well and so much interesting the new 'bad guy' is pretty bland repetitive and predictable which is kind a weird since J.J. latest work Star Trek Into Darkness has such an amazing villain The thing is this part hurts, not only it makes the movie kind a less interesting since the bad guy is kind a boring and predictable it's just makes a HUGE and i mean HUGE surprise not memorable as it should be which is kind a shame since this plot twisted part should really just blow me out of the window but instead i saw it coming from a mile away (especially if you always read news about future Star Wars movie from Disney)One of the main reason why the villain in The Force Awakens is in this state is because of it's actual script it's just so repetitive almost everything you saw have been done before and because of Disney plan of Future Star Wars sequel it's hurts even more since they can't really go too far in this film and that's make everything seems so simple so repetitive there's no real interesting conflict it's just Light vs Dark , Good vs Evil once again and that's like kind a let down consider J.J. Abrams is a director But in the end Star Wars: The Force Awakens still a fun popcorn movie it's a movie that you will feel like 30 minutes more than 2 hours + it's fun it's entertaining it's kind a worth your movie ticket price but unfortunately it's only do that, it's never really challenge or offer something new and that's make The Force Awakens not as memorable as it should be.",7,3,11,19 December 2015
Kingsman: The Secret Service," 'Kingsman : The Secret Service is not a perfect action movie or deliver something new , but for sure it delivers a lot of fun '
","After a disaster start of Hollywood action movie of the past couple months for example Jupiter Ascending , Taken 3 or Blackhat , we're hoping that the director Matthew Vaughn who brought us a lot of great movies like Stardust , Kick-Ass or X- Men : First Class will come to change this bad flow of Hollywood Action movie .First thing first , this movie is pretty fun to watch and i love the decision of Matthew Vaughn to embrace that 'Over the Top' of this movie and make the movie out kind of a mix between brutal bloody action scene and the black comedy stuff which makes this movie pretty unique.One other things that need to be talk is the Action Scene , it is really great and it proof that Matthew Vaughn can really directed the action scene well with his beautiful camera angle , camera movement and the flow of his characters movement just feels so alive that make the action scene always feels really cool.But i have to say that Kingsman : The Secret Service is not a perfect movie , with it's plot is pretty repetitive and predictable.The Characters them selves is also pretty repetitive and kind a boring with the same back story that has been used for like 100 times already , for example the mentor who wants to redeem his sin in the pass by taken the new crew , the bad guys that sees the human evil and try to 'safe the world' in his way , the stepfather who always do bad things try to harm to the hero and his mom , a kid who lose something in the past and has to redeem himself and so on , these characters are so repetitive and also not set- up well enough to make me care about them that much.I also like the point of the movie that tries to satire the politics , class of society and Global Warming problems , unfortunately these point of the movie has not been dig deep enough to make it memorable or make me feels like these point of the movie are actually really really big deal in the real world , which is kind of a shame.Overall Kingsman : The Secret Service is not a perfect movie by any mean , it still have a repetitive plot , repetitive boring characters and sometimes the bad set-up of story by Matthew Vaughn , But even then it is still a fun movie to watch especially with it's amazing action scene and over the top black comedy style.",6,1,10,15 February 2015
Minions," Forever Minions
","Honestly the real and main reason why the studio (Universal) decided to make this movie at all is because how popular Minions is , they just everywhere know from toys to even some ride in Universal Amusement Park.For me personally i'm okay with that , i mean i'm a big fan of these little yellow guy since the first Despicable Me in 2010 but overall i have to say that Minions is not a bad movie but it's also could be a lot better especially comparison to the first two Despicable Me that a lot better than thisfirst off the script it's horrible super cookie cutter cliché boring script that you pretty much getting tired of it , it's super predictable , lack imagination or any real story driven it's like they just search 'how to write a movie script' in google and just do it exactly that.Another thing that kind a let me down is the other main character in this movie besides minions and that is Scarlett Overkill voice by Sandra Bullock , she's awful really just another cookie cutter part of this movie , the character itself is boring repetitive predictable and not even likable at all she's just doing her bad stuff without any real background to it even though they try to force her terrible background in to our mouth but it's just terrible storytelling.BUT but even though a lot of part in this movie is a let down , one thing that Minions fans should at least feel safe going into this movie is for sure the minions itself ,they're still cute funny and likable character the same character we know and love from the previous Despicable Me , so if you going to this movie just for this reason and you're a big minions fan there's no reason why you should not see this movie but other than that it's just another cliché mediocre movie that pass the test but never at the top of the class.",6,4,7,11 July 2015
Warcraft," Fan Service ?
","Warcraft is probably one of the most well know game of all time and one that actually has a huge influence on gaming community to date, with that in mind there's no doubt that this is the movie that fans has been waiting to see for years and years and one that hopefully will break the curse of 'movie based from video games are bad' .first off, i want to clarify things and talk about the real quality of the movie without that gaming fan (which i am) in mind, Warcraft is not a bad movie but it is no doubt has a lot and lot of trouble especially with it's scale, Warcraft is a HUGE game there's tons and tons of things to talk about but this is not a game it's a movie which mean you have a limited amount of time to tell story and get things right with precision.Unfortunately Warcraft just want to do too much stuff without thinking how much resource they have and that makes everything feels rush because they want to fill as many characters as possible while progressing the story and with out real time to just sit and talk about background of all these characters it's just a mess, in the end i feel disconnect from the character and the story itself which is the worst thing you can possibly do.With that reason i can see why a lot of critics and audience who don't know about the game and didn't care about the game didn't like Warcraft because honestly it's just a mess and lots of things go wrong, i don't want to pinpoint the main reason here but maybe this Huge scale of movie (like lord of the rings scale) didn't fit with director Duncan Jones who did a amazing job at Moon (2009) and Source Code (2011) but the scale of these 3 movie is just too much to handle.Now for the gamer and fans point of view Warcraft is actually a pretty good experience just seeing your favorite characters, world or story in the movie makes you want to shed a tear or something it's just so beautiful and with fans that already know a lot of backstory of these characters these story they will have no problem understand what's going on in the movie at all which is something that a lot of people will have a problem with.In the end Warcraft is probably a middle-ground movie it's not a bad one but it's not good either it's a movie that depends a lot on your knowledge your nostalgia your love a lot to understand or even like it, gamer and fans will probably love the movie while others will scratching their head and wonder what's going on in the movie, i can't denied that Warcraft has a lot of miss-step even i'm a fans of the franchise but i still want to see it more, so if you're a fans you should watch it support the movie, if you're not a fan then maybe give it a try but keep in mind that you should not expect much from it.",6,4,16,29 May 2016
Furious 7," Furious and Fast
","Fast and Furious is seems to be one of those Franchise who still fun to watch even though it have so much sequel already ( i mean this is the 7 installment of this franchise so...)This is another almost mindless fun dump movie to watch for sure with the over the top action , racing scene like driving a car jumping from one building to another building i mean it's for sure really dump and the characters should be dead like a hundreds time already but in the end is it fun ? YES totally .One thing to mention though is the characters in this movie , as you might know that Paul Walker passed away while the film is not 100 percent complete , so this makes me want to know how they going to handle his character , and in the end i must say they handle really well and this is probably the perfect ending of his characters.Overall this is still the Fast and Furious we know and love about with all of these fun popcorn action scene and the bond between characters makes this movie worth the money to watch.",7,0,12,7 April 2015
