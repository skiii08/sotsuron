Black Swan," The Meshuge Swan
","The old chestnut about having to experience life before being able to be a true artist is rehashed in the case of a psychotic ballerina. Trouble is, beautiful Natalie Portman, the actress portraying this ballerina is no great dancer, and therefore the dance sequences are being filmed either in a now-you-see-her-upper-body closeup, with her arms executing over and over the same ballet-101 gesture, or in a now- you-see someone's feet closeup, or finally now-from a greater distance-you-see-a ballerina in a pas-de-deux. It makes for clumsy filming and we get too much of it. Add to this that her male dancing partner lacks the good looks one expects of the Prince in 'Swan Lake,' and then, he turns out to be a klutz to boot. All the characters come in two one-dimensional variants, which might as well carry tags of 'I am good' and 'I am evil.' True, this reproach could also be leveled at the scenario of that superb ballet, 'Swan Lake,' but then most people watch it for story told by Tchaikovsky's music, and not for its silly scenario by Begichev and Geltser (you can look this up in Wikipedia, like I did, for if you are honest, you will have to admit that, like me, you have never heard of either of them). The ballet is rescued by Tchaikovsky, but no, even remotely comparable, genius rescues this silly movie. The horror of the hallucination scenes has been done to much more effect by Roman Polanski in 'Repulsion.'To my mind, the only thing that could save this movie would be a remake as a Woody Allen comedy under the title 'The Meshuge Swan'",4,18,47,4 December 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," everybody is at sea in this movie
","In this movie special effects don't only run amok, they even swim amok, but they are unimaginative, copied from other movies, and frankly . boring. Boring is also Johnny Depp's performance. He obviously has been instructed to cut out the sexual ambiguity he overdid in the first installment of the Pirates series, and beyond that his acting ability seems to be on the limited side.For a Caribbean movie it is .maybe appropriate if the actors seem to be at sea. Orlando Bloom certainly does. One has the feeling that they forgot to tell him who his love interest was supposed to be, and in his confusion he shared what little erotic interest he could muster for someone other than himself, between Keira Knightley, and Johnny Depp. The story is of the type where every scene is lifted from some work old enough for its copyright to have expired: 'The Flying Dutchman,' 'Captain Cook,' the Road movies of Crosby and Hope, etc.. The only good thing about this movie is the performance of Naomie Harris in the small but important role of the seer Tia Dalma. It is intense, refreshingly alive amidst the general boredom, and yes, spellbinding, a clear Oscar candidate.",3,3,6,8 July 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," A Kafka of the Silver Screen
","Guided by his unmatched imagination, and masterfully using the German language as his tool, the thirty-two year old Franz Kafka has written 'Metamorphosis', one of the deepest and most absorbing tales of world literature, devoted to a description of the artist's position in bourgeois society. Guided by a seemingly no less spectacular imagination, and a thorough mastery of modern cinematographic techniques, the forty-two year old Mexican director Guillermo del Toro has given us a magnificent, rich and multi-layered movie about the horrors of the Spanish Civil war.Exposed to these horrors without any protection, a young girl tries to cope, by creating a parallel fiction-world of her own, in which she has a degree of control over the magical happenings. Like in all fairy tales, she is subjected to difficult 'tests', while during the civil war the Spanish nation as a whole endures difficult 'trials'. The director cuts back and forth seamlessly between these two worlds, and while the spectator is under the impression of watching two stories unfold, one 'real', the other fictional, they are more or less the same story, and in this very original manner, Mr. del Toro, with supreme artistry, paints a picture that, more fully than one would have thought possible, captures the finest nuances of human suffering.In spite of the horrors they depict, the special effects during the fantasy sequences are of a rare artistry and conjure up images of Francisco de Goya's masterpiece 'Saturn Devouring One of His Children', and somewhat surprisingly of the great American photographer Joel-Peter Witkin's 'Feast of Fools.'At a deeper level, this movie manages to add a new insight into the fundamental and by now well-explored topic of the relationship between reality and fiction. In 'El Laberinto del Fauno' reality and fiction are not each other's reflections, or extensions, but rather together they give an understanding that neither history nor art by itself could come close to conveying.",9,2,5,18 February 2007
Avatar," How to guard against the dinosaur's big teeth in 3-D
","Having liked 'Titanic,' I walked in to an IMAX theater to see 'Avatar' hoping James Cameron will show us what a real feature-film director can do with 3-D technology, as opposed to all those documentary film makers having big fish swimming in water or having dinosaurs making little children cry by baring their plentiful sharp teeth at them. When, at show's end I walked out of the IMAX, I had the bad feeling that either 3-D may not be good for anything more than having teethy dinosaurs scare the daylights out of the kiddies, or a more talented director is needed to heed the third dimension's call.Beyond its dinosaurs and colorful jumbo-birds, this movie has not much more to offer. Some may say that the floating rocks are an imaginative idea, but that idea has already been thought up half a century ago by the great Belgian painter René Magritte in his very famous 'Le Château des Pyrénées.' There can be no doubt that James Cameron is familiar with this painting, since his floating rocks happen to have the same shape as Magritte's, the only difference being that Magritte's rock is barren and supports a castle, whereas the 'Avatar' rocks are covered with vegetation, and the folks living around them have yet to come up with the idea of a building.There are chase scenes galore in this film, and the kiddies will be frightened, alright. Given all the 'Star Wars' paraphernalia on show in 'Avatar' a more appropriate title would have been 'Tree Wars.' But then 'Star Wars' had a marvelous sense of humor, which is totally lacking in 'Avatar.' After a little theological editing, its silly politics could make 'Avatar' a hit among believers in a great Satan.",2,21,60,18 December 2009
