The Rock," ***1/2
","I'm sick to death of action movies with chase scenes, big guns, weapons of mass destruction, and huge bodycounts.  But this movie has all of those things.  So why did I enjoy it so much?  Because the director Michael Bay managed to take all those elements that make up an action movie and polish them to a gleaming shine.When I watch this movie, I get a sense of excitement that is rarely found in movies today.  There are lots of movies out there with just as much, if not more action than 'The Rock'.  But for some reason, 'The Rock' is by far more exciting and entertaining than all those other action flicks.  And the villain is great.  He's bad but not too bad.  I hate it when I see a villain who so evil, that you almost know what his next move is going to be.  If you know what he's gonna do, where's the suspense?I also like Sean Connery and Nicholas Cage as a team.  They make an interesting combo.  We have a nerd who specializes in chemicals who is a major wuss and then in the end is a hero, and then we have a hardass who is also a genius who gets a little soft by the end.  They could fight crime!!It also has its funny moments.  Every movie needs a funny moment.  If it doesn't, the movie will get boring, because there is no break from the violence and action.  A movie sometimes needs a little humor to break the ice.In the end, this movie is near the top of my list.  It has a serious plotline and is very exciting during the action scenes, but is also a lot of fun when things calm down.  It's one of my favourites.  We'll probably never see a movie with as much excitement ever again.  Oh well.  Looks like it's back to old family vacation videos.",10,1,1,23 October 1998
Alien: Resurrection," Enough Already!!!!!
","When I went to go and see this movie, I had very high expectations.  But I left the theatre feeling a little misinformed.  I'll be blunt about this movie: It sucks!  I mean, who in the right mind would go see this movie twice?  I hope Sigourney Weaver is kicking herself right now.  'Aliens' is by far the best movie I have ever seen in my entire life!  It's the best! But this just spoils it.  The acting stinks, the aliens stink, the plot line stinks, even the action is missing.  What I find odd, is that so many people die in the movie, but yet, there is hardly any action at all!  And I ask you, where have we seen creatures grown in a lab, put in a cage, and then they escape and go on a rampage before?  Don't think too hard!  You might hurt your brain and end up like the writers for this movie!",Null,1,1,18 September 1998
Armageddon," When your ears stop ringing, listen up.
","It gets pretty sad when a movie is bad-mouthed because it has bad acting. Don't get me wrong, I hate bad actors, and if you've read my other reviews, you'll see that I talk a lot about crappy actors.  But those are for movies where good acting is required for the situation to be believable. 'Armageddon' is a movie that does not require good acting.  Michael Bay never said that the movie would have Academy Award winning acting in the movie.  He said it would be an action packed thrill ride.And it was.  The movie was very good, because it kept the action going straight to the end.  It didn't matter if the acting sucked.  But I have to be accurate about this movie:  The acting was half-decent.  I mean, whenever I see bad acting, I almost always laugh.  I never once laughed during this movie, except when the script required me to.  The acting is pretty good. Bruce Willis is not my favourite actor, after all, some of his movies have shown his 'bad actor' side.  But he does a decent job in this movie along with the rest of the cast.And finally, I will say this.  The last 10 minutes of the movie disturb me. They are horrifyingly sad!!  The last 10 minutes of 'Titanic', were nothing compared to this.  I swear, I almost cried!!  It was so depressing, I was tight-lipped for the first few minutes after I left the theatre.  That's amazing.  A movie starring Bruce Willis is sadder than 'Titanic'.Although I should tell you:  I'm speaking hypothetically.  I didn't find 'Titanic' sad.  In fact I laughed!  But I know many people cried their eyes out in that movie.  So if I didn't find 'Titanic' sad, and millions of other people did, and then I found 'Armageddon' sad, what does that tell you? That 'Armageddon' is one hell of a sad movie.So if you're one of those 'Go see an action flick, just 'cause it's an action flick' kind of guys, go see this movie.  If you enjoy good acting, decent story and stuff like that, go see this movie.  If you want to cry your eyes out at the end, go see this movie.  I do, however recommend you bring ear plugs for some scenes.  (It gets a little loud!)",10,1,1,23 October 1998
Aliens," Yeah baby, it rocks!
","What can someone say about this movie?  It rocks is all I can say!  I love it!  It's a great movie in every way: storyline, characters, and especially action and suspense!  James Cameron outdid himself with this movie.  I only wish I could have seen it on the big screen in a dark theatre, because from what I have heard, 'Aliens' was the most horrifying movie of 1986.  Instead I saw it for the first time on T.V. and they had commercials every 15 minutes, and I still enjoyed it!  This movie has all the action and suspense of all of James Cameron's films put together.  And that includes 'Titanic'. And when the action starts, it doesn't stop for an hour and a half! The adrenaline rush you get from this movie is so big, you feel like you're there with the charactors of the movie.  It is a great thriller.  If you haven't seen it yet, see it NOW!!",10,1,2,18 September 1998
The Exorcist," Great
","I'll make the major point of this movie brief: it takes forever to get into the story.  You see, for the first 30-45 minutes of the movie, nothing interesting happens.  It consists of the characters standing around and looking at each other.  But when the movie finally gets going, (and I emphasize the word 'finally'), you find out it was worth the wait.  'The Exorcist' while not being all that scary in the 90's, is still a great movie.  I enjoyed this movie very much despite the boring beginning.  The last 15 minutes of the movie are the best.  The scene with the priests performing the exorcism is very haunting. I enjoyed this movie mainly because it is original, and it has still manages to scare me in some scenes, even though it is from the 70's. I don't know if everyone will enjoy this movie, but your chances are 50/50.  Give it a chance.",Null,0,0,18 September 1998
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," meh
","What a pile of ****!!!  This is one of the worst sequels I have ever seen!!! Why would Speilberg do this?  The first film was fantastic.  I loved it.  I really looked forward to the sequel. Then when I saw it, I was destupified!!!! (look it up).  There really is nothing different than the first one.  Except a higher bodycount and action sequences that are simply there to be action sequences.  One thing that I hate with some movies is how they kill off meaningless characters.  Why would you do this?  To get the bodycount higher that's why?And I'm sorry, but a T-Rex loose in San Diego?  It just doesn't work.  This is the worst way to end an already bad movie.But you know what, a critic's mind is a terrible thing to waste, so I'm not going to waste it on this movie.",Null,0,2,16 October 1998
Titanic," It kind of stinks!
","Well, what can I say about 'Titanic'.  It certainly does deserve some credit for it's special effects, action scenes and realism.  But it spends too much time with Leo and Kate drooling over each other.  I got bored! Even during the drawing scene I found myself saying, 'Oh just hit the damned iceberg an get it over with!'  If James Cameron spent less time on the love story, it might have been more enjoyable.  But I'm not saying everyone will find the movie boring, just the people who don't like romance and kissing will be bored to tears for the first hour and a half.",Null,2,3,12 September 1998
Scream 2," Zzzzzzzzzzzz...
","The saddest thing to see happen to a great movie is to see a lousy sequel. The first 'Scream' movie was great.  I loved it mostly because the whole time I was watching it I was guessing who the killer was and when I found out, I was saying, 'See, I guessed it was him near the beginning!'  But the sequel... I mean I was guessing, but there were so many to guess from it got boring.  The number of suspects went down as the body count went up.  And then when I found out who the killer was, it was someone that I didn't even care about.  My friend said to me, 'Ha, you never guessed him!'  How was I supposed to.  But this sequel just didn't do what the first one did.  It wasn't any fun to watch.  It relied too much on dead bodies and 'boo' shots to be any good. 'Boo' shots are when the killer jumps out, says 'Boo' and runs away.  I think Wes Craven should stop now before it's too late.",4,2,5,26 September 1998
Platoon," ****- 4 stars!
","This is the best movie of all time.  It's just fantastic!  It's sad that the majority of the cast haven't gone on to be successful actors, but they can at least look back at this film and smile.  Why do some people hate this movie?  Because of the disturbing village scene? I don't understand why anyone can not like this movie.  I think it's at least 10 times better than 'Saving Private Ryan', and the best movie ever made to this day. It shows the emotional traumas of the war like no other movie ever has, the battle scenes are horrific, the characters are believable, and there is never has a dull moment.  This movie rules and is the best film of all time!!!!    **** / ****",10,1,1,5 December 1999
Scream," Yeehaw!
","When I saw 'Scream', I was expecting a real horror movie.  After all, I had heard that this was a very scary movie from people who had seen it before me.  But, I wasn't hardly scared at all.  I don't know why.  Maybe it's because after living with my parents for the last 15 years, everything else seems a lot tamer.  But like I said with 'Halloween', just because it wasn't scary doesn't mean I didn't like it.  The movie made me laugh more than it made me scream.  It's hilarious but not because it's lame.  It's not lame at all!  It's funny because the movie makes fun out of other slasher films. Even in the middle of the climax, I was laughing my ass off because Stu had started crying about how his parents were gonna kill him.  This movie is awesome.  It's just as entertaining as 'Halloween'. See it if you haven't already.",9,0,0,26 September 1998
Halloween," A Classic!
","Where do I begin?  Well, when most people hear about a slasher movie, they think, 'Oh that's just a movie about a bunch of horny teenagers running around getting their heads cut off!'  Well guess where people got that idea? This is a tough one folks so think before you answer!!  'Halloween' set the standard for slasher movies, and since it's success, has been copied so many times I run out of fingers.  But unlike it's sadly delinquent offspring, 'Halloween' is actually worth watching.  I enjoyed it very much.  I don't know why.  I didn't find it all that scary, (although the closet scene was rather tense).  But I guess just because it's a horror, doesn't mean you have to be scared to enjoy it.I guess the reason I enjoyed it was because the way it was filmed creates a mood, and while I watched it, I had a feeling of what the characters were going through as good old Michael Myers 'calmly' hacks his way through doorways and windows and the sort.You'll notice I put the word 'calmly' in parenthesis.  I think it's neat how Michael just walks instead of runs after his victims.  I sat down and thought about why he would do this.  Is he 'Transportationly' challenged?  I finally came to the conclusion that he just doesn't care.  If he catches them and kills them, great!  If he doesn't, he feels that there will always be someone else to slash.  Maybe they'll be in the shower!  You never know. Anyway, to make a long story short, if you haven't seen this movie yet, see it NOW!",10,0,0,2 October 1998
Halloween," Not Bad
","I heard all this talk about 'Halloween', and how it is the best horror movie ever made, second to 'Psycho', so I decided to rent it.  I must say, I wasn't that scared.  I'm sorry, but I was a little disappointed when it came to how scary it was.  But I should keep in mind that I'm living in the 90's and a horror movie from the 70's will probably be tame by now.  But, just because I didn't find it scary, doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it. I thought it was a great movie.  And, well, the part where Jamie Lee Curtis is in the closet did kind of get me going.  So, even though it didn't scare me, I enjoyed it very much, and I think everyone else will too.",10,0,0,18 September 1998
Jurassic Park," GiddyUp!
","Well, I've never seen a movie like this before!  Monsters, or in this case Dinosaurs, are locked up in cages, they escape and go on a rampage.  No, we've never seen that before!That statement was a statement of sarcasm.  This kind of plot has been done so many times, I'm surprised lawsuits haven't been thrown out.  But even though we've seen this kind of plot before, 'Jurassic Park' is still at least half decent.  I saw it for the first time when I was 10.  And at that age, a movie like this will terrify a young child to the bones, and this one did just that.  The scene in the kitchen with the raptors was horribly tense.  I can't think of a time I've been more scared. But now that I'm older, and a little more mature, it's hard to find a movie that will scare me like that ever again.  And that's a little sad, because I like it when a movie scares me.  It shows that the people who made the movie did a good job.  But aside from the fact that I was scared, I also enjoyed it very much.  The dinosaurs looked real, some of the acting was pretty good, which in my opinion is important for any movie.In the end, this movie is one of my favourites.  And even though that kitchen scene doesn't scare me anymore, I will never forget how it scared me the first time.  However, if you want a movie that will create the same tension, only make it last longer, see 'Aliens'.  It will terrify you. Believe me.  But if you haven't seen 'Jurassic Park', I'd like to ask you where the hell you've been the last 6 years?",Null,0,1,10 October 1998
