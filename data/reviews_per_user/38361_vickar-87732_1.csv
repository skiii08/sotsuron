Ford v Ferrari," Not bad.
",I like cars. So therefore I now I liked the movie more than I would have if I wasn't a car person. It was quiet good. Not amazing. They forgot Ferrari after the beginning in the movie then they suddenly were in the movie againin the end.Spoiler: When Ken crashed the Ford GT at the test track and the car exploded it was extremely unrealistic that he got out completely fine with no burns. Nobody would survive that.,7,0,1,5 January 2020
