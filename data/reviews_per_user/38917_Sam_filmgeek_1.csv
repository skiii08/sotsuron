Hereditary," I wish this movie did more
",This movie isn't as good as the trailer. I kept thinking there was going to be a grand twist or something more than what it put forward. It ends with kind of a whimper. It's just this kind of awkward horror movie that doesn't do anything with the premise or the general title of the film. Though the effects were nice and the performances were strong.,5,3,7,18 June 2018
