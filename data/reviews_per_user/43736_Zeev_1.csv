Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," If you like Star Wars you will love this movie
","Before I start let me say this. If you like Star Wars, you will love the Phantom Menace. If you did not like the first 3  Star Wars movies don't see this movie.  Or if you do relax and enjoy the moment! The whole hype about this movie probably has tainted your view on the movie.  THE MOVIE HAS BEEN OVER HYPED. I enjoyed the 2+ hours watching the movie. Not once did I look at my watch wondering how long the movie was.  The visual effects were spectacular.  Lucas has stepped up the notch for computer animation.  A few times I had to remind myself that the character where computer animated! I can't wait for the next two movies and see what George Lucas comes up with!",9,0,0,21 May 1999
