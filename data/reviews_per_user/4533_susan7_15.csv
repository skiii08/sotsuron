Casablanca," The Perfect Movie
","Thousands of words have been written about this film by amateur and professional alike, but none are adequate; none do it justice.  There is only one thing that can be said about 'Casablanca' -- it is the most perfect movie ever made.",10,0,0,24 December 2000
Star Trek," I Find This Movie To Be Offensive
","I know it's been several years since this movie was released, but I've just now gotten around to watching it, and I must say that I found the movie to be offensive, because it ignores established TOS history. This is the kind of nonsense that drove the fans away and destroyed what was once a multi-billion dollar franchise. I can't fault the actors for this. It's the writers I object to for creating an alternate timeline without laying any proper foundation for it. And then again, who is gonna believe 20th century motorcycles in the late 23rd century, or creating a Spock with a love interest or killing off his mother. And then there's the matter of Spock marooning a fellow officer on an ice ball out of anger. The list goes on and on.I realize that the writers and producers won't care about what I think. Afterall, I'm just a crazy Trekkie, but at least I have had the pleasure of saying how much I abhor this film. I will not buy the DVD; I will not recommend the movie. The only reason I give it 3-stars is because, while the story line was anything but Star Trek, the acting was credible, and I have nothing against those who were just playing the roles handed to them. Beyond that, this movie is nothing more than a cheap knock-off of what was once a very good franchise.",3,5,8,14 February 2012
Gettysburg," A magnificent and sobering movie about the realities of war
","War is not fun.  War is deadly and painful.  This is a movie that dramatically brings that point home.  More than 50,000 men died at Gettysburg.  The awesomeness of that number hits the viewer head-on in this well done movie, and the emotion raised by that fact will surprise you as you suddenly grasp the magnitude of what actually took place.  You cannot watch this movie and come away untouched by it.Filmed just a few miles from the actual battlefield sites at Gettysburg, more than 5,000 re-enacters were enlisted to ensure the historic accuracy of the costumes, and to try to convey the magnitude of the numbers of men engaged in this horrific battle.  The actual number of troops present numbered somewhere closer to 150-179 thousand, taken altogether, though not all were actually engaged.You know from the moment the opening credits start to roll off your screen that this is going to be a powerful film experience.  The musical score alone will take you to heights seldom experienced in the Hollywood of today. It's too bad I'll never see this one on the large screen.  What a magnificent experience that would be.",10,0,0,28 April 2001
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Forget it.
","Dumb!  Really dumb.  The whole thing, from the base commander to Strangelove to the Russian Ambassador.  I can't believe this is in the top 250, let alone as high as #11.  Is there no one here who can think?  Tell me, please, what is there in this movie that makes it good?  I'd really like to know. It's not the music.  It's not the character development.  It's not the story.  It's not the comic relief.  My God, it's not even the absurdity of the whole thing.  And while the picture of Slim Pickens riding the bomb might be mildly amusing, surely everyone didn't vote this move so high just for that.  Or did they?  Hummmm.",2,20,56,18 July 2002
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The End of a Saga
","Believable up to the point of the speed bikes in the woods. Then it really fell apart with the band of teddy bears. That was the beginning of the end of Star Wars for me. Come on. Teddy Bears fighting imperial storm troopers? Effectively too. Give me a break. I've never before seen anything that was so transparently for the marketing of toys.It is, perhaps, unfortunate that with the end of the Emperor and the end of Vader we will never know how the Empire was reorganized or even if it fell apart completely and was replaced with a new form of government. Unfortunate too is the fact that we will never know whether the Jedi ever regained a place of prominence or not.",7,0,2,27 July 2009
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Not So Great, But Better Than SW I
","Some people try to excuse this childness of SW 1 and II by claiming that the original trilogy was enjoyed by kids. So What!? It was enjoyed by adult as well, and it was the adults that became the real fans. If Lucas would have stuck to his original format, this would have been a much more satisfying film.In a desperate attempt to save money, I guess, Lucas produced a whole army of cartoon robots in a misnamed movie that should have been called Attack of the Robots, not clones. The only clone of a living being in this movie was Jango Fett's son Boba.All of this is surrounded by an ineffective love story between two people of different ages. One would think that with at least ten years (and maybe more) between them, you would see that difference clearly in Amidala's overall appearance compared to that of Anakin. It does tell me something about Anakin's youth, however.Also, too much line stealing from the first trilogy. I can live with the rebellious teenager at this point, though it seems border line believable from one who is to become a Jedi. Maybe I'm just expecting such individuals to be more studious at this point.",5,0,1,27 July 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Incredible!
","Wonderful.  Marvelous.  As fans of the trilogy, we can find fault all day long.  That's because it's easy to criticize, but let us remember that the movie medium has limitations that an author of a book does not have to deal with.  Before being too harsh, we should ask ourselves if the deficiencies are of any consequence?  Is the movie a good representation of the author's intent?  Certainly character development is limited in this medium.  But to do more than was done would result in the film being criticized for being too long, or for moving too slow.  We expect a certain amount of this from a good book, but a movie can not be done that way.  It is my view that, as measured against what has been achieved, that which was left out of the movie pales into insignificance.  This is the best film adaptation of a complex story that I have ever seen.  If the 2nd and 3rd installments are as well done as the first, this will be a great addition to anyone's DVD collection.  Something to be treasured.A 10 all the way.",10,2,2,23 August 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," A good adventure, but could have been much better than it is.
","I was somewhat disappointed in The Two Towers.  I felt that the editing was a little choppy resulting in a lack of transition between some scenes.  I hope the extended edition of the DVD will correct this.And while I can allow for the introduction of certain scenes not found in the Trilogy to maintain the love interest angle, I can see no need to introduce a story line that simply doesn't exist in Tolkien's work. 
The principal example is this: in Tolkien, the elves never showed up at Helm's Deep, and the captain of the elves, Haldir, while he did an exceptional job of dying in the movie, did not die in the battle at Helm's Deep.  The introduction of that into the movie served no useful purpose that I can see.  I could have lived without it, and Peter Jackson should have lived without it.Another example is when Aragorn went off the cliff during the battle with the Wolf Riders. It can be inferred from Tolkien that a fight with the Wolf Riders could have occurred, because the text is clear about the fact that some skirmishes did occur on the way to Helm's Deep.  But Tolkien goes out of his way to indicate that the encounters were minor. They were of the 'hit-n-run' variety.  Still, I can live with the movie presentation.  But Aragorn did not go off that cliff; he did not float down stream; and he did not reappear.  That part of the movie can only serve as a possible introduction to a second love interest, and a conflict in Aragorn's mind over his future.  If that was the intent, it was poorly done.But my major complaint with this movie is the shabby treatment given to Faramir.  He was an honorable man in Tolkien.  He was able to do what his brother was not able to do.  He knew the Ring of Power was within his grasp, but he never saw it.  Indeed, he did not want to see it.  And he let Frodo go.  He did not drag him off to present him as a gift, and Frodo never stood on that wall and faced the Ringwraith.  Putting this into the movie was an unjustified modification of Tolkien's work.  It served no purpose other than to add perhaps 5 minutes to the running time of the flick.  That is a poor excuse for doing such a hatchet job on a man's work.  Unforgivable!All of this leaves me with some doubt about how Jackson will handle Part III of the Trilogy.  Does he have the nerve to do it right and do it completely? We shall see.Mr. Jackson, you have an unprecedented opportunity here.  Please don't waste it.  This could be YOUR magnum opus.",7,0,2,10 September 2003
Mission: Impossible," In a word - Disgusting!
","The overall story line is worthy of the original series, but the way it is implemented is offensive to those of us who grew up with the T.V. series. The characters shouldn't have been used that way. I can not forgive that. Only someone completely lacking in common sense, or a complete egomaniac, would have pulled a stunt like that. Any redeeming value the film might have had is lost under the impact of the extreme lack of sensitivity.Oh yes, there is one scene that I remember, not because of the action, but because of the total absurdity of it. Care to guess which one that was? Yep - the big tunnel scene. I've seen a lot of movie scenes that asked me to stretch my imagination pretty far, or even suspend my capacity for reason altogether, but never before have I been insulted like this. The setting of the film and the property itself demands that the events and the action be at least plausible. That, too, was tossed aside by Tom Cruise.What a waste.",5,4,9,13 July 2004
Where Eagles Dare," Riveting Action Film
","If you like James Bond, then you'll like 'Where Eagles Dare.'  Actually, this movie is somewhat better than the average Jame Bond movie.  And I love James Bond.  You always know where you stand with Bond.  Spectacular scenery in far away places; a car chase; and some pretty ladies to decorate the sound stage.  There's a good guy and a bad guy.  The good guy is gonna win, and the bad guy is gonna lose.  All that is known up front, before the movie starts.  Nothing to think about; nothing to ponder; nothing to worry about. Just good entertainment.  The interesting part is how it all unfolds.We have a similar formula here.  There are some changes of course.  A little more espionage, and a plot twist here and there, and of course the violence of the Eastwood Western.  Add it all up, and you have 'Where Eagles Dare.' All that changes is the time period, the setting, and the suit.The violence in this movie is a little less mindless than it is in most films being made today, and there is no useless swearing and cursing.  What a pleasant change of pace from many films where the producer and/or directory haven't got enough confidence in their product to sell it without offensive language.  It is true that the plot in this movie is somewhat farfetched, but so are the plots of most movies.  And if you can't deal with an indestructible superhero, then perhaps you should stay away from the movies and be content to play with your rubber duckie.",10,2,3,16 September 2003
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Good Technology, but Character Development Doesn't Hold Up
","I would give examples, but I don't believe in putting spoilers in reviews, so don't look for them here. This review gives only my personal impressions of what I saw on the screen.The visual effects of this movie are spectacular. The use of CGI was awesome. The technology has advanced rapidly from where is was just a few short years ago. The musical score was very good. The acting was great in some places and weak in others. The story line? That's another matter.The basic idea of showing how a man falls from grace into evil is a good one. Certainly we all wanted to know how Darth Vader came to be after we watched Episode IV, 'A New Hope.' And after a fashion, George Lucas has delivered the answer.But the answer isn't logical. The story breaks down. The reason for Anakin Skywalker's turn to the Dark Side just doesn't hold up. I've watched the movie several times now; I've even gone back and re-watched Episode II: Attack of the Clones to try to put the current movie into context, and I still come away with the same feeling. The character development of Anakin isn't believable - not even when I factor in his youth, his love for Padme, his raging hormones, his inexperience in dealing with his emotions, and the manipulation of the Emperor.The young often think they know everything better than those who are older and have more experience, and they make some big mistakes as a result. Sometimes tragic ones. But I don't personally know of, nor have I ever heard of or read of, a case where an individual was so easily driven to such a pure and all consuming hate as was Anakin Skywalker. Over time, it is conceivable a person could fall that far, but not after only a few sentences of conversation with the one person he had sworn to rid the galaxy of. I might have rated this film 2 or 3 stars higher, but for this failure.All of that said, the film is full of action, and some of the best sword-fight scenes ever put on film. In fact, there is so much high drama and fast action that it is difficult to now go back and watch the original movies with their light hearted approach to life.",6,1,1,8 December 2005
Tombstone," An OK flick
","Good entertainment.  Reasonably true to the main historical fact, but not very true to the details.  I mean really, is there anyone out there who can honestly believe that Wyatt Earp stood in the rain crying?  Certainly not in front of the entire town?  And the character of 'Doc' Holliday was stretched to the max, as was the character of Johnny Ringo.  Indeed, the historical Ringo is barely a blip mentioned in passing in the period literature and the history books of the time.  But I admit, it makes a good story, and it brings home the bacon.  Just don't believe to much of it.",7,0,1,6 April 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Stunning! Breathtaking! Brilliant!
","Peter Jackson has not done an exact representation of Tolkien's' work.  That will always remain as impossible as it is to force an apple tree to grow an orange.  Some things were left out that could have been put in the movie(s). And some things were put in that in my opinion should have been left out.  I was disappointed that in The Return of the King the story line of Faramir and Eowyn was not pursed.  And I was VERY disappointed that  Peter Jackson did not deal with Saruman in the theatrical version.  I felt that this was unfair to Tolkien, to the actor Christopher Lee, and to the viewer, who was left with the fate of a major character in the films unaccounted for. Indeed, I see this as nothing less than a transparent ploy to force the viewer to buy the Extended DVD Version when it becomes available.  Shame on you Mr. Jackson.  We would have bought it without you having to resort to the use of a cheap conjurer's trick.As for The Scouring of The Shire - I am disappointed that it was not filmed, though the truth be told, I see why it was not shot.  The movie holds its own quite well without it.  The power of The Return of The King as it was presented would have made The Scouring appear to be the longest and most boring ending to a movie I can imagine.  At the very least, we would have had to cut out the Gray Havens as well and put them both into a shortened fourth movie, along with such things as the recover of Bill the horse, and frankly, that just doesn't sound like a movie people would pay to sit through. As I sit here just thinking about it, I can almost hear the howls of the purists and the general public alike.  Still, I can not help but think that had The Scouring been filmed, at least the footage would have been available for a follow-on short feature on a separate DVD.  It is something of a minor tragedy that no footage of this part of Tolkien's work was shot.Yet despite these omissions, I must rate The Return of the King a solid 10, no question about it.  And may I say, 'Thank you , Mr. Jackson.  Thank you.'There are those who are so troubled by the fact that every word that Tolkien wrote isn't in this film that they can not see what is there.  These people say that despite all that Peter Jackson has done, The Lord of the Rings has still not been done in film.  Oh how very sorry I feel for these poor, wretched souls.  So lost are they in their bitter and abusive criticism that they will never be able to appreciate the stunning, breathtaking brilliance of Peter Jackson's achievement.  Guys, set aside your sanctimonious points of view and come smell the roses.  Despite its failings, the movie HAS been done.As for the series as a whole, I regret that I must give it rating of 9.  It would have been a 10, but I too am subject to the illness of not letting go of some of the failings in Peter Jackson's work.  Peter, you should have done right by Faramir.",10,0,2,30 July 2004
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," That's One For The Good Guys
","Good clean fun. This movie didn't ask you to think about any deep and weighty subject matter. It was good vs. evil almost literally in black and white. And when you left the theater, you didn't have to digest what you had just seen. To top it off, it reached out and grabbed you in the opening scenes with a fantastic shot of two ships in space doing battle. Even the bar scene was believably because the weird characters were not computer generated. They were played by real people in costume, and the viewer knew it and could live with that.It was clear at the end that Darth Vader had escaped the destruction of the Death Star, but it was unclear how the small, one-man fighter he was in could have traveled far enough on its own to be rescued.",9,1,1,27 July 2009
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Star Wars
","Totally believable, action/adventure flick, except maybe for the worm in the asteroid and the Imperial Walkers. But what the heck -- you can't have everything. Besides, those Walkers were just another form of tank, and we all understand tanks.Even the city in the sky was believable for the simple reason that once inside, it looked like any other city we may have seen, and it appeared to function like any other city. I think I developed a crush on Billy Dee Williams. What the movie lacked was the WOW of the first movie. But that's understandable.",8,0,1,27 July 2009
