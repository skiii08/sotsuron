Resident Evil: Afterlife," Full of ridiculous clichés
","Full of ridiculous clichés, very bad story. Visually acceptable, made essentially for 3D.",3,0,3,26 February 2020
Dark City," The film has some interest, but...
","The film has some interest, as there is mystery and strangeness about what is going on with the story. The environment is also well accomplished with a mixture of eras, particularly from the 40s and 50s, but with the city looking like something like London. in the industrial revolution and always at night. There is a certain steampunk style always present.However, there are some things that don't flow very well in the film. The tics of the aliens are a little goofy and the part of the final confrontation is weak, looking like a poorly made and overacting Dragonball scene. There are a number of cartoonish things throughout the film that affect you.",5,0,2,24 February 2020
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," ridiculous clichés
","Full of ridiculous clichés, very bad history. Visually acceptable.",3,0,4,26 February 2020
The Happening," Terrible
","Terrible. Although the idea has interest the story is basic and the performances are horrible and worthy of a SyFi movie despite the good actors that participate. The characters either express themselves as dumb or goofy in a comedy film. Despite being an apocalyptic film, sometimes it touches comedy in the most inappropriate situations, which is not enough to understand if it was intentional or simply incompetence and loss of notion of those involved in the film.",4,0,2,26 February 2020
Mother!," artistic work for internal consumption
","The film is an allegory about God, Mother Nature and the Earth and the destruction that man and religion, with the frequent absences of God, causes on Earth and in nature. The Poet is God, the wife the Nature, the House the Earth and the Baby represents Jesus or the Prophets. Visually the film is spectacular, the action is intriguing, strange, very uncomfortable and often visually violent. If I had seen the film as a teenager I would have devoured it for all the allegories and critical, cynical and sarcastic view of what it represents. Nowadays ... meh ... It is an artistic representation of a theme that has been discussed and discussed frequently, and with no real impact on those who would be its 'target' given the allegorical and complex element in the way of passing the message. It turns out to be an artistic work for internal consumption by those who already share the point of view.",5,1,3,24 February 2020
The Thin Red Line," overly philosophical chatter
","The overly philosophical chatter and the slowness of the film have lost me. Not that I don't like slow action and can take the voice off, but the conversation of God, Nature and the like I didn't have a lot of patience for them. Most of the time it started to wander. The combat scenes are good, and the rawness of death and madness show well.",5,2,4,26 February 2020
Mad Max: Fury Road," Absurd, gratuitous and made for 13 year olds
","Absurd, gratuitous and made for 13 year olds who think skulls as decoration in everything and everyone is the ultimate coolness.The explosions are the main characters and grunts the dialogues.The only joke it has is that it is seen as a species of Sharknado with a budget thousands of times larger. And yet it's not as funny as Sharknado and similar Syfy movies.",2,3,9,11 December 2019
