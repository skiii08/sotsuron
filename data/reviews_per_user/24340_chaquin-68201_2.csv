It," The book remains unparalleled.
","First off, I'm not naive enough to say that all books are better than their counterpart movies, e.g.: Fight Club, Trainspotting, etc. But this movie was bad. It didn't just fall short, it was a bad movie. Poor cast, badly directed. The book is so full of possibilities... Really disappointed.",1,1,4,2 June 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Underwhelming.
","This movie was a proper letdown for me, mainly due to it being made in service of the characters and not in service of the movie, unlike Infinity War.I think this movie could've been great or even a masterpiece, because Infinity War certainly was, but for people that aren't invested in the characters and don't like that same old corny comedy and totally predictable outcomes (and major plot holes), it was definitely a letdown.I'm not saying it's a bad film, how could it? It's a good film that could've been great, that's all I'm saying.",3,7,10,6 May 2019
