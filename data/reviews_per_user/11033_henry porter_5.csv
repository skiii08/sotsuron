Antz," Woody and the Marxist Underground...
","I suspect that, in time, this film will be forgotten because of 'A Bug's Life.'  That's a shame.  I thought this movie showed great character development and was kinda neat looking.  It was the story, though, that I thought really distanced this ant movie from the other ant movie.  Like I said, history may find me in the minority - but I do prefer my pictures with smarts - and I think 'Antz' is as cerebrally occupying an insect movie as has come out since 'The Fly.'",8,0,0,1 November 1999
The Beach," joke, right?
","Remember that silly looking guy from the Spin Doctors?  You will after you see 'The Beach.'Remember why you quit watching MTV?  You will after you see 'The Beach.'Ever wonder how 'Lord of the Flies' would read if it were written for 'Teen People' magazine?How would 'Apocalypse Now' have been different if it had been adapted by, say, Jewel - and Marty Sheen's job been given to Rickey Schroder?You have got to see this film!     It's as bad as 'Orgazmo' - but here, the thing seems to take itself so seriously that you get the idea that someone thought we might not notice!   And the best part is - most of us probably won't! I thought this was either a really, really bad movie or else a really, really good joke.    That's what I thought.",2,2,3,21 February 2000
Man on the Moon," Film of the Year
","Jim Carrey's portrayal of Andy Kaufman is better work than you thought he was capable of.  Forget Arse Ventura.  Forget that other thing he did.  This is some kinda special film, friends - and you needn't bring an awareness of Kaufman's work into the theater to appreciate it, either. The career of Andy Kaufman is a story that deserves telling - and the guys who put this thing together did it the right way.  RUN - do not walk - to catch this one.  And, when leaving the auditorium, let 'em know you were hip to the gag all along.  Be sure to exhibit your share of that smug American pretentiousness that has made us all fodder for artists like Kaufman since the day we were born. But go.  Just go.",9,0,0,23 December 1999
Good Will Hunting," Big Deal
","Often, when a Robin Williams character is the most palatable feature of a film, the film may be avoided and the filmgoer's admission may be saved and the filmgoer may enjoy $7.00 worth of candy and cake (There are exceptions - 'Dead Poets'' is one, of course).  Good Will Hunting doubtlessly sold lots of issues of Teen People magazine - but it also kept a lot of good filmgoers from enjoying a lot of good candy and cake.-That's what I think.",6,2,4,31 October 1999
Schindler's List," everything's a work of art
","Sometimes, when you've got a great story and a great storyteller, an audience - not wanting to be exposed as the weak link in the Storytelling - can become a detriment to the integrity of the Storyteller's work as it scrambles to manufacture its appreciation.  I refer to an 'emperor's new clothes' dynamic.I want to appreciate this film like the pretentious kids down at the video store do - and I can't seem to 'get it.'I like 'Schindler's List,' but what is all the fuss about?  Am I missing something?  Am I desensitized to greatness?  Did I not get the memo? Someone help me out (And while you're at it, I didn't like The English Patient one bit).",7,1,3,31 October 1999
