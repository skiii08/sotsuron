The New World," It's Beautiful
","What a beautiful Love Story - the scenery and music is beyond words. Q'Orianka is as beautiful in person as she is on the scene. A must see for any romantic! I can't wait to go back and visit the actual filming site located in Williamsburg, Virginia. Filmed on site at Historic Jamestown and the Jamestown Settlement, it will be interesting to see some of the same scenery that I saw in the movie. The preview at the Kimball Theater in Williamburg Virginia was packed and everyone left with a deeper appreciation for the area. Some of the cast members that were on hand were genuine and sincere and a pleasure to speak with. I highly recommend this film.",Null,15,31,29 December 2005
