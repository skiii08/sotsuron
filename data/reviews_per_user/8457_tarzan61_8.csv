The Ring," you won't be sleeping after you see this
","This is a dark, dark movie. I haven't seen Ringu, but if it's scarier than this I might die. This was one brilliant movie. If you take a dead body and mutilate it to make it more disturbing, it looks scarier than anything else! The video tape kills you and somehow screws your face up. Man, that's creepy! Brings me back to Alice, Sweet Alice And The Texas Chainsaw Massacre! The video tape is bizarre, the mysery is a gas to see unfold, and the ubrupt and artsy endng was genius! The filmaking was brilliant!This is the kind of thing you have to watch. This ranks up there with Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween, Alice, Sweet Alice, Zombie, Ghost Ship and The Changeling. If you to be scared and disturbed, rent it.9.8 out of 10",Null,0,0,27 January 2004
The Thing," Great effects! Classic Sci-fi/Horror!
","Elements of science fiction and horror come together very well in this movie. You never know who the Thing is till he mutates! The effects were brilliant! Very good for even today. It's got an action movie air as well. Great movie. Watch as soon as you can. Sci fi and horror fans will love it.Rated R for language, gore and violence",Null,0,1,28 January 2004
Psycho," One of the Greatest Slashers
","Not only is Psycho is classic slasher, but it is such a well-filmed piece of work. Creepy music and lots of psychology cover this album. There is a constant chilling atmosphere. There is so much to this. So much.
         If you want scares, chills, and a suprise ending (and a chilling very end), this has it all. And to think this was 1960! Go Hitchcock!Rated.....I dunno, but violence, some gore and thematic elements are here.",Null,1,2,27 September 2003
Scream 2," Worthy Sequel
","Scream 2 lives up to the original and delivers just what we want. The blood spills everywhere, the question of who it is remains intact yet again. (You won't guess who it is) Dewey is trying to be Mr. Cool now, rather than some Keystone Cop, and now he wants some Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox)! Sydney is really to fight again, and she gets the chance. Gale's new cameraman is a black dude who knows that brothers never survive so he books it. Cotton, the man Sydney accused of killing her mother, pops up. He wants to get his innocence spread around with a TV special. And then there's good ol' Ghostface, with his mean calls and enlongated mask. Good times. Once again, a blonde with noting important to the plot dies.So there you are, another romp in slasher tribute and lotsa blood. Just as good as the first and crying for attention. Get this one too.",9,0,0,20 October 2005
Scream," The Ultimate Slasher Tribute
","Possible VERY MINOR spoilers:Wes Craven is a freaking genius! This movie is so..well it's so serious and cool, but obviously there's a black comedy slant to it all the way. It's just a lot of fun really. Slasher fans will find all they want right here, except for nudity (sorry folks). Blood and stabbing, however is abound. I've never seen so much blood (except for maybe Evil Dead 2). Though the deaths never get more gory than the very first killing. Plus, any of you who haven't seen the gem that is 'Halloween,' you get a fine preview, as the fine folks in this movie watched this one on the tube. There are also many other horror references. Craven even has the stuff to make a joke about the failure of the sequels to his own Nightmare On Elm St. saga. Freddy also shows up int his movie, sort of. AS the cast puzzles over the killer's identity, so do you. With everyone a suspect, it'll drive you crazy. The there's the killer themself (is that a word? :-') Ghostface has become an instant legend in horror history. I still see scream masks in stores (it's the Halloween season now, and I've seen 'em, along with those Scary Movie parodies). Yep, Scream is a respectable horror classic. It's set the standard for teen horror flicks of the '90s. So get out there and rent this little classic.",Null,0,0,11 October 2004
Halloween," Myers rules!
","AAAAAAAHHHHH!Killings,killings everywhere!A madman like Myers is something every slasher film needs.Jamie Lee Curtis is pretty good in this movie.Loomis is one of the best characters.It could do without the nudity.The mask(a painted Captain Kirk mask)is a great one.It fits with the mood of this chilling tale on the eve of All Saints.A must see for die-hard slasher fans.",8,0,0,9 September 2001
Signs," Sci-fi Scares Don't Get Better
","M. Night Shamalayan is nothing amazing (that Sc-Fi Channel special on him is an insult to your intelligence), but he certainly makes scary movies. Even before 'Passion of the Christ,' Mel Gibson shows his Christian side as a priest-father of two. The religious undertones of the movie seem a bit odd, but work well. Gibson's brother in the movie is one of the best characters. Swing away! The female police officer performs well too. For such a serious movie, there's a lot of fun moments. A few that are even fun-ny. The suspense is excellent. The aliens are not seen till the end, but that's not problem. There's plenty of scares in here.Rent it, you'll be happy. Verrrry happy.",Null,0,1,9 October 2004
Evil Dead II," Funny Gory classic!
","Dark laffs and plenty o'fun can be found in Evil Dead II. Sequel? I dunno. But it is good. Bruce is great as Ash! 'Who's laughing now?' Now that's funny! Rent it as a horror comedy with some good scares. Rated R for language, violence, gore, and two nude lady corpses!",Null,0,0,17 September 2003
