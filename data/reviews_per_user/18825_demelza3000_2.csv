50 First Dates," Great awwwww factor
","I lost count of the number of times the audience I saw this movie with said 'awwwwww'.  It was just that kind of movie.  There were several touching moments.  There was even a smattering of applause after the movie was over. Like many others who have seen it, I had no idea how good and how sweet this movie would be.My only beef with the movie was the preoccupation with some juvenile humor. Even more juvenile than most Adam Sandler movies.  But I guess if it had not included the humor for 11 year olds, it would have just been labeled a chick flick.And there is an ending you will remember long after the credits are gone.
Note:  The dentist early in the film is played by Adam Sandler's wife, Jackie Titone.",10,0,0,25 February 2004
Legends of the Fall," Best Comedy I've Seen
","I love this movie.  It is soooo funny.  Unfortunately, I don't think it was actually intended as a comedy.  But with a group of snarky family and friends, this movie is quite a hoot.The movie starts out interesting enough.  Julia Ormond is beautiful. Henry Thomas is a cutie pie.  Brad Pitt is not nearly as Johnny Depp as he thinks he is.  But the whole sweeping epic family thing draws you in at first. Then the movie starts to stink it up big time.I think it was Roger Ebert who wondered what was more ridiculous, the fact that the three brothers are on the same battlefield in WWI or the fact that the British would allow Brad Pitt to wear that long hair.  Answer?  None of the above.  The answer is Anthony Hopkins stumbling around in a bear coat with a chalkboard around his neck writing upside down better than I can write right side up!  I know, he's suppose to have had a stroke, but I just about had a stroke watching his ridiculous performance.
Then one more ridiculous thing after another happens.  But the real gut buster is Brad getting eaten by a bear.  That had me and the kids rolling on the floor.  Honestly, I looooove this movie!",Null,1,5,19 August 2003
