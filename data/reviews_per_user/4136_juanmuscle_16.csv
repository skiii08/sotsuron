The Finest Hours," This was just so sweet!
","I highly recommend it, save for a few lose 'screws' that happen to fall out of some toolbox and fell in some awkward Disney sentences, incoherent sentences, I mean, If a giant enormous giant wave is not the exact time to drop a few F bombs then I don't know what is, cause Screw doesn't really cut it but the film itself does make the cut , so screw the misplaced screws and check it out, its really sweet and fills the heart with hope that their are living angels out there!To me, this is what America is all about, it represents helping our own no matter what! That's more then freedom, they need a new word for it, great stuff!",10,1,2,18 January 2019
Stop-Loss," I love this movie...
","And mostly I love Kimberly Pierce and I hope to see her doing so much more for she is so artsy and fun and knows how to weave a nice tale , handle character building, great with banter and music and directing and editing and everything. I truly love this tale the most out of all her work, Boy's don't Cry is very artsy but I really like the cast here and some scenes really stand out as a wonderful very talented director at the peek of their game , this is a living legend and I hope one day I can say thank you, I wish someone would use her more cause its a waste of talent if no one picks her up for more projects!",10,0,0,8 November 2018
Point Break," How much beauty exists in madness?
","The much sought answer lies right here, look no further, in the NU Point Break! This is my second review on this film, now I know its broaching IMDB propriety, but I say to hell with the rules, its Point Fn Break! I watched both last night, and since I've seen the first a zillion times, I started the affair with the second, so let me throw some things straight up...the lil' bank scene here , was so replete with everything one could desire that it felt like that ordeal in HEAT, but this was in seconds, and it was beautiful.... To go back in time to do complete all the ordeals here, its poetry , This felt like Point break not on steroids but pumped up with some good ol' fashion hormones , and god knows what else, everything under the kitchen sink! this is a thematic Point break wholly inclusive in its single aim, to satisfy everyone, not just the exclusive fans of the first, daresay glorious and beautiful in its callow pretext, OK, look , I give everything a ten because god knows what it takes to make a film, but I keep it real with words, but what are words when action can speak on a monumental level and this point break speaks boundless smashing all levels right in our faces and they did it with style beyond style, and yes there is only one Bodie, but this guy did a great job respectively knowing the shoes he was trying to fill the beloved role we all know and love, and yes Utah here and now that role is not irreplaceable, but both are excellent Keanu and this new Kenau I don't know his name but did a stellar job indeed , but while Keanu or rather his stunt guy was smashing a few windows and spitting into lawnmowers , come on, credit is due were its due , this is on a whole new level meritorious indeed, jumping off cliffs, motorcycling off cliffs into lil' mountains, climbing up god knows what and then jumping off, flying a supersonic speeds inches above ground, and more all fraught with not just cool dialogue but universal and inclusive in its learned profundity, stellar writing! So no, nobody rides for free, this point break took the lil' bebe shoes of old and stepped it up on the level of Mount Olympus with the gods for the gods, we were just there for the ride and whether for free we payed with this super insane over the top old-school narly into the new world radical stellar affair, and I think if the real Bowdie were here, god rest Patrick's soul, yes we love him, I yet daresay Bowdie up in the sky or whatever parallel universe he is riding some big ass waves surely, is looking at this here Bowdie and smiling , maybe saying something like Goddamn, my Point break combined with this new one is a perfect ending to a radical life , free yourselves of the past guys, and keep riding the big ass ride , for free or not, cause I know I payed with my nerves trying to keep up with all this incredibly fun harebrained madness!",10,4,7,1 July 2018
Point Break," Firstly, huge fan of the first...
","Secondly, I defy anyone to watch this film eating something, you will find yourself topsy-turvy with your meal everywhere but inside your open maw. Due to the remarkable camera work, the film was able to capture every crucial move with acute depth and nimble perception as if reading a well descriptive prose novel. This team went well and beyond what is standard film directing; and the results produced something Definitely Cool, Narly and Rad! lol.... It bespeaks to us here today, of something greater than ourselves - it picks up where its predecessor left off and as it should, a sagacious writer of the seminal persuasion really hit home with this really cool idea. In time immemorial, we go into journeys to personal enlightenment whilst touching on the plight of modern society in a foretaste to the folly of man and its attendant pitfalls looming darkly over the crimson wavelet cresting over the vast planetary skyline. Whilst the latter, this one here today, is more of an explosive in your face all out worldly blitz of manic clusterF high intensity pure lunacy! There is just not enough time to really build characters and their attendant relationships, but in the nonce, when the world is barely hanging on the fulcrum of its natural axis, it is impossible to maintain any normalcy while cultivating healthy relationships. And if we are to save this planet, our planet from spinning off its axis, caroming into some other dead world whereupon a massive megaton explosion and off the entire universe with which we threaten all of vast tenebrous darkly space with our toxic noxious pollutant disgusting human remains, we need to definitely do something and do it now, like for example, recycle, eat less meat, stop procreating, read a lil' more classic literature and work on new fuel sources, now this might not seem as titillating as flying out of stuff and dive into planetary holes and Then engage the parachutes without dashing thy heads against the retaining trackless walls. I don't know, we all have to do our part and I'm a lil' afraid of heights. That is to say, Here and now, 20 something, all around us, all about us, we exist in a ClusterF of chaos. We simply do not have the luxury to luxuriate in any personal journey for we have brought our very planet of bliss to a veritable graveyard resting on the rocks of a sickly charnel house as we float with indifferent despair to our imminent doom. Our chance is now, our domain hangs in the balance, our every choice verily affects whether we live to see tomorrow or we all collectively bring mother nature crumbling to a world wide cataclysm so severe it will make the great flood look like 'The small wavelets next to the big Bowdie big boy waves in the first point break' lol. When our hedonistic f-all attitudes come to head to head at the bloody pernicious confluence with the Terminal End. But luckily we have a few young men fighting for a chance at achieving 'The Big 8' and expose the error of our selfish ways as we plunder blindly through the vast stratospheres of our ether sucking, and drinking, and warring and Fn our way into a dismal future for a non-existing posterity. ON the whole with a theme nearing a propinquity to that of Armageddon (Although a lil' obfuscated as to how they are going to show the world their legendary prospects with no camera) But OK, I buy it anyhow, Trust me, under the severe theme or plot or both, there is a really cool, fun, narly flix here. It tears through conventional action scenes with its supersonic, flying in the face of the inextricable yoke of the humdrum redundancy which has plagued the creative world since the dawning of chalk or a stick in the sand, it simply kicks major ass and does it with style. I will say, the film needed to be a lil' longer, probably a series, to really build on each character, define the dangerous prospects, reach out to us with the feral of inter-connectivity with which we weave in and out of the filaments of relationships, in order to keep us there, with the true meaning of the theme, which would thereby bring about a tremendous feel for the amazing awesomeness of this 'Sequel?' For this flix truly was awesome, totally! Hey, Bowdie could have swam back from that big wave way back when perhaps, came out in a younger format, with an accent, maybe? I don't know....",10,2,7,2 May 2016
American Sniper," Just now watched this thing...
","Boy, boy, boy, never was I to enter into a flix with this guy (Mr. Colgate smile) in it, 'In it to win it.' Gawd, this guy has more inclination to flash this lame smile than the original 'Face' from the A-team. And he did the RE-... 'Ugh' Alas! I get everything with my very special Colgate smile and my 'How to be a ham it up Actor and almost wreck every single movie' book at K-Mart blue light special. But at last I am turned around, I have some respect for this guy, his range is limited but he did do a good job (do not know what other words to use, so I went with the good ol' hammy it up bromide). When he is in bed with his wife and he is looking up at into the vast nowhere infinite oblivion and she asks him if he wants to die and he says 'no' plain and simple, no, the most crucial climacterics in our lives are built up to the biggest anti-climax. He cannot answer more than what he knows, because what he does he cannot control, he has found a a home whether he or anyone else likes it, and that is a very shady, grimy horrible desert. We all including our Colgate protagonist have to live with the choices that make bolstered by our fate. He is simply doing what he can only do, not because he loves it but because he has to, huge difference, besides it doesn't hurt to turn around and see your fans have apotheosized you, with the classic: 'Big Hero.' Why not? This was adapted from a book, so I am guessing he probably read it and got all that good narrative insight. Good job, I almost broke down when she calls him up and he is sitting at a bar drinking looking like if he only could he would root out all those gross 'memorial' weeds inly but it is too late, they are entrenched and forever embedded and categorized in that dark and awful cubbyhole inside where the file cabinet may accost us in our darkest most lonely unexpected and terrible languished small hours. Stuck we submit, peal back the layers automatically not without bloody resignation dripping from our icy cold dead/alive fingertips whilst under the pitiless control of our darkest spectral anamnesis, until a complete transmogrification has transpired in the temporal whereupon the manifestations inside breath and live and we must feed them ere they choke and bring us to final carnal ruin, oh but the fetid stench of rot for we are mouldering regardless, we must commit hand in hand ambling to our final fate with the Reaper. When Mr. Colgate retorts to his anxious wife who despairs at his truancy, 'I guess I just needed a minute', that was it, Mr. Colgate busted me up, I could not contain the drama building and I let a few of my own cascade. For hell, a 'minute' is but another itinerant memory passing through the bourgeois zephyrs of our very pleasant but very dull lives, but a 'minute' in the hell whence he has just returned, well, we now, know what can happen. Very nice, I mean, good job!",Null,0,11,4 June 2016
Bohemian Rhapsody," I thought Queen was folk rock...
","After watching this, I don't know what catergory of subgenre of rock, but dang that dude can sing! I felt I learnt a lot about this band, that I only heard in the peripheral but now I will check them out a lil' more closely.But also I had no idea who the hell the fake Freddy in the movie was until now, dang! I guess if you are a thespian and you have to be sterotyped for the rest of your goddamn life, that's not too shabby of a label to be stamped on your head, dude you are a total rockstar!But as little knowledge I have for Queen, this film surely makes it clear and early and that is that whatever this guys name is, wherever the hell he came from, whatever outfits he loves, whatever he loves to love, that is all irrelevant to the one crystalized awakening, this dude was born to be upon on a stage somewhere and with that voice dang!But its kinda cool how we get to know the rest of the band and they are all really artsy and like to experiment with their music... really cool well written imo, wish most bands I loved were such petty self-righteous bitches and stayed together through the thick and thin - like Queen , for its all about the music and although outside circumstances almost rent the ship apart, they truly were a family and it shows on stage as well as behind the curtain...Very very nice... that Freddy fake , definitely needs to be doing more , he not only blew the roof off the stadium at live aid, he blew the sky!",10,1,1,7 February 2019
The Machinist," 'The Machinist'
","I feel that once in a lifetime everything allines just right in the universe and everything comes together in a bright array of perfection. The people involved in the film were created for this reason and this reason only! When we speak of Destiny this can only prove one thing, and that is that it exists! Once in a long while there comes a film that changes the future and re-examines the way screenplays should and will be written. Words cannot express what this film means to the art of filmaking. No place else can a human experience complete flawless perfection in respect to films. Thank God that all of these people's parents made love and had them. Life would not make sense until you experience the masterpiece first hand. My love for this film grows stronger as time goes by. A true original that will never be duplicated ever again. Thank you for all the people involved for believing in yourselves and for not putting up with the trashy markets that refused to accept and appreciate real art. The lengths you all went through to give us this will not be forgotten, I will fight and support this film for life and beyond! All of my love goes out to you all.",10,1,2,5 December 2005
The Favourite," Yes this works, that's why its so freagin' difficult to watch...
","This is a triumph yes, within the scope of the characters and the very very disagreeable, dissipated, galling, and distasteful ambience that is built one has to live here for a stint of time and gosh is it appalling , yes very objectionable indeed, not one character I think throughout the entire movie is above a self centered petty self-regard; oh goodness are all these characters tough to watch , but through this turbid plot as it churns and disgorges their malicious selfish myopic intents one get a closer look at what it takes to survive amongs genteel noble class and its pretty much the same as their neighboring slavish Lumpen Proletariat outskirts... It just paints life in such a terribly selfish perspective, my goodness but that being said, it weaves its tail regardless within this tapestry and finally comes to this very nihilistic conclusion which leaves one feeling so despondent and disillusioned about the human race and how it procreates like unthinking unfeeling stupid rabbits! Oh no... but very cool nevertheless, must watch!",10,2,5,10 January 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," 'How to manipulate 'found art'
","I hear a lot of people once again panning Mr. Tarantino for disrespecting certain people portrayed in his latest venture and mistaking the dialogue in this film for being his trademark dialogue whether either good or bad this is not the case. Let me expatiate: What we are looking at is a manipulation of something that has already happen we know the original story because its part of our history, but what the artist here did was pose the question: 'what if?' In order to break through the spheres of the past to recreate a new future we must somehow bend time in the present just enough to create a rift in reality to birth a new parallel universe in which now the artist can answer the initial question with a whole new concept thus we bend time enough for this new reality to manifest itself before us, and here it is done, once again with style, a style and a surreal timeline in which thing unfurl, much a very new and experimental effort by Q.T. we have never seen before, one that excels his hitherto fun narratives in a fresh and strangely different way, for one, there is no story, there are just characters existing in this strange universe going against the face of everything we know to be real and constant and pulling it off, how I don't know but it just works. Ask yourself, why is Brad Pitt's character portraying a stunt man, we know him as one of the greatest living thespians of our time and yet here he can scarce get a job as a stunt man as people who first meet him keep saying , 'gosh that's strange, your the prettiest stunt man in history' haha... yeah, where does that happen; where is the greatest fighter of all time, in all of human history, Bruce Lee not able to back up his bravado as he tries to fight awkwardly maladroitly in a silly fighting sequence in which Brad beats him up, hello? It's not a diss on Bruce at all, its supposed to evoke in his greatest fans a sense of good humor and fun in an absurd backwards homage to the legend himself. This has to be in order to get to the climacteric at the end and have this incredible big sequence in which the ultimate new reality takes place in a heretofore terrible situation in our human history as Brad and Leo transcend and rise as the ultimate anti heroes to this quirky and very thoughtful very fun tale! It was just fun and cool and wholly different style to Q.T. , if you didn't know it was him, you would never know from this gem, especially from his so called 'brand' of dialogue!",10,29,49,12 August 2019
Mr. Nobody," Where am I?
","This type of storytelling is the antithesis of, well you can have psychological intrigue but it is founded on the machinations of a plot device with large gears grinding out scene after thick stifled scene as the turgid gears grind and try desperately to churn out some type of sense , but its founded on what? this is just endless pit of creating upon creating which never finds a base on which to begin the journey...",Null,0,0,12 September 2018
The Witch," Inviolate...
","Perfect subtleness heaped upon thrill after thrill surging into a thematic climax for the Ages! This truly is singly the way one composes a great work of art, not the only way, but feted surely to enter into the annals of History, may the Royal Society pay heed for the best is yet to come from this fantastic gentleman and fine scholar: Robert Eggers. By giving us more than the wonder that lies far beyond the mere meager middling minds and souls of the average creative, Roger extracts from the vast quarry of the vast beyond, giving us not everything, for how can one know such things, but by digging and never stopping, until he extracts just enough, a fine and lustrous rare seminal diamond akin to one of the greatest films which surely must stand the test of time. This is exactly how one moves the protagonist about a rich and robust plot disporting through a prevalent terror yet using the directing as a sort of spectral narrative in whose fiendish features, mobilize and galvanize the garrison for an all out assault on both phenomena and phenomenal classic reality. This is exactly how one wants to incorporate multi courses of ancillary characters whose affecting dialogue and multi-tiered peregrinations teeming with the style and wit of feeling from a seething stew over a hot steamy fire, perhaps a Witches stew, making everything start! And this is how you want to bolster a precious universal undercurrent whilst the classical prose like narrative, by one whose sophisticated sensitive nature of the most supremely intelligent persuasions brings it all together in an influx of manifold rhapsodical titular thematic explosion feted in supreme meritorious value; Pathos! This guy is a diamond in a sea of sinking wanna-bes', Who dare say, they cannot wait with bated breath for his next masterful work of art, and I want to stress the word artist, for 'The Witch' is a triumphant feat in the realm of classic works, a true opus! Truly loving it! Every dang second of it! Forever! 'Clickety Clackety!' Will it have the lasting power, the answer is already in the past, Yes, for it has already met its long term goal, and so, justly all its short term goals fall right into place. In the now, it has awaken a complex system of outward signs yet masked as dowdy gewgaws, but inside a strange transmutation has given rise to a deeper understanding of those opaque things which dance with the cold gusts of hot importunate winds by our casements and lure us with fantastic shapes and forms into concupiscent realms of sepulchral fancy. It is compact yet eerily spacious. It has more than enough to make us ponder, then later reflect. Perhaps in the offing, posterity might hark-back and use this masterpiece to add the missing piece to the plight of our human puzzle, to effect change from the paternal quagmire our forefathers were presented with, dispatch with the hoax and forthwith call to the arms of science with a dash of the savage thusly spare us more wasted time, whereupon we are henceforth cast out of the darkest of centuries and hurled headlong into a polar contra-distinction so incredible, so fantastic, so irreprehensibly, inextricably sound it will make the nonce but a sad and petty prospect whose superstitious tenets bring only more discord and disharmony as a unified humane whole, with which to disobey would but surely shake the very foundation of sanity; conversely, we would all brainlessly stumble forth and crumble such to revert back to genuflecting at another more pernicious, more malicious tabernacle. Wake up, Heed the message festooned by 'The Witch's Jeremiad, let us step out of the penumbras of redundant turgid superstition which hitherto fells opportunity, and forthwith! Aye! give reason, science, logic and the arts the light for a new age! Lest one sits about in idle fancy, For 'idle hands are the devil's workshop'. So I say pray, beware of the witch and her resonating superstitions which rend and sunder all in her terrible wake borne on the wings by the lashing winds that echo her maddening prophecy in the night by and by, Alas! Do we want our children gamboling about half mad from fright mingled with confusion at the endless traceless nursery rhymes? 'I be not Mercy, I be the witch of the woods, and I come to steal ye', hear me stick a-flyin' through the trees, clickety clackety, clickety ... God Bless the children of the beast!",10,1,6,4 June 2016

The Wrestler," Mickey, The Wrestler, so sweet!
","What is so wonderful about the Wrestler is it works well with the material , the material itself is food for the machine that keeps on feeding and growing in and of itself - and also the editing, its very psychological yes, there is no one forcing him here or there, no, what compels the spirit is free, so he is trying, but it is in the editing that leads us to the triumphal ephemeral climax; the preceding scenes blend really well together in a contiguous manner leading to our final psychological decision, Mickey Rourke's character is at that fork in the road, here is an angel tugging at his heartstrings for a lasting climax ending or elsewhere is the erstwhile past, what he knows, what he loves, that fake love from his fans who only see him as the wrestler; So, it is too late for there is nothing to think about, everyone has told him he is a F up, he believes it, why mess up this angels life, it inevitable right? When the brain asks the heart what to do, for the angelic force inducing one to move away from peril and into sacrosanct ground , refuge or as Quasimodo would say, 'Sanctuary!!!;' it is too late for here the mangled Wrestler has no heart, at length everyone has taken their piece for the pieces lie strewn lost forever in all the towns he has ever competed.",10,1,1,21 August 2018
Creed II," I gotta give it to Stallone...
","When the man wants to pen a nice apropos extravaganza, his pen flexes and dances and delivers!I've always said I would love to read or watch something Stallone wrote on the fly that did not need a big A** production - that is , it would have been nice to get a few indies in there about whatever without the big budget.I mean he can act, write and put something worthy together, I loved this tale yes, am I fan of the Rocky's of course who isn't, would I have also loved to see a few flashbacks of Creed the father in there, sure, like in Part IV but we can't always get what we want...I thought the most ingenious part of the script was when Creed Jr had to defend this title after he got pummeled , really challenging to see him go through hell with the training , the next level fight and the final outcome, I love how he brought back all the characters from Part IV and it just worked, at the end , some might say the cut aways were a bit spliced out of exigent contrivance to tie the knots to a few threads but I don't think so, I thought it flowed naturally and the ending and everything in this affair was just plain awesome!I can't give enough praise , the dialogue was so cool, the unspoken moments were classic, here it just worked - is it as classic as the first four? I think so , I think it fits very nicely , would love to see many more!BEWARE THE CLICHE LINE- can Stallone deliver the knock out punch? - without fail! this was high class super production super good kick ass job !I can't wait for more!",10,1,2,20 April 2019
La Vie En Rose," I don't know who gets the credit for the timeline here but...
","However it was done, with a perfect screenplay directly to film or if the manifest magic happened in the editing or what but that person deserves a nice job somewhere doing this for a living for imo, and whose other would it be, I think this is exactly how you transfer a biography into a biopic...Unfortunately a lot of people do not like the jumping way forward and back as it does interfere with the process of telling a story comfortably naturally and without the contrived offense , but being that this is film, sometimes this makes a nice 'alternative' option to seize the ever lasting snatches of the remembrances of time's past - and if you think about, no one is perfect, no one can maintain that which is deemed the ideal of staying in the now - even those perfect people , when accidents happen, when things don't go our way , it it normal in these unforeseen terrible situations to not stop involuntarily giving way to the accosting influx of thoughts , what could I have done to not have had this happen to me? , There are only a handful of people that can assert the situation with reason, accept it , learn from it and move on a better person, those are the tried and few perhaps dynamic super successful people who see openings that for us folk are just not there, we either have to be guided by a lil' help from our loved ones or keep on making the same mistake until the way out falls ontop of us and then and only then is the solution evident; so that being said, there are a lot of moments here that give way to mawkish sentimentality which cannot be forbore by those great ones but to the rest of us, we can and will relate to this...I just think one thing, what impresses me most , and I have always wondered this, for there are successful people in the entertainment industry to either are not creative all , or they fail to attune to whatever is there due to not seeing it before their eyes... for this character the machinations of a beautiful voice had to be adjusted a bit there and tweaked a jot there and before we know it, a star is born but is she really a stand alone star, and the answer is no; she needed a team of people to express herself , and those were the writers of her music to which she prevailed on stage ever so manifestly alluring and graciously and wonderfully sweeping us all under her magic thus as we involuntarily follow at her every whim ,for she has us on the palm of her pretty hands we are swept away by her engaging charm and sweetness and dulcet tones, oh the pretty such pretty songs, but never once did she take a pen to paper and create not a one, so thus , she lived a very exclusive life for at the end when someone shows up with the perfect song that makes up her moral compass , that instills one with hope, manifesting all those universal tropes, that ever so includes all of us whom we felt dashed and misunderstood, there comes the perfect song that encompasses everything for which we stand for surely now , if I sing this all will be well with the world , to her, for how can they not love with in this all inclusive universal theme to be included to be desired, to be understood and to be loved....Very admirable piece of art, a triumphal enterprise, and definitely makes one want to search this person out , and dang the acting was - how this person did not win best actress, I don't know did she? dang... of course imo... must of been some heavy hitters that year!Very cool... very very cool... and I listen to Iron Maiden so , but I can say dang , this the music, the everything I learnt something... its not just about some annoying cats fighting with each other music lol...",10,0,0,20 March 2019
