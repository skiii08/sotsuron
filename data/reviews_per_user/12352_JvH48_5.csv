The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Superfluous film. Adds nothing new to many other films and TV series about the same social environment
","I saw this film at the Ghent filmfestival 2012. I must confess upfront that I find this film superfluous, given the overload of TV series and films that also center around high schools and their population. One might falsely think that striving to be popular and 'cool' is the main occupation of an average adolescent. This film adds nothing new or original to this overload, and does not even attempt to show that there is more to the subject. Further, this film concentrates too much on a single person, the alleged 'wallflower', and leaves the remaining persons very much as entourage.What hinders me in the scenario is that our main character can only be considered a wallflower for a relatively small time frame. He gets some friends in an early stage of the story, albeit all these are older than he is. What helped in acquiring these friendships is that he could show several talents in the context of prose and poetry, and that he also had some talents as a stand-up comedian (probably only when under influence, but still).I scored a 1 (lowest) for the audience award when leaving the theater. I am at a loss why this film ended on place 8 for this award, with an average score of 4.52 (out of 5). I can only assume that other people find interesting material in these stories, which theory seems confirmed by the scores on IMDb. Maybe I'm just too old (64) for this.",3,31,64,23 October 2012
The Babadook," Very spooky experience, better than assumed after having read the synopsis
","I saw this film at the Imagine (sf/horror/fantasy) filmfestival Amsterdam 2014. It was a very spooky experience, gradually speeding up to get creepier and creepier. The son's behavior was annoying some of the time, asking for attention and often playing dangerous games, however not unusual for his age. The only minus point is that the final scene left me puzzled, and seemed not a logical consequence of what happened before.Being a very young, presumably inexperienced actor, the boy does very well. He is annoying some of the time, but that is an inherent part of his role. On its turn, his behavior could not be helped and was a logical consequence of his compulsive eager to defend his mother from evil, becoming apparent after having found the book of Babadook and reading it together. He made his weaponry out of miscellaneous household material, which was a very nice touch, certainly serving as icing on the cake of his superior performance.Of course, a bed moved, some doors creaked, often there were very dark, human-shaped figures on walls and ceilings, lights faltered or died suddenly, and more such standard tools of the (horror) trade. But it was never over-the-top in the context of movies of this genre. Such events became more frequent later on in the story, until a climax just before the final very quiet scene. At first, one could have thought that the events we witnessed, were only present in the imagination of the mother, but some of the later experiences are shared between mother and son, like the aforementioned moving bed.All in all, in spite of the seemingly less attractive story that I derived from the synopsis beforehand, the end result was much better than I had expected. Added to that, the mother and son acted spotless and believable. They were sometimes annoying and did not behave sensibly, but that is obviously an integral part of their role and fits in the story line, so no problem.(*** ALERT *** SPOILER AHEAD ***) The only thing I failed to understand was the peaceful ending. It seems related to delivering a bowl of worms in the cellar, which is a bit usual to say the least. This happened on the boy's birthday, also remembering the day the father died while driving on the way to maternity hospital. A party was to be held later that day (his cousin would/could not come as he pushed her lately and made her fall). Mother and son eat peacefully in the garden, and then the credits appear, so we'll never know whether this party is for real, nor whether there were many attendants (doubtful, given the son's deviant behavior in the past, when eventually no one wanted to play with him). We also have no information how and why the disturbances ended, nor what could have been the answer to the mother's repeated question 'What is it that you want??'. Anyway, something seems to have satisfied the hostile visitor, and the bowl of worms definitely has something to do with it. Yet, all this may be the most logical (is that relevant in a horror movie?) wrap up of the plot. I certainly can live with this as a solution, given the thriller qualities of the preceding scenes.",8,7,16,5 October 2014
Don Jon," Many viewers around me enjoyed this film more than I did. The last half hour took an interesting turn and offered some compensation
","Main character Jon is used to round up women from the disco. He always succeeds in getting the one who received the highest marks from his friends. He has sex with his prey, seemingly enjoyed by both, but the real satisfaction comes afterwards when watching porn on his laptop. History repeats itself every week, each time with a new woman appointed by his friends as an attractive target. He knows this is not the proper thing to do, and he makes a habit of dutifully confessing in church how many times he had 'intercourse out of wedlock'. Each time his sins are forgiven after a standard penance of 10 Holy Mary's and 10 Our Father's.A break through this routine seems imminent when he meets a very attractive women, who is determined to turn him into a house trained husband. She even gets him to present her to his parents as his fiancée. The parents applaud his choice. Only his sister sees that this relationship is heading nowhere, but no one listens (as seems standard operating procedure in this household).Only the last half hour was interesting and worth seeing. I suspect that it must be my fault, because of the apparent fact that people around me looked like enjoying themselves, with several laughs where I failed to see the humor in the scene at hand. I appreciate that this first hour of the film is needed as context, but while waiting for something relevant to happen, the overload of (bleep) F-words and stereotypes did not help to pass the time. The latter was most apparent in his parent's house, where no one seems to listen (really listen) to the other, where the father continuously watches sport on TV, and more such things we also see in the daily soap opera.The interesting part starts at the moment his self-appointed fiancée wants him to stop cleaning his house by himself, though he enjoys it and knows he is competent in this. But she insists, and considers this a simple sacrifice, something that a man needs to do for a woman he loves as a matter of course. We observe some hesitation but he gives in, unknowingly that she has more such sacrifices on her sleeve. Though each seems trivial when considered separately, we gradually see these 'sacrifices' sowing a few extra bits of doubt.Near the end of the film she explains her philosophy that bringing sacrifices to a woman, is a natural thing to do for a man. She considers this a love test, so it seems, for her a matter of principle. When he objects that this is a bit one sided, she reacts baffled as if she does not understand what he is saying.(***warning***spoiler ahead***) In the meantime he met a totally different woman by accident, this time not harvested from an evening in the disco, the latter being the place where he used to pick up women and take them home to have sex, following by a wanking session before the laptop. Conversely, he has no sex with her initially. It is made very clear that they come to a mutual understanding on other grounds. He confesses his porn addiction to her, and she helps him finding out why his wanking before a laptop screen is more satisfying than real sex. Eventually, the expected happy end comes about.As said before, the first hour was a bit of a drag to me, though the rest of the audience seemed to enjoy it and had several laughs where I failed to see the humor of the scene at hand. Yet, the story takes an interesting turn in the last half hour. A second compensation may lie in the casting and acting, both adding much to making this film enjoyable to watch. Let me conclude with assuming that my problems with the first hour are my fault, and won't probably apply to you as a candidate viewer of this film expecting entertainment. Given that this film was part of the Panaroma Special section of the Berlinale 2013, I can only assume that the festival programmers saw some quality in it, something that I cannot confirm after the fact.",6,15,40,24 February 2013
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Almost perfect George Smiley book-to-film transition. But who is waiting for another Cold War spying story??
","This was the opening film of the Ghent filmfestival 2011. I saw it on the 2nd night, luckily without photo shoots around celebrities walking over the inevitable red carpet. The venue (378 seats) was completely sold out, after promising announcements and positive local TV reports after the 1st night.The story is based on one of the famous George Smiley books by John le Carré, hence is all about spies in times of the Cold War. The announcement listed a star ensemble of actors. What can go wrong given these prerequisites?? Aforementioned TV reports talking with 1st night attendees had some warning signs already, due to the word 'complex' that I heard too many times. I ignored those red flags, however, deeming them no experienced readers of detectives and thrillers like myself. How wrong I was! Throughout the 127 minutes we were bombarded with new characters, appearing out of the blue, most without getting introduced who he was and his role in the story. And while the story unfolded with several unexpected turns of events, we did not get any nearer to some solution or purpose.Further, with the Cold War over for many years, we cannot feel ourselves involved in spy stories like these. It all seems so silly to us nowadays, knowing how we presently go along with those same countries. We also observe a formidable waste of resources in the form of protocols to restrict knowledge on a 'need to know' basis, to protect field workers from exposure. These same protocols were circumvented a few times without many problems, as we saw demonstrated in the film. A little bit of modern surveillance equipment would have obsoleted most of these precautions anyway.I'm wondering who is waiting for the umpteenth version of Cold War spy stories, without any modernization attempt that transfers them into the changed world of today. The universal concept of a 'mole' hidden in your own ranks, is not time bound and offers ample opportunities for such a transition in time, while still keeping the core ingredients of the original story. Outweighing everyone's acting performance with all the missed chances to create a modern version, I gave an 'average' mark (3 out of 5) for the public prize competition when leaving the theater.",Null,1,4,17 October 2011
50_50," Beautiful portrait how friends and relatives cope with a maybe (50/50) fatal spine tumor
","I saw this film as part of the Ghent filmfestival 2011, in the same week as 'Halt auf Freier Strecke' aka 'Stopped on Track' (Dresen; 2011) having a similar theme. Both portray how relatives and friends try to cope with the announcement of an immanent death due to a tumor diagnosis. Particularly interesting is how some evade the issue, while others rise to the challenge.Both films succeed very well in showing how friends and relatives initially react, and how good or bad they find their own way in dealing with the issues at hand. The two films are very different in all other respects. The chances for survival for the spine tumor are 50/50, hence the title of the film, contrary to the brain tumor in Stopped On Track that is not curable in any way. Optimism is not appropriate for the latter film, because of the known fatal end result. In counterpart 50/50 a positive outcome is uncertain but feasible. This allows for humor and optimism, as that may well improve the chances for survival, according to popular belief.Several nice touches are thrown in as extra ingredients. Firstly, we see the doctor explaining the diagnosis. His whole talk is directed to the notes and diagrams on his desk. He seems unable to look at the patient (Adam) before him. Secondly, when Adam's mother is invited to dinner, she apparently expects an announcement that he is going to marry his girl friend, or even that she is pregnant. Instead, when she learns about the tumor, she is annoyed that he waited two whole days to tell her. Thirdly, we see a group of four patients receiving chemo therapy on a regular basis. They gradually get to know each other, becoming sort of friends. At one day they discover that only three are left, after one died recently. Something everyone saw coming but still a shock for the three, emphasizing their possible near future the hard way.Adam's friend Kyle has a very prominent role throughout, taking care of the humor department. In a delicate situation like this, his efforts might be considered inappropriate and too much to witness. In other words, you love it or you hate it. But he certainly has a better side, as appears later on. When buying support books recommended by the psycho therapist, Kyle abuses the sad story around Adam as opening lines to get girls interested in himself. But deep down he is not all opportunistic. We see with our own eyes that Kyle really has read the support books, shown by a lot of hand written notes in the margins.The psycho therapy sessions with beginning therapist Katie could be hilarious, where it not that she does not act as a model for her profession. She does all the things that her tutors have forbidden, in her eagerness to comfort the patient. She can't help herself, sometimes even to the extent that it is embarrassing to watch. Can this be intentional??Finally, an operation is needed to remove the tumor. I cannot reveal the end result of this operation, if only to avoid a spoiler. Anyway, the film comes to its finale soon after the operation. Its end result is less important than what happened in between, how everyone was able (or not) to deal with the situation. It lets us think how we behave ourselves when this would happen in our own lives. Maybe this film prepares us for this, and makes us a better patient, friend or family member.All in all, I'm very satisfied with the film, the main actors and the ingredients for the story. You cannot help getting involved in how these people react, and their problems in doing their best, but not always succeed in that. I gave it 5 stars (out of 5) for the public prize competition when leaving the theater.",Null,1,2,26 October 2011
