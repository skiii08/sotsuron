United 93," Impersonal, unemotional.
","It's hard to say anything bad about a movie that deals with this topic, but it is equally hard for me to say anything good about it. So let's just see it as what it is, a movie.The director emphasized on the fact that the people on the plane were normal people, no heroes. They were like me and you and the story is about those normal people acting like heroes. Usually movies have some kind of filter, so watching it really makes you aware that it is only a movie and not real. This one though could have been made with a usual digital camcorder that many people have at home. The idea was a good one, it reminded everybody again that all this really happened. Sitting in a movie theater though, only gave the impression of bad quality. They had great, unknown actors, but they didn't take advantage of them. The first part of the movie shows the procedures of getting onto a plane. Everybody knows that this is not very exciting. Then you see a lot of people sitting in a room controlling the planes etc. on their monitors. They are talking in their headsets, giving orders, telling others what they heard. Each shot throughout the movie is about 2 seconds long, maybe even shorter. Sometimes there is a conversation that lasts longer, then you see those people talking in a fast change of perspectives, from the front, back and the sides. Most of the times you only see a lot of different people every 2 seconds giving orders, in the background there is constant talking. Yes, it showed how unprepared the US was for such an attack and that those people were in a shock and everything was stressful. But after one hour I could hardly stand those voices anymore. Just imagine a hundred people constantly talking at you. That's how it felt. It doesn't only look like some inexperienced private person used his camera to shoot the movie because of the filter, but also because of the camera work. Let's just say it makes you dizzy after a while. Again, the intentions were good, but it doesn't work. As I mentioned before, they had good actors. The ones on the plane especially. The problem is, you hardly see them. After two hours you have no connection to them, you know almost nothing about them. They are still strangers, so thinking about it as only a movie, I didn't care about them. The last 20minutes of the movie were touching, but not because of the great movie. It was, because I knew that all this truly happened and it touched me on the day that it really happened. The movie just reminded me of the feelings that I had that day. All those media they used to make it look real, stressful and hectic also draw the attention away from the victims and their family and friends. It makes the story less emotional. I only felt like crying when I saw those people on the plane calling their relatives. Why not showing the relatives? Why not letting the viewers get to know those people in private? That's what it should have been about, getting to know the people that did something heroic. Instead, you see 1.5 hours of strangers getting onto a plane and strangers giving orders into their headsets.",2,8,19,6 May 2006
The Last Song," Positively Surprised
","Before seeing this movie I wasn't surprised to read negative reviews for it. After all, we're talking about Miley Cyrus here, who is the number one celebrity of her age group and fame often brings overly harsh criticism.I did not read the book, so I'm just going to judge the movie. I knew it'd be romantic and I knew it'd be sad. That's what Nicholas Sparks is usually all about. If you don't like that, this isn't going to be your kind of film.That being said, I was very positively surprised by the credit given to the feelings and abilities of young adults in this movie. There is often a kind of prejudice that teenagers' cannot have complex feelings that should be taken seriously. This story is all about a young adult, though, and the movie deals with her first love as well as her relationship with her family, and how she handles loss. There are very few movies that explore these issues seriously and solely from the point of view of the young adult, which was very refreshing to me.I was also impressed by Miley's performance. Hannah Montana didn't require a lot of serious emotions, so I was curious to see how she would handle this material. Especially in the scenes with Kinnear (who is an awesome actor) she is very believable. Pretty much everyone in the movie theater was crying. If you get that type of response from your audience, you did your job.I also felt myself smiling and even grinning during the more lighthearted scenes, which also indicate great performances. Eliciting emotions in your viewers is what acting is all about. Unlike many other actresses of her generation, Miley isn't afraid to not look perfect at all times (which would have weakened her performance). She pouts and storms and cries and laughs out loud, all the while assuring the audience of her natural charms.This movie is not super-exciting or full of action. It's about people's feelings. It's calm and melancholy and cute and sad. If you like that kind of movie you should go see this!",9,6,23,1 April 2010
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," If you loved the novels, you'll love the film!
","I just read through some 'professional' as well as viewer reviews and as I suspected they were mostly negative.Well, I am going to review this film while keeping in mind who it was intended for: Teenage Girls. Now the novels happened to appeal to a much larger audience than that, which is why so many people were super-excited to see both Twilight and New Moon. That doesn't change the fact that the whole story is still intended for female teenagers.Is it long? Yes. Is it very slow paced, with many intense emotional moments? Absolutely. The film follows the book. If Weitz had changed the story to match typical film structures or left out the readers' most favorite parts, a gazillion people would have been disappointed. I think it's better to have some old haters mock the movie than die-hard fans be disappointed. The movie is not an artistic masterpiece, but it's not supposed to be. It's not trying to win an Academy Award, so I don't judge it by comparing it to those kinds of movies.As a fan of the series, I loved the film. Weitz did a great job turning a novel that basically describes feelings into a film that entertains every second of its two hours. Technically, Weitz far surpassed Hardwicke's Twilight as well. There was one awkward cut to Edwards face that threw me off a little, but that's nothing compared to all the technical errors in Twilight. There were several references to the first film that gave the two movies a connection. I appreciated that, especially since the director changed. As before, the actors have a great chemistry. And especially the three Volturi and Dakota Fanning were awesome new additions. Too bad there's not enough time to properly flash out every character. Rosalie and Esme had about a line each.One reviewer said that it is almost impossible to follow New Moon without having read all the books. That's probably true. And if you haven't read the novels, Bella's illusions and the wolves might even be comical to you. And you might roll your eyes at Jacob's nakedness even though that choice had nothing to do with wanting cause hysterics among the teenagers.My opinion is: If you loved the novels, you'll probably love the film.",10,23,48,20 November 2009
