Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The greatest cinematic disappointment of my life
","'Star Wars' (1977) represents the birth of my love for cinema.  As a child I had seen movies before it but nothing before had gripped me with the wonder and excitement of this film.Like everyone else I had given up any hope that there would be a Star Wars film after 'Return of the Jedi'. The whole idea of a prequel seemed like an urban myth.  It is thus difficult to explain my excitement when the project began to materialize.  In fact, I count the experience of watching the trailer for 'The Phantom Menace' in the theater as an event almost comparable to viewing the original films- such was my keen desire.I went opening night and saw the film.  I can never be as disappointed again with a film as I was with the failure of 'The Phantom Menace'.Now you could say that no film could have met the astronomical expectations that I set forth.  Perhaps that is correct, I will never know.  What I can tell you though is that this film is not in the same league as the others in this series and I will tell you why.It is not because of Jar Jar Binks (though every negative thing said about him is correct), it is because the film has no heart.  What is the center of the first Star Wars trilogy?  It is the relationship between Han and Luke and Leia.  In particular, it is Han Solo who is the spark of life.  Han Solo has personality, he has character, and he has humanity.  Luke, Ben, Vader- they are more or less sterile and that describes the entire cast of 'The Phantom Menace'.The reason the film doesn't work is that we don't care what happens to these people. The portrayal of Anakin is particularly bad. Does anyone buy for a second that this child is a slave, or that he is saddened to leave his mother?  I see a child actor smiling and trying to be cute. Period.The jedi characters may suppress their emotions intentionally but it doesn't make for interesting screen time. As a counter-example, in the 'Star Trek' television series the logical character of Spock only really works because he can play off the cantankerous country doctor role of Dr. McCoy and to a lesser extent Captain Kirk.  Without a foil to play against cold logic is just that- cold.This is another reason that the Jar Jar Binks character was such a poor choice.  His place in the cast could have been filled by a more substantial role that played off against the jedi and offered Anakin a different choice of paths.  Instead we get a slapstick routine that is geared towards infants.  And I do mean infants not children.  I remember seeing the original movie as a child and I would have considered Jar Jar 'babyish' even then.  R2D2 and C3P0 work well to provide humor; there was no need to double up.I think it is obvious that George Lucas has become blinded by special effects, and marketing reports.  He has forgotten that the magic of Star Wars had nothing to do with CGI.  The line 'Don't get cocky kid' is worth more to me than a hundred digitally created creatures or trips under water.As a movie in its own right the film is unremarkable.  Some of the special effects are a tour-de-force of digital magic.  However, some of the effects fall quite flat.  There is a battle on a field at one point in the film and it is painfully apparent that we are looking at a video game and not reality. I have never in my life seen a field that is a uniform glaring green.  Perhaps if the scope of the digital effects had been scaled back a bit what was left would show to better result.  (After all, is this a film or the resume for Industrial Light and Magic?)  But all things considered the film in its own right can stand on even footing with other space opera offerings.  It is when it is compared to its predecessors that it collapses.I guess you can never go back and relive the excitement of childhood.  I just didn't need the door slammed so violently in my face.",Null,4,7,31 January 2002
United 93," Reflections
","'United 93' is not so much a film as it is a mirror. It reflects back to the viewer the feelings and emotions of September 11, 2001 without any attempt at amplification or modulation. In that respect it is perhaps the most unemotional film I have ever seen. There are no dramatic effects used to create the artistic bridge to empathy. That bridge is already present in those who experienced the events.The experience of the film is powerful because it taps into our own powerful real-life memories. However I wonder how it will play to children born today when they are old enough to see it. Will their reaction be as detached as the film, or will the film still draw in emotion that it does not exhale? Obviously I am unable to make a useful conclusion about that, but my guess is that it will still remain a powerful experience.",Null,2,4,3 May 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Not as good as Episode One, which was not good to begin with
","I think `Star Wars Episode Two Attack of the Clones' is a curious movie. The majority of the film is quite awful, but there are scenes (or perhaps more accurately, moments in scenes) that make your heart leap.  That is what makes this movie and its predecessor (The Phantom Menace) so sad.  We are obviously looking at the work of a master craftsman.  The problem is he's a terrible artist.I think the blame for the failure of `Attack of the Clones' lies clearly on the shoulders of George Lucas.  The acting is quite bad in this movie, but I have seen many of these actors in other films and they performed splendidly. Rather than believe that all of them just had a `bad day', I think we have to look at the screenplay and the direction- both of which are the responsibility of Mr. Lucas.The screenplay.  Let's start with the positive- the plot of the screenplay is sound.  There may be holes in it, but this is a fantasy and I can excuse jumps of reason.  What I cannot excuse is the jaw-dropping-ly incompetent dialogue.  I can say without a trace of bravado that I was writing better dialogue in the fifth grade.  (I'll have Mom pull the papers from the attic if you want evidence.)  It seems completely incongruous that this is the same person who wrote the original `Star Wars' screenplay.  If this were a project for a college class Lucas's teacher would be searching the internet to see at which cheat-site he bought the original screenplay.It seems that the screenplay for `Attack of the Clones' is a direct response to criticism of the last film.  `I'll cut down Jar-jar's screen-time and have the Jedi's use some modern slang.  Oh yeah, and I'll throw in a few zingers for 3PO. That oughta lighten up the mood.' It is nice to see that Lucas is trying to accommodate his fans, it is just sad that he can not pull it off.  There are countless examples but one will suffice.  `You're not all-powerful Anny.'  `Well I should be.'  Waah! Instead of whining why couldn't he have said something more ominous like `Not yet' or `That time has not yet come' or even better- a penetrating glance as he considers the words, then a dark `No, of course not'.  It does not take a genius to fix this screenplay, Lucas didn't need to call in Quentin Tarantino (not that he couldn't use the work).  I think it's a fair guess to say that 50% of Star Wars fans that went to see the movie could have improved upon that script with a minimum of effort.The direction.  Again let's start with the positive.  Star Wars has always excelled at battle and chase scenes. This picture is no different.  The bar has been raised again on the fast-paced action scene- no one can touch Lucas there.  And as for saber dueling, it is only surpassed by `The Phantom Menace'.  Lucas uses CGI to good effect where it is best used- either in fast-paced scenes where details are obscured, or in dark scenes (night, rain, star-fields) where detail is unimportant.The problem is that Lucas refuses to use CGI as a tool, but instead uses it as his medium.  What looks real in space or on a rainy planet is clearly fake in the warm light of day.  I can be fooled into believing how a spaceship orbits a planet, but I know damn well how light reflects off water or how a pig casts a shadow, or how clouds move in a desert.  Perhaps someday CGI will be able to imitate life exactly, and we will never need to film a location.  Perhaps if Mr. Lucas is lucky he will someday be able to replace even the human actors with digital creations spouting his wooden lines.  However, that day has not yet come.  If the director had taken some of his enormous CGI budget and used it to build a few more sets, and shoot a few REAL locations it would have helped both the actors and the audience to suspend disbelief.  Again one example will suffice.  In one of the romantic scenes the leads are in a field on a bright summer-like day.  However, they are surrounded by these quite obviously fake pig-creatures.  The pigs serve no real purpose in the scene (the interaction seen could easily have been written a different way) except to reinforce for the n-th time that this is a `foreign',  `weird' place, not like Earth.  (Really George?  I think we've got that in the first four movies. Perhaps we do not need to be slapped in the face with this fact in EVERY scene.)  The effect of forcing the pigs into the scene means that the whole thing has to be `CG'ed, and it looks completely fake.  I was having a tough enough time believing the romance with the terrible dialogue.  Do I really need to be further distracted for no reason?  This is just a poor decision by a director more concerned with showcasing his animation staff then making a good filmThis is why I am quite tired of hearing people gushing about the special effects in this and the last movie.  Yes, some of the effects are unparalleled but some of them are really quite bad.  And if people were honest they would admit that there are times when `muppets' look more real than computer-generated illusions.  There is something to be said for the filming of actors interacting with real objects.  I'll take Yoda in the swamp any day.  At least there I can tell that the light falling on him is the light that exists and not the best guess of an illustrator.All in all, I would say this movie is un-rateable. There are scenes that should not be missed by fans of cinema, and then there is the majority of the film- which had me literally gagging at points.  My best advice would be to wait for the DVD release and rent it on the two-for-one night at your local video store. That way you're not losing any money and you can fast-forward through the drek.  Never thought I'd say this but that's my plan for Episode Three when it comes out, because unless George Lucas signs on a new director (Spielberg anyone?) and a new dialogue writer it's not going to get any better.One final point for all you folks spouting off about `target audiences'.  I realize I was in the target for the first movies and now I am out of the target by 20 years for these movies.  However, I can go back and watch the first three movies and honestly say that they still hold up after all these years.  That is not true for many movies I liked when I was that same age. Episode One and Two will not stand the test of time. In 20 years when Mr. Lucas has departed these will scream out for a remake, something that will not be true of the older films.  It's just a shame that such an excellent cast, and such an excellent vision was wasted because of the arrogance of one man.  I guess it was his creation to destroy, too bad so may of us fell in love with it long ago, in a place that now seems far, far away.",1,1,3,28 May 2002
The Village," A `Twilight Zone' Episode Stretched Thin to Two Hours
","In his latest offering M. Night Shyamalan continues his ambition to become the modern-day Rod Serling.  Unfortunately, this time out he tries to stretch an hour's material twice as long as it has the elasticity to bear. It is unfortunate because when we strip away M. Night Shyamalan the writer and his eccentricities of plot, then we are left with M. Night Shyamalan the director who is revealed to be average or less in some cases. 
In particular, in heavy dialogue scenes he leaves his actors a bit stranded. Poor William Hurt bears the brunt of the expository burden and he seems to shift rudderless through those scenes, trying to make his body do the work of the camera.  In a scene where Judy Greer talks to her father about a love interest (and the subsequent scene) the camera never gets closer than a medium-shot of her, making the emotional material difficult for her to communicate.I also question the structure of the film at some points.  The use of flashbacks seems forced and unnecessary at parts.  It feels a bit like a bad gear shift through an acceleration.  I think different choices with the editing might have made the film stronger.However the film is not without value and the standout has to be Bryce Dallas Howard.  Her performance is talented and moving.  She is not quite perfect but perhaps some of the stilted dialogue would not sound true from anyone.   She makes the film meaningful.The photography is also wonderful, that is one of the things that attracted me to the film from the preview, and I was not disappointed.  Roger Deakins uses the muted palette to glorious results, creating crisp, autumnal paintings on screen.***SPOILERISH***If I had one major complaint about the film it would be that I wish M. Night Shyamalan would play it straight for once.  I think he had the cast, crew, and fragments of story to make a very good film.  Sometimes irony isn't clever, it's just a crutch for people with out the bravery to be honest. Perhaps his `twist' worked in `The Sixth Sense' (though I would debate that) but here it hurts the picture.  The true meaning of the film lay in a unique love story- not some amateurish social criticism.",Null,0,0,2 August 2004
Van Helsing," The Monster Mash
","*** out of *****Van Helsing is a fun film whose quality see-saws along the way.  It has its share of cheesy dialogue, bad acting, historical anachronisms, and phoney-looking CGI.  But it also has a batch of good cinematography, humour, charisma, fine music, and a <i>joie de vivre</i>.  The trailer is a pretty accurate barometer for the film (which isn't always the case).  If you liked the trailer I would say there is an 80% chance you will like the film.  If you didn't like the trailer, then the film will not change your opinion.For those who haven't seen the trailer think `The Mummy' (1999) meets `Young Frankenstein' with an order of `Raiders of the Lost Ark' on the side, and lightly flavoured with some 007.",Null,0,0,10 May 2004
Quantum of Solace," A straight-ahead sequel that neither disappoints nor surprises
","It plays like a paired down version of Casino Royale, which at 106 minutes just might have been the producer's intention. This is not a handicap for the most part as this is essentially a sequel to the prior film and carries over some of the plot and most of the motivation. Although there were a couple of moments when I wondered for an instant if we had skipped a reel. To call the editing 'tight' would be an understatement.The performances are skilled, the stunts are exciting (thought some of the CGI could have used fine-tuning- particularly a fall through a glass ceiling), and Craig is starting to warm up a bit more to the suave side of Bond. I think the only thing noticeably lacking is a bit of fun. With this film we get back into the familiar Bond realm of preposterous schemes and omnipotent criminal organisations. It makes for great spectacle but the gravitas with which it is dealt could become a bit self-indulgent if left unchecked.Of course I understand the need to close the loop on this little character development cycle, but I think it would be best to move away from the perpetual scowl as the franchise moves forward. James Bond is not Jason Bourne; I realise that is the box-office that the studio is trying to cash in on these days but you can only push it so far. You need that wink and a nod to the audience that we're all in on the game. Otherwise you start to drift towards the overly-serious, self-caricature land of Steven Segal.All things considered 'Quantum of Solace' is a good investment for your entertainment dollar. Yes, you've been on the ride before but there are still thrills to go around for all.",Null,1,2,24 November 2008
Saw," Laughably bad
","This movie seems more like a first year film school project with a big budget, than like a professional film. The acting is corny and false, the edits jump so quickly and contextually that it almost seems like a parody. However, the worst offender is the script. There are moments so preposterous in this film that not only does it break the tension, but it made me laugh out loud. At another point I actually thought, 'I hope this character does die, he deserves to for being so stupid.' Not exactly the right mindset to create in the viewer for a horror film.The direction and the camera work are all right, and could have made for a better film. But the collapse of everything else doomed the project. Most disappointing was Cary Elwes, his performance was as floundering and weak as he has allowed his physique to become. Where is the actor from 'Kiss the Girls', 'Glory', or even 'The Princess Bride'? Danny Glover was equally bad, but he wasn't the lead so he gets a slight pass. Leigh Whannell's acting was of course the worst of all, but since I had no expectations for him it couldn't be a disappointment.However, it turns out that Leigh actually wrote the screenplay as well. And since the screenplay is the real problem with the film we'll have to lay the blame at his feet. I liked 'Se7en' too, but perhaps he just should have watched it again and moved onto another idea.",Null,0,1,10 November 2004
The Conjuring," A solid, professional effort but not quite there.
","It feels bad in a way to criticise this film because it is trying so hard to be good. However the fact is that it just doesn't come together in a way which genuinely taps into our fears and releases them. Yes, there are crashes and jumps that startle, but one is never drawn in deeper.It's a pity because there are a couple of good performances (Lili Taylor stands out) and it's certainly photographed well. I think it is the direction that is a bit off. It feels more like a paint-by-numbers approach to the genre than someone who is genuinely conveying what makes him personally afraid. (I don't think I've ever seen a film with more people walking backwards into the open frame behind them.) So does it work for a Saturday night popcorn-jumper with the right audience? Sure. It will put the receptive viewer through the standard paces, and he or she will likely leave satisfied. But it's nothing that will have you starting at shadows when you go to bed that night.",Null,2,5,2 August 2013
Beowulf," Amateurish, rotoscoping fiasco . . . A missed opportunity
","'Beowulf' is a mildly interesting retelling of the classic story that is rendered virtually unwatchable by the CGI motion capture technique used to 'film' the actors. The result looks like second-rate animation or third-rate photography. It's actually quite shocking to me that the movie was released in the state that it was. I don't know how any artist with even a semester of an art-school drawing class under his or her belt would be satisfied with that work. It looks like a second draft pre-visualisation for what the film might look like when completed. Whatever their budget and time-line was they obviously needed to double it.I suppose what it most resembles is a poorly drawn version of 'Shrek'. But quite frankly that is insulting to 'Shrek', because the makers of that film would never put their stamp on characters with such vacant expressions, lack of detail, childish shading, and wooden movement. However there is still a visual similarity between the human 'extras' in Shrek that are painted with less precision and the characters in Beowulf. This makes for a creepy experience when you see them in sexually suggestive scenes or using coarse language. It's like a pervert's transformation of a child's film.Two questions popped into my head when watching the movie. The first question which occurred about five minutes in was, 'Can I actually sit through two hours of this crap?' Well, I was able to answer that question with a begrudging, 'Yes'. The second question was, 'Why on Earth did they choose this technique?' That I cannot answer.The fact is that if they had chosen either pure animation or live action filming, the result would have been incalculably better. John Malkovich is a great actor, but I found myself staring at the face of his character at one point trying to get some clue about his motives, but it was a completely blank slate. It was like watching a mannequin. What a waste of a fine cast. Watching the DVDs extras you get to see Anthony Hopkins in costume or the beautiful Robin Wright Penn on the set and it hammers home the point, 'Why?' Why, did they throw away those potentially magical performances for this dreck? I could go on for pages but due to the space constraints I suppose I need to capture the essence of my objections and it is this: I felt absolutely no emotional connection to any character or event in this film. This is quite rare for me, as I'm an easy sell. So as a piece of art it was a complete failure. It is a quirky oddity that may one day be remembered as the most ambitious example of an abandoned technique. Let us hope so.",Null,0,1,22 May 2008
The Godfather," Completely un-redeeming in any way. Garbage.
","I remember distinctly the first time I saw 'The Godfather'. I was a child and it was being shown on broadcast television.  Granted, neither of theses are optimal conditions for rendering an informed opinion but I remember being struck with how unremarkable- in fact how boring I found the film.  I was particularly surprised by this, as there had been a great fanfare over the broadcast. I chalked this up to my own immaturity and thought no more of it.The second time I saw the film was in college.  My friend had a brother who was quite a film enthusiast and he, like many others, counted 'The Godfather' as the finest film.  One evening my friend and I watched the film.  The viewing once again left me unimpressed.  I feigned an enthusiasm for the film that I did not feel, as it seemed the popular, and even the intellectual expectation.  Once again I associated my dislike for the movie with a failing in myself. I apparently did not appreciate a 'good movie' when I saw one.Since that time I have seen many films, from many directors, from many countries, in many languages, and with varying budgets from independent offerings to mainstream Hollywood fare.  I certainly do not consider myself to be an expert but feel myself to be an informed member of an audience. Armed with my experience I recently viewed 'The Godfather' again to expunge my previous failures and to gleefully join the ranks of Godfather sycophants.  Well, I think you know the outcome.  As they say in baseball, three strikes and you're out.I find the film to be completely un-redeeming in every way.  I do not have space to address the film systematically or technically so I will speak to my central grievance- the story is hollow.  There is no moral center.I do not demand that a movie have morality.  I do not demand that a film even have a point.  I can take a film at its face value for what it is.  A slapstick comedy is foolish and an action flick is mindless, I do not ask that they be a different movie- only that they meet the narrow definition to which they aspire.  The problem is that 'The Godfather' aspires to be a great drama and that aspiration comes with high expectations.Gratuitous violence is expected in big-budget action flicks, amorality can be understood in the quiet desperation of an independent film's philosophy, and self-indulgence is to be expected in the over-the-top musical extravaganza.  However, violence, amorality, and self-indulgence in a film that portrays itself as mainstream drama or even tragedy are reprehensible. This is not art- it is base voyeurism at its worst.  We are standing in the bailey at New Castle or at the Coliseum watching with leering stares at the baseness and depravity of man. This film is not a criticism of man's foul nature, as in the above referenced independent film; it is a celebration of it.  Anyone who claims otherwise deludes himself.Thus conceived I can appreciate `The Godfather' as a film oddity, a curious victory of the popularity of evil men.  But to say that it is a great film is scandalous, and to say that it is the greatest film is blasphemous.  To say that the highest achievement of man in film is a celebration of cruelty, deception, and greed is a statement that many should reconsider.I find it interesting that many of those who claim 'The Godfather' as their favorite film, or the best film of all time can count their viewings of the film on one hand. In fact, I myself (who thinks unfavorably of the film) have given the film more attention then many of the 'fans' I know.  A friend of mine who professes to like the film recently returned the box-set DVD 'Godfather' collection that he received for Christmas.  As he put it, he loved the film but when was he ever going to watch it?  That is faint praise indeed for the 'greatest film of all time'.I am sure there are those who genuinely enjoy the film, but you could say that about any movie.  I would advise those who fawn over this film so to ask themselves if their enthusiasm comes from within or from a modern mythology. 'The Godfather' is a paper tiger.",1,110,314,18 January 2002
