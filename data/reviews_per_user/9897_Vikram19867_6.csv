Skyfall," Incredibly well directed, structured Bond Movie, with a dark, gripping opening & final act
","Bond movies have been my favorites, not only because they're exciting and have huge action set pieces, but because the screen play is fantastic, the directors are veterans, and they all deeply explore the vivid, often dark world of Agent 007. He is human, which is a point brought out very very well in the previous 3 installments, and justified by Daniel Craig's stellar performances.The opening act is great, and sets the tone for the entire film. The opening credits were incredible. What is great is that Daniel Craig has now perfectly understood his character. He is human, but this time, he isn't too emotional or sulking about it. He is tough, and has M's confidence. He is in his best act.M is the one who is in focus here. And Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem) who stuns everyone with a chilling performance. The deserted island set is incredibly beautiful, and the neon lit Shanghai building in which a major fight sequence takes place, is one of the most stunning work of cinematography in any bond movie so far.In the last half hour, Bardem steals the show with his underground train wrecking, and maniacal ways at the 'Skyfall' palace. However, I say this again, Daniel Craig isn't weak, or a wreck this time. He knows his ways. Agent 007 is a smart and strong character, and he does what his expected of him by fighting his way extremely well, and by protecting M till the end, in a very charismatic way, which was a pleasure to watch.So what makes a bond film a great one? A mad villain, a well-knit story, an incredible opening sequence, an intense final act, bond's handy fist work, explosions, some smart gadgets, a huge train wreck, and some of the best beautiful cinematography. 'Skyfall' has it all.One of the best movies of the year. If good action movies are your fare, you cannot miss out on 'Skyfall'!",10,7,21,5 November 2012
Iron Man 3," Good Action sequences. Disappointing Villain. Jon Favreau would have done justice
","After going into the theater having seriously high expectations, I was disappointed. Not to outrightly dismiss the movie, let's discuss the pros:<ul><li>Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man is just brilliant. He breathes life into the character like no other. Undoubtedly one the reasons why i was generous with the 4 star rating.</li></ul><ul><li>Ben Kingsley as Mandarin. OMG! He gave me goosebumps. He's the reason I watched the movie. Those Aviator goggles, that terrifying militant persona and the ten rings. He nailed the Mandarin look. Extremely disappointing how they turned down his character. Trevor? Seriously? Here was an opportunity to deliver one of the greatest villains in history, and they turned it down. Shame on you Marvel.</li></ul><ul><li>The short lasting, but quite outstanding action sequences were immense fun while they lasted. Although Jon Favreau put the CGI to much better use, this movie did well too in that department. The Malibu mansion take-down was action-packed and filled with tension, because at the back of it all, was Ben Kingsley as the Mandarin. You could feel his inclination for terror in every strike, and the gravity of the attack because he wanted to kill Iron Man for good. It wasn't Killian that terrified the audience, it was Ben Kingsley's Mandarin. Also, The finale, ruined of course by the lame extremis Killain villain, was still pretty action packed, and pepper potts kicked some major ass!</li></ul>Now, the Only Con, the final blow, which ruined the film for me and my expectations, is this:<ul><li>Adrich Killian as the Mandarin?! Why, Shane Black, Why? Iron Man comics have had some really good plots and story lines and Killian could easily be the Mandarin with the extremis powers he possesses. But God, how can you just dismiss Ben Kingsley's Mandarin? How? That crazy accent, the furious terrorist demeanor, those ten rings, did that mean nothing in the end? He is Iron Man's nemesis, not those jerk off extremis soldiers. They may stand as good foes, but an incredible villain has been wasted, and it is a pity, for my faith in comic book movies has been lost again, &amp; it would now take another Christian Bale comic adaption to revive it. Extremely disappointing.</li></ul>Overall, good action sequences, great chemistry between pepper and stark, Guy Pearce plays Killian and the extremis villain well, but disappointing character development regarding Maya & the Mandarin, and a great villain wasted, which ruined the movie for me, greatly over weighing all the pros. Watch it once for fun's sake.",4,37,73,26 April 2013
Gravity," A magnificent vivid portrayal of the perils in a world without gravity
","I walked into 'Gravity' with high hopes, and it delivered. The only previous work by the director I'm familiar with is 'Great expectations', which is a movie which will stay with me forever, being a mature and coming-of-age piece of cinema for me.Gravity however, is futuristic, captivating, and a thrilling ride of a film, delving into a dimension and accomplishing successfully what only greats like Stanley Kubrick did with 2001 A space odyssey, Ron Howard with the masterful Apollo 13 and and Ridley Scott with Alien.There is a tension in space, a fear of the unknown, which only few artists have encapsulated in their works over the years. It is not just about protagonists battling antagonists, but the triumph of one over oneself, braving odds and emerging champion.Gravity's story develops well, as it explains how Russians have the right to dispensation of defunct spy satellites. One such missile strike chains a reaction of destruction of existing satellites, imperilling the lives of astronauts with debris hurled at them at high speeds revolving in orbit.Sandra bullock outshines in her performance as a doctor on a space mission gone defective, as she drifts, marooned, confronting and overcoming unending space hazards. Her emotional turmoil is captured in astounding manner, and one which propels the movie. George clooney's performance is an excellent one, delivering comic timing and uplifting the mood of the film, empowering Sandra bullock, and ensuring she survives the trauma and perils of the space catastrophe, all on her own.Some facts, satellite details and their use (Russian and Chinese orbiters) might be scientifically arguable, but it's certainly not a shot in the dark. If not delved into in detail, one would say the technical aspects and display/use of equipments is credible.Gravity is one of the best movies of 2013, and one of my favorites alongside Elysium, Oblivion and Pacific Rim. It is an very real and terrifying vision of survival in a world void of gravity. It has been critically acclaimed and rightly so. Highly recommended. Don't miss out.",10,1,2,15 October 2013
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Witness the birth of Darth Vader!
","I have always admired George Lucas and his creation for it's incredible story and scale. And clearly, he outdid himself with this movie. 'Revenge of the Sith' in my opinion, is fantastic, and the best of the Series. It fluidly merges the Prequels and the Sequels.The emotional depth of Padme and Anakin's story in this movie, is one of the most intense & greatest on-screen stories ever told, portrayed beautifully by Hayden Christensen & Natalie Portman. Chancellor Palpatine's ways are villainous, and Ian Mcdirmid does an outstanding job of playing the evil sith lord. Skywalker's embrace of the dark side, has been very well understood & acted incredibly well by Hayden Christensen.*SPOILER*One particular scene of his which I would like to mention, and probably the most intense of the movie, is when he screams out 'I hate you' after Obi-Wan has dismembered him. It signifies the blind anger and hate he has for himself & everyone else, and the very essence of what he is to become - 'DARTH VADER'This really is the most dark 'Star wars' movie, & even if one has missed out on the other 5 movies, this movie is incredible as a stand-alone. The rise of Darth Vader will bring chills down the spine of any moviegoer who is familiar with Star Wars. One of the best movies ever made, and not to be missed. Highly recommended.",10,0,3,11 March 2013
Spectre," Absolutely loved it! Skyfall, Casino Royale & Spectre are my favorite bond movies!
","Daniel Craig is my absolute favorite bond. I love his presence, so modest, yet classy. He is 'James Bond'. I feel Sam Mendes has found his perfect subject with the bond movies. They together deliver such integrated bond story lines with such fluidity that it is amazing.The action scenes are mind-blowing. from the opening Mexico bombing & helicopter maneuvers to the London finale is all explosive stuff throughout, and it gets better towards the end of the movie, in the last half an hour.Christoph Waltz as Obenhauser stands out, and is my favorite bond villain yet, only matched by Javier Bardem. When you meet him towards the end of the movie, you experience some magical moments between him and Daniel Craig. They are yin and yang. The perfect villain confronted by the perfect protagonist. Daniel Craig finally meets his match.Lea Seydoux was such a surprise as well. Beautiful, modest and so perfectly sorted for the role. Laudable performance by her. And Dave Bautista as the heavyweight side villain adds the perfect brute touch reminiscent of classic bond fare.An absolute must watch for all bond fans. Skyfall, Casino Royale and Spectre shall always be my favorite Bond Movies. You will be dearly missed Daniel Craig. I just hope I'll be as excited to watch future bond movies as I am when I watch him as Bond. But I am also very hopeful. After all these Bond movies just keep getting better, and that makes me a very happy person.SPOILER:The scene where bond escapes from the Spectre desert lair after the torture is spectacular, explosive stuff. One of the best action sequences I have witnessed, matched only in the explosive action scenes from 'The Dark Knight'",10,2,10,24 November 2015
The Social Network," Fantastic Movie!
","The movie delves deep into the origins of the social networking phenomenon. There may arise, at few points, doubts concerning the credibility, or the authenticity of the material put together on screen and those are highly debatable, but I went in to watch the movie less informed in that department, and found it otherwise, quite intense and immersive. The pacing and the screenplay are wonderful. The background score by Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross infuses life into the already strong performances spearheaded by Andrew Garfield and Jesse Eisenberg. One of the two, is certainly going home with an Oscar next year.David Fincher takes you on a frenetically paced ride into the world behind facebook, with fascinating revelations and disclosures. Though the facts portrayed seem to be relevant and are combined in sorts to make the movie exciting and gripping, reality somewhat may have been less dramatized and banal.The movie scores highly on the performances, screenplay, background score and direction. Superbly executed, extremely well made & a must watch!",9,0,2,21 November 2010
