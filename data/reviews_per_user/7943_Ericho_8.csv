The Mask," Jim Carrey at some of his best
","As you might have read in my 'Liar, Liar' review, I really like Jim Carrey comedies. I'm not sure if this outdoes LL or not. Anyway, it's a really good movie. It was the film debut of Cameron Diaz. I especially adored the funny Tex Avery cartoons homages they did with the fine CG effects. The mask seems just like the kind of person Jim Carrey would become. It was cool how they would have the shy Stanley Ipkiss at one point, and then he would turn into the zany, funny, wise-cracking mask guy. He is by far, one of the funniest movie characters I've ever seen. There was no stop to it!! My brother used to do impressions of him all the time. Whether it was 'Somebody stop me!!' or 'Party! P,A,R,T,Y? 'Cuz I have to!!'.Anyway, it's full of memorable gags, like the part where the dog gets the mask and such. This was probably one of the earliest PG-13 movies I remember seeing. It's the same with 'Liar, Liar'. You just can't miss it. I personally think Jim Carrey has kind of lost his good humor in his latest movies, but I'm looking forward to 'Bruce Almighty'. Anyway, a 9/10, or a 10/10, I'm not sure. The Mask: ('dying') Tell Oliver I won't be coming home this Christmas! Tell Scarlett I do give a damn!

Gremlins," Nice little movie
","It was a good thing that I've been smart and knowing how PG-13 movies weren't made until 1985, as I consider this a PG-13 movie. (Dang, I couldn't believe it when I found out 'Jaws' had a PG rating! I was really wondering how a movie like that didn't cause the MPAA raters to make a PG-13 rating) Anyway, I rented this movie out right after I turned 13(so it's probably the first PG-13 movie I saw alone) and it was as good as I had thought!Anyway, I don't see how people should complain it's too scary. I mean, if YOU want to see a movie you thought was for little kids, but was scary, rent 'The Secret Of NIMH'. Gizmo is a very cute little fellow, and I always kind of went for furry little creatures. The gremlins were very cool, and it was interesting how clever they were to wreck all that havoc (i.e. cutting off the power of a traffic light). Yes, the effects could have better, but this is just one of those movies you just wanna have fun with, and not really take seriously. The part where the gremlins were at the bar was very funny! I'll always remember the gremlins attacking the Santa Claus guy, or the gremlins watching Snow White. It was a kind of sci-fi/horror/comedy crossover.Don't listen to the Leonard Maltin review. He gave the sequel a good rating, and that sequel was just as volient as the first one(I'll bet he did that just because he himself had a cameo in the movie). Anyway, a 8.5/10.",Null,1,2,29 April 2003
Forrest Gump," An ordinary man
","I think that TV Guide (wasn't it?) summed the movie up very well, when they said this movie was about the adventures of an ordinary man. The film was kind of an homage to what can just plain happen to anyone. Who could ever be entertained (or forget for that matter) the wily accent Forrest Gump had in this movie? This was released in 1994. That was a very good movie year. This and 'The Mask' (another favorite of mine) came out. They slowly showed how Gump was expriencing the important elements and occurings of the 20th century. I once went to a restaruant that was completely devoted to Forrest Gump. I think it was called 'Bubba's Grill' or something like that, and they showed all the things featured in the movie. Like all those drink bottles that Forrest drank that caused him to say 'I got to pee' to president Kennedy. You could never forget the various 'words of wisdom' in that movie ('What's vacation?' 'It's when you go to a place and you don't ever come back' 'My mother always says, stupid is as stupid does') Another favorite part was the subplot with Lieut. Dan. With he lost his legs and years later, you see him a better man with metal legs. This was based on a book. A writing teacher of mine, Mrs. Olmar said FG was the only movie based on a book that was better than the book. She said in the book, Forrest went into space with a monkey and a woman(!). The floating feather effect was nice too. Tom Hanks is another favorite actor of mine, with his roles in movies like FG and 'Toy Story'. Anyway, I'll give it a 9/10. Really nice movie. Forrest Gump: (talking about president Kennedy) Then they shot him, and a few years later, they shot his brother.",Null,0,4,23 July 2003
Spider-Man," Kind of goes beyond the normal super-hero story
","In the history of movies based on comic book superheroes, most of the time you either like them or you don't. And that has been the case for me. I liked this movie. It started out as a pretty humble plot, like something we could all relate to. A teenage kid with only one friend trying to fit in with the world, but the only conversations he can start are ones about science which not many people care about. Then he got superpowers in the simple way of a radioactive spider biting him. I especially like this movie because of how it knew where it was going, and all of the things in it were there for a reason. I especially think of this when Peter/Spider-Man realizes if he would have stopped that criminal, he would have saved his uncle.He sure did mean it when it kept saying, 'This is my gift. This is my curse' contrasting on his battle with the Green Goblin killed his best friend's father, and now he wants revenge on Spider-Man. It was also funny especially with the newspaper guys that wanted to get pictures of SM. The battle sequences with the Green Goblin were good, especially when SM stopped him by ripping the engine out of his flying thing (clever). TGG was a colorful villian, who fought with his human counterpart, making us wonder if he really was a seperate being or not. The special effects were nice, especially with the pumpkin bombs and Spider-Man dodging the blades slowly. All in all, a nice movie. Watch it over 'Batman And Robin' or 'Daredevil'. An 8/10.",Null,0,0,11 July 2003
Liar Liar," HA, HA, HA, HA, HA!!!!
","This has got to be one of the funniest movies of the 1990's! It's just plain laugh out loud hilarious! Jim Carrey has shown his hilariousness again! If only we could have more of this. I don't know if I could say the most funny part, maybe the part where he was funnily insulting everyone on the board.The plot? Well, it's about a guy who has a kid who wished that his dad would go for one day without lying and his wish came true. You can imagine all the trouble this could cause from him being a lawyer! It also has some of the funniest lines ever, especially the thanksgiving turkey stuffing part! Not to mention the bloopers at the end! Jim Carrey was always funny to me, especially his exaggerated voice in some scenes. I'm looking forward to 'Bruce Almighty'. I rank this as his best film, second only to 'The Mask'. This gets a 9/10.",Null,0,0,12 March 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Better than the first!
","I haven't read any of the Lord Of The Rings books or 'The Hobbit' either, but these movies have gotten me interested. I really hope I do, because it's hard for me to remember all the character's names, since like most names in fantasy stories, they're hard to remember.The plot has thickened more from the last movie, because it's now not just everyone in a group. They're in seperate groups, and I think its a cool concept how the scenes shift from group to group. The battle scene(s) at the end were a very worthy climax. I especially like the scenes where Gollum was 'talking to himself'. It made it seem like two separte people were talking, on how they shifted Gollum/Smeagle from scenes at different angles. Very clever. I can't wait for 'Return Of The King'.Although I'm kind of curious as how they were able to kill the guys and the hamster monsters they rode with just one arrow, it was still quite memorable. 8.5 out of 10.",Null,0,0,20 January 2003
Toy Story," What a movie
","Wow, I remember back in 1995 when I first saw this movie back in 1995. I think it was the movie being the farthest away that I could remember in theaters, and I saw it like two or three times. At first, I thought it was something about these toys trying to get to another group of toys, and they were a big group themselves. I couldn't believe how amazing the plot was.After I saw that movie it was like I couldn't get enough of Toy Story stuff. The characters were cool as well, and they just all seemed to be in the right places at the right time, like Mr. Potato Head, especially. And I had waited for years for a Toy Story 2 to come out, and after four years of waiting, it finally happened! And it was an excellent sequel! The extra fun in this movie, spotting the other toys that make cameos. It was kind of a simple plot that just worked, what with the rivalry between Woody and Buzz competing for Andy's favorite toy and the wisecracks of that pig, and Rex. I even got my own TS toys and such. It was truly a memorable movie. 10/10. Nice work, Disney and Pixar!",Null,0,0,8 April 2003
Bruce Almighty," Nice work, Jim Carrey!
","Jim Carrey has always been one of my favorite actors. He was great in 'The Mask' and 'Liar, Liar'. I was noticing that recently he's been in more serious movies ('The Truman Show' 'The Majestic' etc.) and I was kind of waiting for a classic comedy of his. This funny film is his best comedy since 'Liar, Liar'. Anyway, the film is quite entertaining in my opinion, and offers a very original idea...a human getting God's powers. I kind of think Ebert and Roeper were focusing more on the bad jokes than the good. (I mean, come on! The wind lifting up the lady's skirt was only in like one scene!) Morgan Freeman was very good as God. A very fine actor indeed. I (or at least my dad) was noticing that wierd thing with the signs througout the movie that the poor guy had and how he turned out to be God at the end. I wonder if that 'Armeggadon Outta Here' sign at the very end, meant 'I'm A Getting Out Of Here' or something. Yeah, the film was really suttle in its messages.The idea of someone having a special ability is kind of reminiscent of LL. Anyway, one of my favorite parts was where Bruce was messing up the guy's news report. That was so funny!! The movie also kind of showed you kind of how everything has an effect, and it not always seem as it should be, but we as humans beings should just do as we're meant. Allright, I've probably said enough. A 9/10. Hope you like it!",Null,0,1,28 June 2003
