The Avengers," highly overrated...
","Uninspired high gloss kiddie comic adaption with acceptable visual effects and a screenplay that fits on one sheet of toilet paper...It is almost incredible how this Movie could be so highly rated. Must be indebted by the target group which exists from nerd comic-fans and teenagers without an clue what makes a good movie...The characters are flat and as a result none of the (normaly good) actors is capable of convincing.What's left is the typical action-loaded special effects spectacle. But even in this category nothing is extraordinary or surprising.Let's hope, that someone saves us from a sequel, is hard to underbid that...",4,6,32,4 April 2013
Avengers: Infinity War," Bang boom bang for the simple minded...
","Will any 14 year old Marvelfan will love this flick? OF COURSE!
Will any real moviefan will hate this flick? OF COURSE!A rating round 9 at IMDB for this brainless effects-overkill is a hit in the face to movie histoty!",1,395,987,30 April 2018
