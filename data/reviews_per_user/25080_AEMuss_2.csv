Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," boring
","This movie violated all the rules for a good movie.  The acting was stiff and emotionless.  I was left with no feeling for any of the characters, good or bad.   The film maker has to make you hate the bad guys and love the good guys.  Neither happened in this one. A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.",2,0,1,9 July 1999
A Bug's Life," It was hard to stay awake.
","I finally broke down and saw my first 'cartoon' movie since I was a kid. (actually, I saw Aladin on video tape, but I wouldn't pay to see it)  I should have stuck to my guns.  Unfortunately, on Christmas Day, there wasn't a movie playing that I really wanted to see.  This one was a cute story, but there was something lacking.  I didn't develop any feelings for the characters.  I think most people who liked the movie, just liked the animation, which was excellent. Don't waste your time on this one.",Null,0,0,26 December 1998
