Lucky Number Slevin," Feels like watching a good movie again after a long time
","Now, you have seen this movie before a dozen times. Think of Ocean's Eleven, Payback, Donnie Brasco, Casino, Goodfellas and few of the less famous ones, mix it all together and you are pretty much there.However, in my view, this recipe worked well here. The movie's 'universe' is well constructed, the story is stringently told in a way that keeps you enjoying what you are watching, and the overall atmosphere and coolness is entertaining, not embarrassing.Also, the guys have done a good job in casting the characters. Bruce Willis is playing pretty much the same guy as in The Whole Nine Yards and The Jackal - which is a good thing in my view, because he is pretty good in these roles. Josh Hartnett is a (surprisingly) credible lead, Lucy Liu is lovely as always if you go for Asian girls, and I just like to see Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley being the cool bad guys (they have played this numerous times before, too). Even the supporting characters are fun to watch.In short, not the most original movie of all times, but a pretty save bet for a good time seeing guys at work who know what they do (again...)",7,2,13,25 February 2006
