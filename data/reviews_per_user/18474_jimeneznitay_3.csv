The Double Life of Véronique," ...
","I've been watching a lot of Kieslowski films lately, and I've liked all of them, but I have to say: this one was a little bit of a disappointment.As any other Kieslowski, it has stunning imagery, that can't even be described with words, but this time, it doesn't fill all the holes. The story is not half as strong as his last films, and it goes beyond subliminal and criptic. The story switches to a complete different one from the one we were getting, and makes the first half hour of the movie almost useless. Props to the score and imagery, but yet again, it´s not enough to say it's a solid film",6,0,1,23 October 2019
Control," Nice
","Very enjoyable movie if you´re a Joy Division fan like me, it shows some interesting details about the band and some scenes just give you a good sensation.Now, talking about cinematographic value, I think this film doesn´t stand out among other rock and roll biographic films. I feel like the director could have known better where to cut or to keep filming a scene. The sentimental scenes could have been a little bit more powerful, and generally, the film had the potential to be more than it is. All things we see are superficial and I would have loved to see a more deep perspective about Ian mental problems, but it´s not bad as it is and I enjoyed it while watching it",7,0,0,23 October 2019
Joker," Don't believe the hype...
","Besides Joaquin Phoenix's amazing performance and great cinematography, I don't really get the hype behind the film. It just shows, but doesn't explain. It's not believable and instead it feels very forced overall. The movie doesn't know its direction and the message behind it gets kind of blurry sometimes. I loved some scenes, but I'm just disappointed at the waste of potential this project had.",6,3,9,29 January 2020
