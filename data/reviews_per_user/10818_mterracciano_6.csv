The Blair Witch Project," Absolute Rubbish
","The day Roger Ebert gave this movie four stars was the day I lost all respect for the man as a film critic. This film is an absolute piece of garbage. I'd rather stay home and watch my fish swim in circles than sit through this film again.There was only one movie I've ever walked out of: FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS. I tell you if THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT lasted a minute longer, I was ready to walk out. First of all, the way it was filmed with the bouncing camera was horrid. I was getting headaches throughout the whole movie. Second, it was not the least bit scary. There were actually people laughing in the theatre throughout the entire movie. I don't know which 'horror' movie was a bigger comedy; this or THE RING.You people say this was the scariest movie ever made. Obviously, this was made for the DAWSON'S CREEK little teenybopper audience who probably thinks SCARY MOVIE was scary. Go to your local video store and rent THE EXORCIST and THE SHINING, two TRUE horror classics.I give THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT zero stars. (out of four)",1,13,24,22 December 2002
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I waited 16 years for this???????
","'I waited 16 years for this??'Those were my exact words after the credits started to roll on that May evening in 1999 after viewing the midnight show of STAR WARS EPISODE I: THE PHANTOM MENACE.This was one of the most anticipated movies of ALL TIME! I literally could not sleep the night of May 14th because I was so excited about seeing this movie. I would buy tickets to movies just to see the trailer for this movie. I was psyched. And in a matter of two hours and ten minutes, I was shot down in flames.Like ATTACK OF THE CLONES, this movie is horribly written and it is very boring. I know its the first chapter of a trilogy, but at least LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING was exciting!Jar Jar Binks is easily the most annoying character in movie history. Rumor has it he is killed in EPISODE III and that won't be a minute too soon for me. Too bad they couldn't digitally remove Jar Jar from this movie. The only good sequences in this movie are the pod race and the final lightsaber battle. The final space battle was ripped off from INDEPENDENCE DAY (which ripped it off from RETURN OF THE JEDI), so Lucas stole it back.I just cant believe how bad this movie was. After seeing ATTACK OF THE CLONES, I went back and watched THE PHANTOM MENACE a few times and my hatred for it became lessened. I just hope Lucas redeems himself and makes a killer film in EPISODE III in 2005. I give STAR WARS EPISODE I: THE PHANTOM MENACE two stars. (out of four)",Null,0,1,21 December 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," 1 HOUR AND 50 MINUTES OF PURE BOREDOM, but.............................
","I've been noticing a lot of movies I've been seeing lately, you can start them halfway through the movie and not miss a thing. PEARL HARBOR was the most guilty of this; you can start it about an hour and a half into the DVD and you wouldn't skip a beat. STAR WARS EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES goes further. If you have never seen this movie, start the DVD around the one hour, fifty minute mark. Trust me, you'll save yourself an hour and fifty minutes of boredom!After the major disappointment I had with THE PHANTOM MENACE, I said to my friend as we walked in the theatre that May 2002 evening, 'this can't be much worse.' I was right - to an extent. What is so great about the one hour fifty minute mark is when the actual Clone War begins. Let me tell you, this is probably the greatest battle sequence I've ever had the pleasure of viewing. The beach battle at Normandy in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN follows a close second. I have a feeling come around 30 hours from now after I get back from seeing THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS, I may have to rank the Battle of Helm's Deep as the greatest battle sequence in film history.
ATTACK OF THE CLONES picks up right where THE PHANTOM MENACE left off; nowhere. Granted, annoying characters are not rampart in this movie (young Anakin and Jar Jar), but the Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray is as annoying as ever.THE PHANTOM MENACE was a horribly written movie and so is this one. The love story between Anakin and Padme is totally uninspiring. Hayden Christensen's whining and griping got very annoying really quick. I can't believe that George Lucas has made two movies that are making the STAR WARS saga sour for me. Granted, THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK was the best film of the saga and I was hoping AOTC would be the best of the prequel trilogy. I will know the answer to this in about 3 years.Like THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, AOTC ends with a cliffhanger..you have unanswered questions that we will have to wait till 2005 to see. The problem with Episode III is that it is going to have to be LORD OF THE RINGS long. There's no way they can tie everything up in a 2 hour 10 minute movie. Lucas has really blown the first two prequel movies and I hope to God Episode III is a killer. I really really think I am going to enjoy LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS more than AOTC.",Null,0,1,16 December 2002
Pearl Harbor," Half bad, half good
","PEARL HARBOR was really two movies; one part was a horribly written love triangle (that makes the love story in STAR WARS EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES look good) between Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale. The other part was a gritty, in-your-face action packed historical trip back to the early '40s that showed the attack of Pearl Harbor.Like so many movies I've seen recently (HEAT, ATTACK OF THE CLONES), this is a movie that could be started half way through the film and you wouldn't miss a thing. Actually, the whole first half of the film deals with the really boring love triangle mixed in with the foreshadowing that Japan will attack us. If you took out the whole love triangle thing, this would have been a superb movie.As of this point, I will pretend the love triangle (which was most likely thrown in for the DAWSON'S CREEK teenybopper audience) thing didn't exist. What we have here is a great, typical Bruckheimer film that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The action is superb. The performances by Cuba Gooding Jr. and Jon Voight as President Franklin D. Roosevelt were on the money.I would recommend this movie, just skip the love triangle scenes and it will be that much more enjoyable.I give PEARL HARBOR two stars.

Saving Private Ryan," SPIELBERG'S BEST!
","After I saw SCHINDLER'S LIST, I didn't think Stephen Speilberg could top himself. This man is such an incredible director who has given us such classics as RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, E.T. and now SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.I still can't understand how this film did not win Best Picture in 1999. (SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE won) This movie is very violent, but it is violence that is needed to tell the story and make the story realistic. From the opening battle of Normandy, you feel like you are right there on the beach in the battle.The performances in this movie are outstanding. This is Tom Hanks in his best role since FORREST GUMP as the leader of the platoon assigned to find Private Ryan. One of the performances that was underrated was that of Jeremy Davies who played Corporal Upham who makes a fatal mistake with a German officer that comes back to haunt him. Edward Burns was teriffic as well as Private Reiben, who wonders out loud why risk the lives of several men to save one. Tom Siezmore is equally as brilliant as Tom Hanks' #1 man. Even Matt Damon, who I normally do not like, was outstanding.
This is such a terrific film because the characters are developed so well and you feel like you know them by the time the movie is over. The battle scenes are outstanding as well. This is the best war movie I have ever seen.
I give SAVING PRIVATE RYAN four stars. (out of four)",10,0,1,22 December 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," A Masterpiece! Better than the first!
","There have only been a few sequels that I have seen that have been better than the first: TERMINATOR 2, SUPERMAN 2, THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and THE GODFATHER PART 2. Chalk up another film to that list. While FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING introduces us to the characters and begins their journey, THE TWO TOWERS is a 3 hour breathtaking ride of filmmaking enjoyment.While Roger Ebert (who I lost all respect for after he gave that piece of garbage BLAIR WITCH PROJECT four stars) complained there is too much action in the movie, my response is so what? The Battle of Helms Deep was the greatest battle I've ever seen in my life onscreen.This is the movie that George Lucas wanted to make. Like ATTACK OF THE CLONES, this movie splits up the main characters into separate adventures and the transition between the stories is done exceptionally well. The Battle of Helms Deep makes the Clone War battle in ATTACK OF THE CLONES look like a schoolyard brawl. The Battle of Helms Deep itself is worth the nine dollar admission.The other thing I liked about THE TWO TOWERS is Liv Tyler's role is substantially reduced. I saw no reason for her to even be in the trilogy, especially since Arwen plays such a minor role in the book. She was just put there as eye candy for the horny teenage boys.Overall, Peter Jackson has created a masterpiece of modern filmmaking. True, it doesn't follow Tolkein's story to the T, but THE TWO TOWERS is a film that should not be missed. Maybe George Lucas can see RETURN OF THE KING and base STAR WARS EPISODE III on that.I give LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS four stars. (out of four)",Null,0,0,21 December 2002
