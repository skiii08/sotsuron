Blade Runner 2049," Excellent sequel
",Almost as good as the first one. If the director has used the soundtrack from the first Blade Runner would be perfect!,10,3,15,29 December 2018
Bird Box," Fantastically stupid and overrated
","People are losing the ability to create good movies and some viewers are losing or don't even have the discernment to comment about it. I like Sandra Bullock as a actress, but my review is based on the movie and its characters.
The movie is good up to the 30 first minutes, then the story is pure stupidity and underestimates the intelligence of the people that is watching it.
I thought Sandra Bullock got the prize after one of her first movies in witch she made a bus literally jump from the bridge, but this one wins. Being blind with two blind kids going down in a violent river and then running in the jungle is the best. Chuck Norris can not beat that!",2,4,7,29 December 2018
