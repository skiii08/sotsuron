Lucky Number Slevin," Incredible
","Yes, incredible is right because this movie was individual, smart, funny and downright...incredible. OK, so Josh Hartnet, one for the ladies maybe, but he doesn't fail to impress as the supposedly arrogant and lippy Unlucky Slevin, who, by an unfortunate twist in fate, ends up in the middle of war being plotted by two violent gang lords; The Boss and The Rabbi - the excellent Morgan Freeman and Sir Ben Kingsley.Lucy Liu is also at her best as 'the girl next door', whose zany hyperactive behaviour offers amusement and, my new word, lovability. Slevin, despite his dark secret, unwittingly falls for her innocent charm, which seems to erase any thoughts of his dangerous predicament.And there is, as promised, Bruce Willis; who captures the essence of a hardened 'world-class assassin' called Mr. Goodkat. The character is expertly presented by the often stereotyped Willis, who leaves behind his macho, hard-talking, gun-blasting vigilante-like Die Hard - whom this character could very well have imitated - and creates the subtle, quiet-spoken hit-man who's cooler that the North Pole.The plot is also a highlight, with so many amazing twists that the story becomes more enjoyable as it continues. Couple this with the amazing cinematography - flashback scenes mingled with present time situation, and a healthy use of vibrant colour and patterns - and you have one heck of a film which delights in it's own intelligence, and is unjustly criticised because of it.In an age where films are beginning to dumb down for the supposedly stupid audience, i think everyone should stand up and applaud a very versatile, funny and often moving story of mistaken identity in which the viewer is never left feeling like they got the simplest version of events.",9,1,3,16 October 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," as much as i liked star wars...
","..this was crap.Despite what anyone says about this movie being terrific and action-packed, believe a once avid star wars fan when he says; 'this movie made me detest Geroge Lucas.' I mean, come on, the only redeeming feature of the film is the credits, which at least still had some classy likeness to the originals.Of course, i can't criticise Ewan McGregor - he did what he could with such a poor script - because not even Johnny Depp or Marlon Brando could make this film any good.Weeks and weeks i waited for the film, on the edge of my seat excitement! I went to the cinema wanting to see a great movie - instead i got a spoof almost as funny as 'Bored of the Rings' which culminated in the inevitable and resounding crash of a franchise. Seriously, people liked this film - the video game was better and i traded that in after two days! But hey, you might as well see it cause you won't see anything funnier and laughable than Ian McDiarmid (or whatever his name is) screaming for his life as he electrocutes himself - Ronnie Barker couldn't have written it.As for Hayden Christiansen, what a pathetic waste of space. I preferred little Anakin cause he could say his lines in an ear catching way - as opposed to the dreadful monologue which is apparently acting. How much did he get paid for this role? I would have payed him to step down and leave it to the professionals. And as for Mace Windu getting killed by Anakin in such a casual swing of a lightsaber, I think Lucas should be ashamed of himself. What a show of disrespect to the character, easily cut down by a kid, screaming as he falls out of the window - come on!All in all, funnier than Only Fools, but without David Jason and written by a five-year old - yep, that's the extent of it.",1,2,5,31 October 2006
