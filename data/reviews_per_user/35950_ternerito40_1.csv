Skyfall," What a ridiculous plot
","This is by far one of the worse 007 movies. The problem lies mostly with the script. The director was somewhat competent and had a good cast, a great photographer, obviously plenty of money... why pick Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and John Logan as writers will be always a mystery to me.The only good bit of the movie is the opening credits, with Adele's song. The animation in the credits is also first class. Enjoy it while it lasts, it's all downhill from there. The plot is so silly and ridiculous that is not worth spending a lot of time criticizing: try to watch the movie for yourself, and see if you can suspend your disbelieve for more than 5% of the time.The plot: a bad guy got so angry and resentful with M, that he wants to kill her, so he takes any chance he got to shoot at her throughout the movie (there are several of these). Actually, he first had a chance to blow the whole Mi6 place up (which he succeeds in doing), but he makes sure she's not in it first... What?About half way in the movie we learn that M is the target, so what happens? The whole British secret service has no better idea than our own James Bond: let's take M to an isolated house in the middle of nothing. Ah, let's make sure we let the bad guy know where we will be. Brilliant.This movie will stimulate your intellect as much as the latest Batman movie (zero), but without the entertaining special effects. You are just left with astonished actors that can't help having a hard time keeping a straight face delivering the pathetic script they're asked to enact. Bardem seemed to me to be the only one in the cast who, at times, could keep a straight face. Not a small accomplishment since, as the constantly-monologuing-bad-guy, he happens to have some of the stupidest lines in the movie.Can someone please explain why they keep assigning the writing to people who clearly are not up to writing a coherent 12 grade essay? This is becoming a trend in most of this big budget movies, there must be a reason, I'd like to know it.",4,4,18,6 February 2013
