First Man," A superbly crafted drama that gives a fantastic insight to the lead up to the moon landing
","The film 'First Man', directed by Damien Chazelle, is a brilliantly shot and edited film depicting the life of Neil Armstrong up too the infamous moon landing. 
The film uses film grainy footage to give the film a nostalgic feel and is shot mostly in closeups of the characters, creating a claustrophobic feel. Chazelle does not resort to extreme long scenic shots of the space environment, instead choosing to use closeups and extreme-closeups to better understand Neil's perspective of the event. 
The actors all are outstanding in the film, particularly Claire Foy who brings a lot to the character. 
Overall the film was very entertaining, had great pacing and was very entertaining to watch as well as informative. I would highly recommend this film to any lovers of film, however it is very mucj different to the usual style of Chazelles films.
