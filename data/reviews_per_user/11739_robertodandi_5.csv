The Blair Witch Project," Marketing rules!
","When I saw this movie, in Rome at the Barberini Cinema the first weekend, there was almost a riot (whistles and yells from almost all young public). This movie is really disappointing (I`m polite). First, it`s not scary at all. The script wanted carefully to follow the rule `do not show the monster to be scary` but what it obtains is that it doesn`t show ANYTHING worth watching. Second, the interesting idea of the story is the part we all saw in the trailers and commercials. The story in the film adds a little more and not always unexpected: in conclusion BORING. Third, the camera work, in the attempt to appear `real`, is unpleasant (most scenes are shot while walking or running and this causes something like the sea-sickness). If I can forgive the neorealistic movies, the intellectual French movies, the Danish DOGMA movement for this is only because they can offer something back and the naive camera work adds something to the overall art of the movie. But here? The post-movie question was: are we really all stupid to be cheated by a commercial? The answer was: yes. But only this time.It`s another proof that a good (excellent) marketing is enough to make money in this business. Don`t waste your time and money watching this boring, useless, unneeded movie.",1,2,4,5 June 2002
Gremlins," don`t grow up so fast, please
","This movie is really funny even if its genre could be considered horror or sf. The cute little Gitzmos can change into murderer gremlins only adding some water. Some of them appear as little punks or heavy metal-fans or members of street bands that like so much to drink, break everything and kill human beings. Maybe the message is that it is really simple to transform our sons into punks or let them degenerate into psycho-killers, drunk or madmen and to ruin even the most clean and organized society... it`s enough some water more than necessary... don`t grow up so fast, sons! we want you all obedient and cute like Gitzmo!",Null,0,1,2 June 2002
Spirited Away," go and see this movie
","I loved 'princess mononoke' (the previous film of this director) and I love this one, even if less strongly. This is a strange movie, probably not targeted to a children audience, because there are some disturbing scenes and some hidden messages that can be faced only with an adult mind. Which kind of messages? First, I think that there is the idea (already present in Mononoke) that nature is good and industrialised world is bad. You can see this by comparing the two terrible big-nosed sisters of the movie, where the first runs a factory-like bath for spirits, the other one lives inside the nature and is far more good than the previous one. Another message is that our industrialised, capitalistic world has something wrong. I don't know if the director is left-wing or even communist but what I feel is that he - being a creative person - dislikes factories and tayloristic/beaurocratic organisations such as those shown in his movies. Low-level workers are like those little black balls that bring carbon to the fire for the rest of their lives. Or at least this is the message I want to see. Finally something related to the recent economic situation of Japan. The father says that what they are in is probably an amusement park that, with the advent of the economic crisis of first '90s, now is in abandon. The struggle of his daughter to find a job is something that probably now has become very present in Japan (as well as in Europe) due to this economic crisis. The movie thus becomes the representation of the end of childhood, when one has to get a job and become independent from its parents, who are accused to have lost country whealth, to have eaten all what is good (and destined to the spirits - that is 'the nature') and to have become pigs.I see those messages, but maybe I'm wrong and just so 'European' (that is cervellotic) and I want to see messages everything also where there are not.However in general this is a strange and maybe disturbing movie but I suggest every adult to see it.",Null,0,1,19 May 2003
Moulin Rouge!," 9/10
","I am not a fan of musicals. I often avoid to see them at cinema, but sometimes I see them on DVD and regret my choice. There are many musicals that can be considered the best movies ever: The Blues Brothers, Jesus Christ Superstar, The Rocky Horror Picture Show to name a few.This is a beautiful musical, too, that can compete for quality with the above mentioned ones, even if I voted 9 for this (my favorite ones are perfection). First the music is great. It has so many famous songs rewritten to fit in the script. I was delighted especially by the 'Like a virgin' scene and by 'Show must go on' (I'm always touched when I hear this magnificent song. It tells a lot of life and death and can be considered the most impressive testament by Freddy Mercury. One of my favorite songs ever). The initial song (I knew a boy..) is also very touching.So, the music is great, the script is funny and well written, the direction is wonderful, the actors are great, Nicole is sexy and as good as usual. But Jim Broadbent (the owner of mouline rouge) is the best actor in the play. He creates a character that you cannot easily forget.Don't miss this movie in DVD. 9 out of 10.",9,4,5,17 January 2005
Army of Darkness," absolute fun
","I`m still laughing when I remind the protagonist, how much is borious, ignorant and his I-can-fix-all-don`t-bother-me-with-your-bla-bla-bla style. To make this film they`ve spent probably a lot of money (good fxs) and it`s definitely worth watching even if you missed the previous EVILDEAD movies (they aren`t related so much with this).",10,1,1,2 June 2002
