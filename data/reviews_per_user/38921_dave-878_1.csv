Requiem for a Dream," disturbing,intense,powerful,brilliant-a must see film....
","This film is absolutely brilliant!! I saw this film today and was simply blown away by it! It is the best film I have seen to date that deals so intimately with the horrific effects of drug addiction on the mind and body. Darren Aronofsky's directing is nothing less than superb throughout the film. The final fifteen minutes or so in the film is fittingly powerful. The collaboration in directing and editing in this climax to the film is astounding and unforgettable. It is certainly intense and wonderfully highlights the film's central theme. The musical score in 'Requiem for a Dream' is frighteningly good and certainly one of the strongest points of the film.The cast were all excellent. However, it was Ellen Burstyn's mind blowing performance that stole the show. Her portrayal of a woman addicted to weight loss pills is, I believe, one of the most powerful and unforgettable performances in years and it was certainly the best of the year 2000!Anyway, this is one of my favourite movies of the year. A definite 10/10.",10,0,0,22 February 2001
