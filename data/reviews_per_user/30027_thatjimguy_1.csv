United 93," A truly emotional experience
","I don't think I've had such a profound movie experience since I saw the first half hour of Saving Private Ryan. This film does not tell a story, but rather transports the viewer into the events of that that day. I left the theater with a sense of loss for the passengers of that flight. Like D-Day in SPR I intellectually knew what was going to happen, but seeing it so skillfully brought to the screen I could feel it on a visceral level. I could not help but remember where I was and what I was doing on 9/11. There has been some controversy regarding this film in that some people consider it exploitive. I got no such impression from this film. It deals with the subject matter with the utmost respect. These are real people in a harrowing situation. There are no Hollywood heroics in this movie. I am thankful that I have never found myself in any situation remotely similar to this, but if I ever do, I sincerely hope that I can comport myself a fraction as well.If you thought the days of meaningful art had left the cinema, or want a truly emotional experience I urge you to see this",8,4,9,1 May 2006
