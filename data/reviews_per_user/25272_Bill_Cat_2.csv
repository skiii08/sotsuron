Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This was Star Wars?
","I actually thought it was more like a 'Barney Goes to Space' video.  It was targeted way too much towards the very young audience, which makes it easy to watch but just not fulfilling for an adult who believes 'cute' belongs in Barney videos, not Sci-Fi movies.",1,3,6,13 January 2000
The Mummy," Cheesy. Just cheesy.
","The special effects were great, however it's hard to see them with your eyes rolled in the back of your head -- because of the super-cheesy lines and sight gags.  The comedy that was injected into this movie really just did not fit for me.",3,1,2,13 January 2000
