Requiem for a Dream," Wow...wow wow wow wow wow...(wow)
","Well when i saw this movie i really did know nothing about it i knew it was supposedly one of the best films of the millennium but i really didn't have high expectations...but when i finished it...i was speechless it was to be honest one of the most flawless movies i've ever seen...The Performances were honestly breath taking...Jared Leto's Performance towards the last 15 minutes of the film was bone chilling...The hospital scene of which he is being amputated really made me take a look at how affecting drug abuse can be...Ellen Burnstyns performance was really a life changing role...what Darren Aronofsky gave her was a very hard character and she executed it perfectly...and lastly...Marlon Wayans, well seeing Marlon wayans in other box office smashes such as...Scary movie 1...Scary movie 2...and White Chicks i was extremely surprised that he would be cast in a movie like this and i didn't expect a lot of him but however i got a s*** load more than what i expected...The script was also what i thought quite amazing...Darren Aronosfsky and Hubert Shelby Jr. portrayal of Hubert's book was i think quite hard to do..your looking at a book which really was a work of art and your have to turn it into your piece of art work without people saying the previous piece of artwork was better...and i think they really executed their version...well Hubert's second version into another piece of what i can say beauty.The cinema-photography by Matthew Libatique was really the pedals on a bike..it complemented the score so well i really could not imagine any other shots for the unique score...i also have to say I've seen a lot of shots like what i saw in RFAD but none of them were as well executed as Mr. Libatiques Portrayal...in the scene when Tyrone is fleeing from the Italians after they assassinated one of Tyrone Bosses in a limo the cinema-photography scene there is really what i can say textbook film making.Clint Mansells score was pretty surprising...not that didn't expect it to be good but i only just realised that those famous pieces of score have been used commonly in many Film adverts such as :Lord of the ring the two towers. I guess what that really shows is his effort into making this film he really did put his heart and soul into The many minutes of score and what we got back was really the heart of this Amazing film...Darren Aronofskys direction was what i think one for the year books he made essentially the most unique flexible and Moralitive storeys ever told and i think without Darren Aronofskys heart and soul I wouldn't be spending i good deal of my time writing this so that really i can share the story that he has told...",10,1,2,20 December 2008

","Firstly, i cannot believe that empire magazine said it was 5 star! For crying out load this film makes Zombie nation (the worst movie voted by IMDb)look like the GODFATHER!

No Country for Old Men," Oscars beware Javier Bardem is coming.....
",With out a shadow of a doubt that is simply the best supporting role I have ever seen if they don't give him an Oscar I'm going to kill the academy! First of all i absolutely thing that the people who think there will be blood is better then this is either in a mental hospital or has some sort of disease and is extremely delusional. The cinema-photography is unbelievable and what also make it even more amazing it is the first film credited to have Joel and Ethan directing. the first time i went to see it i had to sneak in to the movie i really thought it wasn't going to be that special. but when the credits went up i was star struck!!! I have to say in the quiet words of Paris Hilton This is hot There will be blood it not.,9,3,8,12 February 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," well....
",Well...Let's Just say i'm 12 years old...the first time i watched it i was 7 now i still watch it every single day. NoT many words can describe Lord of the Rings some of them maybe Mesmerising Unbeilevable...But for me it was pro bely the most Effecting movie i have ever witnessed. When i watch it i always get goosebumps...ALWAYS never once have i not been star struck by it. Now to all of you Tolkien Haters out there who call LOTR nerdy lets just say F*** YOU!!!! Now honestly i recommend these movies to pretty much everyone. Now I admit that there are too many endings(6 to be precise) but who honestly gives if you spend 5 years of your life loving this movie intensely no matter how many endings it has they will all make you cry.,10,1,2,27 May 2008
