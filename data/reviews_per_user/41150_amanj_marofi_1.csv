Scarface," Yes
","Yes,this is one of the best movies i have ever seen. Everything in this movie is perfect. It's maybe a little sad at the ending. But it is still so good that i don't't have the words. This should be in top 3 for best movies. As i said, i don't have any word to say to this movie, it's unbelievable. Al is playing like a GOD. He is one of the best actress i have seen in my life. Any one who has seen this movie, they all have to give it a 10. Because is the best. Just like The Godfather and the other top 10 films. Only this is to god. I don't know what to say, and everybody else is playing good. And just the name should get a 10, 'Scarface'. Tony Montana is a GOD. So please give this movie a 10.",10,0,1,30 November 2006
