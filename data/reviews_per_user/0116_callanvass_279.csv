The Devil's Advocate," Great fun all the way,I didn't care for the ending too much,however this is a very solid film with two amazing performances from Al Pacino and Keanu Reeves
","This is great fun all the way, I didn't care for the ending too much, but this is a very solid film, with two amazing performances from Al Pacino and Keanu Reeves. All the characters are cool, and the story is pretty good, plus Al Pacino and Keanu Reeves are simply amazing in this!. It does run a little too long,and I wish they would have kept the ending where Kevin rejects Satan instead of the typical predictable ending, however those are minor things as I really enjoyed this movie, plus I must give credit to Charlize Theron as well she gave a fantastic performance!. Reeves and Theron had very good chemistry together, and some moments really surprised me, plus all the characters were extremely likable. It actually has a couple of pretty creepy scenes, and Pacino is wonderfully OTT, plus this is one of Keanu's best performances in his career!. It's very well made and written, and this movie gets surprisingly bloody at times! plus Connie Nielsen is great and super sexy in this!. This is great fun all the way, I didn't care for the ending too much, however this is a very solid film with 2 amazing performances from Al Pacino and Keanu Reeves, I highly recommend this one!. The Direction is very good!. Taylor Hackford does a very good! job here with excellent camera work, good angles and keeping the film at a fast pace. The Acting is wonderful!. Al Pacino is amazing as always and is amazing here, he hams it up big time and is totally OTT, and I absolutely loved it, he was so much fun to watch, and really seemed to be enjoying himself, he also had some wonderful lines, and played one of his coolest characters!, I loved him!. (Pacino Rules!!!!!). Keanu Reeves is also amazing as always and is amazing here, he gives one of his absolute best performances, had very good chemistry with Charlize Theron, is fantastic in the acting department, was on top of things, was very believable and had plenty of charisma to spare! (Reeves!!!!!!!). Charlize Theron is stunningly gorgeous and is fantastic here,she played a cool emotional character had very good chemistry with Reeves, and while it may be dwarfed now due to her incredible performances in her recent Oscar worthy films I still consider this to be a fantastic performance! (Theron Rules!!!!). Connie Nielsen is extremely sexy and did very good with what she had to do I really liked her. Judith Ivey is great as Kevin Lomax's mom, and was quite intense at times I liked her. Craig T. Nelson is fantastic in his small role, and while he didn't have much to do, his great screen presence was always felt. Jeffrey Jones is good as Eddie. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall I highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5",8,1,2,5 January 2006

Insidious: Chapter 2," A very worthy sequel that delivers thrills and chills in spades
","After surviving the traumatic ordeal from the first movie, the Lambert's are hoping for a fresh start. Renai (Byrne) is interrogated by a detective over the supernatural events that took place in the first movie. Renai moves the family into her Mother's (Hershey) house, hoping to leave the past behind. Renai suspects that her husband Josh isn't himself. Renai is haunted by a malignant supernatural force, Josh is battling demons of his own. With the help of Elise's partners, Specs & Tucker, Renai must save her husband before it's too late. As a fan of the original, I didn't really see the need for a sequel. It ended things too darkly for a sequel to be necessary. That being said, I was still somewhat psyched to see it. Much to my surprise, this sequel was very entertaining in many ways. It stays true to the terrific atmosphere that served the first movie so well. This is old-fashioned suspense at it's finest, and who better than James Wan at the helm? The man is a true visionary, and knows how to make you squirm in your seat. He uses great tactics such as doors slamming, eerie sounds, and some terrific mind games. James always had a trick up his sleeve, and forces you to use your imagination. One thing this sequel has going for it more than the first are the ghosts themselves. The mother of Parker Crane (The Lady in White) (Very well played by Danielle Bisutti) gave me the willies and was one of the reasons I had trouble going to sleep after I watched this movie. James Wan did risk making the ghosts over exposed, but he knows just the right times to use them. I'm not scared easily, but this movie definitely made me uncomfortable to go to sleep after I finished watching it. On the downside of things, this sequel does go the typical sequel route. It has to be bigger and badder, much less subtle than the original. Also, I thought the finale ran a little too long. It tried to throw in too much at once and I felt it lessened the impact a bit. It got a bit too simple and lazy, unrealistically tidy as well. The ending paves way for another sequel. To be perfectly honest with you, I'm not sure I like where this series is heading if the ending is any indication. The acting is exceptional. Patrick Wilson's plight is one of the reasons this sequel was as efficient as it was. His character is forced to delve much deeper than the original, having much more to play with. I enjoyed his storyline a lot. I loved how he pulled a Jack Nicholson from the Shining in the finale as well. Rose Byrne is fabulous and a very strong heroine. I was on her side the whole way. Lin Shaye and Barbara Hershey don't have as much to do, but shined when they were on screen. This sequel exceeded my expectations and then some. It isn't quite as good as the first, story isn't strong enough. As far as scares are concerned, this sequel outdoes it. Despite some hiccups here and there, this sequel is well worth the watch. You'll find many things to like if you're a horror fan7.5/10",7,0,0,7 June 2014
The Avengers," Simply Incredible!
","Loki is looking to unleash hell down on earth and make people bow at his feet. Nick Fury is forced to assemble the world's greatest superheroes, in hopes of saving everyone. The Avengers must put their egos aside to make everything right again and stop Loki. I'm hoping to see Age of Ultron later this week. In preparation for it, and to get myself more pumped, I decided to watch The Avengers again for the fourth time. This movie has almost everything you can possibly imagine. Ever wanted to see Thor face off against The Incredible Hulk? How about Thor fighting Iron Man? You'll get that here and more. If you're not fond of some of the superheroes in this movie, there is plenty of others to choose from. It really is a Marvel fan's wet dream. It's one thing to make great action, it's another to combine that great action with near-flawless storytelling. Joss Whedon manages to pull this off. This must have been an incredibly hard script to write! Whedon manages to deal with the pressure to give us a thoughtful script. I loved how the first 30 minutes or so focuses on introducing each character. I thought it was really neat how they delved into what everybody was going through at the time. The action scenes may take your breath away. I'm what you call an adrenaline junkie. I've seen tons of action movies, but there aren't many that make my jaw drop like this one. The last 40 minutes or so are filled with mind blowing action. It rarely gives you a chance to breathe. The performances are excellent. These superheros may have incredible abilities, but they have flaws. The character development was superb. Robert Downey is awesome as Iron Man. His obnoxious behavior tests my patience, but he is perfect for Iron Man. Captain America isn't my favorite by any means. Chris Evans is great at playing him though. He even manages to make him somewhat likable! Chris Hemsworth is tremendous as Thor. Mark Ruffalo isn't the best Hulk, but he does a really good job nonetheless. Scarlett Johansson was my favorite! She has a lot of depth to her character. Her checkered past, and reluctance to be a heroine made her character all the more interesting. She also has some great fight scenes. Wait until you see the stunts when she's tied up in a chair. Tom Hiddleston is amazing as Loki. He is so manipulative, smarmy, and I couldn't stand him. If you hated Loki in Thor, you'll hate him even more here. What a job! Samuel L. Jackson is the epitome of coolness. Jeremy Renner is very good as Hawkeye. I wish they'd have delved into his struggle a bit more, but I won't carp too much. Clark Gregg, Cobie Smulders, Skarsgard, Paltrow, all do what they have to do well. This movie is the closest thing to perfection. I can't see Marvel topping this. This is one of my favorite movies of all time, and it never fails to blow me away. I'm so pumped for Age of Ultron10/10",10,3,8,29 April 2015
Angels & Demons," |Spoilers| Not as polished as The Da Vinci Code, but it's OK.
","Angels&Demons is a film I was very much, half and half on. It looks spectacular ,locations are absolutely beautiful ,but it's just lacking too much substance. I will be the 1st one to admit that The Da Vinci Code, is a bit slow paced in scenes. And I noticed how they tried to to make the pace a lot better this time around, only it left a lot more plot holes, as a result. I have not read any of the Three Novels ,so It's not really right for me to criticize. I am a big fan of Ewan Mcgregor's, but he seems to be heavily miscast though, as Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, he just seemed off. Ron Howard has abandoned the low key suspense, into a more thriller orientated film. Gone, is the know it all Tom Hanks. Instead we get Tom Hanks in 'smart' Action hero mode, it just didn't seem right. I didn't exactly care for the big twist at the end, either. The film spent so much time, making Camerlengo to be the good guy, and the hero at the end, and well to be perfectly blunt, it left me feeling cold. The film's action at the end, is without a doubt a sight to behold. Never have I seen an explosion like that, leave such a jolt while I've been watching a film. Angels&Demons is decent entertainment to be sure, but it just didn't engage me like The Da Vinci Code did. Performances. Tom Hanks is solid ,but unspectacular here. His portrayal of Robert Langondon, Doesen't have the depth that it did in the original, but he still managed to produce plenty of charisma. He's somewhat in Action hero mode here. And while that's not necessarily a bad thing, it kinda seemed out of place. Ewan McGregor is miscast as Camerlengo. His accent was really odd, and he just seemed clueless to the whole shtick. Ayelet Zurer is a poor woman's Tatou. She Doesen't have the charisma that Tatou has ,and ended up giving an impression, more then anything else. Stellan Skarsgård is excellent as Richter. The man is full of intensity and unpredictability, I enjoyed his performance.Bottom Line. Angels&Demons is an OK film, that I personally didn't find to be anywhere near as engaging as The Da Vinci Code. The Da Vinci Code was far from a masterpiece ,but it produced more suspense and a more engaging storyline. Angels&Demons falls flat for the most part. Still there is some decent stuff here, to make this a decent rental, but not anything more than that.6/10",6,0,1,7 January 2010
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Even better then the original in my opinion as its my favorite of Tarantino's along with Pulp Fiction, with an emotional finale and outstanding performances!
","This is even better then the original in my opinion as its my favorite of Tarantino's along with Pulp Fiction, with an emotional finale and outstanding performances!. All the characters are just wonderful once again, and the story is brilliant, plus Uma Thurman, David Carradine and Daryl Hannah are all simply amazing in this!. OK granted there is nowhere near as much as the amazing action that the 1st had, however while Kill Bill is one of my favorite films, I just felt the story was better here, plus it was cool to see the opening fully this time!. To me the finale was one of the most emotional I have seen in a long time, and i'll admit I was sad to see Bill go, plus the dialog is just brilliant. For me it was very different from the 1st film, and a gross out scene for me is when Beatrix plucks out Elle's eyeball and squishes it with her foot!, plus the buried alive scene was great but rather disturbing as well. The fight scene between Ellie and Beatrix is now one of my personal favorites and the training scenes with Pai Mei and Beatrix were really cool as well, plus David Carradine's superhero theory was really cool!.It was awesome to see Beatrix bonding with her daughter and I really dug the relationship between Uma and Carradine as they had fantastic chemistry together, plus the ending was just perfect. Even at almost a 140 minutes it's never over long and Uma Thurman gives an even better performance this time around! plus Michael Madsen's character was really cool as well!. It's extremely well made and written, and I loved how they gave Carradine, Hannah and Madsen a lot more to do this time! plus the music is very good in this once again. Like the 1st Kill Bill this deserves to be in the top 250 and while I couldn't stand Pai Mei's character Chia Hui Liu did his job extremely well! plus it has many surprising and shocking moments throughout!. All the characters are extremely likable once again , and while the main fight between Beatrix and Bill was disappointing and too short, it fit the film well, however it's nowhere near as violent as the 1st!. This is even better then the original in my opinion as its my favorite of Tarantino's along with Pulp Fictionm with an emotional finale and outstanding performances, and if you haven't seen it and loved Kill Bill like me do so immediately you shouldn't regret it!.The Direction is once again practically flawless!. Quentin Tarantino does a perfect job here with amazing camera work, wonderful angles, good use of colors and lots of other stylish and cool shots as well, plus he kept the film at an extremely fast pace!.The Acting is incredible!. Uma Thurman is stunningly gorgeous and is amazing as always, she is even better this time around, kicks that ass, had some great dialog, had fantastic chemistry with David Carradine, was incredibly convincing in her emotional scenes, was really likable, and it was cool to see more of her past this time around,she was amazing! (Uma Rules!!!!!!!). David Carradine is amazing here as Bill, he gave a charming show, had some very classy lines, had fantastic chemistry with Uma, and I was really sad to see him go, I was so happy they gave a lot more to do here! (Carradine Rules!!). Chia Hui Liu is extremely convincing as Pai Mei unfortunately I couldn't stand his character, he was extremely unlikable and cruel to Uma's character, much too arrogant and classless, still that's what his job was and he did it very very well. Michael Madsen is fantastic as Budd, he was funny, and had a really cool character I liked him a lot. Daryl Hannah is extremely hot, and is amazing here, she was so evil, and I absolutely loved it, I wish she didn't go so soon though!. Samuel L. Jackson has a cool cameo (Jackson Rules!!!). Rest of the cast do fine.Overall If you loved Kill Bill then please go see this if you haven't, you shouldn't regret it!. ***** out of 5",10,3,7,28 December 2005
Vertigo," Vertigo is a haunting masterpiece from Hitchcock. It's almost mesmerizing with its storytelling (SPOILERS!)
","There are spoilers in this review, so don't read on if you feel it'll ruin your viewing experienceScottie almost dies during a roof chase on foot on the roofs of the building in San Francisco. Unfortunately, the cop that tries to save Scottie ends up plummeting to his death, and Scottie is unwilling to accept what happened, and suffers from a condition called Vertigo. Scottie retires after these events, but he ends up getting an offer from a good friend named Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore) to investigate his wife's (Kim Novak) increasingly erratic behavior. Gavin seems to think she is being possessed by the spirit of Carlotta Valdes. Scottie reluctantly agrees to follow Madeline around. He develops an uncontrollable infatuation for Madeline. He saves her from drowning in the San Francisco Bay, and the two have a romance, and fall in love. Madeline's erratic behavior leads to her death at the bell tower of the church, where Scottie is unable to save her, because of his fear of heights. Scottie's devastation doesn't go away, until he meets a woman named Judy Barton, who is an uncanny resemblance to Madeline. Scottie becomes incessant with wanting Judy to dress and look like Madeline, and falls in love all over again. What Scotty doesn't know is he is in a web of deception. It's really hard to fathom how critics lambasted and slandered this film when it was first released. After a thrilling opening, involving a chase on a roof, which sets the tone for the rest of the movie, a true movie lover should notice right away that they are in for something spectacular and special. Not only was it was way ahead of it's time for what it was going for, but Vertigo is one of the greatest thrillers of all time. It rivals Psycho & North by Northwest, and Rear Window as Alfred Hitchcock's best film. I really loved Vertigo's dreamlike atmosphere, with all the visuals. Not only is it near flawless with the storytelling, but it is also tremendous visually. It's deliberate (Or as I like to call it, thoughtful) pace, gives us much more time to get to know our lead hero. Scottie (James Stewart) is a flawed hero, one with a huge fear of heights, and a syndrome called Vertigo. He's a regular, everyday human being, and one we can all relate too. Stewart is easily able to elicit sympathy from the viewer, because of the predicament he has gotten himself into. I thought the scenes where Scottie stalks Madeline (Kim Novak) were not only chilling, but thought provoking as well. As the stalking scenes continue to commence, you start to see Scottie's job begin to turn into a precarious obsession. His infatuation veers toward an uncontrollable desire to be with Madeline. It was really engrossing to watch James Stewart's character evolveThe cinematography deserves a lot of praise for still holding up to this day. We get various colors, and many beautiful images throughout the movie. James Stewart is simply a revelation in this movie. Even when he veers towards obsession, you can't help but feel for the guy. I felt James Stewart did a tremendous job with everything. His romance with Kim Novak is deeply felt to the point where I often couldn't keep my eyes off the two. James Stewart is especially phenomenal in the second half as his obsession grows. His depression and obsession with Kim Novak is something that chilled me to the bone. It's one of the greatest, and one of the most tragic romances in the history of movies. The two were almost hypnotizing to watch at times. Kim Novak's beauty is peerless. Her manipulative, yet at the same time, lovable performance as Madeline is unforgettable. Her vulnerability as Madeline was amazing, and so was her sorrowful performance as Judy Barton. She was absolutely magnetic at times, and amazing to watch. It's impossible not to be attracted to her. I'm not sure which pair I loved more, Scottie & Madeline, or Scottie & Judy. Both were amazing in different ways. Barbara Bel Geddes (Midge) is not only likable, but funny as the girl who has a major crush on Scottie. The ending of Vertigo is absolutely heartbreaking in every sense of the word. It felt like everything crumbled down around me, and I was just beside myself in a way. I sat on my bed with a blank expression on my face, and tried to process everything that just happened. It's one of the greatest movies in cinema history. Those that call it overrated, I feel sorry for. I respect people's opinions, but this is the definition of a masterpiece, and I can't praise it enough. If you haven't seen it, what the hell are you waiting for? Get to it! you won't regret it10/10",10,2,4,12 October 2013
Walk the Line," 'Hello I'm Johnny Cash'. I Am Still In Awe, Over This Movie, If Joaquin, Reese Don't Win Oscars, And It Doesn't Win Best Picture I Will Be Seriously Irate
","I am still in awe over this movie, if Joaquin, Reese don't win Oscars, and it does not win best picture I will be seriously irate. All the characters are fabulous, and the story is just amazing, plus Joaquin Pheonix and Reese Witherspoon are simply incredible in this! and give two of the best performances I have ever seen!. I am also stunned by Joaquin and Reese's singing, I had absolutely no clue that they could sing that incredibly well!, plus Joaquin had all the mannerisms of Johnny Cash down perfectly, just the way he walks, the way he does things with his guitar, his voice, it was just jaw dropping!.Hell Reese was so good that she is actually way better then most of the singers out now a days in my opinion, and the music was just a blast to listen too, plus Reese and Joaquin had some of the most amazing chemistry I have ever seen!. But it's not all about music, it has an extremely gripping story, as we look into Johnny's major drug addiction, which was fascinating but also disturbing at the same time, and the opening is very memorable, plus Robert Patrick is amazing as the cold somewhat heartless father of Johnny. All the characters are extremely likable, and The ending was simply awesome, as it left me with a smile on my face!, plus it's brilliantly written and made as well. This is unquestionably one of the best movies i have ever seen, and while I didn't care for Ginnifer Goodwin's character(Vivian Cash), she played her role very well, plus I found myself having the urge to clap after it was over. The scene where Johnny is confused, and is trying to get the stuck tractor out of the mud, is actually quite powerful, and the film also has some great humorous moments such as Johnny's band and the other singers getting drunk, with Reese chucking bottles at them all. To be quite honest, the reasons I went to see this film was to see what all the fuss was about, and i'm a huge fan of Reese Witherspoon, and also to see How Joaquin played Cash,and I must say I agree with everyone who raves about this film!, plus James Mangold deserves an Oscar for best Director!, in my opinion. There are plenty of shocking and surprising moments, and even though it's over 2 hours, you won't be bored as the film is extremely gripping and engrossing!, plus it was funny seeing a very young Elvis Presley. I loved it when Joaquin and Reese sung duets!, and I also loved the part near the end when Johnny sings at Folsom Prison, plus Jonny and June are so likable you will find yourself rooting for them!. My review for this may not be too popular with most reviewers however, I just loved it that much, as it's now one of my favorite movies!, plus I really do hope this film cleans up the Oscars!. I really can't see why anyone would hate this film, it's got everything you want, perfect story, incredible Oscar worthy performances, fabulous music, and lots more!, plus while I am happy that well over 2000 people have voted this a 10 I am absolutely shocked and appalled that 114 people have voted this a 1. I am still in awe over this movie if Joaquin, Reese don't win Oscars, and it doesn't win best picture, I will be seriously irate!, and if you haven't seen this, please go to the theater and check it out immediately you won't regret it it's now one of my absolute my favorite films.The Direction is masterful!. James Mangold does a masterful job here, while nothing really Fancy, it was still masterful, as he kept the film at an extremely engrossing pace. The Acting is no doubt Oscar worthy, with two of the best performances ever!. Joaquin Phoenix Is just incredible here, and unquestionably gives one of the best performances in the history of the Cinema, his chemistry with Reese is seriously amazing, and just the way he had all the mannerisms down on Johnny Cash perfectly, he is also an incredibly good singer, and sounded a lot like Cash in my opinion, i will never forget his chilling performance, if he does not win an Oscar, then i will be seriously irate because he deserves it!(Joaquin Rules!!!!!!!). .Reese Witherspoon is amazing as always, and is just incredible here, she is incredibly gorgeous, had amazing chemistry with Joaquin, is also an incredibly good singer, and for the people that thought she was miscast you were dead wrong, she was just as good as Joaquin, and gives one of the best performances ever!,as she is my favorite actress, give her an Oscar already!, she was just spellbinding on screen, i couldn't take my eyes off her! (Reese Rules!!!!!!!!!). Ginnifer Goodwin is really excellent as Vivian Cash, however her character really got on my nerves as i thought she was spoiled and real selfish, however she still played the role with perfection!, and had good chemistry with Joaquin. Robert Patrick is amazing as Johnny's Dad, he was cold and heartless at times, and had a lot of trouble forgiving Johnny with what happened to Jack he was really intense he deserves a lot of recognition for his performance here.Shelby Lynne(Carrie Cash),Tyler Hilton(Elvis Presley),Waylon Payne(Jerry Lee Lewis),Dan Beene(Erza Carter),Ridge Canipe(Young J.R.),Lucas Till(Young Jack Cash), all do wonderful with what they have to do.Overall It's one of the best films i have ever seen, and is now one of my absolute favorites SEE IT!. ***** out of 5",10,5,12,9 December 2005
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," In my opinion?..A Boring,unfunny 84 minutes of my life,that I will never get back!.
","Borat I guess is an acquired taste of humor,I obviously failed to get in every aspect. I was bored senseless through most of the stuff,with his attack on all of the American people getting quite irritating. I am not familiar with Sacha,nor have I seen any of his skits,but from viewing this film,I certainly didn't like what I see. I'm not an American,I'm a Canadian,but why is it just because people wanna make fun of the Americans,it's an automatically funny idea for a movie?. It honestly gets tiring for me after a while,I mean how many times have we seen this kinda thing?...plenty if you ask me!. Sacha himself is really hard to get into. Most of his humor was not to my liking at all,all the stuff Borat goes through to go see Pamela Anderson,was unfunny and crude. Thankfully there are a couple of howlers in this film. One is when Borat goes into the hotel lobby talking all hip,the other had to be when he finally meets Pamela Anderson at a signing,that was definitely a scream. But I just couldn't get into this,it wasn't my kind of thing,others will probably love it.The Performances. Sasha Baron Cohen to some is a beloved icon for this movie,I on the other hand fail to grasp why he's so funny. He's often arrogant,crude and dis likable,maybe my opinion will change if I enjoy Bruno.Bottom Line. Borat is an unfunny piece of entertainment if you ask me. While it's beloved by many for it's shocking antics and bizarre humor,It isn't beloved by me.4/10",4,1,4,25 December 2009

This is a brilliantly made film, that's funny, and actually had a few suspenseful moments, plus the comedy was brilliantly done!. All the characters are awesome, and i really loved the dialog, plus Gizmo was so adorable!. Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates have excellent chemistry together, and the finale was fantastic, plus the ending was cool.There are many over the top moments, and all the special effects were awesome, plus Dick Miller was really funny in his role!. The characters are really well developed, and there are plenty of laughs to be had, plus the bar scene was great!. This is one of the best Horror/Comedy's out there in my opinion beautifully told, and i say everyone must see it!, absolutely everyone!. The Direction is brilliant!. Joe Dante does a brilliant job here, with excellent camera work, great angles, and keeping the film at a very fast pace!. The Acting is great!. Zach Galligan is excellent here, he is extremely likable, had excellent chemistry with Phoebe Cates, seemed like a really neat guy and was charismatic!. Phoebe Cates, is gorgeous, and does fine with what she had to do i really liked her, her chemistry with Galligan was also on. Hoyt Axton was good here, he had a great presence to him i liked him. Keye Luke is awesome as the grandfather i loved him he also looked really cool!. Corey Feldman has barely anything to do he did okay i guess. Dick Miller is hilarious here, wished he had more screen time though. Polly Holliday plays the bitch to perfection i hated her. Judge Reinhold looked bored here, and for good reason he is barely in the film!. Frances Lee McCain is good as the mom. Howie Mandell is amazing as the voice of Gizmo. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall See it right this instant! a true classic. ***** out of 5",10,0,2,8 July 2005
Mission: Impossible III," Mission Impossible III, delivers the goods in a big way. It has much more depth ,then the usual Action film.
","Mission Impossible 3 is not only,much better then the barely above average,Mission Impossible 2,but it also manages to give a an excellent action film,like Mission Impossible,a worthy sequel. The action sequences are truly a sight to behold. It's honestly been a long time coming,since I have been absolutely floored,by the action sequences. The ingenious,emotional beginning,completely sets the stage for the entire movie,because it makes you wonder,why they are showing part of the finale at the beginning. What really surprised me was the pure emotion,in Mission Impossible 3. The mind games between ,Ethan and Davian ,are very suspenseful,and creates a ton of suspense. We are back to the Ethan we fell in love with in the 1st one. He's not superman anymore,he's not doing any fancy kicks in mid air,or causing chaos with his motorcycle. This Ethan were able to root for,and it's rare in an action film these days,that you care so much about the two central characters. At the time Tom was in a lot of hot water,for his outbursts on drugs and Scientology,along with his couch jumping antics. I personally don't see how that should have affected the box office results.Tom's charisma can never be denied in my opinion. Whether you like him or not,he attracts movie Goers. It's just a perfectly well made action film,that should please Action lovers all around the world.Performances. Say what you want about Tom Cruise,but i'm a guy,and even I can proudly say, he is one of my favorite actors. This Ethan is a changed man. We see he Doesen't wanna do what he does anymore,he is through. He's a family man,who loves his wife dearly. It was a great change of pace for Tom,and he pulled it off beautifully,with his charisma. Philip Seymour Hoffman is excellent as the villain. He is brutally cold,and I couldn't take my eyes off of him,when he was on screen. His scenes with Tom were absolutely chilling. Michelle Monaghan is a gorgeous sight to look at,and manages to be a much better option,then Thandie Newton,even though I enjoyed her. She felt more real with Tom,I believed in there love,and most importantly,I rooted for them at the end. Michelle is able to pull off her role,with believability,and conviction. Ving Rhames&Jonathan Rhys Meyers&Maggie Q make a terrific MI crew,for Tom. They all had excellent chemistry together,and I thoroughly enjoyed there performances. Simon Pegg adds some great comic relief,as Benji. Billy Crudup has the most mysterious role. He played it low key,and gave a decent show. Laurence Fishburne is class as always,and managed to inject charisma into his role. Keri Russell does fine,with the screen time she has.Bottom Line. Mission Impossible 3,is the real sequel if you ask me. It's action packed,with a lot of great emotion,and suspense. Check this one out with confidence,and have a rollicking good time!.8/10",8,1,2,5 January 2010
Captain Phillips," A HUGE letdown
","How in the world is that rated so highly? This is nothing more than manufactured Hollywood BS! The tension that everybody raved about rarely happens. There are brief moments of tension, but nothing is sustained. It all felt phony. Even when Phillips is captured, there isn't much suspense. It's all done in routine fashion. After it was over my initial reaction was 'That's it?!' I felt severely cheated. For a movie that's over two hours long, nothing really garnered my interest. I'm a big fan of Hanks, but his performance isn't anything special. As a matter of fact, he overacted. His final scene is embarrassingly overacted. As much as I like Hanks, this isn't one of his best performances. Barkhad Abdi is solid in his role. This movie left me feeling cold. Many will probably scratch their heads reading this review.

The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Impressively bleak and mature, but pacing issues hinder the impact quite a bit
","(Credit IMDb) The Quileutes close in on expecting parents Edward and Bella, whose unborn child poses a threat to the Wolf Pack and the towns people of Forks.I saw this over a year ago, so my review may not be up to standard. I don't hate Twilight as many people do. I think most of them are watchable and mildly enjoyable (Aside from Breaking Dawn Part II) I can either take them or leave them. I like Kristen Stewart a lot, despite her bad reputation. I have to give this movie credit for exploring mature and controversial themes. There are quite a few scenes where it is quite unpleasant. Considering the cookie-cutter nature of this series, I was impressed by the mature subject matter. The honeymoon scenes with Stewart & Pattinson are corny, but admittedly enjoyable if you can get into the stuff. I'll always stand by my opinion that Bella has more chemistry with Jacob. It's just the way I see it. The birth scene is fitfully disturbing. I wasn't repulsed, but I did feel slightly uncomfortable. Kristen Stewart steps up her game as Bella, while Pattinson & Lautner do their thing. It does get a bit draggy at times with some pacing issues, but overall, I didn't mind it at all. It's far better than the mediocre part II. This is a crappy review, but if you like the other Twilight films, you'll enjoy this one.6.2/10",6,0,5,14 December 2013
The Longest Yard," Pretty good for a remake!
","Paul Crewe (Sandler) was a former star quarterback, but was banned for life. He gets too drunk one night and steals his girlfriend's (Courtney Cox) car. He's busted for a DUI and sent to prison. The Warden asks him to assemble a football team to compete with his. The Warden gets more than he bargained for when Crewe's team is much better than expected. I really think this movie is as good as the original. It's got plenty of laughs, a decent script, and more importantly, it's entertaining. This is not one of Sandler's 'Paid vacation' movies. There is a lot of thought put into this movie. They use the original's formula, but add their own touches as well to make an enjoyable combination. There is also some great football action as well. Football fans should be at least fairly impressed by some of it. My only big complaint is the crappy rap music. The performances are surprisingly fun. I'm a fan of Sandler's. He can be very funny when he wants to be, but he has been p**** me off a lot lately with the awful comedies he's churning out. He has become really lazy. That laziness is non-existent here. He's still Adam Sandler, but the passion is there. He's funny and makes for a fun lead. He's no Burt Reynolds, but I enjoyed him. Burt Reynolds pays tribute to the original by playing Nate Scarborough. He was a lot of fun and added presence to this movie. Chris Rock is actually amusing as Caretaker. His banter with Sandler was enjoyable. James Cromwell is excellent as The evil Warden. Nelly doesn't embarrass himself, delivering a decent performance. Wrestlers like Stone Cold, Goldberg, Kevin Nash, and The Great Khaili show up. Nash is hilarious. Rest of the cast is good. If you've seen the original, you'll know how this one ends.I thought it was just as good as the original. What's not to like? You have laughs, action, football, among other things. If you like the original, I see no reason to not like this remake7.2/10",7,0,2,29 April 2015
Source Code," Ambitious, and skillfully acted, but I didn't buy the contrived ending
","This was alternately engaging and disappointing. I was very engrossed with everything that was going on. It was suspenseful right from the outset, but it turns into clichÃ©s. I'm wondering if they were forced to change the ending or something, because the ending feels extremely artificial. I get why they did it, but it just didn't seem to fit. Was it the right choice? Sadly, yeah; I think audiences would have walked away deflated after such an ambitious film, but that doesn't mean I liked it. I actually liked this movie for the most part. Jake Gyllenhall was absolutely tremendous, and I was on his side the whole way. It's a terrific performance. Michelle Monaghan is a naturally gorgeous woman and provided great support as the love interest. I enjoyed her a lot. Vera Farmiga is one of the best actresses to come around in a long time. I loved her show as the helping hand. This movie does make you think quite a bit, so be prepared to put your brain to use. You'll be thinking about it for a little while afterFinal Thoughts: I think this is a movie that deserves multiple viewings. It's suspenseful, engaging, but I didn't buy into the finale. Maybe it's time to give this movie another watch. I enjoyed it for the most part, so I'd be more than willing to watch it again. 8/10",8,0,0,2 September 2013

All the characters are awesome, and I really liked the ending, plus Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks are simply amazing in this!. All the characters are extremely likable, and it's often very suspenseful and hilarious, plus Martin Sheen cracked me up as Brenda's dad!.

Christopher Walken is wonderful as the dad, and I felt bad for DiCaprio's character when his parents were getting a divorce, and he ran away, plus it's extremely well made and cleverly written as well!. The opening was quite creative, and the dialog was quite awesome as well, plus Tom Hanks knock knock joke was very funny. It keeps you guessing throughout, and Tom Hanks and DiCaprio had some wonderful scenes together, plus this deserves it's 7.6 rating!. This is an excellent piece of entertainment from Spielberg, as I throughly enjoyed it, with an engrossing story and amazing performances, and I say it's a must see for everyone!. The Direction is top notch as always from Steven Spielberg. The Camera work, is awesome, the angles are fantastic and he kept the film at a very engrossing pace. The Acting is amazing!. Leonardo DiCaprio is amazing here, he really had a brilliant character, and had plenty of charm and likability, and while I admit to not seeing a whole lot of his movies he was really amazing here, and managed to carry the film with ease, as I absolutely loved him!. Tom Hanks is amazing as always and is amazing here, he is extremely likable,even funny when he was mostly serious throughout the film, has some great scenes with DiCaprio, had a very cool character, and some terrific dialog! (Hanks Rules!!!!!). Christopher Walken is wonderful as the Father, he was funny, extremely likable, was perfect for this role, and just did a wonderful job overall, I just wish they gave him more screen time(Walken Rules!). Martin Sheen is hilarious as Brenda's dad, he clearly was having a hoot, and as a result I did too! (Martin Rules!!!!). Nathalie Baye is good as the mother I liked her. Amy Adams is cute, and was quite perky as the love interest I dug her. James Brolin is OK in his small role, wish he had more of a part.

Rest of the cast do fine. Overalll a must see for everyone!. ****1/2 out of 5",9,4,7,8 February 2006
The Hangover," The Hangover is great and raunchy fun!. It's one of the best comedies to come out, in a while.
","The Hangover was a movie that everyone hyped about, to be one of the best comedies to come out in ages, and I agree!. I'm very picky on Comedies now a days, because most of them turn out to be the same old stuff. The Hangover takes raunchiness to the next level here, I was amazed at how far they went, past the line. They even go as far, as to joke about a baby, jerking off!. What really makes The Hangover though, is the likability of the 4, and the astounding chemistry they have. Each one of them is different, but funny and likable in there own way. I enjoyed the Rain man spoof very much, with Phil and Alan, it was very funny and cute. I also really enjoyed The Las Vegas scenery, since it reminded me of my trip. It's also one of those movies that surprises you, because despite the hype, the trailer didn't look all that impressive to me. There are so many unbelievably crazy moments here, it's insane, if you like off the wall humor, you will love The Hangover. It's raunchy, it's dirty and just plain fabulous!.Performances. Bradley Cooper has shown the ability, to be a great versatile actor, I mean the guy is in everything now a days. He is funny, while remaining the cool sport of the bunch, always wanting to have a blast. Ed Helms is a hoot as the nervous wreck, always worried about what his girlfriend will do, if she finds out. He's the nerd of the bunch, but instantly likable, and very funny himself. Zach Galifianakis is insanely funny as Alan. He's clearly off his rocker, but that is what makes him so funny. Justin Bartha, does not have as much screen time as the others, but makes a big impact himself, when he is. Heather Graham is a favorite of mine, due to her beauty and versatility. Here she is great fun, while being a likable support. Jeffrey Tambor is funny as Alan's dad. Ken Jeong tested my patience once again, he was funny in doses I suppose. Mike Tyson is actually sporadically amusing with his screen time, I was really surprised, with his adequate performance, I see potential in him. Rachael Harris plays the funny, yet nagging woman to a T.Bottom line. The Hangover really does live up to most of the hype. It's one of the funniest movies, I have seen in some time. It's raunchy, it's nasty, and downright Magnifique!. I'm all for the rumored sequel, I can't wait to see what these guys do next. Highly recommended.8 1/2 /10",8,1,2,7 February 2010
Iron Man 3," It has issues, but the action definitely entertains you. It's a big step up from Iron Man II
","I really enjoyed the first one, but couldn't stand the second movie. In all honesty I wasn't looking forward to this one very much. Tony Stark is an abrasive hero, and I can either take him or leave him. This movie was a bit overlong, but I did enjoy it to a certain extent. I really liked how they made Tony Stark's character so vulnerable in this movie. He had so much to lose, and they went a bit of a different route. Tony isn't always arrogant in this movie. He has a lot of feelings, and many fears. They explore Tony's anxiety issues in this sequel, and I thought that was pretty ballsy. I was able to get behind the character more this time around because of it. I felt there were too many villains in this movie. It goes down the road of Superman 3 a little bit with how many villains it has, and ironically enough. I enjoyed Iron Man 3 as much as I enjoyed Superman III. It just felt like they were trying to stack the insurmountable odds for Tony Stark in this one. The women are especially underdeveloped. Why was Rebecca Hall here again? She looked great, but doesn't have much of a part. Gwyneth Paltrow plays the charming, damsel in distress for most of the movie before her character gets an admittedly cool twist in the finale. I'll just say it was a lot of fun. She even gets to be Iron Man succinctly in the beginning. How cool is that? It's just too bad I didn't feel much emotion from Downey & Paltrow when it came to their respective characters for their romance. Guy Pearce makes for a decent villain. Ben Kingsley feels wasted. Don Cheadle's patriotic Iron Man suit impressed me, but that's about it. The action is where this movie is at. It has many great action scenes, scattered throughout, but the finale is often breathtaking. It's filled with big stunts, explosions, and some amazing stuff. I definitely wasn't disappointed in the abundance of actionFinal Thoughts: This is a big step in the right direction. It's very flawed, but it has enough going for it to be an entertaining blockbuster. I'd be down for a part 4, as long as it's quality7/10",7,0,1,19 November 2013

This scared the crap out of me, and i thought the effects were awesome, plus the finale was great!. Both This and The original Japense version Ringu are extremely scary, and i think this is one of the best American remakes ever!, plus i thought it was brilliantly written as well. Naomi Watts and Martin Henderson had excellent chemistry together, and the character development was very good, plus David Dorfman and Daveigh Chase are both extremely creepy as the kids. The opening is one of the scariest things i have ever seen, and it was constantly unpredictable, plus the images were quite frightening!. This is quite simply one of the scariest movies i have ever seen, simply brilliant in all aspects (in my opinion), and i say drop what your doing immediately and go see it!. The Direction is brilliant!. Gore Verbinski does a brilliant job here, with jaw dropping camera work, fantastic use of colors, constantly adding scary atmosphere, creating very scary images, great angles, and keeping the film extremely scary throughout!. There is a tiny bit of blood and gore, but this movie is not really bout that. We get lots of creepy images, very scary disfigured faces,fingers cut on glass,tongue vomited out,nail through finger,bloody nose bleeds,bunch of severed fingers, melting corpse, and other minor stuff. The Acting is amazing!. Naomi Watts is STUNNINGLY GORGEOUS! and is AMAZING as usual. She is extremely likable, vulnerable, had excellent chemistry with Martin Henderson, was constantly on top of things, was intense, and really gave a stellar show! (Naomi Rules!). Martin Henderson is excellent here, he is also extremely likable, had excellent chemistry with Naomi Watts, had a good sense of humor, and just did an excellent job overall!. David Dorfman is great and very creepy as the son, his eyes really gave me the creeps, and did what he was required to do extremely well!. Brian Cox is great and very intense in his cameo, he was awesome!. Daveigh Chase gives a very memorable performance as Samara and scared the crap out of me big time!, the scene where she walks in from the TV, is one of the creepiest things you will see (a little scarier in Ringu, but it still scared me very much!). Shannon Cochran was great in her scenes as the mother, i liked her lots. Amber Tamblyn Rachael Bella were both hot, and did there jobs well. Rest of the cast do awesome.

United 93," It's well made no doubt about that. Rather manipulative though, and not as impactful as it's made to be.
","United 93 is a movie I had heard people rave about for years, due to it's shocking realism, and the impact it makes on you. Well it did make an impact on me, but I had many problems with this, when all was said and done. In my opinion, this seemed to be really exploitive, and an attempt for the film makers, to cash in on what happened at 911. Personally I think this is a tragedy that didn't need to be revisited, and should have been left alone respectively. The actors in this movie, look like just that, actors. I didn't sense any realness to them, and the movie didn't give me enough to care as much as I should have, when the movie was finished. I'm a Canadian, but I was deeply affected to what happened on 911, like a lot of people were, it's just this movie Doesn't do it any justice. The Arabiacs often complain about injustice, and the treatment directed towards them, that America gives them. Well it's there own fault, by doing what they have done, they have dug there own grave, ruining it for a lot of other innocent Arabiacs. United 93 left me feeling a little empty, and cold, after it was over. It was a well made movie, but not worthy of all the acclaim it has gotten.Bottom line. United 93 is an effective, but over-hyped movie about the 911 events. It has many flaws, and as I said, left me feeling a little empty, when all was over. It's well worth a viewing, it will make an impact on you, but it wasn't the masterpiece people said it was.7/10",7,1,3,11 February 2010
Deja Vu," Excellent thriller, that I really enjoyed, it's exciting and unpredictable, Denzel is wonderful in it! *minor spoilers*
","Deja Vu is a very exciting thriller, that I enjoyed very, very much, it had everything I wanted, and gave me an ending I didn't expect, plus I have always loved back in time films, so this one was no different!. Some people complained about the endings, but I personally liked it, as it wasn't too happy, yet not too sad either,so I think it was perfect for people who hate happy endings, yet people who hate sad ones as well, plus The opening was really cool, and quite disturbing. James Caviezel is the perfect villain for the film, and it has some good twists and turns as well, plus It's quite unpredictable, as you never know what's gonna happen next. One thing that irritated me is when Claire points the gun at Denzel as that just annoyed the hell out of me for some reason, and the finale will have you on the edge of your seat, plus there is a really wicked and unique car chase scene as well. Overall an excellent thriller, that I throughly enjoyed I say it's a must see for everyone!. ****1/2 out of 5The Acting is excellent. Denzel Washington is amazing as usual, and delivers yet another top notch performance in a thriller, he is intense, and focused and also very likable, this guy is one of the best actors in Hollywood today, and can pull of any role, and he shows it here!. Paula Patton is OK here she's definitely gorgeous, but got on my nerves with her character, as she made some stupid decisions. Val Kilmer is surprisingly adequate in his role I am usually not a fan but he did alright here. James Caviezel is excellent as the villain, he was menacing in his screen time I just wish he had more of it. Adam Goldberg is very good as Denny, he brought humor and class to the film I loved him. Elden Henson is good I remembered him as Fulton from the Mighty Duck movies. Bruce Greenwood is OK in his role and always plays a good prick.",9,3,5,28 June 2007

This is a movie that requires a lot of concentration, because it's one of those films you have to pay strict attention too, and the plot is seriously awesome, plus one of my favorite moments in the film is when Cruise chases his own eyeballs!. This is up there with one of Spielberg's best films and believe me he has done a lot of brilliant movies, and This is one of Cruise's finest performances,plus it's full of awesome twists and turns so don't blink!. It's extremely well made and written, and for once I agree with Roger Ebert's review!, plus you will really root for Cruise's character throughout. I loved those little mechanical spiders, and I thought that ending was just wicked! plus while i'm not a huge fan of Colin Farrell he did a fantastic job here and really impressed me!.Max Von Sydow was also excellent, and the special effects are simply stunning, plus the chase sequences are awesome as well!. I saw this a couple years ago and was unimpressed, however after upon 2nd viewing, I must say It deserves it's praise, so if you didn't care for it the 1st time, give it a second viewing, you may change your opinion.This should honestly be in the top 250 in my opinion, and there are some fantastic creepy moment as well, plus I loved the depressing atmosphere it had at times, and This is almost like The Fugitive except it's set in the future, plus It also has some very funny scenes in it as well. Cruise had excellent chemistry with Samantha Morton, and I especially loved the dialog, plus some scenes really had me on the edge of my seat!.

Steven Spielberg does a spectacular job here with amazing camera work, fantastic angles, awesome use of blue,excellent lighting,great slow mo shots, and plenty of other uncanny shots as well, plus he kept the film at an extremely engrossing pace.The Acting is incredible!. Tom Cruise is amazing as always and is incredible here, he gives one of his finest performances, is extremely likable , blew me away in his emotional scenes, had great chemistry with Samantha Morton,as always had lots of charisma, and has really matured as an actor, and if you don't think he can act watch this movie! (Cruise Rules!!!!!!!). Max Von Sydow is excellent here in his role, he brought tons of class, was especially good at the end, and had some awesome scenes with Cruise!, I loved him. Colin Farrell is fantastic here, I am not a big fan, but he certainly was good here, he held his own against Cruise, and really gave a good show I liked him a lot. Samantha Morton is awesome as the creepy psychic chick, she gave a great show, and had very good chemistry with Cruise. Lois Smith is good in her scene as The Doc I liked her. Neal McDonough is good as Fletch I just wished they gave him more to do. Kathryn Morris is good as Cruise's wife I really liked her.

Gravity," I have to tip my hat!
","Due to all the hype surrounding this movie, I decided to stay away from it. I like to go into a movie with my head clear and my expectations low. I dislike movies that are 'oscar bait' Some of them try way too hard, and I end up being very disappointed. The wait ended up being longer than I expected. Every time I'd go to watch it, something would come up. Gravity is a case of style over substance. The story engrosses you until the end, but It's not gonna be remembered for the story. The tension and suspense are so high, it manages to make you forget that the story isn't anything special. There are some moments that truly startled me. It also takes advantage of an ideal setting. I'm not huge on films set in space. Some of them move way too slowly. That being said, being trapped alone in space is one of the most terrifying things imaginable. It's an easy recipe for success, making the viewer constantly uncomfortable with all the tension. Near the beginning of the movie, Ryan (Bullock) is asked what she likes most about being in space. She replies 'The silence! I could get used to it' foreshadowing what will happen. The visual effects are as good as advertised as well. The performances are top-notch. Sandra Bullock has always been a favorite of mine, but she's really become a fantastic actress. She owns every single scene she's in. Her plight was a fascinating story to watch unfold. Despite that I had to suspend disbelief by how much bad luck she was in, it added to the suspense. She conveyed all her emotions perfectly, and she showed the right amount of vulnerability and courage. In my opinion, Clooney is highly overrated. He certainly adds presence here though. His smart-ass persona made things livelier with some timely humor. There is also a big twist about him, which I didn't see coming at all. It also made me doubt if it would end happily or not, which is rather impressive, considering it isn't easy to keep me guessing.When the end credits rolled, I was mostly pleased. It's SLIGHTLY overpraised, but admittedly an impressive achievement. I was rather surprised how short this movie was. I thought it was a good decision though. This movie taught me to appreciate life, and to never give up. It's a great spectacle that everyone has to see at least once. Try and ignore they hype, you'll be better off that way.8.7/10",8,1,2,29 April 2015

This movie really messes with your mind and really makes ya think, and it's no date flick that's for sure. This made me squirm in my seat couple of times. The ending is especially chilling and trust me you won't see it coming, it's very unpredictable and will make you feel uncomfortable (in a good way. there is plenty of shocking blood and violence. We get a corpse with a huge pool of blood around it , blood on a window, plenty of bloody disturbing imagery, LOTS of nasty looking corpses, nasty stitched up corpse, corpse without a stomach (nasty) gory photos, corpse with no arm, severed hand in a jar, bloody beatings and more!. The acting is Oscar worthy (in my humble opinion). Morgan Freeman is absolutely stunning here and there is no doubt his performance was Oscar worthy he and Brad Pitt had AMAZING chemistry together and was EXTREMELY likable. Brad Pitt is AWESOME here and did a VERY good job and his character was really likable and was great in the emotional scenes. Gyneth Paltrow is GORGEOUS and does excellent as David's wife. Kevin Spacey is VERY good here however i am not saying another word. R. Lee Emery does what he has to do well.

You have to pay strict attention while watching this, as you will most likely get lost if you don't!, plus I still can't get over the ending I didn't see that coming at all. This is one of Bruce's best performances ever!, and I really feel M. Night Shyamalan has the potential to be one of the best directors out there plus the finale is especially great!. It really does have quite a few creepy moments, and I loved the flashbacks of David when he had the car accident!, plus all the characters were extremely likable. It's full of twists and turns, and Spencer Treat Clark is surprisingly excellent as Joseph (David's father!, plus one of my favorite moments in this film is when Joseph loads the gun and is threatening to shoot David (Willis),as it was extremely tense and somewhat disturbing. This is a slow but very rewarding film, that's fascinating to watch! with incredible performances, and one of the best twist ending I have ever seen and I say Go see it immediately!. The Direction is wonderful!. M. Night Shyamalan does a wonderful! job here, with brilliant camera work, superb angles,giving the film a moody and somewhat depressing atmosphere, and lots of other cool shots as well, plus he kept the film at an extremely engrossing pace!. The Acting is incredible. Bruce Willis is amazing as always and is incredible here, he is extremely likable, very low key (But in a good way), emotional, had very good chemistry with Spencer Treat Clark, gives one of his best performances , and really seemed to be into his role, he was just perfect I was rooting for him all the way (Willis Rules!!!!!!!). Samuel L.

(Jackson Rules!!!). Robin Wright Penn is great as the depressed wife I really liked her. Spencer Treat Clark is surprisingly very good here as the kid, he was non annoying and quite likable, and I really enjoyed the relationship he had with Bruce!.

As Good as It Gets," For a Romantic Comedy, this is As Good as It Gets!.
","As Good as it Gets is a fabulous Romantic Comedy that is refreshingly original and delightful to watch. Jack Nicholson's abrasive but endearingly hilarious portrayal of Melvin Udall is wonderful, and his great, yet oddball type chemistry with Helen Hunt is one of the main reasons this movie works so well. I laughed very hard when Jack Nicholson would crack on Greg Kinnear's character, and make fun of him for his gay beliefs, or get jealous when he saw Helen Hunt hanging around Greg. My main problem with many of the romance movies now a days, they are all too predictable and they are basically the same old thing, with just a different storyline. As Good as It Gets refreshingly changes that trend with its creativity. The ending to this movie was one of my favorite things about this, it was just so cute and so cool to see something done so different, yet very romantic at the same time.Performances. Jack Nicholson is a revelation as Melvin. His grumpy Schitick is just a joy to watch in every way, and proves he can even do Romance well!. Helen Hunt is excellent as the love interest. Her vulnerable yet sassy show often captivated me, and her chemistry with Nicholson was consistently on the ball. Greg Kinnear is not a favorite of mine what so ever, but he did terrific here as the gay man. His whiny, yet wonderfully funny performance was great, I especially enjoyed his scenes with Nicholson. Cuba Gooding Jr. is great in support.Bottom line. As Good as It Gets deserves the recognition it gets, as it's truly a great romantic film. Hollywood needs to look at this movie more, and see what it takes to make a good Romantic Comedy. Highly recommended.9/10",9,2,4,9 May 2010
The Maze Runner," Bring On The Sequel!
","I've never read the book, but I saw considerable praise for this movie. When my friend and I decided to see this movie, I had decent expectations for it. I expected a well made movie with a fair amount of thrills and action. Not only did I get that, but a lot more than I bargained for. This is a very well made movie that has solid storytelling and lots of intense action. The action scenes are filled with tension, building the suspense very efficiently. There are some fantastic chase scenes that had me on the edge of my seat especially the one involving Tomas and a Griever. I was blown away by the performances in this movie! Considering I had only seen a couple of the actors in other things. Dylan O'Brien is excellent as our hero, Thomas. I've never seen Teen Wolf, but he was great here. Kaya Scodelario is really good as well and played off O'Brien very well. The rest of the cast is just as good. Even Patricia Clarkson has a brief role at the end. The only minor complaint I had is that it was rather simple to figure out where this was heading. I picked up on it pretty quickly, but I still enjoyed the ride. The ending was quite satisfactory, filled with emotion and suspense, setting up the sequel nicely. This is the best movie I've seen in theaters this year. Even if you aren't familiar with the book, you can still have a great time. I don't see how you can possibly dislike this movie, but that's just me. It's well worth the money to see it in theaters. 8.3/10",8,1,4,26 September 2014
Inglourious Basterds," Simply put, not my type of movie.
","I've always had a love and hate relationship with Quentin Tarantino. Some of his work i've adored, others no so much and this falls into the latter category. I guess it helps that I had really no interest in the whole storyline, while I also thought a lot of the performances were way too over the top. The brutality is up to part with a lot of Quentin's work, the set pieces are impressive but in the end it just ended up boring me. Eli Roth is great in his twisted role, I especially loved his Ted Williams impersonation from The Red Sox when he hit someone with a bat, but Brad Pitt didn't deserve his critical acclaim if you ask me.Bottom line. Some will undoubtedly love this, others will hate it, I definitely hated it. Tarantino lovers should see it immediately, casual viewers may want to look for something else, it's all to personal taste.3/10",3,4,8,24 May 2010
Underworld," Rather disappointing effort for the genre, not without a fair amount of merit though.
","I've seen Underworld twice now, and I'e enjoyed it twice. It's got some great action bits, memorable characters, and it moves along at a great clip, what's the problem you ask? well I just feel it wasn't as good as it could have been. I've always loved the idea of Vampires Vs Werewolves and this movie was just brimming with it, I just felt disappointed by it all. The finale is a memorable one, with a great showdown between Viktor|Nighy| and Selene|Beckinsale|. The gore level is pretty decent, with some nice effects, and not an abundant amount of CGI like I expected.Performances. Kate Beckinsale is gorgeous to look at, and makes for a great anti heroine. She's got the right amount of emotions, the kick ass attitude, and the proper attire to look right. Scott Speedman is decent as Michael, but not as refined as he is in the sequel. Michael Sheen is intense as Lucian, I dug him. Shane Brolly played a great, yet intense weasel. Bill Nighy stole a lot of the scenes he was in, with his frighteningly intimidating performance. His scenes with Beckinsale were endearing.Bottom line. Underworld is a decent way to pass the time, but It's not as good as it should have been. I'll admit I was disappointed, but all I want from a movie is to be entertained, and for the most part Underworld got the job done on many occasions. Well worth a look.6 1/2 /10",6,0,2,22 March 2010

This Is the End," Despite all the self awareness, I didn't think it was nearly as funny as people are saying
","After glowing reviews for this movie, I was rather excited to see this movie. I wasn't able to watch it in theaters, so the long wait was finally over. I was rather disappointed with the movie as a whole. It's not nearly as clever as it thinks it is. It's very self aware, with many jabs amongst the cast. Some of them are very amusing, and a lot of them fall flat. Favorite was probably the crack about Seth Rogen playing the same character in every movie. I like Seth, but that is kinda true. I was not a fan of the lewd humor in this movie. I've gotten tired of raunchy comedies for the most part. I did enjoy some things about it though. Emma Watson going nuts was fun, as was Michael Cera's small role as a coke snorting fiend. Another problem I had was my dislike of some of the cast members. I don't like Craig Robinson, James Franco, and I can't stand Jay Baruchel. I will give credit to both Seth Rogen and Jay Baruchel for having solid chemistry, but it doesn't change the fact that Jay belongs nowhere near the upper echelon of comedic actors. Danny McBride was the worst, though. He relies on being as offensive as possible to generate laughs, without being naturally talented. Some scenes run far too long. Jonah Hill's spoof of The Exorcist was painful to witness, and ran on far too long for my liking. It is pretty ballsy at times. The rapture storyline was pretty controversial. And I can definitely see why Christian's would get offended by it. It didn't offend me personally. I found it to be rather brave, but I can see how it would irk some. Everyone is playing an exaggerated version of themselves here. It's hard to rate the performances, when that is the case. Seth Rogen probably came off as the best. It has many Celeb cameo's such as Rihanna, Channing Tatum, and as mentioned. Emma Watson & Michael Cera. The finale is my favorite part of the film by far. It has some great gags. This is worth a watch. It does make you laugh, but there is far too much inconsistency in between. This movie did make me wanna do one thing. I'm gonna go listen to some Backstreet Boys! 6/10",6,0,3,28 October 2013
Dawn of the Dead," One of the best remakes i have ever seen *Spoilers*
","One of the best remakes i have ever seen. While it's not as good as the original it's still EXTREMELY awesome in it's own right. It's not as intelligent or as thought provoking as the original but it makes up for it with TONS of action and TONS of gore (although not quite as gory as the original). I LOVED most of the characters especially the main 2!!. This is a actually a bit different then the original yes it takes place in a mall like the original yes the 2 main leads are very similar to the original, But in the original the zombies were slow these zombies are EXTREMELY fast and they Run! very fast. I have not seen the original theatrical cut just this one (frankly i don't think i missed much!. The effects are AMAZING!!!. The blood looks VERY real and the zombies look absolutely fantastic. The direction by Zack Snyder is terrific great closeups of the zombies great shots of the mall awesome camera angles. There is TONS of gore. We get Very messy looking zombies, 2 people get HUGE chunks of skin bitten off them with lots of blood spurting, some people are covered in blood, some guy gets run over graphically with an ambulance, zombie with no arm, guy with all of his guts showing then we see some gut munching (VERY Briefly) an arm graphically gets cut, stick jammed through the chin and out the top of the head , a HUGE bloody gash on someone's arm, nasty stitching sequence, TONS of people's brains get smashed in when hit by trucks (very messy), nasty bite on someone's hand, spear through the eye, blood on walls, zombie with no legs, nasty birth sequence, exploding head, TONS of extremely gory and graphic gunshot wounds to the head with blood and brains splattering, TONS of bloody gunshot wounds, a few people get there legs sawed off with a chainsaw (VERY gory) chainsaw to the shoulder with tons of blood spurting, and LOTS more gunshot wounds. The acting is GREAT!. Sarah Polley is STUNNINGLY GORGEOUS! and does awesome here she is focused and does awesome in the dramatic scenes i LOVED her!. Ving Rhames is the man! and did awesome here, was loads of fun to watch!. Jake Weber was very good here and had pretty good chemistry with Sarah Polley and was a likable guy!. Mekhi Phifer does decent here but his character kinda annoyed me and wasn't on screen much. Ty Burrel did great with what he had to do. Michael Kelly at first was VERY VERY Unlikable (although he did it very well) but he turned out to be a okay guy. Lindy Booth is GORGEOUS! and does great here i liked her lots. Overall SEE IT THIS INSTANT Don't wait any longer if you have not seen it. By the way look out for cameos by Tom Savini and Ken Foree, and one of my favorite moments in the film was when they had fun with the look alike zombies!. ***** out of 5",10,3,7,20 December 2004
Iron Man 2," Loud, incredibly obnoxious, and boring,
","I enjoyed the first immensely, it was an entertaining blockbuster, but this is overkill. For starters, Downey's arrogance went beyond my limits. I couldn't stand his Tony Stark portrayal, and the action scenes were overblown. For over two hours, I was bored and annoyed senseless. A sigh of relief came over me when it ended. Also, what happened to the shy, lovable Pepper Pots? This one is whiny, annoying, and constantly bickers with Stark. The Villain Mickey Rourke who is usually a good actor is given a ridiculous Russian accent. Weak script doesn't help matters. Only really cool scene was the race track scene with Downey and Rourke. Downey is OK, but much too annoying here, perhaps he saw dollar signs when he read the script or something, because how he accepted this is beyond me. Mickey Rourke should be ashamed. His Russian accent is entirely unconvincing, and he basically sleep walks through the part in my opinion. As I stated earlier in my review, Gwyneth Paltrow's character heads in a different direction, and not a good one. Don Cheadle is miscast, and is no match for Terrance Howard. Scarlett Johansson is sexy, and charming, but wasn't on nearly enough for my liking. Samuel L. Jackson has a couple of decent scenes. Sam Rockwell is decent in his role.Final Thoughts: I haven't been this disappointed since Transformers 2, a boring; money making machine with no soul \4/10",4,3,5,22 August 2013
Alien: Resurrection," Boring, and unnecessary in every way. The real Ripley died in 1992.
","Credit IMDb 200 years after the conclusion of Alien 3, the company is able to resurrect Ripley through the process of cloning and the scientists successfully take the Queen Alien out of her. But, Ripley's DNA gets mixed up with the Queen's and she begins to develop certain alien characteristics. The scientists begin breeding the aliens, but they later escape. Soon the Xeno-morphs are running amok on the ship, which is on course to earth. The Queen then gives birth to a deadly new breed of alien, which could spell disaster for the entire human race. It's up to Ripley and a band of space pirates to stop the ship before it reaches earth.Where do I begin? For starters, where's the effort and passion I saw in the first three movies? It's nowhere to be found here. The Aliens, while visually impressive, appear way too much throughout the film, and the essence of surprise is gone. The first Alien was so great, because it always seemed to lurk in the shadows. We never really got a full glimpse of it, and when we did, it was terrifying. I dug the Ripley bonding with the Aliens, but there isn't much else. Grating characters, overblown action, and too much CGI ruins it. Ripley's character meant nothing to me here; it was cold, just like the film itself.Performances. Sigourney Weaver actually does very well, considering her thin part, and it was fun to see a playful side of hers, but it doesn't change the fact I couldn't get into her character, and it was thinly written. She has traits of the original Ripley, and I know it was duly documented that it wasn't the original, but I just felt so cold by her part. Her charisma with Ryder was actually above average. As such an admirer of her role in the first three, it was disappointing to see her go out this way. Winona Ryder was actually good in my mind. I've seen plenty of criticism with her performance here, but I liked it. She showed the right amount of emotion and vulnerability. Dominique Pinon is annoying as the guy in the wheel chair. I felt no sympathy, and he got on my nerves quickly. Ron Perlman is funny, and annoying at the same time. His constant yelling made me wanna shut him up though. Gary Dourdan's role is cool, but that's about it. Dan Hedaya can play these types of roles in his sleep. Brad Douriff is a hoot in his role.Bottom line. Couple of good moments is not enough to just barely maintain this above the Mendoza line. It felt like a pure cash in. No heart, no soul. They should have stopped at number three.4 ½ 10",4,0,2,9 April 2011
World War Z," Flawed, but fairly entertaining for the most part
","I thought this movie was decent. That's the key word, decent. Zombies are rather big these days, since Walking Dead exploded onto the scene. These zombies aren't from the old school, that's for sure. They are fast, vicious, unrelenting, and absolutely unruly. They also do this creepy little convulsion thing as well. Even though this movie was almost two hours long, I did feel that the movie was rushed a little bit, especially with the zombies. While they are fast and vicious, they are perhaps a little too fast. What made George Romero's original dead trilogy so effective is that it was carefully thought out. The action is often quite exciting, but it doesn't know when to fully slow down at times. Zombie carnage is often all over the place, and it became a bit much for me. I realize this movie is vastly different than Romero's vision, but I still felt things moved too fast at times. It does have a fantastic airplane sequence which is truly thrilling, but I was a bit disappointed. I also would have liked more scenes with Pitt & his family. The first 35 minutes or so was riveting stuff. They felt like a real unit, and I was fully immersed in their plight. Then Brad Pitt leaves them, and that's when it starts to wane a little bit. While the action doesn't know when to slow down, the middle of this film doesn't know when to increase the pace. The middle section is slightly plodding. Not much gore here to speak of, either. Brad Pitt was excellent. I have nothing but great things to say about his performance here. His strong willed character and the ability to shine when the pressure is on made him all the more endearing. I'm not a big Brad Pitt fan, but he was awesome as the lead. He was the perfect family man. Mireille Enos had a subtle way about her that made me love her. Her performance as the Mother was great. I really do wish she had more screen time, because she was very good. I must give special mention to the daughters in this film, played by Sterling Jerin & Abigal Hargrove. It's a rarity that I like kid actors, but I adored both of them. David Morse has a bit part as well.Final Thoughts: I know I've critiqued this film a bit, but I did enjoy myself for the most part. It is rushed at times, but it made almost two hours pass nicely. It's far from perfect, and it does have issues, but it's definitely above average. Well worth a watch. I'd be up for Brad Pitt kicking some zombie ass again for World War Z II. 7/10",7,3,8,23 October 2013
The Hunger Games," Overlong, but an engaging and enjoyable start for the franchise
","Like most adaptations from books. I've yet to read any, so this was the first time I was exposed to anything Hunger Games related. I actually dug this movie for the most part. It has stylish direction, as well as excellent acting, especially from Jennifer Lawrence. Her strong performance as Kitniss was a main reason as to why I enjoyed this movie so much. I must also commend the somewhat audacious subject matter. Other than Battle Royale, I can't think of any other films that have dared to have teens killing each other. The Hunger Games also has some solid character development. I dug the subtle relationship between Jennifer Lawrence & Josh Hutcherson. It did a good job of making us care about them, and their fate. Credit must be given to the action scenes as well, which were quite enthralling at times. The Hunger Games has plenty of tension and suspense. I didn't expect much when going into this one, despite the rabid fan base. I ended up being very surprised by how much I liked it. It is flawed and a bit overlong, but overall I enjoyed it very much. I'm looking forward to Catching FireRating: 7.5/10",7,0,3,1 October 2013

All the characters are fantastic, and the story is extremely compelling and fascinating, plus Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt and Madeleine Stowe are all simply incredible in this!. You must pay strict attention throughout the whole thing or you will be lost believe me, and I though Willis and Stowe had brilliant chemistry together, plus this may be Willis's best performance!. Brad deserved his Oscar nomination, and I thought the ending was very powerful stuff, plus it's totally unpredictable throughout. The scenes with Pitt and Willis in the mental institution in 1990 are definitely fun times! and all the characters were extremely likable, plus it has wonderful plot twists throughout. It also has some great humorous moments, especially a couple involving Pitt, and it's extremely well made and written as well, plus this deserves to be in the top 250 in my opinion!.This seriously messed up my brain, as it was just so incredibly bizarre, but that's a good thing, and You don't know whether Willis is insane or not! plus this film is an acquired taste as it may not be for everybody. I really dug the opening, and the finale will have you on the edge of your seat, plus the people who say Willis can't act watch this movie!. Terry Gilliam really is a genius! and you will find yourself rooting for Willis while thinking he's incredibly bizarre at the same time, plus I loved how it let the audiences think for themselves. It is very confusing at times, and it has some very violent scenes as well, plus I loved the scene with Willis and Stowe near the end at the Movie Theatre!. It's most certainly one of the best Sci-Fi films I have ever seen, and it's very suspenseful at times as well! plus there are quite a few shocking moments as well. This is one of the most bizarre movies I have ever seen, I absolutely loved it, as it really makes you think, with incredible performances all around, and if you haven't seen it do so immediately, you won't regret it if your a fan of this type of stuff (as I am).The Direction is wonderful!. Terry Gilliam does a wonderful job here, with fantastic stylish camera work, excellent camera work, great use of colors, good locations and lots of other cool shots as well, plus he kept the film at an extremely engrossing pace.The Acting is incredible!. Bruce Willis is amazing as always and is incredible here, he is extremely likable, played insane very convincingly, never over did it, blew me away in certain scenes, gives possibly his best performance, had me cracking up at times, had brilliant chemistry with Stowe, and he was just so focused, he was just incredible!, and there were no wisecracks to be found. (Willis Rules!!!!!!!). Brad Pitt is also incredible here, I'm not a huge fan of his but I absolutely loved him here, he was extremely hilarious, and wonderfully way OTT, but somehow he managed to keep it interesting and not over do it, I loved his character, and think he deserved his Oscar nomination!. Madeleine Stowe is incredibly gorgeous and is amazing here, she had brilliant chemistry with Willis, was incredibly sexy, was extremely likable, and was totally convincing overall, she is able to play any role! (Stowe Rules!!!!!!!). Christopher Plummer is OK as Pitt's father but didn't have much to do and was somewhat wasted. Rest of the cast do fine.Overall if you haven't seen it do so immediately, you shouldn't regret it if you want an awesome thinking movie!. ***** out of 5",10,3,4,9 February 2006
42," Pretty solid biopic; nothing that blew me away, but I was engaged for two hours or so
","42 was a pretty solid film about the life of Jackie Robinson. The film feels extremely polished, and the retro costumes mirrored the time period precisely, as did the baseball stadiums. They really pulled that off well in creating a retroactive atmosphere. They also told Jackie's story respectfully and accurately as they possibly could for the time period that they chose. I was always fascinated by Jackie Robinson. Even though I was born way after he sadly passed away, I loved what he did for the game. The emotional turmoil and all the tumultuous reactions Jackie garnered for himself was really hard to watch at points, even though I had a general idea of what he went through from reading about him. Life wasn't so simple in those days, and the tenacity and the courage that Jackie had to overcome all the racial hatred towards him just because he sported a different skin color than others is not only inspirational, but admirable. He really changed the game of baseball in so many ways. It wasn't so prejudiced anymore and it was looked at very differently all thanks to Jackie. The baseball action was also rather exciting stuff. Director& Writer Brian Hegland knows how to get your pulse rising. On the downside of things, I didn't like how some things were underdeveloped, especially the character development. With a movie that is over two hours, you would think that wouldn't be an issue. Well it is.It covered the most important things about Jackie's early years, but it just felt a little rushed. Maybe making the movie a little longer would have actually helped in this case. Chadwick Boesman is certainly not a problem as Jackie. I enjoyed all the subtle nuances of his portrayal as Jackie whilst also having many of the things we liked about Jackie. It was an excellent show for the most part, and his breakdown scene after being heckled relentlessly by the unruly Ben Chapman (fantasticaly played by Alan Tudyk) was chilling. I felt for him. Harrison Ford is absolutely wonderful as Branch Rickey. As a huge Harrison Ford fan, I had forgotten how great of an actor he can be with his some of the duds he's been putting out. His scenes with Chadwick Boesman are joyous to watch. Nicole Beharie is solid as the wife, but she was way underdeveloped for my liking, and her character was rushed a lot of the time, but she did well. The rest of the cast does well, especially Lucas Black as Pee Wee ReeseFinal Thoughts: I did have some issues with it, but I enjoyed it for the most part. It was a pretty entertaining biopic with many moving scenes. I don't know how baseball fans, or huge Jackie Robinson fans will feel about it, but I recommend it.7.5/10",7,1,1,8 September 2013

","This is an excellent adventure that is highly entertaining, with amazing performances, however it goes on a bit too long. All the characters are fantastic, and the story is awesome if a little overlong, plus Johnny Depp, Keira Knightley and Geoffrey Rush are all simply amazing in this. Orlando Bloom surprised my by giving a very good performance, and his chemistry with Keira was on big time, plus one of my favorite moments in this film is when Sparrow and Elizabeth are on the Island, and there both drunk on the rum, then Keira gets rid of it, and Depp's reaction just cracked me up!. Johnny Depp, gives one of my favorite performances of all time as Jack Sparrow,and the sword fight between him and Rush was extremely cool, plus the special effects were great!.

Johnny Depp is amazing as always and is incredible here, he plays one of my favorite character of all time in Jack Sparrow, was hilarious, extremely likable, wonderfully mysterious, had some of the coolest makeup, and was just tons of fun to watch!

The Rocker," I can't see why anyone would be able to resist this movie's charm.
","Fish (Rainn Wilson) got his heartbroken in 1986 by his band called Vesuvius. He was the lead drummer, and was told to be replaced by their agent. They originally refuse, but when they are told they will be opening for Whitesnake, the band betrays him, and manages to escape a vengeful attack from Fish. Fish's dream comes to an abrupt halt. Not only does Fish lose his job, because the people he works with love Vesuvius, but his girlfriend kicks him out of their house. Fish is forced to live with his Sister (Jane Lynch) When he learns about his nephew (Josh Gad) having a band, Fish gets another crack at living the dream, when his nephew's band very reluctantly gives him the lead drummer position. The band gets unusually noticed when a session on a web-cam leads to Fish practicing naked, and it gets a ton of You Tube Hits. Okay. So it's not rocket science, it's not an Oscar winner, it's highly predictable, but damn. It's great entertainment. I really don't understand why movie fans have to be such sticklers at times. What did you honestly expect coming into this movie, a thought provoking film? It's set to entertain the masses, and it does that extremely well. What makes The Rocker work so well, is the energy and the cohesiveness of the cast. Every member of the band is really amiable, and I enjoyed embarking on their journey. This does have crude humor in it, provided by the hilarious Rainn Wilson. I laughed at a lot of it, and enjoyed the slapstick. The predictability didn't bother me one iota, because it was so well done. I had a general idea of how this movie was gonna end. I knew retribution for Fish would happen, but I still enjoyed the ride. Predictability isn't always a bad thing. The Rocker is a perfect example of that. Critics and movie fans alike tend to forget what is so vital to a movie's success. To me it's entertainment. If a movie is able to entertain, it's doing its job. It also has a very good message to it. It shows that you should never give up on your hopes and dreams, no matter how hard you have to work to ascend back to the top. Rainn Wilson is a funny guy, plain and simple. It amazes me that unfunny people like Will Ferrell, Adam Sandler (These days he is, he used to be funny) and Kevin James make millions at the box office with their abhorrently awful movies, yet Rainn Wilson tends to go unnoticed, compared to them. His idiotic, yet likable character had me in stitches, especially the naked stuff that made him a hit on you tube. Josh Gad makes for an amiably, nerdy nephew, and I enjoyed his low key, but funny performance. Ted Geiger is a guy that females will love. He's got that leadership quality. Christina Applegate was just great as Geiger's Mom. She stole a lot of scenes, and I couldn't get enough of her. Emma Stone shows why she's become one of Hollywood's biggest female stars, with her girl next door persona. I loved her. Jason Sudeikis admittedly has a few funny lines here. He's not a favorite of mine, but I found him amusing here. Will Arnett & Bradley Cooper are fun as members of the arrogant Vesuvius. I doubt Bradley Cooper will talk about this movie very often in interviews, but he was fun. Jane Krakowski also has a role, and Jane Lynch is good as wellFinal Thoughts: It's good entertainment. I think its rated way too low. I highly recommend it. It'll deliver plenty of laughs and smiles. Isn't that what counts? 7.8/10",7,2,2,24 October 2013
Public Enemies," |Small spoilers|One of the very few movies, I couldn't finish watching. How could a movie with so much talent, be so boring?.
","Public Enemies was a movie I had high hopes for, considering it starred two of my favorites, in Johnny Depp and Christian Bale. The biggest problem Public Enemies has, is it's pacing and incorrect factuality. It showed stuff that John Dillinger didn't even do, and padded it with pretty pointless stuff. The reason I couldn't finish this movie though, was due to the pure boredom I went through. I'm not one of those Movie buffs, who Crave constant action, but I do like the movie to be interesting, and this just didn't cut it for me. One of the others things, that seriously bothered me was Pretty Boy Floyd's early demise. I'm not a Channing Tatum mark, but with a big time actor like that, and such an important character, gunning him down that early, really got under my skin.Performances. Johnny Depp is very good from what I saw. He has the charisma and the desire, to play Dillinger, but he's stuck with a terrible film in my opinion. Christian Bale is disappointingly wooden. He looks uncomfortable, and I didn't blame him. Channing Tatum shows up long enough to get a check.Bottom line. An hour of this mess was enough for me. I'm not saying other people will disagree, because they most likely will. But I'm simply stating my opinion on this movie, and It was a colossal disappointment for me.3/10",3,2,2,4 February 2010
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Nothing really that stood out for me, but I was entertained in the process.
","(Credit IMDb) Set in the mystical lands of Persia, a rogue prince and a mysterious princess race against dark forces to safeguard an ancient dagger capable of releasing the Sands of Time -- a gift from the gods that can reverse time and allow its possessor to rule the world.Prince of Persia is far from a classic, but I still enjoyed myself with it. It's got plenty of humor, lots of effective, exciting action sequences, and fun characters to pass the time perfectly. I look at this film along the lines of The Mummy movies (Brendan Fraser ones) Loud, exciting, and they don't make me think too much. That's exactly what I received here. I didn't really perceive Jake Gyllenhall as the action-hero type, but he surprised me with his witty, entertaining performance. Plot isn't original in the slightest as far as I'm concerned, but it entertained me, and these days that's all I ask for.Performances. Jake Gyllenhall is surprisingly an effective action-hero as stated earlier. He's comical, likable and totally entertaining. I've always liked him, but I didn't think he had this in him. Gemma Arterton is decent as the love interest, and had good enough chemistry with Gyllenhall. She got on my nerves once or twice, but remained fairly likable most of the time. Ben Kingsley is as reliable as ever here. His class was clearly apparent, and I loved every minute of his screen time.Bottom line. Far from original, far from a classic, but it didn't matter. Prince of Persia is an entertaining adventure, which I was delighted to have seen. Give it a whirl for a good night of action!7/10",7,1,3,8 January 2011
The Fifth Element," A Bizarre But Great Film, That I Enjoyed Quite A Bit, With Incredible Visuals, Wicked Characters And Top Notch Performances!
","This is a bizarre but great film, that I enjoyed quite a bit with incredible visuals, wicked characters, and top notch performances!. The Story is very cool, and I must say the special effects are just brilliant!, plus Bruce Willis is simply amazing in this!. Milla Jovovich and Bruce had great chemistry together, and Chris Tucker plays one of the weirdest characters ever in my opinion, plus I thought the ending was great!. It's a bit hard to follow at times, and it does run a tad overlong, however those are minor things as I was really surprised by how much I enjoyed this. One of my favorite moments in this movie is when Milla Jumps off the ledge and lands in Bruce's Taxi!, and I thought all the characters were extremely likable, however Gary Oldman was way too hammy and OTT in my opinion. It had some great dialog,and i think it's very well written and made as well!, plus it has many surprising moments as well. I'm not a big Sci-Fi film fan, however this one was great!, plus The finale is quite exciting!. This is a bizarre but great film, that I enjoyed quite a bit, with incredible visuals, wicked characters and top notch performances, I highly recommend this one!. The Direction is great!. Luc Besson does a great job here, with fantastic camera work, stunning visuals, phenomenal angles, great use of colors and lots of other awesome shots as well, plus he kept the film at a very fast pace!. The Acting is amazing!. Bruce Willis is amazing as always and is amazing here!, he is extremely likable, funny, had excellent chemistry with Milla Jovovich, had some great lines, and i really believe this character suited him, as he was tons of fun to watch!(Willis Rules!!!!!!!). Gary Oldman is terrible here, he was too hammy and OTT for my tastes, and he also bored me to tears, i'm not a big fan. Milla Jovovich is beautiful, and had a really tough character to play, and she nailed it down perfectly, and made a potentially boring and bland character, to a very interesting one!, she didn't have much dialog but she had presence and a wicked character!, i loved her. Ian Holm is fantastic as the Father, he was fascinating, and was really into his character, i liked him a lot. Chris Tucker is annoying here for the most part, and over did it badly, its a shame since he is a funny guy. Brion James( General Munro) and Tom 'Tiny' Lister Jr(President Lindberg ) are both great with what they had to do. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall I highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5",8,7,12,12 December 2005
Batman Returns," Utterly moronic sequel, that lacks the entertainment value it needs.
","Batman Returns is a movie that is too moronic and dull for it's own good. Michelle Pfeiffer is not the problem in the movie, contrary to what people have thought, she actually gives a sly and Humorful performance. The real problem with Batman Returns lies in the movie itself. The original was dark itself, but at least it was highly entertaining to watch. Batman Returns is often sadistic, cold and very hard to watch. Jack Nicholson was able to provide us with some great humor, and make The Joker a great villain, but Danny DeVito, despite the fact that he tries hard is just too dark for my liking, heck there are even kids put in danger!. When I watch a marvel type film, I wanna be entertained, not depressed. Batman Returns really is a depressing film for the most part, it lacks all the proper ingredients that Batman had.Performances. Michael Keaton does fine with what he has to do, but his role doesn't have the depth that he did in Batman, therefore he naturally struggles at times with the material at hand. Danny DeVito is OK as the villain. He's much too sadistic and cold for my liking, it really drained a lot of the film for me. Michelle Pfeiffer is a beauty, no doubt about it, and her sly and witty performance, helped make some of the movie bearable for me. Christopher Walken is always a great, slimy villain, and did pretty good here as Max. Michael Gough is solid once again as Alfred. Rest of the cast are adequate or good.Bottom line. Batman Returns is a sequel, I won't be viewing ever again. It's too dark, too humorless, and lacking in entertainment value. Stick with the original.4/10",4,1,5,24 January 2010

X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Highly entertaining
","Over 200 years ago, Logan and Victor suffer some childhood trauma, forcing them to make a pact that they will always be there for each other. They fight in the American Civil Wars and become genuinely inseparable. In contemporary times, Col. William Stryker, recruits them and others to kill. When Victor starts taking things too far by killing innocent people, Logan quits and moves to the Canadian Rockies to start a new life. He falls in love with a woman named Keyla, who happens to be a local teacher. When Logan turns down Stryker's offer to become one of his crew, Victor murders Kayla. Pining for revenge, Logan agrees to partake in an experiment of Stryker's that will make him indestructible to finally beat Victor and get his revengeThis is my 3rd time watching this movie. I saw it once in theaters and now twice at home. One thing has always remained after each viewing, the enjoyment. It is filled with action, twists and turns, and surprisingly adequate storytelling as well. It is a tad vague with how it is done, but it does just enough to keep you satisfied. I thought it did a good job of telling the story of how Wolverine came to be. There are some great fight scenes, especially with Wolverine & Victor. Deadpool is pretty rad himself. Wait until you see him as Stryker's ultimate mutant with everybody's power. Reynolds was supposed to get a spin-off film in Deadpool, but it didn't happen for some reason, which is a shame. The twist at the end was something I wasn't expecting the first time I watch it, and I was actually floored by it. I'm not sure everybody will find it unpredictable, but it caught me off guard the first time I saw it. I do wish the old couple that take Logan in stayed around for a bit, I would have liked to see that developed a little more. The acting is pretty good. Hugh Jackman is excellent as Wolverine. I loved his rage and frustration in this one. His chemistry with Liev Schreiber was on the money. Their storyline together made for riveting entertainment. Schreiber is awesome as the intense brother. This is a man I wouldn't screw around with. Danny Huston is very solid as Stryker, but I prefer Brian Cox in the role. Not to say I didn't enjoy Huston in the role, because I most certainly did. He was great. Lynn Collins is great as the love interest of Logan's. Their love storyline felt real and natural. Taylor Kitsch isn't a favorite of mine, but he fits Gambit like a glove. I thoroughly enjoyed him. Ryan Reynolds screen time is tragically short, but I loved his wise-cracking portrayal of Wade. The rest of the cast does fine work as well. I questioned Scott Summers role at first, but once I saw the ending, it changed my perception. Final Thoughts: I wanted to see this again before checking out the new Wolverine film. This never fails to entertain me when I watch it. It has a little bit of everything for action fans. 8/10P.S, stay for the end credits!",8,4,6,17 February 2014
The Mummy," A Must See Adventure For All!, Its An Excellent Mummy Movie, With Fantastic Special Effects, And Fun Performances!
","This is a must see adventure for all!, its an excellent Mummy movie, with fantastic special effects and fun performances!. All the characters are just great!, and the story is really cool, plus Brendan Fraser makes a surprisingly great Action hero!. Fraser and Rachel Weisz had very good chemistry together, and John Hannah is very funny as Evelyn's brother!, plus Arnold Vosloo made for a pretty damn good Mummy!. OK granted, it may not be as good as the 1932 classic staring Boris Karloff, or even the 1959 version starring Chrsitopher Lee, however it really does make for a very entertaining action film, only problem it runs a tad too long, but it's never boring. One of the funniest moments for me is when Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) is in the Library putting books back on the shelves and the ladder collapses, and she messes up the whole library!. It's very well written and made, and i thought Kevin J. O'Connor was very good as the weasel Beni!, plus The finale is very exciting!. This is a must see adventure for all, it's an excellent Mummy movie, with fantastic special effects and fun performances!, and I say it's a must see for everyone. The Direction is awesome!. Stephen Sommers does an awesome! job here, with fantastic camera work, great angles, and lots of other cool shots as well!, plus he kept the film at a very fast pace. The Acting is wonderful!. Brendan Fraser is absolutely wonderful here, he has all the tools to be a great action hero, and here he proves it, with his sly humor, and his charisma!, he also had very good chemistry with Rachel Weisz, kicked that ass, was extremely likable, and was just tons of fun to watch!(Fraser Rules!!). Rachel Weisz is gorgeous, and does excellent here, she was adorable, had very good chemistry with Brendan Fraser, and she didn't take things all that seriously most of the time, which made her even more fun to watch!, she was great. John Hannah is very funny as the brother of Evelyn, sure he may be part of the comic relief, but his character really amused me as I thought it blended in with the film pretty well in my opinion!. Arnold Vosloo may not be great in terms of Acting range here, but he sure has one hell of a presence, and made for one awesome Mummy!, he was creepy, and extremely menacing, i loved him!.Kevin J. O'Connor is very effective as the weasel Benni!, perhaps a little too well, he was so convincing!. Oded Fehr is great here as Ardeth, he was cool, and likable i dug his part. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall a must see for everyone!. ****1/2 out of 5",9,4,5,12 December 2005
The Natural," Too long but the performances are so good, and it does just enough to make this a solid movie
","(Plot) A highly touted, once in a lifetime prospect has his career taken away from him. He reappears out of nowhere for another crack at greatness, but there seems to be some real divine magic at work, considering his age.I wanna get this out of the way. I enjoyed this film quite a bit. It has a certain old school charm that manages to consume you throughout most of the duration. My problem is actually with the duration itself. It's over two hours long, and I felt they could have easily cut it a little bit. Especially Redford & Basinger's scenes, which I felt droned on a bit. I think viewers could easily tell where it was going, and trimming it would have been more effective. This is also the type of film where you will have to suspend your belief quite a bit, but hey. That's the magic of movies. It also has big hints of 'divine intervention' throughout the film. I loved the cinematography, and the baseball action is often very exciting. Robert Redford plays this perfectly low- key, and proves why he is one of the greatest actors. He is our hero, and he was a main reason why I didn't tune out from the very long running time. He was excellent. Glenn Close doesn't have as big a role as you may think. She has a much bigger part in the second half. Close was good as per usual, even if her character was a bit underdeveloped. Robert Duvall is good as the nosy reporter. Duvall's range is near untouchable at times. Wilford Brimley is excellent as the grumpy coach with a heart of gold. Kim Basinger is effectively cold in her performance, but I felt some of her scenes were not needed. Barbara Hershey has a really quaint character. It's hard to describe her , but she did well. Joe Don Baker elicits memories of Babe Ruth. I wish he had more screen time. Final Thoughts: It's a bit of a strange film in all honesty, and much too long, but I did enjoy it quite a bit. It's definitely well made, engrossing, and the cast is awesome. Recommended!7.5/10",7,1,2,14 September 2013

Just Go with It," Not overly hilarious, but I won't complain
","(Credit IMDb) On a weekend trip to Hawaii, a plastic surgeon convinces his loyal assistant to pose as his soon-to-be-divorced wife in order to cover up a careless lie he told to his much-younger girlfriend.My expectations were gone a long time ago when it comes to Adam Sandler films. I used to be a huge fan of his and still am to a certain extent, but he's gotten uncouth, lazy, not to mention that he has complete contempt for his audience at times. This one is better than most of the recent stuff he comes out with these days, but that isn't saying much. I did laugh a few times, despite that it was quite predictable. If you can't figure out where it's heading, I don't know what to tell you. Sandler does Sandler in this one, what else do you expect? Jennifer Aniston does Jennifer Aniston. She's lovely to look at and has the presence to spare. Her chemistry with Sandler was decent. Nicole Kidman steals some scene's that she's in and it was nice to see her play this type of role. Overall, I didn't mind it. I'll never watch it again and Adam Sandler is capable of better, but I'll take what I can get at this point5.5/10",5,0,0,13 February 2014
Orphan," One of the scariest movie I have ever seen,i'm not kidding!. I forgot what it was like to be scared out of my wits,and it felt good!
","I had no expectations what so ever for Orphan when I 1st read the synopsis for it on IMDb,I thought it would be another Omen wannabe|which is highly overrated itself| but what I got was much,much more then that. The film starts off with a creepy and effective hospital sequence,from that point forward it gives you this amazingly slow build up,that will grip you right until the end. It's honestly been a long time coming that i've been able to be frightened,while watching a movie. The characters are all beautiful developed,along with giving us a heroine who is strong,vulnerable,but most importantly,one we can root for in Vera Farmiga. The film's real strength comes from Isabelle Fuhrman. She's scarier then any Damien,and shockingly enough scarier then most of the Horror characters that exist now a days. Whenever she is on screen we feel the fear,we feel the tension. The makeup for Isabelle is truly remarkable. Never have I seen anyone look as frightening as she did in the finale,trust me you'll feel the same way. It's rare that a Horror film is so unpredictable,to be honest I didn't have a clue on what was gonna happen,you really don't see that in Horror films anymore,so I thought that was great.Performances. Vera Farmiga is one of my favorite current actresses,she is able to provide a great performance,no matter the genre. Here she puts on a captivating show. She is strong,yet vulnerable at the same time. We feel for her loss,we can see the pain she's trying to hide,but she's never unsympathetic,she's able to make us be on her side the whole way. Peter Sarsgaard plays his role well,however I felt he was nothing but a sleaze ball. His character often felt cold and desperate,I could never get into him. Isabelle Fuhrman gives one of the scariest performances of all time. Her performance is hall of fame worthy as far as kid actors go. The 1st time you see her on screen,you will know. CCH Pounder did well with what she had to do,she's always a competent actress. Jimmy Bennett&Aryana Engineer are actually likable kid actors,as a result we are able to care for them.Bottom Line. Orphan is one of the best Horror films I've seen in sometime. It has all the main ingredients to be an effective Horror film. Be sure to leave the lights on when you spin this in your DVD Player,better yet turn them all off,and scare yourself silly!.Highly recommended.9/10",9,2,5,25 December 2009

The opening is really cool, and the 1st match between Fast Eddie and 'Minisota 'Fatts' is exciting and heartbreaking at the same time, plus Paul Newman should have won an Oscar for this!.The film is very depressing, but it was very entertaining all the same, and Newman and Piper Lauire had fantastic chemistry together, plus Jackie Gleason and Geroge C. Scott are especially awesome in there supporting roles. Paul Newman's character is extremely arrogant and cocky, but i just couldn't help but love him, and root for him, and the scene where him and his manager Charlie(Myron McCormick) have a fight and break up in Sarah's( Piper Laurie) apartment, is really powerful, plus this movie should have won best picture as well!. The movie itself is almost entirely flawless, and, it's extremely well written and made as well, plus there are plenty of shocking moments as well!. This hasn't dated one bit, as it still holds up incredibly well today, and the Pool games are very intense and exciting to watch, plus, i believe this is one of the best films ever!. The character development is especially awesome, and the dialog is absolutely brilliant!, plus it really leaves you thinking after you are done watching it!.There is not one boring minute in this film, and the direction is fabulous!, plus the finale was especially great!. I loved the gritty atmosphere it had, and there's no happy ending as it's very sad and depressing, but brilliant all the same!, plus all the characters are very likable. This is a masterpiece plain and simple, with wonderful storytelling, a brilliant ending, and an Oscar worthy performance from Paul Newman, and if you haven't seen it, Do so right this instant, it's one of the best films ever. The Direction is masterful.Robert Rossen does a masterful job here, with brilliant camera work, adding some great gritty atmosphere, and keeping the film at an extremely engrossing pace. The Acting is no doubt Oscar Worthy. Paul Newman is incredible here, he most certainly deserved the Oscar, for his incredible performance here, and while he was extremely cocky and arrogant, he just had a certain likable charm about him, and i couldn't help but root for him, he also had fantastic chemistry with Piper Laurie, and was just incredible overall, i can't say enough about his performance here(Newman Rules!!!). Jackie Gleason is wonderful as Minnesota Fats, while he didn't have much screen time, he still made a big impression on me, i loved him!, i just wish he had more screen time. Piper Laurie is fantastic as Eddie's girlfriend, i really felt sorry for her character, and it was so sad with what happened to her, as she was so likable, and had fantastic chemistry with Newman. George C. Scott is fabulous here, he played the sleaze ball extremely well, and deserved a lot of recognition, for his fabulous performance here, i loved to hate him!. Myron McCormick did what he had to do well as Charlie's manager i liked him. Rest of the cast are great.

Terminator Salvation," As a Terminator film, it kinda falls flat. As a blockbuster, it entertained the heck out of me.
","Terminator Salvation was a movie, I was very weary of, for one sole reason, No Arnold. Much to my delight, it managed to pass the time very amiably, and entertain me heavily, for a 100 or so odd minutes. It definitely does not feel like a true Terminator movie, and that did kinda disappoint me, but its so much fun to watch, in the end I didn't really care all that much. There are a few inconsistencies in the film, that hampered the film a little bit, but nothing overly major to where it distracted me. The main quality's Salvation has, is it's entertainment value and the cast. There is so much thrilling action taking place, it really makes you forget about how disappointing it is, due to the lack of Arnold. Having Linda Hamilton do the voice overs for Sarah Connor, was a nice touch, and I also thought it was cool how they planted Arnold's face in the end on the T-800, too bad it wasn't a real cameo. The cast though, is what truly makes this work. If it wasn't for Christian Bale, Anton Yelchin, and Sam Worthington, this film would have been a forgettable action film, in my opinion.Performances. Christian Bale is the best John Connor yet. He has a few off moments, but for the most part he came through, in a big way. Sam Worthington is excellent as Marcus. His vulnerability, and entering into a realm of unknown, was a treat to watch. Moon Bloodgood is sexy no doubt about that, but she's also a pretty good actress too. Blair doesn't have as much screen time as I'd have like, but she did fine with what she had to do. Helena Bonham Carter receives somewhat top billing, but is rarely in the movie. Anton Yelchin does a fantastic impression of Michael Biehn. For his age, and pressure he had to take over for him, he did an excellent job. Jadagrace is a likable kid actress, go figure!. Her unsureness, and weird quirks were quite cute. Bryce Dallas Howard is mediocre as Kate. She's no Claire Danes, that's for sure. Michael Ironside is a bad ass once more, and about time!.Bottom line. Terminator Salvation is a very entertaining entry, that I had a good time with. It's disappointing in some cases, but for the most part, I dug every moment. Terminator fans will probably be mixed on how they feel about this movie, but I recommend it highly, for a great night of entertainment.8/10",8,1,2,27 January 2010
500 Days of Summer," Finally a fully original Romantic&Comedy!. Funny,wonderfully downbeat, and informative.
","(500) Days Of Summer is one of the most brilliant, original, and refreshing romantic comedies I have ever seen. Year after year, we get the same old tired formula, only in different ways, and while I do enjoy some of them, they do get tiring after a while, because it's so utterly predictable. Here I couldn't predict a thing, even when I thought I could. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel make one of the most intriguing and original couples in sometime, showing us how relationships are not fairy tales like the movies make it out to be, and how tough it really is. I also liked how almost every day passed, a screen would show up saying what day it was at, I thought that was a unique addition.SPOILER: If you don't wanna know, please don't read any further.500 Days also has to be quite possibly, the only original romantic comedy, that doesn't have your typical happy ending. Tom and Summer don't get together. Tom's hard work does NOT pay off, and Summer ends up getting married, which I didn't expect. 500 Days of Summer tries to show us there are no fairy tales, or miracles, but by showing Tom meeting another woman at a meeting at the end of the film, it also shows things aren't totally disastrous.Performances. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is turning out to be one of the great up and coming actors, proving there is hope for the new generation. Here he is convincingly in love, and I could relate to him 100%. It also helps that his heart is pure, and he has a unique sense of humor. Zooey Deschanel is charming, and really good, but if I have a mild complaint, it's her character was very cold and manipulative sometimes. Geoffrey Arend is very funny as Tom's best friend McKenzie. He was goofy, but likable.Bottom line. (500) Days Of Summer is now one of my favorite Rom com's. It's original, it's funny, it's downbeat, and I can't find many bad things to say about it. It really opened up my eyes for relationships, and it shows not every romance is a fairytale waiting to happen, not matter how deep the love is. A must see, and one of the best films of 2009.9/10",9,2,2,6 March 2010

Some people complained that the 2nd half wasn't as good as the 1st, I have to disagree as I thought it was just as good!, plus Jake Gyllenhaal and Emmy Rossum had fantastic chemistry together. Yes some of the dialog is kind of hokey, however that's a minor thing, and the film is surprising and unpredictable throughout!, plus Dennis Quaid was surprisingly solid as the main lead. The opening is really cool and tense, and I thought the situation that all the characters were in kind of scary, plus one of my favorite moments in this film is when Gyllenhaal and the rest of the characters head to the library, to race against the tidal wave!. It's extremely well made, and I thought the ending was great, plus all you need to do to enjoy this movie is check your brain at the door!. This is an awesome disaster flick! that's very exciting, with incredible special effects and fantastic performances, and i say it's a must see!. The Direction is great!.

Dennis Quaid is surprisingly solid as the main lead here, he is very likable, focused, intense, and even though he had some bad lines at times, and was wooden in certain parts, he still did a pretty solid job in my opinion i liked him. Jake Gyllenhaal is excellent here, he is very convincing likable, had great chemistry with Emmy Rossum, had a cool character, and was very resourceful!, I really liked him. Emmy Rossum is also excellent here, she is gorgeous,had very good chemistry with Gyllenhaal, and just did excellent with what she had to do she was great. Sela Ward is decent here and did what she had to do adequately. Ian Holm is good in his role and added class. Kenneth Welsh is pretty good as the vice president I liked him, even if his character was a bit of a dick at times. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall a must see!. **** out of 5",9,1,1,21 December 2005
Don Jon," My interest never waned I was engaged throughout
","Jon goes out clubbing and takes home gorgeous women to have sex with him. It does the job very well, but not like his beloved porn. Jon finds a breathtaking woman (Scarlett Johansson) , but she turns him down. He tracks her down and they start dating. Jon is able to let go of porn for a while, but he isn't able to abstain from it, even after promising her. Your enjoyment of this movie may depend on how much mileage you get out of Gordon-Levitt's character. I wouldn't exactly say I enjoyed the hell out of this movie, but I appreciated the originality. On the other hand, I had trouble relating to a guy that gets off on middling stuff like porn more than Sex. I don't see how anyone can do that, but I admired the gumption of Gorndon-Levitt to pull it off. Whether I agreed with it or not, Levitt has my respect for being original with his creative vision. On another note, there is some stuff that rings true about Porn. I chuckled at the little things, such as 'Waiting for the perfect video out of many videos' , 'Ruining the moment when you see the guy's face' It really is a polarizing movie. Levitt is fantastic. He bulked up majorly for the role and I thought he gave the performance of his career. Not only that, his direction was solid as well. Johansson plays her role well as well. Juliane Moore's role plays a pivotal part in this film and she was a pro like usual. I give Levitt props for giving me an unpredictable ending. It did NOT go down the way I expected it would. I thought I had it all figured out, but he got meFinal Thoughts: I liked this film quite a bit. It's not something that is worth repeated viewings or anything, but I dug it. 7.8/10",7,1,2,3 February 2014
X-Men," Extremely entertaining
","In a world where both mutants and humans fear each other, a woman named Marie, better known as Rogue, runs away from home when she renders a young man into a comatose state with her unique skill set. She goes to Alberta to hitch a ride with a man known as Logan, aka Wolverine. After initially vetoing her request to hitch with him, Logan gives in. They are almost killed when Sabretooth makes an unexpected attack on Logan & Rogue. Storm & Cyclops save their lives, and take them to a mutant school, run by professor, Charles Xavier. His old friend Magneto believes a war is brewing, has an evil plan in mind, and kidnaps Rogue. Now, this is how you start off a franchise! There isn't anything fancy about this one, but it's incredibly effective, and enormously entertaining. Everything clicks in this one. Unlike, the overblown X-Men III: The Last Stand, this one is able to combine action with terrific storytelling. I also liked how it delivered a message, about how everyone should be viewed as equals, no matter what your condition is. There are a few things that would set the tone for future installments. Wolverine's flashbacks would be told in lengthy detail, with the movie Wolverine. It also has a great love triangle with Wolverine, Cyclops, and Dr. Jean Grey, but Wolverine & Jean's attraction towards each other is subtly hinted at, but that would change. I always thought Anna Paquin was terrific as Rogue. It is kind of a shame that her screen time would decrease with each installment. Hugh Jackman is fantastic as Wolverine. He plays the perfect anti-hero, and is the coolest character as far as i'm concerned. Patrick Stewart oozes class as Prof. Xavier. He was a joy to watch, and his scenes with Ian McKellen were awesome. Ian McKellen is awesome as Magneto. Famke Janssen isn't unstable in this one. She is rather tame, compared to how she would become as Phoenix. I thought she was excellent, though, and drop dead gorgeous. James Marsden fits the arrogant Cyclops to a T. Halle Berry is absolutely beautiful, but she felt a little off at times, as Storm. Tyler Mane does fine as Sabretooth, but I find sabretooth to be insignificant and rather useless. Rebecca Romijn is awesome as the devious Mystique. Wait until you see Wolverine battle himself, when she turns into Wolverine. Bruce Davison is good as Senator Kelly. The finale is filled with amazing action scenes, and leaves you wanting more with the short running time.Final Thoughts: This isn't the best in the original trilogy. I'd have to give that honor to X-Men II, but it's a damn good way to kick things off. It is exciting, well written, and a lot of fun to watch. You have no excuse not to see this if you're an X-Men fan8.6/10",8,0,1,8 January 2014
Match Point," 'It's all about luck!'. My 1st Woody Allen experience, and I must say it was an incredible one! *spoilers*
","This was my 1st Woody Allen experience, and I must say it was an incredible one!. All the characters are fascinating, and the story is really brilliant, plus Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Scarlett Johansson are simply incredible in this!. I originally wanted to see this in theaters because the trailer looked awesome, however I never did, so I was really happy to see this masterpiece when it came to DVD, and it's full of incredible plot twists as well, plus I absolutely loved the dialog!. This should be on the top 250, and while it may seem draggy at 1st, if you stick with it you will be rewarded, plus like the tennis ball does your luck can go over the net, or not. It was completely unpredictable for me throughout, and it was fun to see Scarlett Johansson's character develop throughout, plus while I was hoping Jonathan Rhys Meyers would get caught because he was such an unbelievable prick(in my opinion), the ending still worked pretty well, even it didn't give me what I wanted. I will definitely be checking out more of Woody Allern's work after loving this film,and Emily Mortimer did fantastic in her role, plus I loved the old fashioned music it had in it as well.It's extremely well made and written, and there are many shocking and suspenseful moments as well, plus it will leave you thinking long after you are finished watching it. Penelope Wilton was incredibly annoying as Chloe's(Mortimer) mother, but played her role extremely well,and I really loved the setting as well, plus Woody really has an incredible mind, as he is just so imaginative and creative. It also has an important message about adultery,and while I really couldn't feel any sympathy for the characters, they were still very likable(except for Meyers), plus I couldn't believe what Meyers character did, and that he would resort to that, as it just shocked me. This deserves all the praise it gets, and yes while it is talky, it was always interesting, plus the most important scene in the movie for me may be when Meyers tries to throw the watch into the river, but it hits the railing instead. This was my 1st Woody Allen experience and I must say it was an incredible one, and if you Haven't seen it, please do so immediately you shouldn't regret it!. The Direction is outstanding!. Woody Allen does an outstanding! job here with wonderful camera work,excellent angles, using an awesome setting, and just keeping the film at an extremely engrossing pace, and doing everything else just perfect. The Acting is top notch!. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is incredible here, he played an unbelievably selfish prick, that I despised,a gold digger in my opinion, but he was just so incredible at it, and as I said the things that he resorted too, just shocked me, he was one of the main reasons the movie was as good as it was, I just wished he didn't get away with it. Scarlett Johansson is also incredible here, she is incredibly gorgeous, and while she didn't have as much screen time as I would have liked she was incredible when on, I know some people thought her performance was very wooden, but I must say I disagree completely she was intense when needed to be, and played her role extremely well! (Scarlett Rules!!!!!!!). Emily Mortimer is fantastic in her role, her role wasn't anything special, but she did it with charm and likability, she also was very sweet, I really liked her, as she had fine chemistry with Meyers. Brian Cox is good as the father. Penelope Wilton is incredibly annoying but very effective, as the Mother. Matthew Goode is good as the best friend. Rest of the cast are fine.Overall if you haven't seen it please do so immediately you shouldn't regret it!. ***** out of 5",10,2,6,2 May 2006
Midnight in Paris," Exquisite scenery, clever observations about life, and witty dialog are all part of its charm
","(Plot) Owen Wilson embarks on a journey back in time to the 1920's where he gets inspiration for his novel. He begins to wonder about his current situation with fiancée (McAdams) whilst in this magical time period and even indulges in romance and other pleasures of lifeIt's really hard to write a review about this film without spoiling so much of the wonder or the amazement. The big thing you must do in this film is go with it. If you choose to concentrate on the believability of it all, you'll most likely find your viewing experience tarnished. It's a fantasy type of premise, so you should know going in that it might strain credibility for you if you focus on it, but if you decide to go into the world of Woody Allen, you'll more than likely have a blast like I did. I'll be honest. I haven't seen many of Woody Allen's films, but Woody Allen never skimps out on making sure the dialog is crisp and witty, and this film was no different. It's just a terrific film that put me in a good mood after it was all said and done. Owen Wilson usually annoys me to no end, but he was perfect for this part. I shockingly enjoyed him very much, and loved his performance. He can be talented after all! Rachel McAdams is charming as per usual, even if her character is a tad snobbish. The rest of the cast does greatFinal Thoughts: Just go with it. If you can't find enjoyment from this movie, I'd really suggest that you put a halt to watching movies in general. There is real magic in this movie, and I just hope you appreciate it8.5/10",8,0,0,4 September 2013
Sleepy Hollow," Has many moments of succeeding, but like most Burton films, a mixed-bag overall.
","(Credit IMDb) The cruse of the headless horseman is the legacy of the small town of Sleepy Hollow. Spearheaded by the eager Constable Ichabod Crane and his new world ways into the quagmire of secrets and murder, secrets once laid to rest, best forgotten and now reawakened, and he too, holding a dark secret of a past once gone.Tim Burton is an artistic Director, no doubt about that, but he often does it to the point of overkill in his movies. I remember watching this as a teenager, and being wowed by it, unfortunately that wasn't the case this time around. The creepy atmosphere is clearly apparent, and Johnny Depp's out there sort of style benefits the film immensely, but the film as a whole is very inconsistent. The whole Headless Horsemen ordeal should have been much more powerful than it was, and Christopher Walken's screen-time is precious, and not as much as I'd have liked. It tries to balance a romance (Unconvincing one I might add) a creepy horror story and a heavy Gothic atmosphere all in one, and it just isn't able to do it.Performances. Johnny Depp is better then the movie itself. His weird facial ticks, his presence, and his unique style are a treat to watch. This guy is capable of anything, and it shows here. Slight criticism, his chemistry with Christina Ricci fell flat. Christina Ricci is OK, but nothing noteworthy. She looks elegant, but her part felt vastly underwhelming. Miranda Richardson has a creepy presence, and did eerily well in her part. Michael Gambon is good, while people like Michael Gough, Richard Griffiths, add some English class. Casper Van Dien is wooden in his part. Christopher Lee is sadly wasted as a Judge, while Christopher Walken could peel potatoes and look creepy doing it.Bottom line. I enjoyed bits and pieces, but the over-kill hampered the overall enjoyment for me. It's certainly worth a viewing experience, but it's not as good as the 7.5 rating indicates in my opinion. Too many inconsistencies.6 ½ /10",6,0,0,10 February 2011
We Were Soldiers," Brilliant War Film That's Very Powerful And Emotional, With An Amazing Performance From Mel Gibson!
","This is a brilliant War film, that's very powerful and emotional with an amazing performance from Mel Gibson!. The story is extremely engrossing, and all the characters were extremely likable, plus Mel Gibson is simply amazing in this!. It's a very very powerful film, that's not pretty to watch, however it's really heartfelt, and sends a powerful message, plus the ending was great. The character development is fantastic and i was rooting for Gibson and his troops all the way, plus Gibson and Madeleine Stowe had awesome chemistry together when on screen!. This is one of the best war films i have seen, and some of the scenes were really shocking,plus i thought the opening was very well done!. Chris Klein was really good in his role, and i thought it had a wonderful cast, plus it's extremely well made!. This is a brilliant War film, that's very powerful and emotional with an amazing performance from Gibson and i say It's a must see at all costs!. The Direction is fantastic!. Randall Wallace does a fantastic job here, with awesome camera work, extremely realistic war scenes, good angles and keeping the film at an extremely engrossing pace. This film is not for the faint of heart. We get Hundreds and hundreds(literally) of extremely gory gunshot wounds,hundreds of extremely gory gunshot wounds to the head with blood and brains splattering,tons of very gory corpses,lots of impaling's,extremely gory and nasty wounds,legs peeled off,faces cut by shrapnel,face ripped off by shrapnel,tons of blown off necks, tons of blown off legs,lots of nasty burnt corpses,and non stop blood splatter. The Acting is brilliant!. Mel Gibson is AMAZING as always, and is simply amazing here, he is extremely likable, very very courageous, gives an almost Oscar worthy performance, had awesome chemistry with Madeleine Stowe, and was absolutely perfect for this role! (Gibson Rules!). Madeleine Stowe is gorgeous and is excellent as usual, she is really likable in her screen time, had awesome chemistry with Gibson, and was just excellent overall!. Greg Kinnear is good here i liked him. Sam Elliot is very good as the grumpy Sgt., and was very convincing. Chris Klein is fantastic in his screen time, i am a huge fan of this kid, and feel he has the talent to become a star, i wish he had more screen time though, still he was fantastic in his screen time! (Klein Rules!). Keri Russell is very beautiful and did great in her screen time i really liked her. Barry Pepper is very good as the reporter. Rest of the cast are awesome.

Dear John," Effectively charming and heartbreaking. Tatum and Seyfried sizzle with chemistry.
","Dear John does what it sets out to do, be an effective romantic little film in my opinion. I really enjoyed how they developed the relationship between Tatum and Seyfriend. It felt real and it really hit home for me, because It felt like true love to me. Some movie buffs might find this movie to be too corny or rather contrived, but I'm a sucker for some good romance, a rare bird as far as guys go. The story was very well done, and held my attention throughout. But what really made the movie for me was the chemistry between Tatum and Seyfried. Channing isn't the world's greatest actor, but he showed a lot of promise here. I also found the war scenes to be quite realistic and well done, even if there wasn't very many. I went into Dear John. Thinking it was gonna be your typical Romdrama that they seem to put out these days. To my surprise it's fairly intelligent, romantic, and wonderfully emotional, I enjoyed my time with it.Performances. Channing Tatum still has work to do, but he was actually solid here for the most part. He had a few wooden moments, with that somewhat annoying blank expression on his face, but his effort was clearly there. He's growing up. Amanda Seyfried is delightful in her role. We are able to feel for her character, and become very attracted to her charming ways. She was especially good near the end. Richard Jenkins was the heart of the movie for me. His autistic performance was truly a sight to behold, and I really did feel for him. His hospital moment with Tatum was heartbreaking and heartfelt. Henry Thomas is excellent as the goodhearted, yet Weaslish Tim.Bottom line. Dear John was a very pleasant surprise for me. It's just a very nice romantic movie, that I think even guys like me could get into, if in the right frame of mind. Grab your wife, girlfriend, or whatever love interest you have, and enjoy.8/10",8,5,7,21 August 2010
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," What's all the hoo-ha about? I was personally bored throughout the film.
","Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is a movie that is hailed as not only one of the greatest Westerns of all time, but one of the greatest movies in cinema. I have tried 3 times now to get into this, but each time I end up being bored silly by it. This has made so many memorable lines to quote for people, so many parodies for the bicycle riding scene, with the song 'Rain Drops Keep Falling On My Head' but in the end, I really didn't care. For it's time it's very iconic, but today it's heavily outdated, and the infamous gunfight at the end while one of the best things about the movie, is even outdated. Paul Newman and Robert Reford are not a problem, they are the reasons I managed to keep awake through the duration of this movie, and the scenery is absolutely gorgeous, I have to admit, i'm just very picky on westerns, and this is another one that bored me.Performances. Paul Newman and Robert Redford are both fantastic. They ooze class and charisma, while having there macho type moments as predicted, they are the saving grace to this film. Katharine Ross is OK, but is pretty wasted.Bottom line. This is an overrated movie, that is not on my list of classics like it is on many others. It's just too uninteresting for my liking. Recommended because it is a required viewing, I just don't care for it.6/10",6,2,4,6 March 2010
The Bodyguard," Overblown, and surprisingly dull Romantic/Thriller, with only a few entertaining moments *spoilers*
","The Bodyguard is an OK film, but nothing particularly exciting, I am usually a huge fan of Costner's but here he pretty much bored me, and Whitney Houston should really stick to singing, plus while there are a few memorable moments, like the finale at the award ceremony, I found the killer to be quite predictable. Costner and Houston's chemistry was really lacking, and it's also way over long for it's own good, plus I am surprised this was the huge box office hit it was. It does have a few tense moments here and there, and Costner has a couple good scenes, however the ending is too stupid, as I felt there kiss was too passionate!. None of the characters were particularly likable, and this deserves it's low rating it has, plus the dialog was quite boring in my opinion. This had the potential to be a great entertaining film, but it's ruined by over length, and dullness, and characters we can't give a damn about, so Overall it's worth a watch i suppose but don't go out of your way to see it. **1/2 out of 5(barely)The Acting is OK. Kevin Costner is alright here, but not at his best, I think he is a great actor, but here he is mostly dull, as is his character, he tried to come off as a Bodyguard who was tough, but I simply didn't buy it, he had a couple of good scenes, but he was mostly miscast. Whitney Houston is so so in her 1st major role, she's definitely good at the singing, but acting she's not that great at, I didn't buy her role, and her character got on my nerves. Gary Kemp plays his annoying selfish role well as Sy. Bill Cobbs is good in his role as Devaney and did what he had to do well. Tomas Arana is OK in his role, and did a decent job near the end. Michele Lamar Richards is OK as the selfish sister she did decent. Mike Starr is alright as Tony and brought some comic relief. DeVaughn Nixon is a cute kid, and did fine in his role.",6,1,4,28 June 2007
The Beach," Surprisingly decent and always interesting WARNING!!!!!! SPOILERS!!!
",Surprisingly decent flick and it's always interesting if a little confusing. another one of the films i found laying around the house. There were quite a few things to like about this film the beautiful scenery and that island looked awesome and also looked like a wonderful place to stay the performances were great and it was never boring but i thought the finale got too muddled and silly in the finale also a bit too chaotic as well. Nevertheless it's nowhere near as bad as people have made it out to be Yes the script is very uneven but at least it never bored me and actually managed to be suspenseful in sequences until it got a bit too silly but that's a minor thing. there isn't much gore but quite a bit of violence we get a few people riddled with bullets and it's pretty bloody we also get a chewed up leg that was cringe inducing and some other VERY minor stuff. The Acting is actually VERY good Leonardo DiCaprio is EXCELLENT in the lead role showing vulnerability and he is also on top of things great job!. Tilda Swinton in my opinion over acted in this and didn't perform that well. at least she was bearable. Virginie Ledoyen is BEAUTIFUL and does very well here i thought she did a great job and i liked her lots. Guillame Canet also does very well here he has a thick french accent and does quite well. Overall. worth the watch and it's a little bit above average **1/2 out of 5,Null,2,7,5 October 2004
Fast & Furious 6," An exhilarating sequel! Maybe a bit too exhilarating....(If there is such a thing)
","Everybody is reaping the benefits from the successful heist they pulled off. Dom gets an unexpected visit from Hobbs. He gives Dom some life-altering news about Letty. It turns out that Letty is alive and well, but suffering from severe memory loss. With the help of Hobbs, Brian, and the rest of the crew, Dom is forced to track down Shawn (Evans) to not only get the love of his life back, but a full pardon as well. I'll be honest! I questioned why they decided to make a sixth film. After a fantastic fifth movie, I didn't think there was much left to do. I'm happy to say they proved me wrong in a big way. If you thought the action was insane in the first one, you haven't seen anything yet! The stunts in this one make some of the action scenes in Fast Five look like child's play! Fast Five had enthralling action, but this one manages to outdo it. As crazy as it may sound, it's almost a little TOO much at times! Don't get me wrong! I had a blast with this movie, just had a penchant to go a tad overboard with it. It doesn't give you many chances to breathe, keeping the pedal to the medal at all times! Shootouts, car chases, hand to hand combat, and much more! It throws in everything but the kitchen sink. That being said, some of the action is borderline OTT! Some of the stuff they evade was highly unrealistic (Especially Dom! He looked like Superman on a couple of occasions), but I had a lot of fun with it anyway. I think the fifth movie is a bit better than this one, but I would say this movie is darker than the previous installment. There is more on the line in this one. There isn't a ton of violence; didn't need it! You don't need buckets of blood to make effective fights & action! This series proves it. I also liked how they referenced some of the other movies in this series! They clearly cared about their fan base. The performances are what you would expect! Vin Diesel is as cool as ever! He had more to play with in this one, and I thought he did fairly well with the emotional stuff. I still think Riddick is a cooler character, but I've always enjoyed him as Toretto. Paul Walker takes a bit of a step back in this one. His role is still prominent, but not as much as Vin's. He did very well with what he had to do. It was cool to see him as a Father. Dwayne Johnson is the ultimate bad-ass. He steals many scene's he's in with his gruff persona. I couldn't help but grin when he was on-screen! I'm very happy they made him a regular character in this series. Michelle Rodriguez makes her return to the franchise after being 'Killed off' (In reality she had to spend some time in Jail) I thought she performed adequately for the most part. She had some memorable scenes. Her chemistry with Vin was decent. I'm sure die-hard's will appreciate the storyline between them. Jordana Brewster doesn't have very much to do until the finale. Gina Carano isn't much of an actress, but boy can she scrap! Her scrap with Rodriguez at a subway station was magnificent! I didn't get the pointless twist that came out of left field with her character! It made no sense. Luke Evans is a bit of a bland villain, but it didn't matter in the scheme of things. Jason Statham makes a brief cameo at the end to set up his role for the sequel. Gibson, Kang, the rest of the cast do fine. I was impressed how they spread the screen time out to everyone. How do they outdo this one? I didn't even think they could outdo the fifth one! The fifth movie is a better movie overall, but this sequel is pretty awesome as well. I recommend that you to forget about the plot, just have fun! There is way too much action to even notice that sort of thing. I'm not sure how I feel about the upcoming sequel considering Paul Walker's tragic death, but I'm looking forward to it nonetheless! If you want insane action and you're a fan of this series, look no further than this one8.3/10",8,5,8,1 November 2014
Scary Movie 2," Aside from James Wood's funny opening scene and Kathleen Robertson, this movie can kiss my ass!
","Woe is me; was this unfunny! They must have rushed this one into production after the smashing success of the original. I very much enjoy the original Scary Movie, but this one is truly god awful. The opening scene with James Woods as a priest is sidesplitting. They spoof The Exorcist, and it was brilliant. It's all downhill from thereÂ… There is an unfunny Charlie's Angel's spoof (Why did that need to be spoofed, again?) The cast itself is just fine. It has way too many juvenile jokes. I always expect hit and misses with these movies, but most of them ARE misses. There is plenty of semen jokes and crude stuff like that. We also get one of the most annoying comedians in the world today. (Chris Elliot) I can't stomach the guy. He does nothing but gross out gags throughout the film, and I just wanted to slap him one. Watching Kathleen Robertson's cleavage bop up and down is a rather nice distraction. Her cleavage does the acting for her. Great performance! Anna Farris is fine as per usual. She plays it all straight faced like a trooper; I just wish she had better stuff to work with. Christopher Masterson makes me pine for Jon Abrahams. The Wayan brothers do their thang and it's not as funny this time around. Regina Hall sticks out like a sore thumb. I actually got very annoyed by her in this one. Tori Spelling & Tim Curry are both OK. David Cross is excruciatingly unfunny as the invalidFinal Thoughts: This is what happens when you get greedy and rush production. Scary Movie is quite funny, this isn't! By far the worst in the series 2/10",2,0,0,24 August 2013
Final Destination 2," Honestly? I found it to be a pretty stupid affair..
","Slight Spoilers so if you haven't seen the movie, don't read.Final Destination 2 is a perfect example of how to tarnish a great original. I know plenty of people who actually loved this film, even more than the 1st, and while that's great and all, it can't even touch the 1st. For starters Final Destination 2 is clearly lacking in the Suspense department, and that's one of the reasons that made the original so great, here it's focused on making as many gruesome and creative death sequences as possible. I admit I had fun with the Death sequences, but most of the characters that got them, I was glad to see go due to them being unlikable. I completely disagreed with the killing of Clear's character, and the explanation for Alex's death was pretty lame if you ask me. The opening car accident scene is the reason to see this movie, it was by far the best part in the movie, it was extremely well done.Performances. Ali Larter shows up to reprise her role as Clear. Despite top billing, she is NOT a main character, at least not like you may think. She's rocking the gorgeous blonde locks, and does what she can with the silly material, but the script pretty much wastes her. A.J. Cook is decent but overdid it at times in my opinion. She's cute no doubt about that, but I didn't buy her fully like I should have. Michael Landes is OK as the Cop heroine, but didn't really have much of a character, his character development was pretty crappy. Keegan Connor Tracy is alright as the snobby business executive. Terrence 'T.C.' Carson is funny and annoying at the same time as Eugene. Tony Todd makes another cameo in the same role as the 1st. Jonathan Cherry is a riot as the coke fiend, I got a kick out of him.Bottom line. Final Destination 2 had its moments, but in the end I found it to be rather stupid and insulting. It's played for laughs a lot, and kinda ruins the original's reputation. I loved this movie when I was younger, but thankfully i've smartened up since then. Worth a look for fellow Horror fans, but I'd stick with the Original.5 1/2 /10",5,1,2,24 April 2010

Wesley Snipes is amazing as always, and is amazing here, he is very likable,and actually seemed to be enjoying himself this time, had had a sense of humor, and had more to play with!, he can also kick that ass with the best of them, and he did good in his emotional scenes!, nobody but Snipes could have played Blade in my opinion!. (Snipes Rules!!!!!). Kris Kristofferson is great as Whistler once again, he was likable and had great chemistry with Snipes. Ron Perlman is really good here, his character was always unpredictable, and mysterious!, i liked him. Leonor Varela is very hot and did what she had to do well i really liked her. Norman Reedus is OK here, but got on my nerves a lot of the time, however there was a good twist involving him. Thomas Kretschmann was decent here and did his job adequately. Luke Goss is fantastic here as Nomak, and looked way cool i loved him. Donnie Yen is good but has nothing to do,he still rocked though.

Blades of Glory," It actually made me laugh!
","Chazz Michael Michaels and Jimmy MacElroy are banned from figure skating for life after a brawl breaks out between the two of them during the medal ceremony. With the help of Coach (Craig T. Nelson) , Chazz and Jimmy reluctantly decide to make a comeback in pairs. The Van Waldenberg's (Poehler & Arnett) do everything they can to thwart those plans to undermine them with underhanded tactics. I'm not a big Will Ferrell fan. I hated this movie the first time I saw it. I thought it was completely unfunny. I'm not sure if it was the type of mood I was in, but I actually thought it wasn't too shabby this time around. The premise is absolutely juvenile and silly, but there are some genuine laughs here. The laughs are intermittent, but I laughed a lot more than I expected to. This has your 'typical' comedy cast and I dislike figure skating as a sport in general, but Ferrell and Heder manage to make it work somehow. It does have some lazy humor (Ferrell singing My Humps by the Black Eyed Peas flopped badly) But there are some raunchy gags that legitimately cracked me up. The figure skating action is actually fun to watch. Despite that it's done in comedic fashion, I didn't mind watching it. Will Ferrell gives one of his better performances here. He's still lazy at times, but he actually made me laugh. I'll give credit where it's due. Jon Heder plays a great straight man. His chemistry with Ferrell was solid. Craig T. Nelson takes everything seriously and was a lot of fun to watch. Amy Poehler & Will Arnett make solid foes for Ferrell & Heder. Jenna Fischer did well in her role. As a huge Boy Meets World fan, I had to point this out! William Daniels (Mr. Feeny) makes an appearance as a commissioner!I'll take what I can get. It's far from great, but I laughed a fair amount, even if it was sporadic. If you enjoy silly humor, you'll certainly get your money's worth here. I was pleasantly surprised.6.4/10",6,0,1,11 May 2015
Underworld Awakening," Better than the last few sequels, but that isn't saying much
","(Credit IMDb) When human forces discover the existence of the Vampire and Lycan clans, a war to eradicate both species commences. The vampire warrioress Selene leads the battle against humankind.I'm not a big fan of this series. The first one was decent, but the rest have left a lot to be desired. It's a shame, because Selene is a terrific anti-hero and Kate Beckinsale gives her justice. It starts off interestingly enough, but isn't able to keep up the excitement throughout. It's also a bit hollow as well. I saw this over a year ago and don't remember much about it. Underworld fans will most likely love it, but I thought it was OK at best5.3/10",5,1,3,22 February 2014

Taxi Driver," Utterly Amazing film and is unquestionably one of the greatest films ever made in my opinion WARNING!!!!!! SPOILERS!!!!!!
",Utterly Amazing film and is unquestionably one of the greatest films ever made in my opinion Robert Deniro is one of the best actors of all time and his performance here is spellbinding (but more on that later). This film has incredible direction by Martin Scorsee and amazing performances all around. beware the finale is not for the faint of heart for casual viewers as it was incredibly graphic for it's time kinda tame now still very graphic indeed we get a very graphic gunshot to the head with blood and brains splattering on the wall a knife in the hand and arm blood everywhere in the finale and a few more graphic bloody gunshot wounds. For some reason i felt a little uneasy while watching this film but in a good way i was deeply disturbed by some of the scenes SPOILERS!! watching DeNiro fiddle around with those guns made me feel uneasy. The Acting is no doubt Oscar Worthy Robert Deniro is quite simply one of the best actors there ever was and ever will be (sorry to get off subject here when i say Arnold Schwarzenegger is my favorite actor i mean he's the most fun to watch not the best as far as acting goes in fact he's not really that great of an actor he is just a fun guy to watch. just wanted to let people know that Now Deniro is no doubt my favorite as far as acting is concerned and his performance here is simply amazing astounding words can't describe it he had me squirming in my seat with a sense uneasiness always he deserved to win That Oscar by far YOU RULE BOBBY!!!!!. Cybill Sheppard is beautiful and does great here wish she had more screen time though. Peter Boyle is also good here in his very limited screen time. Jodie Foster is an amazing actress and she took on a tough role here and did a wonderful job!. Harvey Keitel is the man and he cracked me up and looked funny with long hair (or was that a wig). Overall this is unquestionably one of the greatest movies ever made SEE THIS THIS INSTANT!!! ***** out of 5,Null,4,7,28 October 2004

Pacific Rim," It's far from perfect but the action makes it a pretty enjoyable blockbuster
","I've grown tired of summer blockbusters. I love action movies but with all the Transformer movies, comic book adaptations, among others things, it gets a bit much after a while. Pacific Rim is typically overlong but I can't deny how enjoyable it is. The middle is a bit slow at times. I thought it got a bit too talky at times, and my interest began to wane. I did love the final 40/50 minutes. The final 40/50 minutes is absolutely packed with non-stop carnage and destruction. It's loaded with CGI; don't get me wrong, it just didn't bother me. The production design is extremely impressive, and it's amazing visually. The destruction on the cities, the robots, the monsters all looked fantastic. My only problem as I explained above is that when you aren't being amazed by all of that stuff, it does tend to be a little mundane at certain points, but it has a lot more good than bad. The performances can be a little bland at times. Charlie Hunnam isn't the most exciting lead. He's OK at best. I never really got into his emotional plight. Since the movie is over two hours long, he didn't have nearly enough charisma to maintain my interest. Thankfully, the fantastic action tends to bail him out a lot of the time, but I wasn't all that impressed by him. Idris Elba is excellent as per usual. He's by far the most interesting character in this movie. His gruff, yet caring character was a blast to watch. Rinko Kikuchi is rather uninteresting as Mako. She has moments where she does good work. I just think she seemed a little uncomfortable during some of the meatier moments. Charlie Day is alternately funny and annoying as a scientist. Final Thoughts: Aside from the mediocre performances, the rather boring middle section, I thought this was well above average for a blockbuster movie. It sets out to entertain the masses. It does that extremely well. Considering I had low expectations going in, I was pleasantly surprised. It's a little overlong but if you kick your brain to the curb, sit back, relax, and enjoy the abundance of destruction7.6/10",7,2,3,24 December 2013
Bridget Jones's Diary," EXCELLENT Romance/comedy
","This was an excellent Romance/comedy film that is good natured and very funny. Renee and Colin were wonderful together and had very good chemistry. I'm not usually into these type of movies, there more like chick flicks, but this one was excellent it had a very good story and Renee is absolutely irresistible . However there is a problem i had (a minor one) and that was Hugh Grant i can't stomach this guy he annoys the crap out of me, and find him cocky and arrogant, and thankfully he didn't have a ton of screen time. The dialog is engaging and witty and i loved the scenes with Firth and Renee. The acting is Oscar Worthy. Renee Zellweger gives an Oscar worthy performance here, she is EXTREMELY likable had great chemistry with Firth (and as much as i hate to admit it Hugh Grant too, plus she was pretty hot. Hugh Grant did okay here and had good chemistry with Renee but i am just not a fan of his. Colin Firth is Excellent here and very likable, and i loved the Hugh Grant and Firth fight scene!, plus his chemistry with Renee is so on!. Gemma Jones is good as Bridget;s mom but didn't have much to do. Jim Broadbent was good as Bridget's dad. Overall i highly recommend this funny romantic comedy you won't be disappointed! ****1/2 out of 5 a must see!",9,0,2,25 December 2004
Captain America: The First Avenger," Somewhat languid and rather dreary...
","I saw this initially when it came out, but was pretty bored by it. After enjoying the latest Captain America installment I decided to revisit this one and give it another chance. Captain America isn't horrible, but it gives you a big case of the blah's for many stretches and that's the main problem. This movie desperately needed more humor in it and that's something they improved greatly on in the sequel. A superhero movie should not feel lifeless, but that's exactly what it felt like on far too many occasions. The storytelling is solid, but basic. It really felt like they were going through the motions. Another problem is the lack of dynamic action. I honestly can't recall one action scene that stood out to me. I will give credit to the set pieces. They mirrored the time period precisely and I bought into the retroactive atmosphere. It really was disappointing that the storytelling was so basic because it could have been so much more! Steven Rogers's story was a very interesting one, but it is told so generically with needless meandering. Chris Evans is very good as Captain America! I thought he was ideal to play the part. It's not his fault he didn't have much to work with. This was a perfect casting choice and thankfully they didn't let him down in the second movie. I also admired the dedication and commitment to get buff and scrawny. He was easily the best part about this movie. Tommy Lee Jones is as engaging as ever in a thinly written role. His gruff persona was a hoot. Hayley Atwill is OK as Roger's love interest. Their attraction felt forced and slightly awkward. Hugo Weaving is solid if uninspired as Red Skull. I thought he came off as very cartoonish myself. Samuel Jackson shows up at the end very briefly to set up the sequel. The rest of the cast is OKI didn't dislike this movie, but it was inexcusably bland. It was far too long to be as dull as it is. As good as Chris Evans is, he can't overcome everything. 5.5/10",5,0,1,4 September 2014
Top Secret!," Funny, but not as funny as I was expecting as I was a bit disappointed, however I still enjoyed it *minor spoilers*
","This is funny, but not as funny as I was expecting as I was a bit disappointed, however I still enjoyed it. All the characters are cool, and the story is fun, plus Val Kiler is surprisingly above average in this!. It's pretty well made and written, and while it didn't really have any real ending, it was still amusing, however I'll be honest I didn't find some of the spoofs funny, because I just didn't get them. There is one hilarious scene where Kilmer is fighting a guy in an underwater Bar, and he also cracked me up whenever he started singing, plus Christopher Villiers is fun as the villain. all the characters are very likable except for that guy who checked for tickets at the train stop, and while I wouldn't consider this to be anywhere near as funny as The Airplane or Naked Gun films it was still a pretty funny film, plus the whole cast seemed to be enjoying themselves and what was even better was they all played it straight!. It would be cool if they made a sequel to this, and even if you Aren't laughing your head off you'll still be chuckling. This is funny, but not as funny as I was expecting as I was a bit disappointed, however I still enjoyed it, and I highly recommend this one!. The Direction is great!. Jim Abrahams and The Zucker brothers do a great! job here with very good camera work, solid angles and keeping the film amusing and at a fast pace. The Acting is fun. Val Kilmer is surprisingly very funny and likable here, I usually really dislike him in films but he was great here, as this role suited him, and he seemed to be having a lot of fun, why can't he do more stuff like this?. Lucy Gutteridge is decent as the love interest and did what she had to adequately and had fun with it. Christopher Villiers is great fun as the villain I really liked him. Peter Cushing has a cool role here too. Michael Gough is great as the father&doctor I liked him as well. Rest of the cast are fine. Overall while I was a bit disappointed I still highly recommend it!. ***1/2 out of 5",8,0,0,22 April 2006
Fargo," Brilliant Piece Of Filmaking,With Fantastic Story Telling, And Oscar Worthy Performances!
","This is a brilliant piece of film making, with fantastic story telling, and Oscar worthy performances!. All the characters are fantastic, and it had some great comedy bits, plus Frances McDormand and William H. Macy are simply amazing in this!. I had heard people rave about this film everywhere so i decided to check it out for myself, and i must say, i can see why it's so popular, plus i thought the ending fit this film perfectly!. It's quite suspenseful at times, and constantly unpredictable, plus while Frances McDormand deserved her Oscar, William. H Macy deserved it too. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare are great as the villains, and the story is extremely engrossing, plus some of the scenes were very shocking. It's brilliantly written and made, and i thought, the scene where Macy's wife gets kidnapped was very powerful, plus i loved the Dark Comedy bits as well!. This is brilliant film making at it's finest, with fantastic story telling, and Oscar Worthy performances, and i say Go see it now!.The Direction is wonderful!. Joel Coen does a wonderful job here, with fantastic camera work, awesome angles, great POV shots, and keeping the film at an extremely engrossing pace. The Acting is no doubt Oscar worthy!. William H Macy is AMAZING here, he is extremely likable, had some great facial reactions, as his character was quite pathetic, but he did an incredible job of portraying it, he is one of the most underrated actors out there, and in my opinion deserved an Oscar for this! (Macy rules!).Frances McDormand is also AMAZING here , she deserved her Oscar, had some great dialog, had a great accent, and while her character was nothing out of the ordinary, it was fascinating just the same!. Steve Buscemi is fantastic as one of the main villains, he can do this role in his sleep, and he was also hilarious at times, i loved him!. Peter Stormare is great here,as the other villain and did his job extremely well. Rest of the cast do awesome. Overall Go See It now it's a masterpiece. ***** out of 5",10,2,3,22 August 2005
Nightcrawler," I was blown away!
","I actually wasn't all that enthused about going to see this. If I go to a theater and it's almost two hours, I get a little anxious. Sometimes I have trouble sitting put in the theater if it doesn't engage me. Thankfully, this movie made me forget about the running time and took me on a ride I won't forget anytime soon. Until I see otherwise, this is the movie I will be rooting for come Oscar season. This isn't terrifying in the typical way! This movie is terrifying because of the realistic nature. It is a fantastic look at the ethics of broadcasting. Morals and ethics are thrown out the window to a big degree in this movie. Hardly anybody is sympathetic in this movie. (Except for Ahmed) It's unabashedly unapologetic and I respected that heavily.It grips you right from the outset and doesn't let go until the end. Everything about this movie is amazing. Even the cinematography is incredible. Some of it was truly mind-blowing to look at! Shooting a lot of the scenes at night augmented things in a big way. It was a very memorable experience. I was disgusted and disturbed to see how far somebody would go for the price of fame. Jake Gyllenhall gives a harrowing portrayal of Louis Bloom. He's an eccentric weirdo, but a fascinating one. I abhor his character, but I couldn't look away. He plays one of the most despicable characters I've ever had the pleasure of watching. His performance packs a wallop and I hope he picks up an Oscar for best actor! I'll never look at him the same way again. Rene Russo is excellent as Nina. Her character isn't as appalling as Jake's, but she was pretty evil herself. She still knows how to command the screen and delivered a great performance. Her chemistry with Gyllenhall was pretty good. At the age of 60, she's still gorgeous! Bill Paxton can play these types of charismatic slime balls in his sleep, but it was still a lot of fun to see him work his magic. Riz Ahmed is the only sympathetic character in this movie. He's flawed, but he has morals and he's genuine. I'm not too familiar with him, but he was awesome. The ending had major balls to end like it did. I was shocked, repulsed, and mortified. That being said, I loved every minute of it. I love anything that makes me think about it for a day or two after! Nightcrawler managed to do just that. Not sure this movie will be for everyone, but anybody that appreciates great filmmaking, good character development, and flawless acting should love it! Either way, you should take the risk! Plunge into the world of Nightcrawler and prepare to get dirty! You're in for a ride. 10/10",10,2,5,18 November 2014
Oblivion," A pretty entertaining Sci-Fi epic
","This is far from a perfect movie, nor is it one of Cruise's best. But as far as Sci-Fi epics goes, it's a pretty entertaining two hours or so. This is not a very original Sci-Fi picture. It borrows from movies, such as Total Recall, 2001 Space Odyssey, among others. My argument to those bashing this movie is that many movies are derivative at this juncture. There are some movies that are original these days, but the problem is that so many things have been done. My advice is to ignore the plot holes, the derivative nature, and just try and enjoy yourself. If you manage to do that, you'll probably have a good time. It's fantastic visually. The damaged earth from the war is amazing to look at. The special effects are truly a sight to behold, and it's hard not to be floored by them. My favorite has to be the waterfalls. They were truly breathtaking to look at. The story is a bit jumbled, and a tad weak, I have to admit. I would have liked to see more background on Cruise & Kurylenko. We only get brief snippets from flashbacks a few times during this movie about their past love. More meat behind their love story would have really made this movie all the more entertaining. I did enjoy their chemistry, and the love story was above average, but considering how powerful they were trying to make it, more effort was necessary. Tom Cruise is as reliable as ever. He has a commanding presence that you can't help but enjoy. I wouldn't call it his best performance by any means or even in a Sci-Fi movie (That honor goes to Minority Report) but he has charisma to spare, and he carries this film like a champ. I don't really pay attention to his real life antics. He's one of my favorite actors, because of his talent, not his personal life. I felt his character did regain some of his memory a bit too quickly, but that's a minor carp. Olga Kurylenko is gorgeous, and does well for the most part. She actually conveys her emotions decently, and held her own very well. I enjoyed her. Morgan Freeman is one of the best actors of all time, but he doesn't have much of a part in this one. I relished every chance that I got to see him on screen, but I think he was just here to add star power. He did just fine with what he was given, but a better character would have been appreciated. Andrea Risenborough gave the best female performance here in my opinion. I felt she was excellent. Melissa Leo is fitfully menacing, and her character has a nice homage to 2001 Space Odyssey. Final Thoughts: It has many derivative elements, I must admit. The story isn't as strong as I'd have liked, but I had fun for the most part. The action & visuals deliver. The more I think about it, the more I like it7.5/10",7,1,2,30 November 2013
The Bourne Identity," One of my favorite movies!
","A man who is nearly shot to death gets his life saved by a fisherman. He wakes with amnesia, not knowing who he is. He meets a troubled, but kind woman, Marie. He discovers he is a former assassin named Jason Bourne. Jason must fully figure out why he's being hunted by Treadstone. I think the sequels are amazing as well, but the first is still the best (Though, Bourne Ultimatum is a really close second!) This one feels raw compared to the sequels and the most passionate. I wouldn't say it's action-packed, but the story is very engrossing and there are some action scenes that are exhilarating. There is an amazing (and lengthy) car chase at around the 50 minute mark, which would prove to be a benchmark for the rest of the sequels. I also enjoyed the fight scenes. The shaky cam isn't as prominent as it is in the sequels. If the ending doesn't make you smile, I question your sanity. Another thing I enjoyed about this movie is the character development. Even though Bourne is a Stone Cold killer, his transition into a caring human being was really fun to watch. He really is an anti-hero. Marie is a great character as well. She doesn't have much in her life, so why not go along for the ride? She really has nothing else. It was fun to watch Jason and Marie's relationship evolve. I questioned the casting choice of Damon at first. He didn't seem badass to me , but I'm happy to say he proved me wrong in a big way. I really can't picture anybody else as Bourne. Renner did fine as Aaron Cross in the spin off, but it wasn't the same. I also liked his paranoia as Bourne. It really added to the suspense. Damon is able to make you care about his plight. Franka Potente is solid for the most part. She is stone-faced during some of the most hectic moments, but she comes through. She's got a charm that is hard to resist. Her chemistry with Damon is fantastic and is one of the reasons this movie worked so well. Chris Cooper is really good as the villain. His use of the word 'solider' grated my nerves though. Brian Cox is fine. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje is kinda wasted. Julia Stiles is easy on the eyes and good in her role. Clive Owen shows up briefly as an assassin. This is a phenomenal movie! I consider the Bourne trilogy to be one of the greatest trilogies of all time. I own all of them, and watch them at least once a year. This is still the best! 9.3/10",9,1,2,30 April 2015
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," I've never been too fond of this movie,I much prefer the sequels instead of this slow paced but interesting entry
","The problem for me anyway with this one,was it's slow pace in the middle. The story isn't as strong as it's sequels,and sometimes felt like it was taking forever to get going. I was very absorbed with how it was starting,I loved how it was developing the relationship of Frodo and Bilbo Baggins,and how you could start to see a slight bit of tension due to the ring. But things just seemed to sour after all that,I lost interest in quite a bit of stuff. The set pieces are absolutely incredible,as are the special effects but it's often too dark for it's own good,the sequels had a good sense of humor about them,this one was mostly serious which hurt it in the long run.The performances helped make it bearable,along with a couple of outstanding action sequences that can literally take you're breath away,character development was quite decent as well. Moregoth vs Gandalf was quite a visual experience,it kept me on the edge of my seat,and did a good job of making an emotional impact. Fellowship is definitely well made,it's quite a sight to look at but as far as the fun factor is concerned there isn't a lot there,Ring fans will love it,but as far as regular audiences I'm not too sure.The Performances. Elijah Wood was pretty decent for the most part,while he looks much more comfortable and at home in the sequels,he manages to pull it off for the most part here. His chemistry with Sean Astin is absolutely excellent,you believe in there friendship,and the script manages to make you care about what happens to him. My only major gripe is I thought he overacted in the infamous demise of Gandalf 'GANDALLLLFFFFFFF!!' I thought it was a bit over the top,but that's just me. Sean Astin is an actor who i'm not very fond of,but he's very likable here. Like Rudy he proved he can be a capable actor with the right material and his character has that right material. Ian McKellen is a revelation as Gandalf. He's completely intense,yet vulnerable with a great sense of humor,it's just a great performance for a memorable character. Viggo Mortensen is OK here. He's definitely not the actor who pulled of Oscar worthy performances like 'The Road' or 'History of Violence' but he's adequate. He has a certain charm that manages to overcome his somewhat wooden performance at times,his above average chemistry with the actors also helps. Orlando Bloom has one of the coolest characters without a doubt,for an elf he looks completely bad ass,with a lot of charisma..loved him!. Billy Boyd&Dominic Monaghan are the comic relief and it shows,they were bearable but just barley. Ian Holm is very credible as Bilbo putting on just the right amount of emotion and vulnerability. Christopher Lee Is simply chilling,often frightening his role is even more expanded in Two Towers. John Rhys-Davies got on my nerves one too many times with his sch tick,it seemed like he belonged in another film. Liv Tyler I didn't know what to make of,she's certainly great to look at but her performance seemed force and her chemistry with Viggo was mediocre. Hugo Weaving was alright he had a certain presence he brought along with him and did what he had to do well. Cate Blanchett didn't have a lot to do but did it well. Sean Bean was excellent as per usual. His character is completely unpredictable and had me on the edge of my seat whenever he was possessed by the ring.Bottom Line. Fellowship is a worthy film,but it's often too dark to be considered truly enjoyable. There were a lot of things I liked about it no doubt,but I most definitely prefer the two sequels there more action packed with better stories,and most importantly humorous. Recommended though.8/10",8,1,4,15 December 2009
The Matrix Revolutions," Wonderful Way, To End One Of The Best Trilogies Of All Time In My Opinion!, It's One Of The Most Underrated Sequels Out There!
","This was a wonderful way, to end one of the best trilogies of all time in my opinion!, it's one of the most underrated sequels out there. All the characters are awesome once again, and the story is simply fascinating, plus Keanu Reeves and Hugo Weaving are simply amazing in this!. The ending is quite confusing and leaves you thinking, and i know a lot of Matrix fans were not pleased with this final installment of the series, however i absolutely loved it, as i found it extremely exciting, with incredible visuals, amazing special effects and characters that you root for!, plus the fight scenes are absolutely incredible!. I wish Carrie-Anne Moss had more to do, same goes for Laurence Fishbrune however, Keanu and others carried the film really well, and, the gun and machine battles were fantastic!, plus the opening train sequence was simply fascinating!. While not quite as good as the Matrix it's definitely as good as Reloaded, as this was a wonderful way to end one of the best trilogies of all time in my opinion!, it's one of the most underrated sequels out there!, and i say Go see it now. The Direction is incredible!. The Wachowski brothers do an incredible job here, with stunning camera work, mind blowing angles, incredible visuals, great slow mo shots and keeping the film at an incredibly fast pace!. There is a bit of blood and violence. We get bloody gunshot wounds,bloody impaling's,gouged out eyes,guy's face is cut to pieces,bloody stabbings, harsh beatings and more!. The Acting is excellent!. Keanu Reevs is AMAZING as always, and is amazing here, he gives his best performance in the series (in my opinion), is focused, had great chemistry with Carrie once again, looked damn cool, and was really into his role, he was amazing! (Keanu Rules!!!!!!). Carrie-Anne Moss is beautiful and did what she had to do well, and had good chemistry with Reeves once again, however her role was pretty thankless here, she still rocked though (Carrie rules!). Laurence Fishburne is not his usual fantastic self because he has nothing to do, but stand there and do nothing, and spurt out dialog, not much of a part, really thankless role. Hugo Weaving is AMAZING here as Agent Smith, he is at his most intense here as Smith, and was extremely menacing and lovable! (Weaving rules). Mary Alice does a great job replacing Gloria Foster as the Oracle i liked her lots. Jada Pinkett Smith is way hot, and does excellent with what she had to do once again, and had good chemistry with Fishburne. Harold Perrineau Jr. is great as Link once again i liked him lots. Nona Gaye is good as Link's lover, and did what she had to do well. Monica Bellucci(Persephone),Helmut Bakaitis(architect),Harry J. Lennix(Lock),Clayton Watson(kid),Lambert Wilson(Merovingian), and all the rest do fine. Overall Go see it now!. ***** out of 5",10,0,1,5 October 2005
Man of Steel," I was floored
","After the planet Krypton is destroyed, newly born Kal-El, is sent to earth. The Kent's find and raise him like their own son. He struggles to find the meaning of his existence and his extraordinary abilities. When General Zodis released, he promises to destroy Earth and turn it into the new planet Krypton. But more importantly, obliterate Superman as well. After an elaborate (and arguably overlong opening) I feared that this would be another disappointment like Superman Returns. Thankfully, that was far from the case. I loved this unique take on Superman. I'm sure people have complained that it decided to do things differently, but I'm not one of those people. Superman was begging for a reinvention of sorts. They didn't try to play it safe, they wanted to go down a new path and succeeded with it. I thought they did a really good job of making sure to keep the traditional Superman formula intact, while creating their own vision as well. It was the best of both worlds, really. The action scenes are absolutely astounding. The first half of the film is full of exceptional storytelling, but it turns into an action extravaganza sometime in the second half. The action blew me away. Yes, it's filled with copious amounts of CGI, but the action is exhilarating. Even an I-Hop gets destroyed! We do get a decent upbringing with Clark Kent's childhood. It is mostly done in flashback style in a scattered manner, but it was still riveting to watch. The acting is excellent in my books. Henry Cavill is by far the best Superman since Christopher Reeves. It took me a little while to warm up to him, but once I did, there was no turning back. He had great intensity, the right look, and had Superman down pat. I'm glad they chose him. With all due respect to Margot Kidder, who is very good as well, Amy Adams is my favorite Lois Lane. She's wiser and a bit more engaging to watch. She had good chemistry with Cavill. Michael Shannon chews up the scenery as Zod and I had a blast with him. This guy's intensity was off the charts. Russell Crowe isn't a favorite of mine, but he was pretty good as Jor-El. He certainly has more screen time than Marlon Brando did. Lane & Costner are rock solid as Clark's parents, Lane especially. Fishburne plays a more courageous version of Perry White, and I dug it. I smiled heavily at the ending. Longtime Superman fans will get a huge kick out of what commences. My only major carp is that it lacks humor in needed situations. Final Thoughts: I was truly floored by this reboot. Superman Returns was such a dud, I feared we might never see a good Superman movie. The action is incredible and rarely lets up. The storytelling is excellent, as is everything else. I give this movie my highest recommendation. I'm jacked for Batman Vs Superman. 9.3/10",9,7,12,24 February 2014
Footloose," Not just your typical 80's fluff, it's got heart.
","Footloose is far from an original movie, but it's got the heart it needs to be an entertaining 80's diversion. What I love about the 80's is the cheese factor, and Footloose has plenty of that, but in a good way, that's one thing a lot of movies lack now a days. Kevin Bacon is pretty solid and charismatic in his 1st lead role, but the heart and sole of the movie in my opinion is Lori Singer. I just found more to relate to her then I did Ren's character. It has all the usual typical 80 clichés, like abusive men, cheesy dance sequences, classic 80's songs, and a happy ending, but that is one of the reason why 80's movies were so great, they have the heart like a lot movies now a days don't have. The best sequence in the movie had to be where Ren|Bacon| teaches Williard|Chris Penn| how to dance, it's funny and quite touching at the same time. Footloose isn't a masterpiece, nor is it gonna make your day, but it will do is entertain you for 100 or so minutes.Performances. Kevin Bacon is pretty good in his 1st starring role. This is the role that pretty much made him a star, but he does have his green moments. Lori Singer is beautiful, and gives the best performance in the film. I was amazed by her ferocity and how she wouldn't back down from anything, and I felt sorry for what she had to deal with. John Lithgow gives an excellent performance as an over-protective preacher. He will test your patience, but he is so good, you can't help but appreciate him. Chris Penn is really good in a supporting role, as Ren's best friend. Sarah Jessica Parker has a small role as Rusty, she was too cute.Bottom line. Footloose is an entertaining 80's film. It's great for nostalgia reasons, and it will put a smile on your face when all is said and done. Recommended7/10",7,1,3,2 April 2010
The Color of Money," Not as good as The Hustler, but still a top notch sequel in my opinion, with a fantastic story and brilliant performances!
","This is not as good as The Hustler,but still a top notch sequel in my opinion, with a fantastic story and brilliant performances!. All the characters are wonderful, and I thought the ending was just great, plus Paul Newman and Tom Cruise are simply incredible in this!. The 2nd half was just as good as the 1st in my opinion, and I believe Newman truly deserved his Oscar here as he deserved it in The Hustler as well, plus him and Cruise had wonderful chemistry together. Some of the pool shots Cruise made blew me away, and while both Newman's and Cruise's characters were jerks, I just couldn't help but love them, plus Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is excellent as Cruise's girlfriend. The pool match between Newman and Cruise was excellent! and dare I say Cruise deserved an Oscar nomination??, plus this should be much higher then 6.8 in my opinion. I actually felt bad when Forest Whitaker's character hustled Eddie, and Martin Scorsese did a masterful job of directing as always, plus it's actually very unpredictable throughout, as I had no clue on what was going to happen next!.This is one of Cruise's best performances, and I was so impressed with how Newman, was able to play Eddie so easily after not playing him since the 60's with the Hustler, plus I think this film is quite underrated myself!. For a sequel, you can't get much better then this, and all the characters were extremely likable, plus Cruise's likable cockiness was perfect for this part!. It's extremely well made and written, and I thought the dialog was awesome, plus it had some great emotional scenes as well. Newman's teaching tactics were a bit confusing at times, however they were still great, and while it can't quite match the suspense of The Hustler, it still had plenty of it, plus it would be really cool if they made a follow up to this! with Newman and Cruise attached to star. The music was great, and Newman's final line at he end put a big grin on my face! plus Cruise also had excellent chemistry with Mastrantonio!. This is not as good as the hustler, but still a top notch sequel in my opinion, with a fantastic story and brilliant performances, and I say Go see it now, if you loved The Hustler, you will most likely will love this, just go in with low expectations.The Direction is masterful!. Martin Scorsese does a masterful job here as always, with wonderful camera work, and just keeping the film at an extremely engrossing pace.The Acting is indeed Oscar worthy in my opinion!. Paul Newman is incredible here, just like he was in The Hustler, he truly deserved his Oscar, just like he did in The Hustler also, and he is able to match his incredible performance, as well, he also had wonderful chemistry with Cruise, had some fantastic lines , had some brilliant scenes with Cruise, and while his character was a bit of a jerk I just couldn't help but love him, as he was extremely likable! (Newman Rules!!!!!!). Tom Cruise is amazing as always, and is also incredible here, he truly deserved at least an Oscar nomination,in my opinion, he also had wonderful chemistry with Newman and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, was likably cocky, as always had loads of charisma, and made some pretty wicked shots!, and did wonderful in his emotional&anger scenes,and while his character was a jerk like Newman's I also couldn't help but love him! (Cruise Rules!!!!!!!!!). Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio was wonderful here, and while she may or may not have deserved her Oscar for best supporting actress, she was very sexy, and had wonderful chemistry with Cruise, I really liked her!. Helen Shaver is good as Newman's girlfriend I dug her. John Turturro is good as the dick Julian, and was convincing. Forest Whitaker is good in his cameo as Amos he was great. Rest of the cast do fine.Overall Go see it immediately if you loved The Hustler like I did, you shouldn't regret it!, just go in with low expectations and don't expect the original. ***** out of 5",10,2,5,8 February 2006
Radio," One of Cuba's greatest performances, in this heart-warming real life account of Radio Kennedy.
","Radio was a movie I had heard mixed things about, but because I'm such a huge fan of Cuba Gooding, I of course checked it out. I adore Ed Harris so watching him and Cuba act alongside each other was a treat to watch. Radio I suppose is a predictable piece of sentimentality, but the way it's done is wonderful. I have worked with people who are mentally challenged and ever since then, I have grown to understand and deal with them with patience, so while I was watching the story unfold, I couldn't help but feel emotion for Radio. I really don't understand how Cuba Gooding earned a razzy for his performance here, I felt it was Oscar worthy!. I really feel Radio is a nice feel-good story of a kid that's mentally challenged being accepted by the society that he is living in, and becoming a legend in his own right. Maybe people won't love it as much as I did, but if you've worked with these kinds of kids perhaps you'd understand why I got into this as much as I did.Performances. Cuba Gooding gives yet again a fantastic performance. This should have revived his career, but instead he's doing many crappy DTV movies now, which is very sad with a man of his caliber of talent. He feels mentally challenged, looks mentally challenged, it really was a phenomenal performance. Ed Harris is just as good. His character isn't as hard to play, but he has a lot of heart and his character was just as important.Bottom line. Radio is a great piece of sentimentality, and it's bound to jerk a few tears or two, see it.9/10",9,8,9,13 June 2010
Cast Away," A splendid film
","After a horrific plane crash, Chuck Noland is the only one left alive, marooned on an island with nobody but himself. He is forced to try to adapt to everything around him and conjure up courage he never thought he had. This is the second time I've seen this movie, and it was as good the second time around. This is a real character study that requires patience and your thinking cap to be activated. The slow build serves this movie well, but I'm not sure how much this movie will appeal to casual film goers. For true movie lovers it's a real treat. It's a very a powerful experience, despite being a tad overlong. Watching Chuck be disillusioned for so long, almost the point of going crazy was very gut wrenching to watch. I give credit to the writers and Tom Hanks himself for managing to be so sympathetic. This was a daunting role to portray and Hanks was up to the task. He must have been emotionally and physically exhausted after this movie was over. I have to imagine it was a tough movie to film. Helen Hunt is very solid, despite having limited screen time, she does play a pivotal part. The most cringe inducing moment for me is when Hanks is forced to resort to drastic measures, to get rid of an insufferable toothache. Anyone who's ever suffered from an excruciating toothache will probably look away. There a couple of scenes involving waves from the water that were harsh as well. The ending felt real and not contrived. I'm not gonna lie. This is one of those movies where I wanted a happy ending, simply because this movie is emotionally draining. It was a wise decision, but not exactly an ending I hoped for. Final Thoughts: What would you do if you were marooned on an island? would you be able to have the intestinal fortitude to not go crazy? I sure as hell wouldn't. Not only is this a triumph of the human spirit, it's great filmmaking. It shows us the stuff we tend to take for granted, such as water and living. It will make you think heavily9/10",9,2,3,25 February 2014

TONS of gore scenes that are not for the squeamish  the finale is kinda exciting and the characters are likable but as i said it's not the classic people say it is personally i think Halloween is much much better i believe that is John Carpenter best film also this is a bit overlong and some confusing scenes that does not give us enough detail i enjoyed the gore and i loved the performances  and it was quite thrilling in some scenes it has beautiful photography it is quite moody well directed and it has an excellent score but this just did nothing for me a must see rental but not much else at least in my opinion *** Out of 5,Null,1,15,25 June 2004
Armageddon," Big Dumb Fun At It's Finest!, It Starts Off A Little Slowly, But Really Picks Up In The 2nd Half, With Incredible Effects And Lots Of Exciting Action!
","This is big dumb at it's finest!, it starts off a little slowly, but really picks up in the 2nd half, with incredible effects and lots of exciting action!. Most of the characters are awesome, and the story while dumb is very cool and exciting!, plus Bruce Willis is simply amazing in this!. The opening has an hilarious bit with Eddie Griffin and i thought it had some cool emotional moments as well, however if only Ben Affleck wasn't casted!. The finale is excellent and very emotional, and i thought Liv Tyler was great in her role, however she didn't have much chemistry with Affleck. The ending is cool and Steve Buscemi cracked me up throughout the film!, plus i thought Willi's acting was fantastic!. The character development is actually really good, and some of the action scenes blew me away, however i must admit i was bored at the start, but that's OK, because it soon becomes an action packed thrill ride!.It's pretty well written and made and i thought Willis and Affleck had a great emotional moment together as well(even though Affleck over did it badly), plus one of the funniest moments in the film for me is when Willis starts shooting at A.J (Affleck). This is big dumb at it's finest, it starts of a little slowly, but really picks up in the 2nd half, with incredible effects and lots of exciting action, and i say it's a must see!. The Direction is great!. Michael Bay does a great! job here, with wonderful camera work, awesome angles, stunning visuals, adding some cool atmosphere, using great set pieces, great zoom in's and zoom in's and lots of other cool shots as well, plus he kept the film at a very fast pace for the most part. The Acting is excellent for the most part!. Bruce Willis is amazing as always, and is amazing here,he is extremely likable, hilarious a major bad ass, is fantastic in the acting department, played one of his coolest characters, did wonderful in his emotional scenes, was intense, and i don't know how how he put up with Affleck but he did!, he was amazing! (Willis Rules!!!!!!!).Ben Affleck stunk up the screen just like i expected him too, his character is extremely grating and unlikable, he had barely any chemistry with Liv Tyler, his animal cracker demonstration was laughably pathetic, and he almost had me fooled at the end with his scene with Willis at the end i almost felt sorry for him, but he over did it big time with his crying, he was awful!.Liv Tyler is stunningly beautiful, and did excellent in my opinion with what she had to do, i liked her a lot, however her chemistry with Affleck was off. Billy Bob Thornton is very effective in his role as the NASA administrator, and was quite likable. Steve Buscemi is absolutely hilarious, and cracked me up throughout the film, i loved him!. William Fichtner is a very solid actor and here is no different he had a rather unlikable character at 1st but i soon liked him. Will Patton is great here he had a cool character i liked him lots. Owen Wilson is fantastic as always, and is very funny here, i just wished he had more screen time! (Wilson Rules!!). Michael Clarke Duncan is good with what he had to do i liked him. Peter Stormare annoyed me with his accent and his Russian character, i wished he didn't stay alive. Ken Hudson Campbell(Max Lennert ),Jessica Steen(Jennifer Watts, Shuttle Freedom Co-Pilot),Keith David(Lt. General Kimsey), Chris Ellis(Walter Clark),Eddie Griffin,Udo Kier,Lawrence Tierney all do what they have to do very well. Rest of the cast are fine.

Pitch Black," Are You Afraid of the Dark?
","(Credit to IMDb) A commercial transport ship and its crew are marooned on a planet full of bloodthirsty creatures that only come out to feast at night. But then, they learn that a month-long eclipse is about to occur.I wouldn't call this movie great, but it's definitely better than the joyless Chronicles of Riddick. This movie is essentially a movie comprised of better films! Alien comes to mind immediately when you watch this film. It does have a mind of its own, and there are things to enjoy about this movie. The production design is very impressive, as are the special effects. The creatures are unsettling and offer up plenty of suspense. They did what they could with the modest budget, and I thought they did a good job for the most part. The movie is pretty serious, but there a few times where the humor shines. My favorite is when the crew keeps looking for Riddick, but Riddick keeps one-upping them. There is gore, but a lot of it consists of CGI. I prefer the real thing. The acting is very solid. Vin Diesel will never be considered a great actor. That being said, he has the presence. Riddick is the perfect anti-hero, and I enjoyed Vin's show. His body language is perfect. He is the main reason why I enjoyed a lot of this movie. He was a blast to watch. Radha Mitchell does fine as the heroine. She showed off toughness when needed, as well as the right amount of vulnerability. She conveyed all emotions perfectly. Cole Hauser does what he does best, play a jerk. He's good at it! Keith David is very awkward as the religious person. He's annoying, preachy and has an awful accent to boot. I had a decent time with Pitch Black. It's fun in spurts, throwing in plenty of bang for your buck. Those that love the genre will likely find some things to appreciate about it. Not great, but worth a lookFavorite Quote. William J. Johns (Hauser) : Maybe He'll (Riddick) come back and skull F**** you in your sleep!6.3/10",6,0,2,6 January 2015
American Psycho," Great film adaption, that's very entertaining and somewhat disturbing, with a wicked cast, and a knockout performance from Christian Bale!
","This is a great film adaption, that's very entertaining and somewhat disturbing, with a wicked cast, and a knockout performance from Christian Bale!. All the characters are great, and the story is very good as well, plus Christian Bale is simply incredible in this!. It's not overly graphic, but it still has many disturbing scenes, and while I have never read the book, I really enjoyed this movie, plus the ending is especially good, and will really make you think. While the performances were all very good, Bale carries the movie, as he played Patrick Bateman perfectly, and actually managed to give me the creeps, and I thought it was very well made and written as well, plus I also liked how unpredictable it was. The phone call Patrick made to his lawyer, was somewhat funny but also very disturbing at the same time, and I also found his obsession with music to be quite fascinating, plus I loved the dialog as well. All the characters are extremely likable, and Reese Witherspoon is a lot of fun as Patrick's whiny girlfriend Evelyn, plus everyone was perfectly casted. This is a great film adaption, that's very entertaining and somewhat disturbing, with a wicked cast, and a knockout performance from Christian Bale, I highly recommend this one!.The Direction is great!. Mary Harron does a great! job here with very good camera work, solid angles, adding some good atmosphere, and just keeping the film at a very fast pace.There is a little bit of gore, it is disturbing but not overly graphic. We get a person killed with a chainsaw (off screen), bloody bodies,severed head in a freezer, Axe in the face (off screen), gunshot wounds, and a bit of blood.The Acting is outstanding!. Christian Bale is amazing as always and is incredible here, he truly is Patrick Bateman, he is chilling, creepy, likable in a weird sort of way, played insane incredibly well, was extremely intense, was simply fascinating to watch, and could have totally went OTT, but he Didn't,this is truly a dynamic performance! (Bale Rules!!!!!!!). Chloë Sevigny is very beautiful, and gives a charming performance here, she played it very simple and it worked, I really liked her, she is an underrated actress. Reese Witherspoon is amazing as always, and is brilliant in her role as Evelyn, I know her character is supposed to be annoying but I actually found her to be hilarious, especially her crying scene in the restaurant with Bale, sadly she Doesen't get enough screen time. (Reese Rules!!!!!!!!!!). Josh Lucas does what he has to do very well I liked him, he is a great actor. Justin Theroux is OK with what he had to do which was not much. Samantha Mathis is cute, and does fine as Courtney, I liked her. Willem Dafoe is excellent as always, and here is no different he has a small but great role here, and as always had commanding screen presence (Dafoe Rules!!). Jared Leto is good as the pretty boy and was quite convincing. Cara Seymour is fine as the hooker, I felt sorry for her. Rest of the cast do fine.Overall I highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5",8,1,3,25 February 2006
North by Northwest," One of Hitchcock's many masterpieces
","The word masterpiece seems like a broken record when it comes to Hitchcock movies. The man is responsible for so many classic movies. Not only is Hitchcock the master of suspense, but he's also king of adventure. It's a masterfully crafted adventure that never has a boring moment. It's over two hours long, and the time flies by. I give Hitchcock a lot of credit for delivering expert pacing throughout the movie. There are a lot of things I could list that make Hitchcock distinguishable from the rest. It's the incredible shot from a high building, the amazing cinematography, and It's the little things that he does, such as using matches to help the heroine during a key moment of suspense; the way he slowly masters the cropduster scene. Everything is ordinary at first, but the audience can't help but conjecture that something dangerous is about to commence. The plane trying heavily to run down Cary Grant is still one of the most suspenseful scenes in the history of cinema. And, of course. How could I forget the finale at Mount Rushmore. Hitchock had major tabs on his audience. The puppets are the audience, and Hitchock is the puppeteer. Not only does it feature witty dialog throughout, but it has some great humor thrown in at times as well. My favorites are the auction scene with Grant, and when Grant gets arrested for being intoxicated from alcohol at a police station. I won't spoil them, but I never fail to laugh whenever I see those scenes. Cary Grant plays a wonderful everyday man. He is exuberant, charismatic, with charm to spare. He is the perfect hero. Very confident, suave, but not overly cocky, and that makes all the difference. As much as I love James Stewart, I'm glad Hitchcock stuck with Grant. Eva Marie Saint gives a scintillating show. Her character has twists and turns, and for a viewer who hasn't seen this movie a few times like I have will be in for a treat with her performance. Hitchcock was reportedly fixated on Blondes. At least he always picked talented and elegant ones. James Mason makes for a tremendous bad guy. His subtly sinister performance was a lot of fun, but it's Martin Landau's eerie show as Mason's henchman that makes the biggest impression, at least in my opinion. Jessie Royce Landis is hilarious as the selfish mother of Grant's. Final Thoughts: This is a timeless film from a director who can do no wrong. If you're a Hitchock fan, there is simply no excuse for you not to see this. It's an amazing movie, quite possibly one of the greatest films of all time10/10",10,1,3,29 November 2013

All the characters are extremely likable, however what really got on my nerves is that nobody believed Smith that the robots were evil, even when the proof was there, they though it wasn't possible, however that aside, I had a marvelous time with this film, plus the action scenes are fantastic!. Smith and Bridget Moynahan had good chemistry together, and the car chase scenes were pretty good as well, plus Alan Tudyk is wonderful as the voice of Sunny!.

Salt," Entertaining enough spy thriller
","(Plot) A deadly CIA agent is involved in a web of lies, and goes on the run after being accused of falsities. Well. It's nothing outstanding, but it managed to get the job done for me during the 100 minutes or so. Salt has some pretty good suspense and some great action scenes as well. Angelina Jolie has proved she can be a formidable action hero when called upon. She did it in Tomb Raider, Wanted, and now Salt. I do have a qualm. It did start off a tad too slow for my liking, which made me think I was in for a mundane experience. Thankfully, the pace picked up quite a bit, and I was able to enjoy myself. Liev Schreiber is always a good addition to any film he's in, and I enjoyed him here. Salt also has great support with Chiwetel Ejiofor, Daniel Olbrychski, August Diehl, and more. Final Thoughts: Adrenaline junkies like myself will probably find much to enjoy about this one like I did. I'd be down for a follow-up to this one. Recommended!7/10",7,5,7,11 September 2013
We're the Millers," Another raunchy comedy that yields predictable, but fitfully entertaining results
","This was a surprise hit in the summer. I can see why as well. It's got the raunchy humor that families can go and laugh at in the theater, and have a decent time. It's not that simple for me, though. I do enjoy comedies, I'm far from being picky, but this is among the slew of raunchy comedies that flow like wine these days. Is it funny? It does have its moments. It has plenty of penis jokes, along with lots of other crude humor. Some of it's funny, some of it is unfunny. One thing I'll say about We're The Millers, is that despite that I can't recall one time where I really had a huge belly laugh, I did at least smile, or chuckle during some of it. The incest kissing scene involving Kenny is probably the most outlandish and the funniest scene in the movie for me. I know they aren't a real family, but it was still pretty audacious. It's not afraid to push the envelope to try and get some laughs. The cast is clearly having fun. Jason Sudeikis is OK. I don't think he's that funny in my opinion, and I felt he got upstaged by more talented cast members. Jennifer Aniston is charming and fun to watch. It's not much of a stretch for her, but she's sexy and engaging. The scene where she strips to Sweet Emotion will definitely have guys going crazy. (It sure made me go nuts!) Emma Roberts probably has the least to do out of anyone, whilst Will Poulter plays his oblivious part as Kenny very well. Ed Helms is fun as well. There are far too many of these types of comedies coming out these days, and this is another one. It's not a laugh riot by any means, but considering how tired I am of the raunchy style, I actually thought this was better than most. It does have some chuckles at the very least. 6.1/10Note: Be sure to stay for some outtakes at the end credits. The 'Friends theme song' prank is hilarious",6,0,1,12 December 2013
Apocalypse Now," Hands Down The Best War Film Ever Made, And In My Opinion Coppola's Best Work! (This Review Is For The Redux Version, Since I Have Only Seen This Version And Not The Original)
","This is hands down the best War film ever made, and in my opinion Coppola's best work(yes even better then the Godfather). It has 2 of the best performances ever in a movie in my opinion by Martin Sheen and Marlon Brando, plus, it's very engrossing throughout. If your looking for a war movie with lots of war, look elsewhere, however if your looking for a powerful, amazingly acted, and intense war film, look no further. The character development, is absolutely fantastic, and you really start to root and feel for Sheen's character, plus when Marlon Brando finally does show up, it's one of the creepiest things you will ever see.It's a film with a powerful message and if you haven not seen it yet, you must right now, get it now. The Direction is absolutely amazing. Francis Ford Coppola does an amazing job here, with realistic war scenes, creating lots of tension, great use of shadows for Brando, awesome zoom in's, and some amazing camera work,it's one of the best directing jobs i have ever seen, i won't spoil the rest for you. there is lots of harsh violence. We get a hand cut graphically on glass,lots of bloody corpses,guy holding his guts in,lots of bloody gunshot wounds,gory impaling with an arrow,gory surgery on a guy with no leg,severed heads,slicing and dicing,and a live cow is chopped to pieces. The Acting is absolutely incredible and no doubt Oscar worthy. Martin Sheen is incredibly amazing here, and gives one of the best performances i have ever seen, he is extremely likable, vulnerable, was intense and it really looked like that some of his emotion was on screen , he was really into his role, (Martin Rules!). Marlon Brando is amazing, here, he didn't have much screen time but he was on you knew it, he gives one of the creepiest performances i have ever seen, always lurking in the shadows, his creepy voice just a wonderful, wonderful performance. Frederic Forrest is very good with what he has to do here, and was likable. Sam Bottoms is okay here and nothing more. Albert Hall is good but wish he didn't go so soon. Robert Duvall is excellent in his scenes, and seemed to be having a blast. Laurence Fishburne is excellent as usual , but looked very very young. Dennis Hopper is an awesome actor but annoyed the crap out of me here.Harrison Ford shines in his scene, wish he had a lot more screen time though. Overall this is hands down the best war film ever made and if you have not seen it yet, see it right this instant it's one of the greatest films ever made, and it's Coppola's best work! ***** out of 5",10,1,4,4 May 2005
Edward Scissorhands," Still stands up wonderfully today, as a magical tale.
","Edward Scissorhands is a movie they just don't make anymore. Frankly I find Tim Burton's movies to be often too dark and plodding, but this isn't one of them. The romance between Depp and Winnona Ryder is one of the most enchanting and beautiful love stories I've ever seen, while some of the cinematography was tremendous. I really like how they try to make Edward a part of society at 1st, and try to make him feel like a human being, it was really heart-warming and fun to watch. After all these years, this remains one of Johnny Depp's best performances, and most certainly one of his mot definitive roles. Tim Burton's directing style suits him perfectly here. It's effectively dark and brooding, while having the neighborhood in the day-time smartly looking peaceful and classy. The characters are well-developed for the most part, but the main reasons this work so well is Johnny Depp and the unique romance surrounding it, I especially loved the old mansion Edward stayed at.Performances. Johnny Depp isn't even at his peak here talent wise, and he still musters up an incredible performance. He looks unique, acts unique and his character was unique. It was a tough role to play off, but Depp did it wonderfully and made Edward very sympathetic. Winona Ryder is pretty good for the most part. She's hypnotizing on the eyes, and her chemistry with Depp was excellent. Dianne Wiest is great in her role, as the caring yet ninny-nanny person. Anthony Michael Hall served his purpose well, and played a perfectly unsympathetic prick. Kathy Baker did great in her role, she stole quite a few scenes. Alan Arkin is a riot as the dry, yet hilarious Father. Vincent Price looks old and ill, but was pure class when on-screen.Bottom line. Edward Scissorhands is a beautiful work of art, that still holds up great today. There aren't many like this movie, and I'm glad about that. A must see.9/10",9,0,2,1 August 2010
Ender's Game," Highly Entertaining and Intense
","I had very low expectations going into this movie. The storyline didn't interest me that much, and I'm not that interested in these types of movies. Much to my surprise, this movie not only exceeded my expectations, but I genuinely had a blast. It's one of those movies that sneak up on you. It's loaded with great special effects, visuals, and spectacles galore. Not only that, but it has a good storyline as well. It's pretty easy to see that Director, Gavin Hood was heavily influenced by Top Gun. It borrows a lot from that formula, and does it very well. Gavin Hood manages to use his own style very effectively to make a really good movie. For a movie that is aimed at families, it's pretty intense. This movie has something for everyone. If you want intense drama, you'll get it. If you want plenty of action, you'll get that. It's a movie that all ages can enjoy. The acting is excellent. Asa Buttefield is absolutely wonderful as Ender. His character goes through your usual adversity, but I loved watching him evolve. It was great to see his character evolve throughout the movie, especially when darkness starts to creep in. This kid is going places. Harrison Ford is dependable as always. His intensity is always a pleasure to watch, and his scenes with Butterfield are special. Abigail Breslin is solid in her role. She doesn't have a lot to do, but she shined when she was on screen. Ben Kingsley's part is limited until the end, but he was great. Viola Davis does fine in her role. I loved this movie. I didn't expect much at all, but I got way more than I bargained for. If you've put it off like I have, don't. It's a really entertaining movie that anyone can enjoy.8.3/10",8,0,2,16 April 2015
Monsters vs. Aliens," Cute and fluffy, but nothing anything noteworthy.
","Monsters Vs Aliens is a cute little family movie that's energetic and fun to watch, but I wouldn't say it's anything I go i'll out of my way to see again. Reese Witherspoon provides a great personality for Susan and gives us a very likable and energetic heroine, and I liked the supporting characters as well, it's just it didn't seem like anything all that special to me. It started off tremendously at the beginning with a very thrilling capture of Susan and how she turned into an enormous human being, but after that things just seemed to really die down in my opinion. The all star cast for the voices for the characters is quite an impressive feat when you look at it, and all did wonderful jobs, and while I enjoyed myself in the end, it could have been better as well.Bottom line. It's a cute time waster, kids will lap it up and adults will find some enjoyment out of it. It's nothing anything of note, but it's worth a rental.6/10",6,0,1,13 June 2010
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Unimaginative, CGI filled nonsense that somehow made a fair amount at the box office!
","As soon as I saw the trailer that aired for this one, I knew what I was getting into when I was going to see it. I avoided it in theaters; it turns out it was exactly what I feared; a passive, money gobbling film that has copious amounts of CGI, which is something teenagers will probably go for. The scary thing is the able cast it has. I'm not saying this is one of the worst movies of all time, but it's mediocre beyond belief, and certainly not as good as the cast may make you to believe. Believe it or not, I kinda dug the premise. The opening was very cool, and I thought I might be in for a pleasantly entertaining film; wrong! It does have a couple of decent action scenes, but with all the lame CGI, and the wire work, it ruined it for me. Jeremy Renner is solid as a rock; it's not his fault he has to work with nothing. His chemistry was decent with Gemma Arterton. Renner is already a big star in Hollywood. He has taken over the Bourne franchise, potentially soon The Mission Impossible franchise; he's been in The Avengers. The Oscar winning Hurt Locker; he's accomplished a lot. But this is one of those films actors end up regretting. Gemma Arterton is a solid newcomer. She's got a bright future ahead of her. She looked great and did what she had to do well. Famke Janssen is a favorite of mine, and not many can play a female villain with intensity like her. She manages to overcome a poorly written villain character that lacks depth with a solid show. The others do fine as well. The acting is not an issue here. Final Thoughts: In today's era; this is something teenagers will go for. This wasn't for me. I thought it was a half-assed attempt personally with little creativity and some mediocre action scenes to pad it all. Not really recommended 4/10",4,1,5,22 August 2013
Step Up 2: The Streets," Very formulaic, but I still found a decent amount of entertainment value in it.
","After Channing Tatum broke out, they decided to make this into a franchise. The sequels would grow increasingly tiresome, I just felt with every sequel they would rehash the storyline from the original, but in different ways, but this one is actually decent for what it is. The gorgeous Brianna Evigan takes over the lead in this one, and does a solid job. Her bubbly, yet defiant personality was a treat to watch. I'm surprised her career hasn't taken off like I expected. Robert Hoffman lacks Channing Tatum's charisma, but he made for an OK, if underwhelming lead. He & Brianna lack the spark that Channing & Jenna Dewan have. The dance scenes are fairly good. Around the beginning of the film, Channing Tatum has a quick cameo at a dance club of sorts, and to be honest the movie could have used him fully. Overall though, I had an OK time with this movieFinal Thoughts: It won't turn your world upside down, but if you enjoyed the original like I did, I'm sure you'll find things to like about this one.

Jarhead," I wasn't that enthralled with it to be honest...
","Jarhead was a movie I was actually excited to see, due to the subject nature and the real life story behind it. While it wasn't downright boring, I found myself having problems keeping myself interested in it. The performances aren't a problem, but the characters are in my opinion. Not many of them are very easy to relate too. Jake Gyllenhall's portrayal of Anthony Swofford is tremendously acted, but his character is somewhat cold and distant|which i Know how Swofford was in real life, and that was the point, but still| and none of the secondary characters were that likable either, in all honesty it was rather depressing. Maybe i'm picky, but I don't like movies that start depressing, and then have a depressing payoff. It drains me completely and just ruins my mood, I was kind of angry to be honest. I don't know much about Swofford's experiences, nor do I care too to be honest, I'd prefer to read something much more lively and happy.Performances. Jake Gyllenhaal is often excellent, and did a wonderful portrayal. However his character is much too cold and distant for my liking, taking away his likability for me. Peter Sarsgaard is very good as Troy. His mysterious past and the hidden pain he has was very interesting to watch, even if it was hard to sympathize with. Jamie Foxx is really good in his role, even if it's a bit more limited than I would have liked. Lucas Black is good in his hot-headed, yet likable role.Bottom line. It wasn't terrible, in fact its the farthest thing from it. It's just too depressing, and was very hard for me to relate too. Worth a viewing of course, it just wasn't my cup of tea.6/10",6,1,1,18 July 2010
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Azkaban is an enthralling, often spellbinding adventure. Worth revisiting, again and again.
","(Credit IMDb) Harry Potter is having a tough time with his relatives (yet again). He runs away after using magic to inflate Uncle Vernon's sister Marge who was being offensive towards Harry's parents. Initially scared for using magic outside the school, he is pleasantly surprised that he won't be penalized after all. However, he soon learns that a dangerous criminal and Voldemort's trusted aide Sirius Black has escaped from the Azkaban prison and wants to kill Harry to avenge the Dark Lord. To worsen the conditions for Harry, vile shape-shifters called Dementors are appointed to guard the school gates and inexplicably happen to have the most horrible effect on him. Little does Harry know that by the end of this year, many holes in his past (whatever he knows of it) will be filled up and he will have a clearer vision of what the future has in store?Azkaban is quite possibly the best Potter entry I've seen so far. As an avid fan of the films, but not a follower of the books (Yet, anyway) It's in serious consideration to the best as far as I'm concerned. Usually with films that are 140 minutes long, I start to get Ancy in my seat due to my ADHD condition. I actually yearned for more after it was over, as the excitement was top-notch. The finale is without a doubt one of the most breathtaking one's I've seen in my entire lifetime. It was just beautifully told, and wonderfully set-up. Azkaban also provides us with three wonderful leads once again, in Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson. Azkaban is quite the ride, and may just be my favorite so far. Performances. Daniel Radcliffe continues to mature as Potter, and gives a wonderful show here. He balances anger, confusion, and vulnerability perfectly, and I was on his side the whole way. Rupert Grint is as funny and charming as ever as Ron. I found myself cracking up half the time he was on screen. Emma Watson is bubbly and easy on the eyes, but credible once again as well. She is also maturing, and Hermione is quickly becoming one of my favorite Potter characters. Gary Oldman is surprisingly effective as Sirius, considering he only did it for the Money. David Thewlis is interesting in his role, and wise, if nothing else. Michael Gambon is classy as ever as Dumbledore. Alan Rickman is sinister once more as Snape, while Maggie Smith is great once again in her role. Robbie Coltrane is pretty good as Hagrid. Tom Felton continues to emerge as a great threat to Potter's fortune, while Emma Thompson is fittingly kooky. Bottom line. This is top-notch excitement at its finest. It's definitely one of the best, if not THE best Potter film in the series. Potter fanatics should be thrilled with the fine quality of this movie. A must see!9 ½ /10",9,29,33,17 December 2010
Dallas Buyers Club," Phenomenal!
","In 1985, Dallas Electrician is diagnosed with HIV+. He is told he has 30 days to live. He doesn't believe them and continues his partying lifestyle (Heavy smoking, heavy drinking and drug use) . He insists that is a disease that only gay people would get. Ron Woodroof tirelessly researches to prolong his life. Thanks to a Doctor in Mexico, Ron may have found a temporary cure for it. Ron tries to beat the system to help other people with AIDS. A lot of the time, films with Oscar buzz tend to be highly overrated. I end up being disappointed more often than not. I was honestly expecting more of the same with Dallas Buyers Club. I couldn't have been more wrong if I tried. Not only does it live up to the hype, but it surpasses it. This is filmmaking at its finest. It had been a while where I felt so much emotion from a movie. Ron Woodroof won't be for everybody. He is abrasive and doesn't change who he is for anyone. He will test your patience and many people will be mixed on him. As much as I didn't like him at times, I couldn't help but respect his fighting spirit and his perseverance. His will to live was inspiring. He did a lot of bad things, but he also did a lot of good things as well. He even managed to evoke sympathy from me at times. He was polarizing and a fascinating character. Matthew McConaughey is truly impressive as Ron. He deserved his Oscar. I'm not all that familiar with Ron, but Matthew was phenomenal in the role. He hit all the right notes. Jennifer Garner is solid in her role. She's really improved over the years. Jared Leto steals the show at times. His incredible performance is right up there with McConaughey's. This movie was extremely inspiring, moving, frustrating, heartfelt, among other things. It packs a wallop. For once, I agree with all the praise. This movie stuck with me after it was over. If you put it off like I did, don't. It really is an outstanding film. 9.5/10",9,1,1,18 June 2015
The Fast and the Furious," Deep it isn't, but if you don't think about it you'll be entertained
","Brian O'Connor goes undercover as Brian Spillman to try and infiltrate an underworld of street racers lead by Dominic Toretto. He earns the trust of Dominic, falls in love with Dominic's sister Mia, but Brian might have to put all that aside to do the job he was hired to do. OK. I'll fully admit this isn't anything thought provoking. But it isn't trying to be! Does it lack substance? Of course it does, Sherlock! What do people honestly expect when it comes to these movies, Schindler's List? i think you may need to straighten out your priorities. This doesn't try to be anything more than a enjoyably big budgeted B movie, and that's exactly what it is. It is filled with hot chicks, fast cars, heavy metal & rap songs, and impressive stunts. The most entertaining thing, aside from the action scenes is the chemistry between Paul Walker & Vin Diesel. It is the main cog that keeps this movie going. The acting won't win any academy awards, but they are enjoyable. Paul Walker had really become a solid actor over the years. He was amazing in Running Scared. I genuinely like Walker. Honestly, he isn't at his best here. For half of the film, he is far too mechanical with his surroundings. I know that was part of his character, but he doesn't really show off the talent he has until the finale when things get hectic. He is very good in the final 20 minutes, but his performance is very forgettable as a whole. I know Vin Diesel gets a lot of flack, but I dug him. His macho routine was very enjoyable. He'll never be considered a great actor, but he has charisma in spades. He has one great scene where he realizes Brian is an undercover cop. Jordanna Brewster is rather bland as Walker's love interest. She has moments of great work, but not enough of them. Michelle Rodriguez does her bitchy routine again, and glares a lot. She was alright. Matt Schuzle annoyed the crap out of me as Vince. He acted like a petulant 5 year old. The Finale is great stuff, loaded with emotional scenes, and heart pounding action. The showdown between Walker & Diesel is memorable. *SPOILERS* I have mixed feelings on the ending. I like that Brian had so much respect for Dominic that he let him go, but it felt a little contrived as well. It made sense, considering the friendship they built up, but it also felt like an excuse to continue the franchise, even if Vin didn't return fully until part 4. Final Thoughts: I enjoy it, sue me. It isn't art or anything like that, but I can't deny how entertaining it is. I say give it a break, and check it out. Kick your brain to the curb, and enjoy! 7/10",7,1,3,13 January 2014

Now You See Me," I found it to be pretty uninspiring. It's glossy, Hollywood nonsense in my opinion.
","How did this movie become such a big hit at the box office? It's far from horrible, but it definitely doesn't warrant the success that it got. There are magic tricks here, but I didn't feel any of it. Magic should not have such a dull aura surrounding it. Heck. Even the Incredible Burt Wonderstone was more entertaining than this movie. This movie is propelled by such an amazing cast, that one might be willing to overlook the lack of substance. I'm not one of those people. We don't know all that much about The Four Horsemen. We don't know what makes them tick, or what flaws they have. I'm more than capable of ignoring stuff like this, but it was really needed in this movie. It can throw all the flash it wants at me and it tries to do just that, but I didn't buy into it. I get the feeling they went out of there way to show the impossible instead of focusing on engaging their audience like they should have. It's just way too cute for its own good. You can only throw so many fancy escapes at me before I get bored. Am I being too harsh with it? Maybe, but with this amount of talent it should be much better than it is, and there is no excuse for it. My biggest gripe in this movie is the huge twist ending. It angered me in a big way. I actually yelled 'OH, COME ON!' out loud as soon as they revealed it. Not only does it lack logic, but it didn't make much sense. I do like twist endings. They often knock me on my ass, but this one was just needless. Other people may feel differently, but I was already unimpressed with this film. The twist ending made it worse. Jesse Eisenberg is simply OK. He's proved to be very talented in the past, but he came across as arrogant with no depth here. It's not a great performance. Mark Ruffalo delivers a very good performance. His frustration is deeply felt, and he probably gave the best performance in this movie in my opinion. Woody Harrelson is always solid no matter what he's in, but he's also a victim of circumstance. He lacks depth like the others do. Isla Fisher is sassy and great to look at, but that's about it. Dave Franco is the younger brother of James Franco, and shows plenty of potential. MÃ©lanie Laurent has her moments, and had decent chemistry with Ruffalo as his partner. Morgan Freeman & Michael Caine add class to the proceedings, but I just wish they were in a better movie. Freeman's part is a big bigger, whilst Caine's is rather inconsequential for the most part. Final Thoughts: I didn't hate this movie, but I was so disappointed with it. It's typical Hollywood. After I heard what a hit it was with audiences, I was actually excited to watch it. The lack of substance is too much to ignore. A sequel has been green-lit. I just hope they put a little more effort into the sequel than they did with this one. 5.2/10",5,2,4,18 September 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," That's more like it!
","After being somewhat disappointed with X-Men: First Class, my expectations for this movie were normal. I expected an entertaining movie, but nothing more. I didn't expect such an ambitious and emotional installment. Right from the outset, I knew I was in for a wild ride, I just had that feeling. My gut instinct doesn't usually lie and it didn't this time around. Before I praise this movie thoroughly, I'll get one flaw out-of-the-way. If you're a huge X-Men fan, I don't recommend that you watch all the movies before this one. The continuity errors will drive you crazy. If you manage to brush that aside and block it out, more than likely you'll have a blast with this movie. With this sequel, everybody has so much more to lose. The stakes definitely feel way higher than before and I felt it emotionally. The post-apocalyptic atmosphere in the future is appropriately grim and extremely well done. I was also impressed with how they made 1973 look. I felt it mirrored the time period precisely. If you're craving action, this movie won't disappoint you. It's filled with tons of action for all the adrenaline junkies out there. Another thing I really liked was the presence of mutant killing machines. It made the odds seem insurmountable for the gang. The performances are excellent. Hugh Jackman is awesome as always. It was great to see Patrick Stewart in the franchise again. McAvoy & Fassbender are even more comfortable in their roles this time around. They were great as young Charles & Erik respectively. I felt they played off one another perfectly. Jennifer Lawrence is terrific as Mystique. Ian McKellen doesn't have as much to do, but it was nice to see him play a good guy. Halle Berry is completely wasted as Storm. She barely has any dialog and her screen time isn't that great either. Peter Dinklage added an interesting element to his part. Anna Paquin has a brief scene near the end. Page, Hoult, and Ashmore do what they have to do well. I won't spoil it, but there is a couple of cameo's at the end of the movie that made me grin. X-Men fans will definitely be pleased with the cameos. I liked the way they ended the movie. They tacked on a happy ending, but made sure it wasn't too contrived. X-Men: Apocalypse is due next for this franchise. It will be interesting to see what direction they take. I was floored by this movie and I didn't expect to be. Not only is it filled with breathtaking action, it manages to be successfully ambitious at the same time. I really don't see how you can dislike this movie. It has a bit of everything and it's a must see! I'm glad I saw this in the theater9.3/10",9,1,5,8 June 2014

Saw III," In my opinion? the best sequel in the series by far.
","Saw III has surprises and twists galore, but the best thing about it is, they all have a point and a reason. You have to pay strict attention throughout the movie, because every detail counts, every scene is precious because the twist at the end will knock you straight out of your seat, at least it did with me. Saw II for my tastes was too slick for its own good, too glossy and Saw III brought back all the elements that I loved in the 1st one. It really messes with your mind, and digs deep into your emotions by giving you characters you can identify with. The best had to be Jeff by far. I felt so bad for him, I could feel the pain he was going through, and despite his selfish motives, you just wanna reach out and help him. If you have a weak stomach you're best to avoid Saw III at all costs, because this is one of the grisliest movies I've ever seen in my life. Saw III has scares, gore, good storyline and great psychology, it's without a doubt the best sequel in the series.Performances. Tobin Bell is a frightening presence, not because of his physical appearance, but because of the games he plays. He's at his best here and I was frightened by him on plenty of occasions. Shawnee Smith goes all out here, and gives an absolutely spell binding performance. Her vulnerability, yet the psychotic side she displayed at the same time kept me on edge the whole way, she's one of the many reasons this movie works so well, she's great to look at too. Angus Macfadyen is one tortured individual, and for good reason. His heart is broken after the loss of his son, and him bordering on the brink of obsession was just heartbreaking to watch. Bahar Soomekh's cold portrayal of Lynn worked and also worked against her. Her character is shady and selfish, but it worked for the part, though I can't say I felt much sympathy for her. Donnie Wahlberg doesn't have much to do this time around. Dina Meyer is OK in her screen time.Bottom line. This is what most sequels aspire to be. It holds up against the original really well, and in my opinion is the real sequel to Saw. They should have stopped here, because this is as good as it gets.9/10",9,1,4,24 May 2010
Pearl Harbor," Too long, too boring and much too over produced.
","Pearl Harbor is yet another example of why I get so frustrated with Michael Bay. Aside from a few good projects like The Island, Transformers and a couple of others, he's generally trash. There is no heart to this film, and it doesn't know whether it wants to be serious or jokey in tone half the time, which ended up grating me to no end. Ben Affleck has proved to improve his abilities since than, but at around this time he couldn't act worth a lick!. His obvious wooden performance is quite the turn off, while Josh Hartnett who I actually like a lot of the time isn't much better. The love storyline plods ever so terribly and I didn't give a damn what was going on, while Michael Bay makes the action scenes much too overblown once again.Bottom line. Pearl Harbor is not worth the long running time it has. Save yourself the torture, and if you must, rent some of his better work.3/10",3,1,5,25 May 2010
Hardball," Great fun for the whole family that may be Baseball's version of the Mighty Ducks, with a really good story and excellent performances! *Spoilers*
","This is great fun for the whole family that may be Baseball's version of the Might Ducks, with a really good story and excellent performances!. All the characters are cool, and extremely likable, and I thought all the kids on the team were quite likable, plus Keanu Reeves and Diane Lane are simply amazing in this!. It's very well made and written and it has a very emotional scene near the end involving the character G-Baby, plus The baseball action is actually not too bad. Diane Lane was really good as usual, but I wish they gave her more screen time and more to do, and I liked the ending, plus Keanu and Lane had pretty good chemistry together. Keanu had a pretty cool emotional speech, and I feel this film is underrated, plus it took me a while to warm up to Reeve's character at 1st because he was rather unlikable at the start, and an obsessive gambler. Keanu had a great relationship with the kids, and while I wish they would have shown us the final game, The ending they chose fit the film well, plus there were some pretty nifty defensive plays as well. This is great fun for the whole family, that may be Baseball's version of the Mighty Ducks, with a really good story and excellent performances, I highly recommend this one!. The Direction is great!. Brian Robbins does a great! job here with very good camera work and keeping the film at a fast pace. The Acting is excellent. Keanu Reeves is amazing as always and is amazing here, he is rather unlikable at 1st, but then grows on you, he also had pretty good chemistry with Lane, gives one of his best performances, as always had charisma, and you will begin to feel sorry for his gambling addiction after a while. (Reeves Rules!!!!!!!). Diane Lane is incredibly gorgeous, and is amazing with what she had to do, just her screen presence and beauty is enough alone for me, she had pretty good chemistry with Reeves, I just wish they gave her a bigger part and more to do (Lane Rules!!!!!!!). John Hawkes is amusing as the weasel I dug him. All the kids do surprisingly well and were very likable. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall I highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5",8,2,3,2 February 2006
Die Hard 2," Overblown, but fairly fun nonetheless
","John McClaine is forced to be the hero again when Col. Stuart (Sadler) devises a plan to hold the entire airport hostage. Stuart has taken over control of all the electrical equipment affecting all the planes that are landing on the runaway. With no lights on the runaway, all planes are in trouble. If that isn't enough, McClaine's wife Holly is on one of the planes. McClaine must rediscover his nose for trouble and the heroics from the Nakatomi situation to save his wife and everybody else. No matter how hard Reny Harlin tries, this is nowhere near as good as the first movie. The first movie is a groundbreaking action movie that inspired many clones over the years. This movie is inferior like most sequels. Despite the effort, I didn't sense anything else but wanting to make money from everyone involved. It feels disingenuous and I never really bought into it. The storytelling pales in comparison and it just feels there. Sequels are very tricky because you have to make sure that it feels legitimate and not just a money-maker. This is one of those movies. All that aside, I actually do enjoy this movie a fair amount. It's action packed and Renny makes sure there is never a dull moment. The action is really brainless that feature some ridiculous OTT stunts that aren't believable for a second! McClaine escapes situations that make him look like Superman in certain scenes. Luckily, McClaine's character manages to make you feel like it was smarts and dumb luck. Despite my criticisms, it's entertaining all the same. I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy the action. Memorable moments include some good scraps on the wing of a plane near the end. It does begin to drag after a while, but I did enjoy them for the most part. The performances are pretty good. Bruce Willis is great as McClaine. When he wants to be, Bruce is a fun actor that can easily carry a movie. He carries this sequel for sure. He has some awesome one- liners that he ad-libbed himself. His boorish wise cracking persona is a treat to watch and he's perfectly adept in the action scenes. He doesn't have as much to work with here, but he makes the most of it. He's a perfect everyman that anyone can relate too. Bonnie Bedelia is wasted here. Her screen time is much shorter than she had in the first. She has a couple of memorable scenes, but she's nowhere near as prominent. William Sandler is technically solid as the villain. His performance is kind of dull, though. He lacks spark and the charisma that Alan Rickman had. His intensity makes up for that somewhat. William Atherton's role is shorter as well, but he does what he does best! Play an A*hole. Dennis Franz can do this type of thing in his sleep, but he's so fun to watch with it! He's so good at what he does, it's impossible to fully dislike him. His interactions with Willis were a blast. John Amos is fun in his role. Reginald VelJohnson is limited to a cameo in this movie, which is a shame. His dynamic with Bruce in the first movie is sorely missed here. Franco Nero makes a dull bad guy. Robert Patrick and John Leguizamo show up as well. The violence is typically strong for a Harlin movie. An ice pick in the eye was the highlight, in my opinion. Even though it's my least favorite of the original trilogy, I still watch this once a year. This movie is fun! Just make sure you suspend disbelief and temper your expectations if you haven't seen it. That's about the best advice I can give you. Favorite quotesMcClaine: Hey Carmine, let me ask you something: What sets off the metal detector first? The led in your ass or the s**** in your brains?Sgt.

Flashdance," Watchable, but that's about it. It feels like a feature length rock video, more than anything else
","I really can't fathom as to why this was such a box office smash. Yes. It has an amazing soundtrack, it's flashy, glossy, glitzy, and hip, but there isn't much story to speak of. It feels like a feature length MTV film, with all of the arresting images, but I wasn't sucked in from the story. Alex's character (Jennifer Beals) isn't given nearly enough detail as to why we should root for her. All we really know is that she lives in a small town, and works for her money, and she wants to be a dancer. I didn't buy her as a welder, either. I would have liked to see more of her downfalls. Jennifer Beals is the heart & soul of this movie, yet it focuses much more on glitzy images, more than a coherent story. The love story between Beals & Nouri is extremely clumsy and laughable at times. Michael Nouri can't act worth a lick, and neither can Beals, but at least she looked fantastic. Whether she had a double or not, watching Beals practice a dance routine to one of the best songs ever, Maniac is extremely sexy, and it was probably my highlight of the film. With all the sweat flying, peaks at her gorgeous flesh, and her amazing body, it's hard not to notice. Jennifer Beals swears a lot in this movie, and throws a rock through Nouri's house window at one point (!) It's the 80's, so this style of movie is to be expected. I loved the 80's, but I cannot figure out why people flocked to see this movie. There is nothing special about it what so ever. I realize it's about living the dream, but it's all so routine and shallow. It's worth watching for the sake of the gorgeous Jennifer Beals, but it's pretty average stuff. 5/10",5,2,4,30 October 2013
Quantum of Solace," One of the most disappointing follow-up's I've ever seen, considering how phenomenally good Casino Royale was
","*Minor Spoiler*Quantum of Solace is actually an above average Bond film. It's certainly slick and fairly entertaining, but after how blown away I was by Casino Royale? It's also heavily disappointing. There is no awe or wonder like Casino Royale had. It's nowhere near as daring or emotional. I usually have difficulties with movies that are two hours or longer, but this movie was way too short. I could have easily handled another half hour or so, it definitely needed it. It just felt rushed and passive at times. There is plenty of action to make this a breezy time, I'll say that. I also liked how cold blooded Daniel Craig's portrayal of Bond was. He is still heartbroken from the loss of Eva Green in Casino Royale. He was the main reason I was invested in this movie. Olga Kurylenko is rather bland for a Bond girl. She's rather average looking, and she didn't do much for me to be honest with you. Mathieu Amalric is also bland as the villain. I got nothing much from him at all, either, nor was he that menacing. Judi Dench plays off Craig extremely well, and I adored the gal. Final Thoughts: I would not make the same mistake I did by watching this a day after you've seen Casino Royale. As a standalone action film, it's not bad and fairly entertaining. But it's not the follow-up Casino Royale deserved. Skyfall would amend this situation 6.2/10",6,0,4,18 September 2013
Independence Day," Good Dumb Fun However I Was Quite Disappointed, As It's Way Too Long For It's Own Good,But The Performances And Special Effects Were Awesome!
","This is good dumb fun, however i was quite disappointed, as it's way too long for it's own good, but the performances and special effects were awesome!. All the characters are great, and the story while dumb is not too shabby, plus Will Smith is simply amazing in this!. All the characters were very likable, and there are some very exciting scenes, however it did have a few dull spots, and it just went way too long for it's own good, plus it gets a bit tiring after a while. There are tons of explosions and cool looking Aliens to enjoy, and i thought the ending was pretty cool as well, plus Bill Pullman was just fantastic as the president!. Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum had very good chemistry together, and it has a couple of cool emotional moments as well!, plus the finale while exciting is also a bit too long for it's own good. This is a film made to please the audiences, not to really be praised by critics or to win Oscars, and i found the opening to be just great, plus there are plenty of laughs to be had as well. This is good dumb fun, however i was quite disappointed, as it's way too long for it's own good, but the special effects and performances are awesome!, and i say it's well worth the watch!. The Direction is good for the most part. Roland Emmerich does a good job here for the most part here, with fantastic camera work, awesome angles, and lots of other awesome shots as well, however the pace is terribly inconsistent. The Acting is awesome!. Will Smith is amazing as always, and is amazing here, he is extremely likable, hilarious, had very good chemistry with Jeff Goldblum, is very charismatic, had some very cool lines, and he is just so good at this role, this is the role that really got him noticed! (Smith Rules!!!). Bill Pullman is fantastic as the president, he is very funny did not take himself seriously, and as a result was a lot of fun to watch!, i loved him. Jeff Goldblum is great in his role, he had a cool delivery and was just utterly fascinating to watch!. Judd Hirsch is quite funny as i rather liked him. Robert Loggia is wonderful as always,and did a wonderful job as the General i just wished he had more to do. Margaret Colin is beautiful and does fine with what she had to do, she did a good job. Vivica A. Fox is hot and did great as Smith's girlfriend and also had good chemistry with him i liked her a lot. Randy Quaid plays another one of his great kooky roles and he excelled perfectly once again he was great!. James Rebhorn is great as the sleaze ball i hated him and cheered out loud when Pullman fired his ass!. Adam Baldwin is just there he does OK, did not really have much of a part. Giuseppe Andrews(Troy Casse),Lisa Jakub(Alicia Casse),James Duval(Miguel Casse),Ross Bagley(Dylan Dubrow),Mae Whitman(Patricia Whitmore),Mary McDonnell(First Lady Marilyn Whitmore),Harry Connick Jr.(Captain Jimmy Wilder),all do what they have to do well.

The Butterfly Effect," In my humble opinion? An absolute masterpiece.
","The Butterfly Effect is one of the most innovative, the most shocking, and one of the very few movies that I've had to watch twice to make sure I understood what I jut watched. It's a love story, a personal drama, and a thriller all in one. The main story in my opinion, and the most effective one had to be the love story. Evan's childhood at the start of the movie had to be some of the most disturbing stuff I have ever seen, I mean they really pushed it. It's been a long time coming, since I felt that squirmy in my seat, not only that the kid actors completely blew me away. What amazed me most about the movie, and there was a lot of amazing stuff, but I would have to say Ashton Kutcher's performance was the most remarkable, considering he didn't really have any prior serious acting experience. The point I think about Butterfly Effect is this. Leave your life the way it is, accept what has happened in your life, because if you try to change past occurrences in your life, you'll just be more of a mess, so you should try to move on with your own.SPOILERS!. If you don't wanna be spoiled, don't read any further.The Director's Cut Vs The Theatrical Version.The Theatrical Cut. This is probably my favorite version. I liked The Director's Cut version, but this ending seemed more fitting. When Evan sees Kayleigh in the end, you sense hope, you get happiness wondering if things will work out in the end, after all it gave us a nice sense of hope. I also thought it flowed a little better.The Director's Cut. Very good, but a little bit too dark at times, and a tad overlong. I thought the ending was excellent, but I'm a sucker for happy endings, therefore I'm partial to the Theatrical Cut, I didn't like the thought of Evan not existing, though even though he's not meant to be.Performances. Ashton Kutcher has grown up here, it's evident. His performance blew me away, and the fact that he had no serious acting experience prior to this, makes it even more remarkable. He is the heart of the film, and he did a wonderful job. Amy Smart is absolutely gorgeous, and does excellent as Kayleigh. Her multi layered performances are extraordinary. From the country club girl, to the drugged up prostitute, to the haunted girl working in a basically abandon cafÃ©, she was terrific. Elden Henson best known as Fulton from The Mighty Ducks, gives great performance as Lenny, I liked his soft side the most, though he did great as a loony too. John Patrick Amedori did excellent as the 13 Yr old Evan. His range or his age was phenomenal, I loved his performance. Kevin G. Schmidt|13 yr old Lenny| and Jesse James|13 yr old Tommy| were both phenomenal and intense. Eric Stoltz is great as the pedophile father, then again he excels at these roles. Melora Walters is good as Evan's mom, though she had her off moments.Bottom line. Butterfly Effect is officially one of my favorite movies. Butterfly Effect shows the viewer that going back in time, isn't all fun and games, and shows the bad side of it all as well. It really is a brilliant film, and dare I say a masterpiece?. Go see it, I would put it on your films to see soon list, immediately!.10/10",10,3,5,21 March 2010
District 9," Mixed feelings on this overrated, yet undeniably thought provoking sci-fi satire.
","District 9 was a movie that I might have had too much expectations for. It's certainly interesting, and the final 20 minutes really do deliver, but I had plenty a problems with it. It tries so hard to look intelligent, and be intelligent, and while it is to a certain extent, it's not as smart as it likes to think it is. I disliked the cruelty in it. They were offing a lot of the prawns for no apparent reason, only showing us what the documentary style did at the start, which was kinda weird itself. Sharlto Copley comes off as a low rent Dainel Craig sorta, only he's German, and his character is awfully hard to feel sympathy for a lot of times, because he himself, ordered the prawns around, and acted like a coward on many occasions. The relationship between The main alien and his son, with Wikus is actually the best thing about this movie. His compassion for them was quite cute. The special effects for the modest budget it had, were quite impressive too. District 9 definitely made me think, and had it's fair share of good moments, but it's not the masterpiece everyone says it is.Bottom line. District 9 is a good movie, very thought provoking, and unique, but as I said it's cruelty started to get on my nerves, and it's hard to relate to many of the people. Well worth a look for it's originality, but don't get yourself all worked up in the hype of it all.7/10",7,0,4,21 February 2010
Mamma Mia!," Recommend for die hard Abba fans, who will lap up a full movie's worth of Abba.
","Mamma Mia is a movie I really didn't care for, and I actually like Abba. It's pleasant, and Meryl Streep is completely game, but after an hour of this stuff or so, the entertainment value, really started to wain. Some will find the whole plot of Amanda Seyfried trying to figure out who her father is amusing, but I soon grew tiresome of it. Seeing Meryl and Peirce Brosnan belt out Abba songs I guess was a really funny idea to some, but they sounded awful! though I did admire there spirit. One thing I did love was the location it was set in. The beautiful view of the bright blue Ocean, with the sun shining down on it, was a great sight to see. I had actually avoided this movie for quite awhile, because I'm quite picky on musicals, and even respectfully passed on watching it when my Mom rented it. Well I finally bit the bullet and gave it a shot, and while I admired it's good natured plot, dug the scenery, and admired the characters, it just gets completely exhausting after a while.Performances. Amanda Seyfried is charming and showed why she's one of Hollywood's best up and coming actresses. Meryl Streep,Julie Walters and Christine Baranski are a hoot as the inseparable threesome, and made the movie that much more bearable with there natural chemistry. Pierce Brosnan,Stellan Skarsgård and Colin Firth all have there own unique charms as the the gentleman who are dying to find out, if there Sophie's father.Bottom line. Mamma Mia is a decent Musical, but not one i'll see again. For what it was I suppose I enjoyed a lot of it, but the constant Abba just got on my nerves after a while, and as I said I like Abba. Worth the watch.6/10",6,1,2,21 February 2010

Twilight," It's aimed at teen audiences, for Pete's sake!. I'm a male adult, and I thought it was enchanting!.
","I have never read any of the Twilight novels, not one of them, so I can't compare the movie, to the novel. Remember that before judging me on my review, OK?. I have seen Twilight twice now, and enjoyed it just as much as I did the 1st time, does that make me a flake, too?. I think a lot of the Twilight hate, is due to all the hype about it. Whenever something is really big, and over exaggerated about by the media, people immediately begin to trash it. The fellow men can't stand, that there girlfriends are screaming and raving, about Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner all the time, therefore they get jealous. If your not the romantic type, Twilight isn't gonna appeal to you very much at all. if you're a romantic type, whether you're a guy or girl, you will find a lot to like here. Twilight has a lot of heart to it. When were not hearing cheesy dialog at times, or seeing the somewhat, corny special effects|The wire use is obvious!| It's often compelling you with its storyline. Bella is a complicated, but likable heroine. We appreciate the fact that she's different from all the rest.The romance between Kristen and Robert is pretty convincing as well. We can feel the realism, the pure love between the two of them, and I enjoyed the passion they shared together, their chemistry is natural. There are some pretty nifty action sequences in the film too. The big scuffle with Edward and James, was pretty entertaining to watch, if a little on the cheesy side. I also thought the ending was very well done, it was a great little prelude to New Moon. I don't care that Twilight is cheesy, and I really don't care that it's for teen audiences. All I care about is that a movie entertains me, and Twilight certainly accomplishes that feat Performances. Kristen Stewart is actually excellent as Bella. She had just a likable sense of awkwardness to her, while hitting all the right emotional tunes for the most part. She has this stunning unique beauty to her, that you can't take your eyes off of, when she's on-screen. I felt for her as Bella, I could feel what she was going through. Her little patterned ticks might be annoying to some, but I thought they were adorable. Robert Pattinson is pretty good for the most part. He came across a little awkward at 1st, but once he got comfortable, it was smooth sailing all the way for him. My only complaint was, he could have been a tad more aggressive in a couple of key scenes. Taylor Lautner isn't much of an actor at this point, in fact he uses his flashy smile, and charm to get by for the most part. Billy Burke is pretty awesome as Bella's father. To me that was a big key in making Twilight work, was his relationship with Bella. His cold, yet endearing performance made it work. Nikki Reed is so hot she could make steak sizzle. Performance wise she is up to the task for the most part, as Rosalie. Peter Facinelli&Elizabeth Reaser made for effective parents. Ashley Greene is pretty cute. I enjoyed her enthusiasm as Alice. Cam Gigandet is OK as James. He was menacing, yet kinda cheesy as well.Bottom Line. Twilight entertained me heavily, and really that's all I all I care about. Personally I think the people who purposely put low ratings for this film, to make the rating lower, or join in groups to trash it, is even more pathetic than the people who obsess over it. To be honest the only reason I rented this in the 1st place, was because of my big crush on Kristen Stewart. Thankfully I ended up enjoying the movie too. If you ignore all the annoying teenage fan girls, and the constant over hype, you may be able to get into Twillight like I did.8/10",8,1,5,12 January 2010
Saving Private Ryan," Without a question one of the greatest films ever made (in my humble opinion) *Possible Spoilers*
","Without a question one of the greatest films ever made (in my humble opinion). It's very sad gripping and often disturbing. Jaws was amazing but this is my favorite out of Steven Spielberg's films (i have not yet seen Schindler's list (but will soon). This film actually managed to make me shed a few tears at the end (it was very sad. this is EXTREMELY well made and brilliantly directed by Steven Spielberg using great shots especially during the war scenes. This film will stay with you long after you have watched it, and it's very moving. Beware though if you have a weak stomach Don't watch this movie!. The scenes between Hanks and Damon were awesome and very touching. The plot was awesome but sending tons of soldiers just to find Private Ryan a lot of people had a problem with that but i loved it. this is now the 2nd war film i have seen and i will be seeing lots more VERY soon. this movie is EXTREMELY gory. we get a leg blown off, severed arm, HUNDREDS of extremely bloody gunshot wounds, one to the eye (cringe inducing) one to the neck that spurts TONS of blood, blood everywhere someone's guts falls out of someone's belly, as he tried to hold them in , very graphic surgery (you see guts intestines), more graphic surgery, blood keeps pouring from a gunshot wound (VERY bloody), badly wounded soldier, bloody corpses, TONS of people explode into pieces, arm's torso's and other severed limbs fly everywhere, hand bitten on, TONS of graphic bloody gunshot wounds to the head with blood and brains spurting, (one of the goriest films i have ever seen). The acting is no doubt Oscar worthy Tom Hanks gives a performance of a lifetime,and deserved an Oscar for his Incredible performance. he is incredible just incredible, he is EXTREMELY likable, and what he said to James Ryan near the ending, was very moving. He is one of the best actors out there Matt Damon gives a wonderful performance here as the young i liked him lots, in my opinion he is a very talented actor, him and Hanks had awesome chemistry together.Edawrd Burns is good here and did what he had to do well. Tom Sizemore was funny and did very well here i liked him lots.Jeremy Davies is very good he showed vulnerability and did great. Adam Goldberg does rock solid here as the tough guy of the bunch. Barry Peppers also did well. Giovani Ribsi did not have much to do. Vin Diesel was good in his limited screen time. Ted Danson has a cool cameo. Harrison Young does great as the older Ryan. Overall I can't recommend this movie enough you must see this as soon as possible if you haven't. ***** out of 5",Null,2,6,20 December 2004
28 Days Later...," VERY disappointing WARNING!!!!! SPOILERS!!!!
",VERY disappointing film is VERY overrated with a very disappointing 2nd half it had a great 1st half that was full of suspense gore and tension and it was going real good till SPOILERS!!!!!! till the death of frank and it goes downhill from there and gets way too silly in my opinion. the script is uneven and to be honest it was really nothing special just an over hyped horror film (in my opinion). The Gore is there Bloody Machete attacks blood spurting all the time blood vomiting all over others messy looking zombies tons of nasty looking corpses a severed head a couple of gory wounds lots of bloody gunshot wounds a bleeding arm a zombie exploding with chunks flying. and more!. the characters were all great and i was getting all set to really get into it since the first half was AWESOME but it let me down to much in the 2nd half. The Acting is VERY good Cillain Murphy is AWESOME here and he shows vulnerability and i was rooting for him all the way!. Naomie Harris was my favorite character here she kicks butt all the time and is fun to watch she is also very likable. Brendan Gleeson is great as the caring father and i liked him lots. Megan Burns does fine here as the daughter and didn't get on my nerves once. Oh it also does a tribute to the original Dawn Of The Dead in the grocery shopping scene. Overall well worth seeing but nowhere near as good as people say it is still it's a must see but VERY disappointing since i was expecting to give this 5 starts once i was done watching it *** out of 5,Null,1,4,29 October 2004
Avengers: Infinity War," What a ride! It left me wanting more.
","This is my SPOILER FREE review of Infinity War. There are many things I wish I could talk about to make this review better..but I don't have the heart to spoil it for you guys. There aren't many people who hate spoilers more than me...and I won't spoil your experience for you here. I was fortunate enough to see an early screening a day before the scheduled release of Avengers: Infinity War with one of my best friends. I had fairly high expectations and I was pretty excited to see it. This movie delivers exactly what it promises, and that's fun with a capital F. One thing Marvel does to perfection is combine action, drama, and humour. It's absolutely loaded with exhilarating action scenes that often take your breath away, which is something Marvel always excels at. They put the pedal to the metal right from the outset and they don't take it off for well over 2 hours. But one thing that might surprise some people is how dark and dreary this movie is for a lot of the duration. You definitely get your humour that we all know and love...but this movie will get you emotional. It's extremely dark for a marvel film and it left me uncomfortable at times (In a really good way) You don't even have a chance to settle in for very long because your emotions will go haywire not too long after the movie starts. That's all I'm gonna say about that.The performances are all top-notch here. You're able to get emotionally invested in most of the characters and care about what happens to them. This will probably be a fairly unpopular opinion...but I'm not too fond of The Guardians of the Galaxy movies. I certainly found them watchable.....but I felt they were overhyped and nowhere near as good as people made them out to be. I couldn't really get into the characters either. That said, the characters from Guardian of the Galaxy are pretty well-written here and I surprisingly enjoyed them all. They all had a place, especially the complex relationship between Thanos (Josh Brolin) and Gamora (Zoe Saldana) I was riveted all the way. They mixed in well with the others and weren't a distraction like I expected. Josh Brolin is tremendous as Thanos, I can't rave about him enough. I don't wanna write too much more...but I was very satisfied when I left the theater and so were many others. People gasped, laughed out loud, clapped, and were talking non-stop to each other after the movie was over. You can't ask for more than that. When all was said and done, I left the theater very satisfied. It's exciting, thought-provoking, saddening, and downright awesome. I can't wait for Avengers 4. I couldn't be more intrigued by the direction they've chosen.8.5/10P.S...Be sure to stay for the end credits!",8,2,3,27 April 2018
Insidious," A creepy movie that goes off the rails a bit at the end, but it's very good
","A happy family suffers a situation they couldn't possibly fathom. Dalton falls into a coma, doctors can't figure out how it happened. Renai (Rose Byrne) calls in a medium Elsie Rainer (Lin Shaye) , much to Josh Lambert's (Wilson) chagrin. He eventually gives in and Elsie tells them their son is trapped in a realm called 'The Further'It's always nice to see a good old-fashioned ghost story, and who better at the helm than James Wan? James Wan knows how to deliver some scares that can give you goosebumps. He does a fantastic job of letting you use your imagination for scares, only showing snippets of the entities here and there. I thought they were very creepy for the most part, except for the silly looking demon thing at the end. He looked like a glorified elf. This movie is very similar to The Poltergeist in ways. Dalton is essentially in Heather O'Rourke's role, while Byrne & Wilson are in T. Nelson & Jobeth William's roles as the parents. It is derived a bit from The Poltergeist, but James Wan has his own vision and creativity to keep things fresh. It has a good build up as well. My only real carps about this movie is that it goes off the rails near the end. It runs a bit too long and it gets a bit silly. The huge twist with Patrick Wilson was OK at best, I wasn't all that pleased with it. I am also tired of the 'I don't believe' storyline. It has become such a cliché over the years. The acting is solid. Rose Byrne is a pro and a woman I would help out any day of the week. I wanted to jump in the screen and hug her. Patrick Wilson is great as well. His character is a bit cold in the first half, but he pulls off his character change in the second half like a champ and I rallied behind him as well. Lin Shaye is very good as the Medium, managing not to overdo it. Barbara Hershey is wasted in her role, but she does have a couple of key moments. Ironically enough, she was the female lead in another ghost story, The Entity. Ty Simpkins is fantastic for his age as Dalton and I was very impressedFinal Thoughts: The twist at the end doesn't exactly set up a sequel, but we got it anyway. When money talks, logic walks. It's just the way it is in Hollywood. That being said, I really enjoyed this film for the most part. It's scary and well done. I'm looking forward to Insidious II, even if it isn't necessary7.8/10",7,1,2,16 February 2014
2012," How on earth did the end of the world get to be so dull?.
","2012 is a soulless big budget extravaganza, much like Emmerich's Independence Day. The effects are jaw dropping of course, but the boring story and that I had to sit through 150 minutes of this stuff or so begun to get tiresome very quickly. Roland is capable of making an entertaining popcorn film|Universial Soldier is a prime example| but a lot of the time his films are over blown and downright dull with the effects taking over a much-needed story. 2012 is also very manipulative with its characters. It's almost as if it forces you to like them and it puts them in situations were the audience is bound to root for them, but that's what annoyed me, because I like to root for who I wanna root for. Watching John Cusack avoid death constantly became laughable after a while, and watching freeway's collapse with cars falling over, while impressive looking doesn't change the fact that this is still a lousy movie. 2012 is an event that many people are terrified of, myself included but this movie is a manipulative bore.Performances. John Cusack is a great presence and does what he can with the crappy material, I enjoyed his sense of humor. Amanda Peet is OK but nothing special. Chiwetel Ejiofor is a solid talent, horribly underused. Thandie Newton and Oliver Platt are given thankless roles. Woody Harrelson overacts laughably that it's saddening. Danny Glover plays a decent, but underwhelming president.Bottom line. I expected some decent things out of this, considering the horrifying events that are supposed to happen, but what I got was a big budgeted bore. People of course are gonna flock to see this movie, but I really don't advise it.2/10",2,1,2,25 May 2010
X-Men: The Last Stand," Brett Ratner neglects all of the things that Bryan Singer did to give us this cookie-cutter sequel (Some spoilers)
","Still grieving over the loss of Jean Grey, Scott Summers (Cyclops) sees a quick vision of Jean and heads to the place where Jean sacrificed herself. Jean miraculously appears in front of Scott. After being told that it is OK to let Jean see his eyes, they engage in a kiss, but Jean can't control her alter-ego, which is Phoenix. A cure is finally found for mutants, enraging some of the mutants in the process. When Charles Xavier tries to help Jean control the Phoenix, Charles is killed. Magneto takes advantage and it's up to the X-men to save the day againI haven't read the comics at all, so I'm not overly knowledgeable about X-Men. I'm a big fan of the first two movies though. It's not like I hated this sequel or anything, It's just extremely blasé and half-assed. There were so many story elements at play here and they failed to do anything riveting with any of them. It's been a long time since I've seen some drop the ball like they did with this sequel. It started off exceptionally. It was intense and emotional. Everything Bryan Singer did with the first two movies is noticeably absent here. Singer knew how to properly build things up and give us jaw dropping action as well. I don't buy into the excuse that the running time was too short. Singer had about the same amount of time in the first X-Men movie and he did a lot of terrific things with it. Brett Ratner's shoddy direction shows in this one. It lacks efficient tension when it should be filled to the brim with it. Jean Grey's storyline is the heart of this movie and I felt barely anything for her. It wasn't Famke Janssen's fault, but that's what happens when you have to deal with mediocre writing. With The Pheonix being so tantalizing, they should have knocked my socks off with The Phoenix. It's what I deserved, but more importantly, it's what X-Men fans deserved more than anything else. I didn't care for the injection of new blood either. I'm all for new blood, as long as I have a reason to care about the new characters. Juggernaut was absolutely laughable. Vinnie Jones looked foolish in the role. Ellen Paige tries her best, but I wasn't all that interested in her portrayal. Kelsey Grammar is a bit embarrassing as Hank McCoy. Even Hugh Jackman seems subdued in this movie. Also, could Charles's death be any more anti-climatic? I just sat there emotionless. They even managed to mess up the cure storyline. That was another missed opportunity. Final Thoughts: This had all the ingredients to be something special. This one is sorely lacking Bryan Singer's creative vision. As far as a movie is concerned, it's fairly enjoyable. As a follow-up to two great movies, it stinks. I'm not saying it's void of entertainment, far from it. I just thought they p****sed all over a potentially dynamite sequel. What a waste6/10",6,0,0,3 February 2014

The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," What a step up from Fellowship,The Two Towers won't leave you time to catch your breath,it's exhilarating.
","The Two Towers does something incredibly rare these days,that's outdo the 1st in every way possible. While Fellowship Of The Ring is technically good,and very well made,it wasn't very fun to watch at all. The Two Towers manages to grip you for the whole 170 minutes or so and that's quite a feat to pull off,because often for me that's way too overlong. The Battle sequences are quite a sight to be hold,it honestly never stops,it's just so action packed you won't have time to catch your breath. Everyone seemed so much more comfortable this time around,they all seemed to know there roles this time around,unlike the last time where everyone seemed all tense. I've never read the novels so I can't compare them to the films,but what I liked most about this film was the growing tension of Gollum's obsession with The Ring. He is frighteningly unpredictable and managed to make my skin crawl. I hadn't felt that much growing tension in a long,long time with Gollum and Frodo it was really harrowing stuff. While not quite the extent to 'Return Of The King' you start to see the pressure Frodo has of being The Ring holder.You slowly start to see him have a growing obsession for it,it just created a great storyline if you ask me. I also must mention how frightening Christopher Lee was as Saruman. he really gave me the creeps often and was the perfect foe. The Two Towers is everything Fellowship is not,it's exciting,tension filled and downright gripping.Performances. Elijah Wood is perfect this time around. He is often a complete revelation. We feel for him,we feel his pressure,we also see how strong his friendship with Sam truly is. Sean Astin continues to grow as an actor. He is even better as Sam this time around,he has more to play with,his charisma with Elijah is even better this time around,if that's even possible. Ian McKellen is pure class all the way. He put on an intense show,Ian can do no wrong in my mind. Viggo Mortensen as i've mentioned before in my reviews is not a favorite of mine,but he is much better this time around as Aragorn. He is strong,charismatic and only had a few wooden moments,good job!. Billy Boyd&Dominic Monaghan provide decent comic relief and make a likable tandem. Christopher Lee plays one of the most frightening villains in years as Saruman. His banter with McKellen is a treat to watch. Miranda Otto is pretty cute and was quite likable as Eowyn. Bernard Hill carries quite a strong presence with him. I enjoyed his character as Theoden. Brad Dourif is always great as slimy characters,so it's only fitting he played Grima. Orlando Bloom is once again too cool for School. I normally despise Elves,but he is simply a bad ass. Cate Blanchett is OK,like the 1st. John Rhys-Davies is less annoying then in Fellowship,but really that's not saying much. Liv Tyler is quite wooden this time around,I often felt her scenes were worthless. Hugo Weaving is also wooden,unlike the 1st where he was a required presence. Rest of the cast do there jobs fine.Bottom Line. Two Towers is excitement like no other. I am usually not a fan of this type of genre,but Two Towers is so exciting,I will make an exception in this case. You won't find excitement like this in a lot of place,so it's only right I give Two Towers my highest recommendation,I can possibly give.10/10",10,1,5,21 December 2009
The Bourne Legacy," I actually really enjoyed it. I felt Jeremy Renner was a solid replacement for Matt Damon
","This wasn't as good as the original three, but I wasn't expecting a whole lot when it was announced Jeremy Renner was taking over. To my pleasant surprise it stuck to the roots of the original three movies, and I wound up having fun with it. Tony Gilroy was a writer for the first three movies, so he knows what it takes. What really made Bourne Legacy were the potent action scenes, and some of the chase scenes really made my jaw drop. The one involving the motorcycle chase had me on the edge of my seat. That was really well done. What about Jeremy Renner? I thought he was excellent as Aaron Cross and made for a good replacement for Matt Damon. He is no stranger to action roles. Having prominent roles in Mission Impossible IV & The Avengers, he is no stranger in this regard. He is not only believable, but I had a blast watching him kick everybody's ass. Rachel Weisz is a favorite of mine, and she was very effective. Her chemistry with Renner was pretty good, and she was easy on the eyes as per usual. Stacy Keach is solid in support, as are Edward Norton & Scott Glenn. Joan Allen also returns in a small role. There are a few Jason Bourne mentions in this one, so he is not fully absent. Matt Damon doesn't appear at all in this one, thoughFinal Thoughts: It's pretty entertaining in all honesty, and has potential to turn into a solid franchise. I'd be more than happy if future sequels came out. Jeremy Renner's Aaron Cross is a potential money maker. I'd also love it if they made a sequel where Jason Bourne & Aaron Cross team up.7.5/10",7,2,4,30 August 2013
Dog Day Afternoon," Not a masterpiece, but powerful filmmaking for sure
","The first half is quite a bit better than the second half, but the fact remains that this is a very good movie. It's filled with suspense and tense situations throughout. Al Pacino is absolutely incredible in this movie. It's really him that makes the movie so good. He's a desperate man, who happens to be a bit of a lost soul. His wife is extremely self centered and controlling, and he has another 'lover' It might just be the performance of his career, which is truly saying something, considering how illustrious it is. It has some really controversial stuff going on. Taboo subjects such as 'sex change' among other things. I loved Charles Durning in this as well. His battle with Al Pacino is very riveting and great entertainment. I was really disappointed when his character disappeared a bit in the second half, because that's when things began to falter. We also get a painfully dull phone conversation with Al Pacino and his lover. It's much too long, and they should have trimmed that call a bit, because my mind began to wander. We don't have any real heroes in this movie. Al Pacino isn't exactly a 'hero' and I didn't really warm up to any of the hostages, either. John Cazale is probably the person I empathized with the most as Sal. Lance Henriksen has a memorable part as Murphy. This is Pacino's movie and he absolutely nails it. The finale is rather conventional, but extremely well done and exciting. This movie is not without issues, but still a powerful experience. Al Pacino has rarely been better. It's a must see for film buffs8.3/10",8,0,1,19 November 2013

Kick-Ass," Kick-Ass pretty much sums up how I feel
","Dave Lizewski is your average high school student that has no excitement to speak of in his life, other than his two best friends. He orders a superhero costume with every intention of stopping crime on the streets and declares himself 'Kick-Ass'. During a car theft attempt, Dave valiantly fights them, but he gets critically injured. After his recovery, Dave becomes a You Tube sensation and falls in love with high school crush, Katie Deauxma. Dave teams up with Big Daddy & Hit-Girl to take down the evil Frank D'AmicoThis is not your average superhero flick, far from it. This one is all too real. Dave doesn't have any overwhelming superhero powers as Kick- Ass and he is the farthest thing from invincible. I always love it when a superhero is set in the real world. They even add social media sites, like You Tube and the Craig Ferguson show to make it all the more genuine. It really is a near brilliant satire. It is extremely well written and gives us exciting action and a top-notch story. Those that are squeamish will probably loathe this movie. Kick-Ass is explicitly violent, almost to the point of being cartoonish. I'm sure there are plenty of pundits that will bemoan and carp about this being vulgar and how it is sending the wrong message to people. If you're one of those people, lighten up! I'm not saying I agree with vigilantism or anything like that, I just don't find cartoonish violence offensive. I got so much out of this movie for many reasons. Who hasn't wanted to make a difference in this world at some point? Any good person is probably disgusted at events that happen in this world, but we lack the stones and conviction to do something about it. We care about all of the good guys in this one, regardless of whether what they are doing is considered right or wrong. Dave Lizewski is a normal human being like the rest of us. He takes a stand because he strongly believes in what he's doing. How can you not admire that? I thought Aaron Taylor-Johnson did a wonderful job as our brave hero. He is easy to relate too and has a geeky charm that is impossible to dislike. Nicolas Cage gives one of his best performance in years. This is what the man is capable of when fully motivated. I don't see how anyone could complain about his performance. Chloë Grace Moretz is excellent as Cage's daughter. She was bad-ass for her age. She might have given the best performance and that's quite a statement. I loved the Cage & Moretz tandem. Lyndsy Fonseca is absolutely gorgeous and solid as the love interest. Christopher Mintz-Plasse is good, if a little annoying at times. His Red Mist character was amusing most of the time. The rest of the cast is good as well. Final Thoughts: This movie ponders this question. How far are you willing to go for another human being in need? It is ambitious, exciting, authentic, and wonderfully irreverent. This movie isn't for the squeamish. But those that are looking for a different superhero film that is full of realism? This one is for you. It is one of my favorites and I proudly own the DVD. 9.4/10",9,3,5,31 January 2014

Dan Aykroyd is very good here and was quite funny at times and he was perfect for this role i liked him lots.Harold Ramis is fine here as Raymond although he was the least interesting of the lot he was still an interesting character i just wish they gave him more to do. Sigourney Weaver is HOT! here and her acting is fine i always thought this woman was a very good actress here is no different. Harold Ramis does what he does best here play the role he is so good at the geeky but likable hilarious weirdo.Annie Potts does good as the secretary and is a pretty good actress.

Maggie Cheung is gorgeous and does excellent here as Flying Snow, she had some great emotional scenes with Tony Leung, had a cool character, and even though she was unlikable at times, she did an excellent job overall. Ziyi Zhang is incredibly gorgeous, and does fine with what she had to do as Moon, I really liked her. Daoming Chen does what he has to do well as the King, I liked him.

The Hurt Locker," One of the most overrated Oscar winners in the history of Cinema.
","Kathryn Bigelow is a talented Director, but she got away with robbery here. I really don't know what Hollywood was thinking when people voted this Best Picture. Even Avatar was better than this movie, and that wasn't even Oscar worthy as far as best picture is concerned. It has no real plot to it, the scenes seemed to go on forever for me, and I never fully understood what was going on. They really don't make War films like they used too. Classics like Platoon, Apocolaypse Now, Casulaties Of War just to name a few, The Hurt Locker pales in comparison to those.Bottom line. Overrated heavily in my opinion. Worth a look, but I was bored senseless.5/10",5,4,7,18 July 2010

Slap Shot," Slap Shot Is a classic Hockey film that everyone needs to see!
","I really loved Slapshot, i saw it many times as a kid and it still holds up just as well today in my opinion, I absolutely loved the Hanson brothers, they just cracked me up with the things they did, Paul Newman was also brilliant as Reggie. The hockey action is pretty exciting as well with some amusing fights, and great humor as well. It's also very similar to what was happening in Hockey and NHL at that time with all the goons in hockey, so I also enjoyed that too. There's lots of vulgar language,blood, nasty humor and I absolutely loved it, cause i love controversy, as I believe this is one of the best Sports movies ever made it has everything you want. There are lots of funny jokes in this film one of my favorites was Strother Martin's joke about the Masturbator as that cracked me up big time. Overall Slap shot is a must see for any film buff as it's a true classic and hasn't dated one bit in my opinion.The Acting is very good. Paul Newman is terrific as Reggie Dunlop,he was funny,cocky but never overbearing and always had this great charm about him that you couldn't help but love he really is a class act I believe this is one of his finest roles!. Michael Ontkean is good as the hot shot Ned Braden who Doesen't like to fight as he has a classic moment near the end where he strips off his gear and starts doing dances that was the highlight for me.Strother Martin is good as the crook Owner he just brought lots of class and laughs to this. Jennifer Warren is OK but nothing spectacular as the love interest, and didn't really have much to do in my opinion her chemistry with Newman was OK. Lindsay Crouse is decent as Ontkean's love interest but got on my nerves with her constant snotty attitude. Jeff Carlson,Steve Carlson,David Hanson are all hilarious as the Hanson brothers and cracked me up whenever they were on screen as they were the highlight for me.",10,3,6,18 June 2007
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," I don't care if I get bashed for praising this film, but New Moon entertained me heavily, and that's all there is to it for me.
","Now I'm not apart of the crazed female population, who go nuts over Twilight, nor am I a professional critic, or an expert . I'm a simple male who happens to actually enjoy Twilight related stuff. New Moon is a film that seemingly gets never-ending bashing, from movie critics and people alike. While everyone has a right to their opinion, I also have a right to mine. It's because of the ridiculous bashing that I decided to watch this online, rather than pay for money at the theater. All I had heard was, how wooden the acting was, and how the story is so incoherent. I don't look for constant flaws in a movie, nor do I really care, I know all about New Moon's flaws. All I care about is a movie entertaining me, and putting me in another world to distract me from my own problems, in life. New Moon is much darker than Twilight. Bella is much more fragile, she's suicidal and even dangerous to herself. I think it made for a much more interesting storyline this time around, because it develops the strong friendship, and even more from Bella and Jacob. I thought Taylor Lautner had the proper intensity, needed to play Jacob, dude was fit as hell too. The developing relationship between him and Bella, was a treat to watch.The last 40 minutes or so, are absolutely suspense filled, and loaded with surprises. I liked how the movie ended just suddenly like that, to make us wait for Eclipse. It also had some decent humor bits too, from Bella herself. I would laugh when Edward appeared briefly in a blur, telling her no, and she would constantly disobey him, it added some much-needed humor. I thought the budding relationship of Bella and Jacob, was more interesting than the one that was going on with Edward&Bella, which is one of the reasons I'm looking forward to Eclipse, to see what happens there, since I haven't read the books. The slow motion effect of Bella running to Edward, was pretty cool in my opinion. It had a lot of suspense to it.Performances. Kristen Stewart is more rounded this time around. I have heard nothing but criticism from her performance. Well I honestly felt, she was more matured this time around. She had a sense of humor this time, and had more to play with. She gave Bella her all, and looked amazingly hot to boot!. Robert Pattinson did OK, but his part isn't as required, until the finale. Taylor Lautner is actually pretty good as Jacob. He Doesn't have much to do in the 1st, while here the movie relies on his character heavily. He responded to the pressure more than adequately, and I give him plenty of props, for making me care about his character. I see big things for the lad. Billy Burke is solid as Charlie, but he isn't quite as important as he was in Twilight. Ashley Greene does OK as Alice, but does not have a lot to do this time around. Michael Sheen is a bit too hammy for my liking, as Aro, and was dwarfed by all the makeup he was wearing. Anna Kendrick has just become more self-centered here as Jessica.Bottom Line. New Moon entertained me just as much as Twilight, and I don't really care what people think about that. It's not perfect, it has many plausible moments, but when all was said and done, I had a good time!. a 4. 5 rating, really? There are movies that are rated higher on here, that I felt deserve that rating, more then this one. Make up your own mind on this one, you might enjoy it like I did, but if you hate it like a lot of the others, that's okay too. But don't let the bad reviews stop you from watching it.8/10",8,2,8,18 January 2010
Men in Black II," Not A Good As The 1st Men In Black, But Sill A Very Entertaining And Underrated Sequel, Tommy Lee And Will Smith Had Wonderful Chemistry Once Again!
","This is not as good as the 1st Men In Black, but still a very entertaining and underrated sequel, Tommy lee and Will Smith had wonderful chemistry together once again!. All the characters are great, and the story while very similar to the original is still pretty cool, plus Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are simply amazing in this!. The effects by Rick Baker are really cool, and I thought Will Smith carried the film just fine until he found Tommy again!, plus it also has plenty of laughs in it too, especially when Frank (The Dog), is singing out the window. The finale is very good, and I personally felt Rosario Dawson made a great addition to the cast!, plus I feel that critics and movie fans alike are way too harsh on this film in my opinion. It's quite well made, and while it doesn't come close to matching the original, it's still pretty damn good for a sequel!, plus it paves way for another possible sequel. At 80 to 88 minutes, it's a great breezy time waster, and the ending was really cool!, plus all the characters were very likable. This is not as good as the 1st Men In Black, but still a very entertaining and underrated sequel, Tommy Lee and Will Smith had wonderful chemistry once again, I highly recommend this one!. The Direction is very good!. Barry Sonnenfeld does a very good! job here with great camera work cool angles and just keeping the film at a very fast pace. The Acting is excellent. Will Smith is amazing as always, and is amazing here, he is hilarious, had wonderful chemistry with Tommy Lee once again, had some really funny lines, kicked that ass, and did the same things that made him so funny in the 1st! (Will Rules!!!). Tommy Lee Jones is also amazing as always, and is amazing here, while we don't see him until after 30 minutes in to the movie, he hadn't lost his touch, and played the straight man once again, and like Smith did the same thing that made him so good in the 1st!. (Tommy Lee Rules!!!). Rip Torn is great as Zed once again i really liked him, he was funny. Lara Flynn Boyle is decent here, and looked great, however i didn't find her all that menacing. Johnny Knoxville is OK here, I am a huge fan of this guy, however, he just wasn't all that funny, and didn't have that much to do, and disappeared in the 3rd Act he still rocks though! (Knoxville Rules!!). Rosario Dawson is very pretty and did what she had to do extremely well i really liked her. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall I highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5",8,0,0,17 December 2005
Empire Records," GREAT movie that i enjoyed VERY much!
","GREAT movie that is very enjoyable with lots of likable characters and a cool plot!. I actually liked Liv Tyler a lot in this because normally i am not a fan at all, but she was excellent here. It's an excellent blend of Comedy and Drama, with a bit of romance thrown into the mix. I was expecting this to be a very good movie and i wasn't disappointed, and i loved the shop lifting scene between Warren and Lucas. The direction was excellent Allan Moyle did a terrific job he kept the film at a very good pace and not allowing a dull moment. The acting was great. Anthony LaPaglia did a terrific job here , he was very likable had decent chemistry with Debi Mazar and i loved the hairdo!. Maxwell Caufield did his job but he acted with his hair and i hated his character. Debi Mazar did what she had to do well but didn't have to do much. Rory Cochrane was EXCELLENT here, he played a bit of a weasel but he was extremely likable and was my favorite character here, and even if he did lose $9000 dollars to Atlantic City he still rocked!. Johnny Witworth was very good as A.J and had decent chemistry with Liv and was pretty likable. Robin Tunney was excellent here and was pretty likable and her shaved head was pretty funny!. Renee Zellweger was GREAT here and is GORGEOUS! ,good to see her in any movie. Liv Tyler was VERY good here , and quite beautiful, as i said normally not a fan but she was great here. Ethan Embry was Goofy but likable. and Richard Sexton III annoyed me and made me laugh at the same time. Overall give this a shot a must see! ****1/2 out of 5",9,5,10,1 January 2005
Million Dollar Baby," A Deeply Disturbing,Haunting, And Depressing Boxing Film, And It May Just Be The Best Film I Have Ever Seen!
","This is going to be very hard for me to review but i will do my best. A Deeply Disturbing, and depressing,boxing movie, and it may just be the best film i have ever seen!. The Performances, are incredible, just incredible,, and all 3 of them deserve Oscars, especially Swank!. It's Moving, touching, disturbing and extremely sad. You grow so attached to Swank's character, since she is so incredibly likable, and what happens to her is not right!. Hillary and Clint's Chemistry is simply amazing, they had a special bond,as for Maggie's Mother, You will hate her, , and want to slap her silly, for being such a bitch. However it depressed me big time, and it's not easy to watch (2nd half anyway). there are lots and lots of disturbing images, that will haunt you , trust me., In fact The whole 2nd half is haunting. The Direction is absolutely, incredible. Clint Eastwood, is brilliant behind the camera, nothing fancy, but the film does not need it, still it's brilliant, all the way!.And that score, is simply awesome!. The Acting Is absolutely incredible,with No Doubt Oscar winning performances from, Swank, Eastwood,Freeman. Hillary Swank, gives one of the best performances, ever!, she is so incredibly likable, i have never grown, so attached to a character before, she's so adorable, lovable, and what happened to her, it tore me up,however i don't want to ruin the film so that's all i will say.However it is indeed one of the finest performances ever in a movie. Clint Eastwood, is just as good, he is an incredible actor, his character is meant to be rough, and gruff, but he really has a heart of a gold and i enjoyed the special bond/chemistry him and Hillary had.Morgan Freeman is absolutely, fantastic here as always, and was a great narrator, plus, i loved his character. Jay Baruchel, is good as Danger, and was harmless, plus he gave me a few good chuckles. Lucia Rijker, plays one of the most despicable, pieces of trash i have ever seen, she did her job extremely well, but i just wanted to strangle her(literally). Margo Martindale did her job extremely well as the hate able, uncaring mother. Overall , i was simply, blown away by this movie, and it's one of the best movies i have ever seen!, There is absolutely no excuse, for you not to see this film! , i have never been affected by a movie this much! . ***** out of 5",10,8,14,10 February 2005
Garden State," Not quite as good as its reputation suggests, but still a very moving film
","(Credit IMDb) A quietly troubled young man returns home for his mother's funeral after being estranged from his family for a decade.Garden State is an excellent movie. People praise it like a masterpiece, and it was even in the top 250 on IMDb at one point. While it's not quite good enough to be on the top 250, in my opinion, it's still a really moving film, which will make you think a lot. It is quite thought provoking and realistic. The relationship between Andrew (Zach Braff) and his dad Gideon (Ian Holm) was depressingly realistic. The heart of this movie is the romance between Zach Braff & Natalie Portman. They are heart warming to watch, and real as well. It was a real treat to watch them evolve together, and watch them at work. The chemistry was perfect between them. I also thought the ending was quite clever as well. Final Thoughts: This is a very good movie, and one I recommend highly. Some people tend to praise it a bit too much, but that doesn't take away the quality. 8/10",8,0,0,6 October 2013
Casualties of War," Very Good War Fillm, That's Pretty Powerful At Times
","Very good War film that's pretty powerful at times. The 2 main leads were absolutely fantastic, and it has a lot of disturbing moments. This is quite underrated and deserves a b it more recognition. it's very well written, all the characters were very good!. It starts off a little slow but quickly becomes very engrossing and pretty disturbing. The Direction is great!. Brian DePalma does a terrific job here during the war scenes , moving it along at a great pace and overall he did a wonderful job!. There is lots of violence we lots of extremely bloody gunshot wounds a bloody impaling, lots of legless corpses very bloody stab wounds on someone's body rape, exploding body more corpses, and more gunshot wounds. The Acting is fabulous!. Michael J. Fox is OUTSTANDING here!, he was extremely likable and the scenes between him and Penn were pretty powerful. Sean peen is fantastic here he gave me the creeps in some scenes, he did an awesome job!. Don Harvey is sadistic, but did his job very well!. John C. Reilly got on my nerves he did okay. Thuy Thu Le does well in both her roles, but all she has to do really is act shocked. John Leguizamo does fine here as Diaz. while Ving Rhames is great in his scenes. Overall i highly recommend this one! ***1/2 out of 5",8,1,2,19 January 2005
Event Horizon," Entertaining With Awesome Special Effects, However A Bit Confusing With A Muddled Story
","This is an entertaining film with awesome special effects, however it's a bit confusing with a muddled story. It also starts off rather slowly, until the 2nd half. It's got lots of creepy images, and all the characters were cool, however they could have been a lot more developed,and the ending kind of sucked, still the effects were jaw dropping, and it was rather creepy at times. It was kinda disturbing at times and Sam Neil going crazy near the end was great, plus the makeup on him was fabulous. Overall it's well worth a watch, but it could have been better story and scripting wise. The Direction is good. Paul W.S. Anderson does a good job here, with some amazing shots, great use of colors (especially green and blue),great set pieces, creating creepy mood, and keeping the film, at a mostly good pace. There is quite a bit of blood and gore. We get a severed hand,TONS and TONS of blood,hollowed out eye sockets,lot of gory corpses,shattering corpse,bashed open leg,blood vomiting,hollowed out corpse, with all of it's organs on a table,extremely gory flashes,gory scalpel action,guts are pulled out of someone's mouth,very graphic fall victim,slit wrists, and more. yep plenty here. The Acting is very good. Sam Neil is EXCELLENT here, he is extremely creepy, unpredictable,and is a wonderful actor, he excels at roles like this!. Laurence Fishburne is very good here, however his character wasn't developed that well, and it took me a while to warm up to him he was still great, and is also a wonderful actor. Kathleen Quinlan is cute, and does fine with what she has to do, and was pretty likable. Richard T. Jones is hilarious as the comic relief. Rest do fine. Overall well worth a watch! *** out of 5",7,2,4,28 April 2005
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Often intense, but never fully satisfying due to the inconsistent pacing.
","(Credit IMDb) Forty years ago, Harriet Vanger disappeared from a family gathering on the island owned and inhabited by the powerful Vanger clan. Her body was never found, yet her uncle is convinced it was murder and that the killer is a member of his own tightly knit but dysfunctional family. He employs disgraced financial journalist Mikael Blomkvist and the tattooed, ruthless computer hacker Lisbeth Salander to investigate. When the pair link Harriet's disappearance to a number of grotesque murders from almost forty years ago, they begin to unravel a dark and appalling family history. But the Vanger's are a secretive clan, and Blomkvist and Salander are about to find out just how far they are prepared to go to protect themselves.This is well made, often intense, and a good sense of mystery, but as I said in the subject title it's hard to get through sometimes. I understand the point was to be leisurely paced, but sometimes it was too much to bear, and I sometimes thought 'Get on with it' That being said it contained many chilling moments. Where she gets revenge from the rape is not only chilling, but heavily powerful as well, and it certainly stuck with me. While the middle is hard to get through, the finale made up for it. It was touching, intense, and even shocking. Noomi Rapace is also a pure stand-out.Performances. Noomi Rapace is a revelation. Her eyes tell the story most of the time, and I was purely astonished by her performance here. She was the main reason that kept me watching. Michael Nyqvist is very solid for the most part. Not as interesting as Noomi's character, but he was good nonetheless. His chemistry with Noomi was good as well.Bottom line. It's certainly a professionally well made movie, but frustrating to watch sometimes. Is it worth a recommendation? You bet! But if the middle didn't drag so much, it would have been even better.7 ½ /10",7,0,2,9 February 2011
Mulholland Drive," A Thought Provoking Masterpiece!
","This is a thought provoking masterpiece from David Lynch!. It's very confusing at times, and i didn't get all the answers i wanted, but still i enjoyed every minute of this movie, and Naomi Watts gives a fantastic performance in this!. You have to pay very good attention in this movie or you will miss some of the plot twists that happen, and a lot of them are surprises!. There's lots of bizarre fascinating imagery to go around,and all of the characters were great, however i had one problem, i found the ending kind of abrupt, other then that i adored this movie. The Direction is GREAT!. David Lynch does a fantastic job here, creating lots of bizarre imagery, a dark creepy atmosphere, and overall keeping the film fascinating throughout!. There is a tiny bit of blood, but that's not what this movie is about. We get, bloody cuts, gunshot wound to the head, and a bloody nose bleed. The Acting Is Oscary Worthy!. Naomi Watts, gives an OUTSTANDING Oscar Worthy performance here, she is STUNNINGLY GORGEOUS!, and deserved her Oscar Nomination for her outstanding performance here, she also had great chemistry with laura Harring, she is also extremely likable, and that audition scene is a WOW!. Laura Harring is excellent here she is beautiful, very likable and had great chemistry with Watts. Justin Theroux, is very good as Adam the director , he is a bit of a dork at times,but overall i dug him. Dan Hedaya, is good in his scenes and added class. The rest do fine.

Evil Dead," One of the best horror films I have seen in a long time. You best buckle up; the ride is absolutely insane!
","I was seriously appalled to learn that one of my favorite horror films of all time (Evil Dead) was being remade. There was nothing but abhorrent disdain for the months leading up to it. Even the trailer didn't get me pumped. I refused to go to the theater to support a 'remake' let alone one of my favorite Horror films. Then some major buzz for this film commenced. It was really mixed. My interest began to rise a little bit; not much, but a little bit. I waited a few weeks once this was released on DVD before finally pulling the trigger. Well; I have now seen it and I can officially say. It's been a LONG time since I've had this much fun with a horror film; holy hell! Right from the intense and somewhat disturbing opening I started to get the feeling in my gut that everything was going to be OK. Like always; my gut didn't fail me. I admit that this is a remake, but I would also consider this a love letter to the original. It has some very sly winks to the original that are expertly done. The suspense here is top notch and had me on the edge of my seat throughout the film, along with a few boo scares as well. The character development isn't the greatest; I would have loved for it to go deeper between Mia (Jane Levy) and David (Shiloh Fernandez) but I was too busy having a blast to let it bother me. I was able to care about the characters more than the original though. Aside from Ash; I never really boogied to any of the other characters very much. Here I had at least three characters that I wanted to live, and that is something I can honestly not say about the original. What about the violence? Let's just say it gets downright nastyBeing rated R certainly helped this bad boy; I'm not gonna spoil all of the red surprises you'll see in this film, as it gets pretty wild, but here is a few examples. A girl cuts her face off with a shard of glass; there is a succinct scene that involves lesbianism, but you sure as hell won't be turned on by it, that's for sure It's a wickedly twisted scene. It's one of the goriest films I have ever seen, and it arguably might just be nastier than the original. It made me flinch a few times, and I have a very strong stomach. There is also a couple of tributes to Evil Dead II; yes, sir. Fede Alvarez did his homework, and he is clearly a fan of the Evil Dead series. Jane Levy makes for a perfect heroine. She is sympathetic, vulnerable, and a cutie to boot. She goes through hell and back, and I couldn't have been more impressed by her. I also loved the added twist with her being a drug addict. It added a bit more turmoil and emotion. Shiloh Fernandez was solid, if a bit whiny at times. I dug the connection between him and Mia (Levy) and he came through for the most part. Lou Taylor Pucci plays Scottie's role in the original, and he is way more likable and courageous. He had some great scenes, and I loved him; Jessica Lucas (Olivia) plays the most unsympathetic character in the film, and I wanted to back hand her one at times. She did well with what she had to do. Elizabeth Blackmore (Natalie) has one memorable scene. I won't spoil itFinal Thoughts: Is it as good as the original? Not quite, but I loved this film. It's not very often I feel so pumped after watching a Horror Movie, but Evil Dead did just that. It never stops! It doesn't give you time to breathe at times. Its haywire, it's insane, it's shocking; it's everything a Horror movie should be! You won't think of it as a 'remake' at least if you're smart, you won't. I can't praise this movie enough. The people that trash this film in my opinion should not be watching Horror movies anymore. I was bitter too when Evil Dead was remade, but I ended up having a lot of fun. Don't be put it off by it like I was, and don't over hype yourself either. Go in to the movie like you would anything else. Bring on Evil Dead II! Hell; if the rumors are true. Combine both series to make a cross over for Army Of Darkness II (or Evil Dead IV; whatever you wanna call it!)9/10",9,4,9,30 August 2013
The Imitation Game," Deserves All The Praise!
","I hate going to the theater alone! That's why I usually go with a friend. We both agreed that we wanted to see this movie. It's one of the best movies I've seen this year! It's even better that it's based off a true story. It does a fantastic job of building things up slowly, engrossing you with a wonderful story. Alan Turing's story is both fascinating and heartbreaking. We owe our lives to this man in some ways! If it wasn't for him, who knows what Hitler would have pulled off. Some of his tactics may have been unethical and questionable, but he was absolutely brilliant. Who cares if he was neurotic and standoffish! How does he get repaid? He gets medically castrated for being gay. No matter how many times that goes through my head, it never fully registers. He cracked the enigma code, saved lives, changed the world, among other things. It's absolutely baffling! The performances are amazing. Benedict Cumberbatch is incredible as Turning, and I wouldn't be upset at all if he won an Oscar. He's deserving of it. Keira Knightley is excellent. She continues to be one of the most dependable actresses in Hollywood! Matthew Goode has charisma in spades! I loved him. Rest of the cast are greatThis film moved me in many ways. It's a genuinely great film that stuck with me after it was over. It's well worth seeing in theaters! Highly recommended8.6/10",8,4,10,19 February 2015

","This is another masterpiece from Tarantino, its one of his absolute best! with a wonderful story and top notch performances!. All the characters are just wonderful, and it has some wonderful OTT violence! plus Uma Thurman is simply amazing in this!. The opening is quite grim and disturbing, and the fight scene involving Uma and the crazy eighty eights is jaw dropping!, however I wish the main fight between Black Mamba(Thurman)and O-Ren Ishii(Lucy Liu) was a bit longer, it was still cool though!. I loved the animation and all of the black and white sequences! and the scene where The Bride 1st wakes up from her long coma is quite emotional, plus all the characters are extremely likable!. The music in this is great! and the fight scene between Fox and Uma was awesome as well, plus I loved Chiaki Kuriyama's (Go Go)character!. I would rank this as Tarantino's 3rd best right behind Kill Bill 2 and Pulp Fiction! and this is extremely well written and made as well, plus you may find yourself rooting for Uma's character as I felt sympathy for her character!.Michael Bowen's character Buck was absolutely despicable he truly deserved to get his head bashed in! and sometimes the violence is so OTT it's comical! plus the fight choreography was really well done!. I felt that what happened to O-Ren Ishii's parents was really sad, and I just loved the ways on how The Bride got revenge!, plus this movie deserves its place on the top 250 in my opinion!. The dialog is really cool, and the scenes involving Uma and Sonny Chiba(Hattori Hanzo) were just great, plus the swords in this movie looked so awesome!. I loved how creative and unique it was and Quentin Tarantino's direction is flawless in my opinion! plus the character development is excellent for the most part!. I have seen this movie multiple times now as it gets better each time I watch it! and well this movie is popular with so many movie fans and critics alike it may not be for everyone plus the ending was just great!. This is another masterpiece from Tarantino, its one of his absolute best! with a wonderful story and top notch performances, and if you haven't seen it what are you waiting for? do so immediately! you shouldn't regret it.The Direction is incredible! practically flawless for the most part. Quentin Tarantino does an incredible job here with amazing camera work, outstanding angles, great use of colors and lots of other great and stylish shots as well, plus he kept the film at an extremely fast pace!.The Acting is amazing!. Uma Thurman is stunningly gorgeous and is amazing as always, she gives one of her best ever performances is very likable is all business, kicks that ass did fantastic in her emotional scenes was really into her role and I just loved the way on how she got revenge, she was amazing! (Uma Rules!!!!!!!). Lucy Liu is hot and had one wicked character, she was wonderfully evil but at the same time you feel for her, she can also kick that ass with the best of them! I loved her. Daryl Hannah is way hot, and also had a wicked character, I just wished she had more screen time because she was awesome!. Vivica A. Fox is very good in her scene,she is a good fighter and was menacing I liked her. David Carradine had some good dialog but we hardly ever see his face. Michael Madsen is good I guess,but like Carradine we never see him hardly. Chiaki Kuriyama is awesome as Go Go, she was hot and had a really cool character I loved her!. Michael Parks(Earl McGraw),Michael Bowen(Buck),Julie Dreyfus(Sofie),Sonny Chiba(Hattori Hanzo),all do what they have to do very well.

Saw II," Too gimmicky for my liking, lacking all the qualities that made the 1st so special.
","Saw II is an OK film, but vastly underwhelming in my opinion for a number of reasons. Many of the characters here are selfish, whiny and I couldn't wait for them to get their ultimate demise. With Saw I was able to care about the two main central characters, and even though they had there selfish qualities, they both possessed likable qualities. Donnie Wahlberg's character is not very easy to root for. He's verbally abusive, he uses brutality too much and he never learns his lesson when he's supposed to, therefore I had a hard time coming to grips to root for him. The 1st time you watch this one, the twist at the end is very clever, but the 2nd time around it's not so shocking and you start to wonder why you couldn't figure it out in the 1st place. The gore level while good, is toned down here compared to most of them, but the needle in the haystack scene makes for some fun and gruesome times. Most of the people prefer this one over Saw III, but I personally think the 3rd one is miles above this sequel.Performances. Tobin Bell is very effective as Jigsaw once more. His cold eerie stare and his presence are just great. Shawnee Smith displays a great balance of vulnerability and bravery, while being very likable to boot. Donnie Wahlberg does very well, but his character is not very easy to root for. Erik Knudsen plays a likable kid and I actually rooted for him as the Son. Franky G plays one of the most unlikable slime balls I've seen in recent memory, I couldn't stand his selfish antics. Beverley Mitchell is good, but too whiny for my liking. Dina Meyer plays her part well.Bottom line. Saw II is OK, but not the dandy followup I remembered it to be. It's slick-looking and well done, but it's too selfish for its own good. It's worth a look as an OK time waster, but nothing more in my opinion.6/10",6,2,3,24 May 2010
From Dusk Till Dawn," One Of The Best Vampire Films Ever Made!
","This is one of the best Vampire films ever made, tons of fun!. It Starts out like a crime flick then in the 2nd half, it turns into an action/vampire film , in my opinion either direction would have been cool, i was perfectly happy with the 2nd half, it was action packed with tons and tons of gore, lots of fun!, but if it stayed a crime/thriller that would have been cool too. The characters were all awesome and Clooney blew me away with his bad ass performance. It's well written and well made!, and it just entertained the hell out of me. The Directing is Fantastic!. Robert Rodriguez does a fantastic job here, with great zoom in's , great closeup of the vampires, wonderful effects, good use of colors, it's also pretty stylish in some scenes, and he kept the film at a very fast pace! good job. This is a Gorefest! we get a bloody gunshot wound to the back of the head with blood and brains spurting, lots of extremely bloody gunshot wounds,hole blown through hand, gory flashes, bloody corpse, knife in the hand, lots of extremely bloody vamp biting(and i mean extremely bloody), severed head, a very gory corpse, is used as a guitar (you heard me), and we see it over and over, slit throat, 2 decapitations, TONS and TONS of Melting Vampires, lots of ripped of limbs,ripped out heart, gory deformed vampires, TONS and TONS of extremely bloody Stakings, and Impalings legless vampire,a few head explosions, gory arrow hits, weird mutations, and about 20 exploding vampires yes this is indeed a gore fest i probably forgot some stuff too!. The Acting is Wonderful!. George Clooney gives an AMAZING performance here, he is a bad ass, actually likable, and i just couldn't help but love him!, his chemistry with Lewis and Tarantino was great, and he kicked that ass!, and was perfect for the part, and also my favorite character in the film!. Harvey Keitel is EXCELLENT here as usual he is a great actor , and one of the best of all time (in my opinion). and did a fine fine job here, he also kicked that ass, and was very likable as the preacher, who has lost his faith in god. Juliette Lewis is also EXCELLENT here , she is GORGEOUS, kicked that ass, and thankfully wasn't one of those wimpy daughters who just stood there and did nothing. Ernest Liu does decent as Scott, and was fairly likable but didn't have much to do. Quentin Tarantino is great here, he was a nut,kicked that ass and had great chemistry with Clooney. Salma Hayek is GORGEOUS, and does very well here, but wish she had more screen time. Cheech Martin is good in his roles. Danny Trejo, Tom Savini,Fred Williamson, John Saxon and Kelly Preston all do excellent in there small roles especially Savini. Overall One of the best Vampire films ever made and i suggest you see it this instant! ***** out of 5",10,1,3,2 December 2003
Clash of the Titans," Not much better than the original to be honest..
","(Plot credit, IMDb) The mortal son of the god Zeus embarks on a perilous journey to stop the underworld and its minions from spreading their evil to Earth as well as the heavens.I didn't care for the original, and my views on this one isn't much better. Was a remake warranted? I don't think so. Great talents such as Liam Neeson, Sam Worthington, Etc all give way to the special effects. We get plenty of sword fights in exquisite looking forests, with no intensity mind you, and completely lacking in favor, we have Liam Neeson spurting out ludicrous dialog, nothing really stood out for me.Bottom line. You can do better. This is basically a special effects extravaganza, nothing more.4/10",4,0,1,27 May 2011
Jurassic World," Sometimes, nostalgia isn't all it's cracked up to be.
","I enjoyed Jurassic Park a lot. I wasn't a massive fan or anything like that, but it was somewhat of a groundbreaking film. The sequels were pretty crappy, but I don't really remember them. My expectations for this movie were very low. I wasn't against another Jurassic Park movie by any means, but I wasn't exactly clamoring for one either. When my friend asked me to see it with him, I figured I'd give it a shot. It was technically well-done. It looked really slick. That being said, there was something missing that I couldn't put my finger on. Then it dawned on me! It lacks genuine tension. Steven Spielberg is a master at creating thrills and tension. He knows what the audience wants. Colin Trevorrow obviously did some research. In many ways, this is like a love letter to Jurassic Park. There are a lot of references to Jurassic Park. As amiable as that is, he falls short. There is plenty of action, but it felt mechanical and I wasn't all that entertained by it. I will say the Dinosaurs looked pretty cool. The performances are above average. Chris Pratt handled himself adequately. I didn't think he was great, but he did the job. I didn't fully buy him as a 'tough guy' Bryce Dallas Howard is a cute and fared pretty well. It's too bad her character was thinly written. Robinson & Simpkins are decent as the kids. My main problem with the cast is the lack of depth. I wasn't given enough to work with. This film isn't worthy of breaking box office records. I'm still shaking my head about how this made over 200 million on opening weekend. It's never boring and there are some good moments, I just don't see what all the fuss is about. It could have been better.6.3/10",6,6,15,18 June 2015
Paranormal Activity," A genuinely creepy film! Shame about the rest of the sequels...
","Katie & Micah are a happily married couple that have moved into the Suburbs. Unfortunately for them, Katie has brought a demon with them from her childhood. Micah decides to record everything with a camera, but becomes overly incessant with it. This ends up angering the demon and Katie get slowly terrorized by it. This one is far from perfect, but it's actually a well done film. The effort is clearly here, unlike the egregious sequels that followed suit. The formula is wildly overdone and it's become very tiring. Even though it did get tiresome in the sequels, I did love the 'everyday' feel this movie had. Incorporating realism is actually a clever move, and it panned out pretty well for director, Oren Peli. This movie had something in common with The Blair Witch Project. Both had an enormous amount of hype. This movie is much scarier than Blair Witch Project. I actually enjoyed the slow-build. Oren Peli knows how to control the tension just perfectly until it reaches the boiling point. We never actually see the demon and I thought that was for the best. Kate's paranoia slowly increases and it was quite interesting. All the shots of the house and people wandering around does get a tad redundant, but there is stuff to keep you occupied. The shots of Katie just standing there, staring at Micah in the bedroom gave me the creeps. The sleepwalking scenes were effective as well. The viewers patience is rewarded with a finale that packs a major wallop and it scared me silly. It isn't often that I get scared anymore. I've seen far too many horror movies, but I'm not afraid to admit that the ending made me regret having the lights off. I was afraid to go to bed for a while. If you don't feel a few chills go up and down your spine during the ending, check your pulse. The acting is competent, but I wouldn't necessarily wanna spend time with these people. Kate Featherstone is fine as Kate. She's got semblance of natural charisma and is fairly likable. I wouldn't call it a great performance though. Micah Sloat is a different story. His performance is fine, but I hated his guts. He was a major reason they were in the predicament that they were in. How many times did Kate politely ask him to put down the camera? He was very recalcitrant towards her and it became obsessive. Do you need to film EVERYTHING? He rarely stops filming! It got unrealistic after a while. I also got tired of his smart ass routine. If I was Kate, I would have thrown him out much sooner for being such a jerk. He was much too abrasive for my liking. Those two are forced to carry all the weight and they did an adequate job, all criticism aside. I did have some major carps with this movie, but I won't deny that it's a genuinely frightening film. The effort is there and I can see why it was so popular. Thanks to the popularity, we got three atrocious sequels (Haven't seen 'The Marked Ones' spin off) that somewhat tarnished the original's impact to the point where I think people forgot how efficient this movie was. See the original and avoid the sequels like Ebola. 7.5/10",7,0,0,22 November 2014
Mission: Impossible II," Tom Cruise's charisma can only take this,overly mind numbingly stupid sequel,so far.
","Mission Impossible II is full of cool looking Action stunts,Tom looks completely cool in his Leather Jacket,long hair,with his sunglasses,yet the film bored me half the time,rather then thrilling me. I have never been a big fan of John Woo's,I often find many of his films to be overblown,and unexciting,in fact the only film I've liked of his,is Face Off. Mission Impossible II is no different. It's overly loud,brash and not sophisticated like the 1st one was. Mission Impossible managed to thrill us,with perfectly orchestrated suspense,here it turns into an action lovers feast. There're shootouts,Tom and Dougray wrestling around on motorcycles,Tom avoiding bullets,unfortunately it's all highly unrealistic looking,and took away a lot of enjoyment for me. The fight scene near the end though,is shockingly well done. Tom showed quite the acrobatic skills,despite no Martial Arts training what so ever,it was all done to perfection. I also enjoyed how Thandie Newton's character was developed. She's completely unpredictable as Nyah|A bit too much at times,if you asked me| mysterious,we never know where she truly stands until the halfway point.Mission Impossible II entertains at some points,but it's just much too stupid for it's own good,completely brainless stuff.Performances. Tom Cruise's charisma is able to make this film a lot better then it should be. He is the epitome of cool here,walking around with a black leather jacket,expensive sunglasses,his hair all done up,he looks like a bad ass. Ethan Doesen't have the depth that he does in the 1st film,and this completely hurts Tom In the long run. Tom,however is able to bring his own brand of acting to Ethan this time around,to give us a character we can root for. His chemistry with Newton was also on the money. Thandie Newton is certainly good looking,that's for sure. As far as her acting is concerned,she managed to do a pretty adequate job,making her character as unpredictable as it comes. Dougray Scott is a decent villain. He's somewhat bland,but managed to get the job done when it counted. Ving Rhames is too cool for school. He added class,just like he did in the 1st. Richard Roxburgh is decent as Stamp,I liked his style for the most part. John Polson is funny as the other team member,basically the comic relief though. Brendan Gleeson is decent in his shady written part. Rade Serbedzija has a memorable accent,I'll say that.Bottom Line. Mission Impossible II is a failure as far as a followup goes. On it's own it's a mildly entertaining sequel at best,I'll say it again,having John Woo at the helm was a big mistake. Worth a look,but don't expect the original,and you might wanna bring some aspirin with you,due to the utter stupidity of the plot sometimes.6/10",6,1,2,29 December 2009
Black Hawk Down," Exhausting And One Of The Best War Movies I Have Ever Seen! (Possibly The 2nd Best)
","Exhausting (In a good way) and one of the best War Movies i have ever seen (possibly the 2nd best.). It's emotionally exhausting a lot of the time, Awe inspiring battle sequences, with great characters, and some good character development. It's a very powerful movie and not one soon you will forget anytime soon after you have watched it. People with weak stomach's BEWARE! this is not for the faint of heart so if your afraid of it stay away!. It's a very intense movie and it never stops, and will leave you breathless in some places. The Directing is incredible!. Ridley Scott is one of the best there is , he creates a lot of tension, making it always intense, with lots of cool camera angles moving it along at an incredibly fast pace, he was wonderful as usual. This movie is EXTREMELY EXTREMELY gory, weak stomachs beware!. We get Literally HUNDREDS and Hundreds of EXTREMELY bloody gunshot wounds, people are riddled with them, exploding body, people get hit by shrapnel (some of it bloody some of it graphic but non bloody), lots of badly wounded shoulders, people get blown to pieces by bombs, severed hand, someone gets nailed with a rocket launcher (Extremely gory!), TONS of VERY bloody corpses, EXTREMELY gory surgery sequences, we see lots of(guts and TONS of blood!) Blood Splatters everywhere, all the time and lots more!. The acting is outstanding!. Josh Hartnett is an extremely talented actor (in my opinion) and does amazing here , showing vulnerability , he hit all the right emotional notes and was extremely likable! (Hartnett rules!). Ewan McGregor is very good here his character was likable and he did a great job overall. Jason Isaacs is fantastic here and added a lot of class to this. Tom Sizemore is always a good actor he was great here and he played a similar role in Saving Private Ryan. Eric Bana was very good here and did what he had to do well. Sam Shepard is excellent as the General. Orlando Bloom was fine in his scenes and the rest of the cast was great!. Overall a must must see! for everyone see it now!. one of the best war films there is (possibly the 2nd best). ***** out of 5",10,1,3,15 January 2005
The Hangover Part II," A lazy rehash of the original, without the laughter or fun
","I'm a big fan of the first Hangover. It was hilariously raunchy, but this sequel is the epitome of laziness. Like most movies that are brilliant, they make sequels and somewhat tarnish the impact of the original. There is no passion, and the only purpose this movie serves is to cash in on the original's tremendous success. In many ways, it's the very same movie as the original, only it takes place in Bangkok. I didn't catch myself laughing. I did chuckle a couple times, but that's it. The trio of Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, and Zach Galifianakis is as reliable as ever, but I don't understand the appeal of Ken Jeong. He is so obnoxious, and he's not even funny. Giving him as much screen time as they did was a huge mistake in my view. Final Thoughts: I saw this over a year ago, and I don't remember much of it for a reason. I've yet to see the third sequel, but I am not looking forward to it, if it's as lazy as this one4.7/10",4,1,1,30 September 2013
Rudy," Surprisingly a terrific film that's very inspirational *Spoilers*
","Surprisingly a terrific film that's very inspirational. My sister wanted me to see this movie badly so she lent her VHS copy to me, and i didn't really want to see it since i am not usually into these kinds of movies, but how could i refuse so i decided to put in the VCR and give it a watch as i was expecting the worst, but what i got was a VERY enjoyable flick that moved me with it's great storytelling. There isn't actually that much football action , it works more on character development. The direction was EXCELLENT! David Anspaugh did a wonderful job here, with great shots of the crowd very cool shots of the football action, and moving it along at a perfect pace. I found the players protesting and putting there jersey's on the Coach's desk protesting not to play in the game unless Rudy does very cool. The acting is Possibly Oscar Worthy. Sean Astin who i normally can't stand gives an Oscar worthy performance here, he is this film and he Carey's it on his back an OUTSTANDING just OUTSTANDING performance here, he is so incredibly likable too!, Way to go Sean!!!!!!!!!!. Joe Faverau was great as Rudy's best friend i liked him. Ned Beatty did good as Rudy's father but didn't have to do much. Charles Dutton was AWESOME here and he is a kick ass actor! and i loved every minute he was on screen!. Scott Benjaminson was very good as the selfish jealous brother. and Christopher Reed did great here in his short role and i was pretty sad when his character died!. Overall a Must see for everyone! ****1/2 out of 5",9,1,2,30 December 2004
Prisoners," A dark and brooding thriller you won't forget
","During a get together with their friends, Nancy & Franklin Birch, Anna Dover and Joy Birch are kidnapped by an unknown culprit. Detective Loki arrests a prime suspect, Alex Jones. The despondent Keller Dover decides to take matters into his own hands when Jones is released by using physical, torturous tactics on Alex Jones. Keller starts to go over the edge, almost on the brink of insanity to try to get the two little girls back. This isn't your Mother's thriller, that's for sure, in fact, I was shocked when I found out this was a bit of a box office hit. The subject matter is absolutely gruesome. This one requires you to put your thinking cap on and leave all distractions aside. This is really tough to watch. The atmosphere is very grim, not to mention it's raining all the time, which adds to grim mood. It has an ominous score that chilled me to the bone. It took me about 45 minutes for me to fully get into this one, but that isn't a bad thing at all. It is very patient with its approach and I dug that. It is carefully thought out with torture sequences that will make even the strongest people flinch. I couldn't even fathom the pain of losing a child, or to have one disappear on you. There is not a pain the world that compares to losing a child when you're a parent. I'm not a parent, but even I know that. If you're a parent, this movie will hit very close to home, perhaps in a very uncomfortable way. The performances are amazing and I bet they were emotionally exhausted. Hugh Jackman is absolutely riveting. He is full of raw emotion. I loved how he was able and willing to throw his morals out the window and do whatever it took to find his daughter. His methods were totally understandable, if not exactly likable. If I was a father, I would do the same thing Keller did. This is Jackman's finest hour. He'll always be Wolverine to me, but the man is incredibly gifted. What a memorable show by him! Jake Gyllenhall is terrific as Detective Loki. He was on top of things the whole time and I loved his performance. Terrance Howard is very good, as is Viola Davis. I gotta mention Paul Dano's performance as a twisted, yet complex person. I hated him and felt for him at the same time. Melissa Leo steals every scene she's in, especially near the end. Maria Bello was excellent as the grieving mother. I suspect the ending will have people split 50/50Final Thoughts: I would have trimmed it just a tad, but this movie affected me in a big way. It's frightening, disturbing, engrossing, and thought-provoking. It is one of the best films of 20138.7/10",8,1,2,5 February 2014
Avengers: Age of Ultron," One of the best sequels ever made!
","Most people went to the theaters to see The Avengers. I was one of the few people who waited for DVD. There was so much hype surrounding it, I wanted to wait a little while. It was one of the silliest things I've ever done, because the first movie lived up the hype in a big way. This time around, I didn't make the same mistake. I went to the theater and I'm so glad I did. Joss Whedon did a phenomenal job of getting everything to work almost perfectly in the first movie. How could you possibly top it? He had a daunting task on his hands to say the least. The biggest mistake you can do with a sequel is trying to make it bigger and badder. It often becomes overblown and disappointing. The best thing you can do is do what made the first one so successful and simplify it. This movie is darker than The Avengers. They have more to lose this time around. Their fears are exploited and I felt it made for some riveting storytelling. It's also filled with some wonderful humor that made me laugh out loud on several occasions. Last but not least, the mind-blowing action! I was blown away by the action scenes in the first movie, but I think they outdid themselves here. It provides countless thrills and even some sadness. The performances are top- notch. Downey Jr is fantastic as usual. His portrayal of Tony Stark/Iron Man was a lot of fun to watch. Hemsworth is tremendous as Thor. Chris Evans shines as Captain America. Jeremy Renner is a lot of fun. There is a nice twist to his character that added more drama and emotion to his character. Scarlett Johansson is very good. Her romance with Banner could have been awkward, but they make it work. Ruffalo is solid as The Hulk once again. James Spader is awesome as Ultron. His cynical outlook on life was not only frightening, but it had merit to it as well. Bettany's Vision character isn't explored enough for my liking. They did enough to keep me intrigued to see where his character will go next. The newcomers Taylor-Johnson & Olsen are fantastic. As much as I enjoyed Johnson, it was Olsen who made the biggest impression on me. Her skill is a terrifying one and seeing her transition from bad to good was very well done. It's hard not to fall in love with Scarlett Witch. Jackson doesn't have as much screen time here. He was entertaining though. Age of Ultron is almost as good as The Avengers. Considering how much I detest a lot of sequels, that's a huge compliment. Everything flows together beautifully and I don't have many complaints. Prepare to be wowed!9.8/10",9,4,13,12 May 2015
Into the Wild," One of the most incredible films you'll ever see. It will leave you thinking for a while
","Chris McCandless is an ambitious young man who has just graduated from university. He is bored of civilization, his parents, and his current life in general. He decides to unload his life savings to charity, leave all his belongings aside to go on a journey into the wilderness. He leaves his Yellow Datsun behind so nobody can find him, deciding to go on this journey penniless. Despite frantic concerns and heartbreak from his family, Chris elects not to speak to them during his journey. He encounters different types of people who not only change Chris in a profound way but others as well. I'm not trying to over hype this by any means but prepare for plenty of passion in my review. It has been a long time since a movie has moved me like this one. This movie is a triumph of the human spirit, it's about living, sacrifice, new experiences, and how life should be about the simple things. It risks being pretentious at times but it is so adroitly done, it manages to avoid that. I actually saw the first half of this movie a couple of years ago but something popped up and I never got around to finishing it. I think that was a blessing in disguise because I am much more mature as a human being. I'm not sure I would have been able to appreciate the magnitude of this film or the beauty of it. There are so many amazing things in this movie, I don't know where to begin. The story sucked me in right from the outset. The fact that it is based on a true story makes it all the more tantalizing. For over two hours, you get to see many breathtaking sights from the terrific cinematography. It never gets old, trust me. Before I continue further, I'd like to speak a little bit about Christopher McCandless. The man is a very controversial figure. He has had people divided over what he decided to do. I'm one of the people who respect and admire his tenacity, and his unbridled passion. You can say what you want about him being unprepared, I just think he did something we all strive to do at a certain time. We may not have wanted to do exactly what he's done, but I'm sure many, myself included have wanted to leave everything behind and go on a journey with the freedom to live without a care in the world. In my opinion, Chris should have the utmost respect from people. He was a kind-hearted soul that didn't deserve to go so early. I may not have known him personally, but I wish I could have. I truly admire him. The second half is when things get a bit tougher to watch. it was in context with the story, so I accepted it, but I am very uncomfortable with animal killings. I've never agreed with hunting in genera but I accept why people do it. Even though a lot of it was in flashbacks, it was also rough to watch Chris's parents (Played with bravura by William Hurt & Marcia Gay Harden in so much anguish, even if they were partly responsible for Chris's disappointment. I especially felt for Carine (Jena Malone) She was the most genuine person, besides Chris in that family. It really tugs on your heart strings. You would think with the long running time, you might get a bit restless. I didn't. My eyes were glued to the T.V screen. I have to give a special mention to Emile Hirsch for his brave and Oscar worthy performance as Chris McCandless. He hits all of the right notes throughout the movie and gives a flawless performance. I've liked him ever since I saw Girl Next Door, and my respect for him is even bigger. It was a complex character he played and he nailed it. The supporting cast of Catherine Keener, Brian H. Dierker, Vince Vaughn, Hal Holebrook & Kristen Stewart have small but pivotal parts in this movie. I'd say Holebrook & Stewart standout the most out of all of them but they were all great. I can't remember the last time I legitimately cried during a movie, let alone cried. I'm not ashamed to say that I wept at the end of the movie. I stood there staring at the T.V in a lucid state before I gathered myself. I was emotionally exhausted, in a good way. Casual viewers may not get why I loved this movie so much but those that appreciate brilliant work will experience something that they won't forget. Sean Penn has created one of the greatest films I've ever seen. If you've made it this far in the review, drop whatever you're doing and go see it. If you don't get any emotions from watching this movie, go see a shrink. I guarantee it will uplift you in some fashion. Thank you Sean Penn for putting your heart and soul into this movie. 10/10",10,1,4,20 January 2014

Elysium," I thought it was depressing and boring!
","I was really indifferent towards this movie when I saw the trailers for it. I wasn't a big fan of District 9, and this movie didn't seem to be up my alley. I still held out hope that having Matt Damon and Jodie Foster in the movie would mean it would be good. Sadly, this was far from the case. I'm picky on futuristic films! They have a habit of making me disinterested. This movie falls under that category in a big way. I had reasonable expectations for it, and it didn't come close to meeting that. This movie is void of tension for the most part despite trying to make you think otherwise. It tries to be a thinking man's action film, but fails miserably. This movie is nowhere near as deep as it wants you to believe. As a matter of fact, it feels something concocted by Hollywood, and that's not a good thing. It felt glossy and phony from start to finish. Elysium tries to be an effective social commentary. We get the 'rich get richer and the poor stay poor' storyline. I'm getting really tired of the 'The earth is damaged' route that futuristic movies have a tendency to go as well. it was a good idea at first, but now it's overdone. I'll admit that it was impressively bleak, but kinda hollow. Those that love action will be pretty disappointed. I was pretty bored by everything going on, and I can't recall one action scene that stood out. The only thing semi-entertaining was the fight scene in the finale between Copley & Damon. The acting is above average. Matt Damon is good, don't get me wrong. I felt he became boring when he put on all the machinery. Jodie Foster is terrible here. That breaks my heart to say, because I'm a huge fan of hers. Her accent is awful, and she seems very disinterested. I can't say as I blame her, though. Her part is a throwaway one. Sharlto Copley annoyed the crap out of me. His OTT antics grated my nerves on more than one occasion. He yells too much as well. Alice Braga is pretty, but a bland love interest. Rest of the cast are OK. Poorly developed characters, lack of interest, and pretentiousness really sink this one. This is a really dull experience and I don't understand how this movie has such a respectable rating. I wouldn't call it horrible, but it's a below average film that doesn't offer much.5.3/10",5,1,2,19 February 2015
Alice in Wonderland," Great visually, but as Burton pulls often, a bit too dark
","(Credit IMDb) Alice, an unpretentious and individual 19-year-old, is betrothed to a dunce of an English nobleman. At her engagement party, she escapes the crowd to consider whether to go through with the marriage and falls down a hole in the garden after spotting an unusual rabbit. Arriving in a strange and surreal place called 'Underland,' she finds herself in a world that resembles the nightmares she had as a child, filled with talking animals, villainous queens and knights, and frumious bander snatches. Alice realizes that she is there for a reason--to conquer the horrific Jabberwocky and restore the rightful queen to her throne.Not being a big fan of the animated original, I was actually dreading the release of this. Johnny Depp is a favorite of mine, but I had no interest in the movie. To my surprise it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be, and at times I enjoyed it. But aside from Edward Scissorhands, Tim Burton often makes his movies much too dark for my liking. Alice in Wonderland is no different. It's very violent, and has some scenes that would definitely not be suited for kid watching. I enjoyed the performances very much though, and it's certainly better than the overrated animated original.Performances. Johnny Depp is fantastic as The Mad Hatter. He's wonderfully kooky, and I loved every moment he was on screen. He continues to amaze me was his incredible versatility. Mia Wasikowska is impressive in her role. She's easy on the eyes, and portrays a very likable character. Helena Bonham Carter is great as The Red Queen. She's wickedly sinister in every sense of the word, and obviously had a blast playing the role. Anne Hathaway is absolutely gorgeous, and did very well in her role. The people who performed the voices all did great work.Bottom line. A bit too dark to be fully successful, but it wasn't too shabby at all. It definitely had its enjoyable moments, and I don't regret watching it. Worth the watch, especially if you love the original. As I have emphatically stated, I didn't.6/10",6,0,1,17 December 2010
The Mummy Returns," A Great Follow Up To The Mummy!, With Plenty Of Exciting Action And Fantastic Performances Once Again!
","This is a great follow up to the Mummy!, with plenty of exciting action and wonderful performances once again!. All the characters are great!, and the story is really cool as well, Plus while it can't match The Mummy it's still top notch for a sequel. I thought the special effects were cool even though the CGI was extremely obvious and the final was especially awesome, plus Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz had very good chemistry together once more. It had some awesome villains in Imhotep(Vosloo),Lock-Nah(Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) and Patricia Velasquez(Anck Su Namun), and all the characters were really likable!, plus Freddie Boath is surprisingly good as the young Alex and didn't annoy me at all. Yes it's weak script wise, but come on!, it's still really enjoyable if you put your brain in check!, plus there are a couple of great emotional moments in the film as well, especially at the end involving Imhotep!.The set pieces and setting are both great!,a nd there is some great humor thrown in just like the 1st as well!, plus I loved the opening narration and all the flashbacks of The Scorpion King and Anck Su Namun,Princess Nefertiri!. This is a great follow up to the mummy!, with plenty of exciting action and fantastic performances once again, I highly recommend this one!. The Direction is very good!. Stephen Sommers does a very good! job here with great camera work, cool visuals, good angles and lots of other cool shots as well, plus he kept the film at a very fast pace!. The Acting is awesome. Brendan Fraser is wonderful here once again, he had all of the assets as he did in the 1st,, had very good chemistry with Rachel Weisz, had some cool lines,and kicked that ass! (Fraser Rules!!).Rachel Weisz is gorgeous and does excellent here once more, while she didn't have as much to do, she still did an excellent job, and held her own opposite Fraser yet again!, they are two of the reasons why these Mummy movies are so enjoyable. John Hannah is hilarious once again, and cracked me up throughout and brought great comic relief. Arnold Vosloo is fantastic, only problem is he is not the only clear villain in this so he didn't have as much to do, still he had tons of presence!, i really dug him. Oded Fehr is very good here again i really like his character and he fought very well!.The Rock didn't have to act here in his role, but he rocked anyways!, More of him would have been nice!. (The Rock Rules!!!!!!!). Freddie Boath is surprisingly good as The kid, and didn't annoy me in fact he was rather likable!.Patricia Velasquez is hot and did well as both of her characters!.Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje is very good, he is funny and also had quite a presence. Shaun Parkes is funny as Izzy i liked him. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall i highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5",8,2,3,13 December 2005
Avatar," I wouldn't say it's worthy of being the most money making movie of all time, but it looks amazing and it's over two hours of great entertainment
","Avatar's hype was amazing, so amazing I almost viewed it in 3D at the IMAX here where I live, but I held off of it and decided to view it on DVD. Avatar's effects are a sight to behold, even in regularity, and the action especially near the end is some of the coolest stuff I've personally ever witnessed, but the story is quite weak a lot of the time. Avatar's love story is quite ordinary, the only thing that stands out about it is due to the storyline behind it, otherwise it's nothing really new. I ended up enjoying my time when all was said and done, but it really did lag at certain points in the 1st half, before picking up heavily in the 2nd. Some of the dialog itself was questionable and rather wooden as well, but the characters are cool enough to get past it. People say this is James Cameron's best work, and while it's a great technical achievement and some good entertainment, it's far from his best work, and not worthy to surpass Titanic in my opinion.Performances. Sam Worthington is very charming and likable as Jake Sully, but some of the dialog he had to spurt out was cringe inducing. His charisma and character are great though. Sigourney Weaver steals the show in my opinion with her hoot of a show. her no bullsh*t approach was great!|Loved the Ranger Rick shot she took at Miles|. Zoe Saldana is good, but her character wasn't well-developed. Stephen Lang is bad ass a lot of the time, but once in a while he got on my nerves.Bottom line. It was an entertaining blockbuster, nothing more, nothing less. It's not worthy of being the most money-making machine in cinema industry, but I enjoyed my time with it. I think the experience is even better in 3D, but the people who haven't checked it out, ignore the hype and sit back and enjoy the show.8/10",8,1,2,13 June 2010
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," I'm glad this series is done.
","(Credit IMDb) After the birth of Renesmee, the Cullens gather other vampire clans in order to protect the child from a false allegation that puts the family in front of the Volturi.I'm not a Twilight hater. I enjoy the first three to a certain extent, even gave Breaking Dawn-Part 1 a lot of credit for being as audacious as it was. I've just grown tired of all the hype, the fan girls, and everything else. This one was rather middling in all honesty. For a final film in this series, it was rather pedestrian. As much as I love Kristen Stewart as an actress, I had a lot of trouble with some of the things she does in this movie. She's a vampire now and it should have been more exciting than it was, especially with all the circumstances surrounding it. It does have one great scene with Billy Burke, aka Charlie Swan and Bella, which is quite emotional. Overall, I just didn't care for it. 5/10",5,6,13,3 February 2014
There's Something About Mary," Awesome Comedy, that's very funny, and really quite clever, with an excellent story, and fun performances all around!
","This is an awesome Comedy, that's very funny, and really quite clever,with an excellent story, and fun performances all around!. All the characters are awesome, and it really has some great Black Comedy in it as well, plus Cameron Diaz, Ben Stiller and Matt Dillon are all simply amazing in this!. This is a hugely popular film, and rightfully so as it deserve it's rating, and I thought Diaz and Stiller had excellent chemistry together, plus the opening flash back of Stiller's high school days, and the franks and the beans(You'll know what I mean, once you see it) is a scream!. Diaz is really irresistible in this literally, and it has a a few great gross out gags as well, plus it's extremely well made and written as well!. I loved the ending too as that was especially clever, and it was cool to see Brett Favre in a film! plus Matt Dillon steals a lot of the scenes here. The scene with Dillon and Puppy(I think)(the dog), will have you in tears, and Chris Elliot is actually funny here, plus it's extremely creative as well. This is an awesome Comedy, that's very funny, and really quite clever, with an excellent story, and fun performances, and I say it's a must see!. The Direction is awesome!. The Farrelly brothers do an awesome! job here with fantastic camera work, good angles, and just keeping the film hilarious and at very fast pace. The Acting is lots of fun!. Cameron Diaz is amazing as always and is amazing here, she is incredibly gorgeous,extremely likable, hilarious, had excellent chemistry with Ben Stiller, was utterly charming and irresistible, gives one of her best performances, and played one fantastic character! (Diaz Rules!!!!!!!). Ben Stiller is also amazing as always and is amazing here, he is hilarious, extremely likable, looked hilarious with that hair and braces at the beginning, had me in stitches a lot of the time, and just did an amazing job, he is a master at this type of stuff! (Stiller Rules!!!!). Matt Dillon is amazing here too, as he steals a lot of the scenes, with his witty and sly performance as a sleaze ball, he was just fantastic, I loved him!. Lee Evans is good here, and was really funny as both Tucker and Norm, I dig this guy a lot. Chris Elliott is surprisingly very funny and effective here normally he irritates the crap out of me but he did good here, he was especially hilarious looking with all those hives on his face. Keith David is hilarious in his scene as the stepfather, I loved him, this guy is seriously underrated. W. Earl Brown plays the brother with the disability extremely convincingly he was funny. Lin Shaye is hilarious as Magda, and looked hideous!. Rest of the cast are fine. Overall a must see!. **** out of 5",9,0,1,16 March 2006
Invictus," Not exactly historically accurate. But it made for an engrossing and interesting watch.
","Invictus is a movie I avoided for a while due to the uninteresting subject matter that was at hand for me. I am well aware of Nelson Mandella's accomplishments, and what he did, but in reality he didn't interest me all that much. Rugby is also a sport I detest because I get bored easily from it. Invictus surprised me by keeping me involved with its story, and despite the long running time, I was never bored during any of it. Invictus deserves praise for giving us a very good story, but it is Matt Damon and Morgan Freeman who deserve real kudos. Morgan Freeman's mannerisms and impersonation of Nelson was simply uncanny, and I really felt he pulled it off beautifully. Clint Eastwood's direction is also on the ball as usual. He directs with a certain flair and tenacity during the Rugby scenes. Nothing overly intense, but very effective and impressive for my liking. The only thing that bothered me was that despite the feel-good ending, the rugby team did NOT win that way.Performances. Morgan Freeman is brilliant as Mandella. He has mannerisms down to a T, and I truly felt he WAS Nelson Mandella. Is he Oscar worthy? Not quite, but he is still very, very good. Matt Damon is equally as impressive as Francois. His accent is a bit inconsistent, but I admired his intensity and all business attitude. He was engrossing to watch.Bottom line. Invictus isn't the Oscar epic it so desperately wanted to be. However it is still an interesting movie that I recommend quite highly.8/10",8,0,1,6 September 2010
Mission: Impossible," As good as a spy thriller can get,a real thrill ride to say the least!.
","Mission Impossible was a film that I initially didn't care for,during my 1st few viewings. But the latest viewing,it seems I finally got it. Mission Impossible is a film that you have to pay strict attention too,otherwise you will eventually get lost,as it's a very confusing film. It isn't action packed like the sequels are,it's more of a mystery type thriller,but it has plenty of suspense,plenty of surprises,with an explosive finale that will have you on the edge of your seat!. I especially liked the train sequence at the end,it was very well done. I thought the casting of Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt was a bit strange at 1st. Now I am a huge Cruise fan,but he just didn't seem like the Action hero type. He proved me wrong big time,and did what he did best,put on a captivating show,his charisma is a big reason this film worked. The big twist at the end is shocking to say the least. Some would say it didn't make much sense,I personally thought it was a nice touch,because the film needed to end with a big bang,and I thought it did just that!.Mission Impossible isn't as flashy or action packed as the sequels,but as far as i'm concerned it may very well be the best in the series.Performances. Tom Cruise has proved to be one of Hollywood's most charismatic and reliable actors for what seems like forever. Here he does not disappoint. He makes a great Ethah Hunt,he's witty,he oozes charisma,adding the perfect balance of charm&likability to Ethan. He handles himself well in the action scenes too,as I said he was a big reason in making this film work,with his undeniable charisma. Jon Voight is a hell of a presence. He always adds class and excellent acting to any film he's in,here was no different. Emmanuelle Béart is certainly a beauty,but she can also act pretty good too. She was highly mysterious,it kept her character unpredictable. Henry Czerny is full of intensity. His banter with Cruise in the restaurant was chilling stuff,I loved the guy!. Jean Reno is OK here. He is a capable actor,but I didn't much care for him in this. Ving Rhames is a pure bad ass,and while his role isn't as big as in the next two,he still came through. Rest of the cast do fine.Bottom Line. Mission Impossible is an excellent spy thriller. It's exciting,suspenseful and downright unpredictable. Highly recommend,if you choose to accept this Mission.8 1/2 /10",8,9,10,25 December 2009
Saw," The original and without a doubt the best. Saw is a magnificent thriller that will get your pulse rate up, but quick!
","Saw may be undervalued to some due to the endless sequels coming out now a days, but the fact remains this one is the best thriller since Se7ven. It wasn't just about gore and torture here, it had a lot of plot to it, a lot of detail and the suspense was liable to push your pulse rate, right past the danger zone. They didn't just throw characters in their, forcing you to hate them because of there unlikable ways, this gave you two characters who have done dirty deeds, but remained likable. It's so surreal that a disturbing concept of having having people trapped in an ugly room became such a huge hit among Horror fans and now there is one out every Halloween, but I really feel the abandoned bathroom one they used here is the best. The finale itself is one of the best I have ever seen in a thriller. I've seen this now officially three times, and each time the suspense is at times unbearable, and it's rare that I feel that way with the genre now a days.Performances. Cary Elwes is sort of despicable in a way, but somehow he injects likability into his part. His intentions are not admirable, but he obviously cares about his family and I admired that. Leigh Whannell is a bit of a whining weasel as Adam, but he somehow remains likable and sympathetic with his character, which is quite an impressive feat. Tobin Bell's part is nowhere near as big as it would become in the sequels, but it's still felt. Danny Glover gives one of the best performance of his career here. Due to the success of his role as Murtaugh in the Lethal Weapon films, a lot of people didn't think he was capable of a gritty cop role, boy did he prove them wrong. Shawnee Smith does fine with what she has to do, but her part isn't as well-known as it would become.Bottom line. It's the original, it's the best, and it's one of my favorite Thrillers. If you ignore all the hype come Halloween, rent this around Halloween time, it's bound to give you the thrills.10/10",10,0,2,29 May 2010
Mama," Certainly watchable and suspenseful at times, but it is pretty routine stuff
","(Credit IMDb) Annabel and Lucas are faced with the challenge of raising his young nieces that were left alone in the forest for 5 years.... but how alone were they?For some reason, I was dreading this when it was first announced. The title sounded so stupid to me and it seemed like just another horror movie to make some quick cash and disappoint me, like so many Horror movies do these days. It wasn't anywhere near as bad as I thought. It has some decent boo scares and the potential was there for this to be a standout horror film, but sadly it didn't meet that potential. The 'Mama' creature is fairly well done and somewhat eerie. The opening is by far the best thing about this film. It involves the wonderfully talented Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau. It is tense, disturbing, and very riveting. After that whole ordeal is through, it never manages to reach those heights again. Jessica Chastain's character created a big problem with me. Her character is virtually unlikable for the first half of the film before she starts coming around. Her abrasiveness was extremely hard for me to warm up to. She did fine with what she was given, but I would have preferred her to be more sympathetic. It's a watchable horror film that has it's moments. For the dreaded 'PG' rating, you could do a lot worse.6.1/10",6,2,3,8 February 2014
The Last Samurai," A truly powerful film in my opinion, as I learned a lot about The Samurai, Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe are phenomenal here!!
","This is a truly powerful film in my opinion, as I learned a lot about The Samurai, Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe are phenomenal here!!. All the characters are fantastic, and the story is extremely engrossing and quite gripping, plus Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe are simply incredible in this!. It's extremely well made and written, and It also has so many incredibly exciting battle sequences as well,plus I also loved the setting too. It gets extremely violent near the end, and I thought Cruise had some incredibly powerful and moving scenes with Watanabe, plus he had excellent chemistry with him too. I was really impressed with Cruise's fighting skills, and his passion for The Samurai that he obviously had, and The ending was so emotional that it almost had me bursting into tears, plus even at 150 minutes it was never over long for me. To be honest I didn't think this would be my type of film as I only rented because I'm a huge fan of Cruise, boy was I wrong and This should be in the top 250 in my opinion, plus a lot of this was Watanabe's show!.All the characters are extremely likable for the most part, and you are able to care and root for Cruise's and Watanabe because They're so likable, and passionate about the same thing, plus Masato Harada is brilliant as the evil Omura, I absolutely hated him, and sure you will too. This was Ken Watanabe's 1st role in an American film, and I'm absolutely positive, he could think of nothing better with the work he did in this masterpiece, and the sword fighting was extremely well choreographed, plus I would put this performance of Cruise's up there with one of his best!. Cruise and Watanabe are the main reason why this movie is so incredibly good in my opinion,and everyone was perfectly casted as well, plus the cinematography was absolutely beautiful!. This truly a powerful film in my opinion, as I learned a lot about The Samurai, Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe are phenomenal here, and if you Haven't seen this,please do so immediately, you shouldn't regret it even if you are not really interested about learning about The Samurai.The Direction is fabulous!. Edward Zwick does a fabulous! job here with amazing camera work, fantastic angles, using a beautiful setting, and lots of other cool shots as well, plus he kept the film at an extremely engrossing pace.The Acting is stunning!. Tom Cruise is amazing as always and is incredible here, He really shocked me with his passion about The Samurai, and also proved his incredible versatility, his sword&fighting skills, were also very impressive, and some of his scenes with Watanabe are some of the most powerful I have ever seen, he can add another top notch performance to his resume with this one, he was truly incredible! (Cruise Rules!!!!!!!!!!). Ken Watanabe is incredible here, he gives us a performance that we will never ever forget, he was just so powerful and had an amazing presence, he was also very intense, and so passionate about his role, his performance really moved me, for a lot of the film this was his show, I can't wait to see more of this guy!. Masato Harada is brilliant as Omura, I hated him with a passion, he was so unlikable, and I hated him for what he did, and sure you will too. Tony Goldwyn and William Atherton do fine in there roles. Rest of the cast are fine. Overall if you Haven't seen this please do so immediately you shouldn't regret it!. ***** out of 5",10,0,2,1 May 2006
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Inferior to the original product that precedes it. It does have moments that are great, but it's too long and bloated
","The whole gang returns for this sequel. Kevin is at odds with his family once again come Christmas time, and makes the same mistake he did in the first movie. Wishing his family would go away, once more. Kevin gets his wish, when he stops to look for batteries in his Dad's bag for his tape recorder at the airport. He boards the wrong plane, and is stranded all alone in New York for Christmas. Unfortunately, the Wet Bandits have escaped from Prison, and are in New York as well.The first Home Alone is one of my favorite movies. (I will review it one of these days!) I even own this movie, despite having issues with it. It's still a fairly entertaining film, but I just felt they tried to outdo the first film with a bigger setting, and more violent gags. New York is a huge place, and I'm sure they thought this would be ever better than the original when they thought of it. It doesn't work in the long run, and it doesn't have the genuine feel of the first film. It feels like most sequels, a cash maker. It's also somewhat of a rehash of the original. The Pigeon Lady (Brenda Fricker) is essentially the same as Marley the enigmatic neighbor (Roberts Blossom) who befriends Kevin in need, and gets him out of jams. It wasn't nearly as special as the bond Kevin & Marley had. The Wet Bandits (Brilliantly played by Joe Pesci & Daniel Stern) make the same mistakes they did in the original with Kevin, by falling for the same traps. You'd have thought they might have learned a bit after the first one The violence is cartoonish in the original, but it didn't bother me. It's one of the many things I loved in the original, but here it borders on overkill. Onto the positive side of things, Macaulay Culkin is once again hilarious as Kevin. He is a main reason as to why I enjoy this movie. The Plaza Hotel crew is a scream. Tim Curry, Rob Schneider & Dana Ivey are all very funny. Look out for cameos from Ally Sheedy & Donald Trump as well.Final Thoughts: Bigger, doesn't necessarily mean better. As disappointing as it is, I do enjoy this movie to an extent, but it's nowhere near the original's class. There are many things to enjoy about this movie, but just don't expect the original. 6.4/10",6,0,1,29 September 2013

Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis had wonderful chemistry together,plus, it was really different from the original, which was good. The dialog is quite engaging, and you really feel for the characters especially Goldblum's. The Direction is awesome!. David Cronenberg, does an awesome job here, keeping a grim, depressing mood throughout, with lots of nifty camera work, loved the scenes, with Goldblum as a fly on the ceiling,it was also quite stylish and overall he did an excellent job!. There is TONS of gore!. We get a monkey turned inside out(very gory), TONS of nasty decomposing flesh, nasty broken wrist,nasty fingernail removing, an ear falls off, TONS of nasty acid puking, bloody child birth, melted off hand, melted off foot, a face is completely ripped off, a body falls apart (EXTREMELY gory), exploding head,and some nasty fly effects, gore hounds will love it!. The Acting is Terrific!. Jeff Goldblum is Marvelous here, he had wonderful chemistry with, Geena Davis, was very likable, and managed to creep the hell out of me near the end, i also felt sorry for his character, he did a wonderful job!. Geena Davis is beautiful, and does excellent here, her chemistry with Goldblum is wonderful, she is vulnerable, and gave a terrific performance!. John Getz, is good as the asshole, i hated him!.

From Hell," Atmospheric, but overlong and boring take on Jack The Ripper.
","From Hell has all the potential in the world to be a great, grimmy version of Jack The Ripper, but it falls heavily short of that potential for one reason, It's to dull for it's own good. I don't mind slow and methodical films, but everything just seemed dull in my opinion, with only Johnny Depp's performance being the only salvation to this movie. It's also very cruel spirited as well. Johnny Depp's inspector character is quite charismatic, but a bit too full of himself at times, the treatment of woman is disgusting, and it's just very, very depressing looking as well. The streets of London have the perfect looking atmosphere, the set pieces are terrific, it's great visually, but I was just too bored to care.Performances. Johnny Depp is his usual charismatic self, but suffers from an overly cocky character, and his chemistry with Heather Graham isn't that great. Heather Graham is beautiful but I didn't care much for her character. Ian Holm's intense performance is great, while Robbie Coltrane does good work as The Sergeant.Bottom line. It's atmospheric, well acted for the most part, and it looks great, but it's just too dull. You might wanna use the skip button for the DVD to fast forward, because it is very talky. Some will ultimately disagree with me and love the style, but I did not.4/10",4,0,1,15 May 2010

But this is one of the best movies of the year and it's action packed!. with lots of great effects especially the treasure scenes. There is some incredible camera work in this, Great view of the endless black pit great closeups of the scenery the cool angles, and it had a VERY good pace.Great job by John Turteltaub. The story was awesome and very engrossing, and the finale was very exciting. No gore none. The acting is terrific. Nicolas Cage is wonderful in the lead role he's one of the best actors out there and his chemistry with Diane Kruger was so on!, he is funny and extremely likable. Diane Kruger is GORGEOUS! and does very well here, she gave a great performance had awesome chemistry with Cage and was very likable too boot, plus she was easy on the eyes. Justin Bartha is just downright hilarious as the comic relief and cracked me up this guy rocks!. Sean Bean is fantastic as the main villain although he can do this role in his sleep he still was great and was VERY menacing as the main villain. Jon Voight is great here and added a lot of class to this. Harvey Keitel was excellent here with what he has to do. Christopher Plummer was only on screen for about 5 minutes when he tells the story near the beginning. Overall a MUST SEE go see this in theaters now! ***** out of 5",10,1,3,23 December 2004
Reservoir Dogs," A true Tarantino classic WARNING!!!!!! SPOILERS!!!!
","A True classic that deserves the hype it gets. However i did like Kill Bill 1 and 2 a bit better. It can be very grisly , harsh and very violent at times with the vulgar language and the police torture scenes. but it's well worth it. All the characters were fantastic especially Mr. Blonde and Mr. White. However there is one character i really hated (and also hate the actor) but more on that later. this is brilliantly directed by Quentin Tarantino , it's fast paced and stylish with lots of of cool shots. The story is engrossing and fascinating with a knockout ending. Only thing i didn't care for was the constant vulgar language (although it wasn't all that bad). There is plenty of harsh violence we get LOTS of EXTREMELY bloody gunshot wounds a policeman getting tortured Mr Orange's character is covered in blood throughout the running time , a cut off ear a harsh bloody beating, and a few more bloody gunshot wounds. The Acting is AMAZING. Harvey Keitel gives an Oscar worthy performance he is one of the best actors out there and deserves more credit and he gave an amazing show here. Tim Roth was excellent here and i liked his character a lot and enjoyed seeing his story. Michael Madsen's character is crazy but AWESOME! and as sadistic as it sounds he cracked me up. Steve Buscemi's character is annoying and funny at the same time. Chris Penn annoyed the crap out of me and his character was extremely annoying and i just wanted him to shut his yap!. Lawrence Tierney adds class and does fine here. Quentin Tarantino shows up for a very short time. Overall See This NOW! ***** out of 5",Null,0,1,3 December 2004
How to Train Your Dragon," I wouldn't call it top 250 worthy, but it certainly does the job as a cute, family orientated movie.
","(Credit IMDb) Long ago up North on the Island of Berk, the young Viking, Hiccup, wants to join his town's fight against the dragons that continually raid their town. However, his macho father and village leader, Stoik the Vast, will not allow his small, clumsy, but inventive son to do so. Regardless, Hiccup ventures out into battle and downs a mysterious Night Fury dragon with his invention, but can't bring himself to kill it. Instead, Hiccup and the dragon, whom he dubs Toothless, begin a friendship that would open up both their worlds as the observant boy learns that his people have misjudged the species. But even as the two each take flight in their own way, they find that they must fight the destructive ignorance plaguing their worldHow to Train Your Dragon was a cute Animated movie, and considering the fact I'm picky on animated movies, that is a big compliment. However, how on earth did this get into the top 250? It's like Toy Story 3, clearly inferior to the first two, yet it gets voted in. Criticism aside, I really liked the story in this one. For starters, the name 'Hiccup' for a lead is ingenious, and Baruchel performs the voice well. The relationship with the Dragon is what obviously makes the movie though. It's cute, believable, and a good story for the kids to get into. Also thought the ending was heart-felt, and well told. It's enjoyable as a movie viewing experience, but it's not as good as people like you to believe it is, in my opinion.Bottom line. I enjoyed this, I really did. It's cute, harmless, and it passed the time perfectly. Who knows, if more enjoyable ones come out like this is the animated genre, I might just get back into them like I used too. Don't expect a masterpiece, and you'll have a good time. Recommended 7/10",7,5,13,24 January 2011
Eyes Wide Shut," An unforgettable, haunting, thought provoking masterpiece from Stanley Kubrick, with a mesmerizing story and incredible performances!
","This is an unforgettable, haunting, thought provoking masterpiece from Stanley Kubrick, with a mesmerizing story, and incredible performances!. All the characters are wonderful, and even at 159 minutes I wanted more, plus Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are simply incredible in this, and have amazing chemistry together!. You must pay strict attention in this one, otherwise you will be lost, and it's one of the most unpredictable films I have ever seen, plus it's full of twists and turns as well. I can see why it's controversial however it's seriously one of the most amazing films I have ever seen, and quite possibly the best Kubrick film I have seen as well (only competition, The Shining and Clockwork Orange), plus it's brilliantly made and written. Yes it has tons of sex and nudity, but it's a hell of a lot more then just that, as it may take one of two more viewings before it really sinks in, plus all the characters are extremely likable. It's also incredibly creepy as well, and the score is one of the best I have heard, plus the ending was just great.We are able to totally care for Cruise's character here, as we feel his pain, and yes even the jealousy, and the same goes for Kidman as well, even though I didn't like what she told Tom about her sexual fantasies, plus some of the creepiest parts in the movie, came at that weird party, with all the guys in hoods and masks, it really Creeped me out. Also the scene where that guy is following Tom across the street, was really suspenseful and well done, and I personally believe this should be in the top 250 in my opinion, plus This was an incredible way for Kubrick to go out in my opinion, as he may have given us his best film!. This film will not be for everybody, as it's an acquired taste, and it has some great atmosphere in it as well, plus even though I didn't know what the hell was going on at times, I was still extremely engrossed by it all!.It would have been even more wicked it they released it as NC 17 or even X, and the scene with Cruise and Sydney Pollack near the end, is quite confusing, but absolutely shocking! plus the scene near the end where Cruise breaks down in front Of Kidman and confesses is very powerful and moving. This is one of the most unique films around, and filled with lots of wonderful bizarre stuff, plus it may get under your skin (but in a good way) at times too!. It's rather disturbing at times too, and some scenes seriously took my breath away, plus the ending gives you an important message as well. This is an unforgettable, haunting, thought provoking masterpiece from Stanley Kubrick, with a mesmerizing story and incredible performances, and if you haven't seen it please do so immediately, although it may not be for everyone.The Direction is incredible as always from Stanley Kubrick!. Stanley Kubrick does an incredible job here, with outstanding camera work,amazing angles, giving the film lots of creepy atmosphere,and leaving us with a sense of dread, panic and making the viewer feeling uncomfortable (in a good way), plus he kept the film at an extremely engrossing pace.The Acting is incredible!. Tom Cruise is amazing as always and is incredible here, he is extremely likable, a jealous and somewhat tortured man, and we feel for him, are able to care for him, a lot of people complained he walked around too much with a smirk om his face but that's his style and it fit in with this film well, he also had wonderful chemistry with Nicole Kidman, had a very powerful scene near the end, he also played a real convincing Doctor, a powerful performance indeed, up there with one of his best. (Cruise Rules!!!!!!!!!!). Nicole Kidman is also amazing as always and is incredible here, she is incredibly gorgeous, extremely sexy, had fantastic chemistry with Cruise, had a very likable character, even though she intentionally made Cruise's character jealous, she was just important to the film as Cruise was she was incredible! (Kidman Rules!!!!!!). Sydney Pollack is excellent in his role here he added lots of class, and was simply delightful, I loved him!. Vinessa Shaw has a small but memorable role as the hooker Domino, she is incredibly gorgeous and played her part very well. Leelee Sobieski has a very small part as Milich's Daughter and did OK I guess. Rest of the cast do fine.Overall if you haven't seen it please do so immediately, although it may not be for everybody. ***** out of 5",10,1,3,14 March 2006
Inside Man," Excellent Heist flick, that's really entertaining and quite powerful, with a top notch story and amazing performances! *minor spoilers*
","This is an excellent Heist flick, that's really entertaining and quite powerful, with a top notch story and amazing performances!. All the characters are excellent, and the ending was so clever and very well done, plus Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster are all simply amazing in this!. I am very glad I went to the theater and watched this, however you gotta pay pretty strict attention, because the ending may confuse some people, plus Clive Owen was just so ruthless as the villain, as he was very smart. It's often quite gripping, and Denzel added some great humor to the film as well, plus while I thought the scene where Clive Owen makes everybody undress to there underwear quite shocking and somewhat powerful, it was a little unnecessary. It's extremely well made and nicely written, and while I'm not that familiar with Spike Lee I will definitely be checking out more of his work after this excellent film, plus I wish they gave Jodie Foster more screen time though, because she is one of the best in my opinion. I think everyone should go watch this in the theater, and there are lots of shocking and disturbing moments as well, plus it kept me guessing throughout the film. Christopher Plummer is also excellent in his role, and plays a big part of the film. I also thought the scene where Clive takes all the cellphones, ans this guy tries to lie about his Cell, and says he left it at home, as that was really quite tense, plus I loved the score as well. This is an excellent Hiest flick, that's really entertaining and quite powerful, with a top notch story and amazing performances, and I say it's a must see for everyone!. The Direction is fantastic!. Spike Lee does a fantastic job here with wonderful camera work, really good angles giving the film a great atmosphere, using good settings and keeping the film at a very engrossing pace. The Acting is amazing!. Denzel Washington is amazing as always and is amazing here, he is extremely likable, added some great humor had a few really cool scenes with Clive Owen, played a really cool character,and played a Cop that I would want at my sides at all times, he was one of the main reasons the movie was so enjoyable for me! (Denzel Rules!!!!!!!). Clive Owen is also amazing here, he is simply chilling as the villain,as he was so ruthless but incredibly smart and charismatic, as what he did at the end shocked me, I thought he was amazing! (Clive Rules!!!). Jodie Foster is also amazing as always and is amazing, while she didn't have much screen time she was amazing when on, as she had a really great character,I also loved the scene with her and Clive Owen talking about negotiations in the bank, I just wished she had more screen time. Christopher Plummer is fantastic here, and while he too Doesen't have a whole lot of screen time he was a very important character in this film. Willem Dafoe has a small role as the Capt. and made the most out of it, he was great. Chiwetel Ejiofor is good as Denzel's partner I liked him. Rest of the cast do fine.Overall a must see for everyone!. ****1/2 out of 5",9,4,7,2 April 2006

Jackson,John Travolta,Bruce Willis and Uma Thurman are all simply amazing in this!. The dialog is extremely intelligent and witty, and I thought the whole foot massage story was really funny, plus The opening and ending are both especially awesome. I believe this film deserves to be #9 on the top 250! and my favorite segment has to be the watch with Butch Coolidge (Willis), plus Jackson and Travolta were so awesome together and had brilliant chemistry!. The music is fantastic, and Mia's (Thurman) OD'ing scene is both disturbing and somewhat funny at the same time, plus I thought the character development was outstanding. Ving Rhames is ultra cool in his role, and this is extremely well made and written as well! plus the scene where Mia and Vincent Vega are at the diner is just fascinating!.I remember watching this when I was about 13 or 14, and thinking it was so boring, god how could I have been so stupid!, this is truly what brilliant filmaking is all about, plus all the characters are extremely likable. I personally thought Quentin Tarantino was great in his scene and it is quite violent at times, plus one of my favorite scenes is when Vincent Vega's gun accidentally goes off in the car, as I found that to be a great bit of dark humor in my opinion. Harevy Keitel's scene is a memorable one was The Wolfe, and Uma's ketchup joke was funny, plus it all feels like a Dark comedy to me!. Travolta's joke about how they call the quarter pounder with cheese in Paris was very funny and Samuel L. Jackson had some brilliant lines as well! plus I loved Eric Stolt'z character as well. This is Tarantino's absolute best work, and quite simply one of the best films ever! with brilliant storytelling and incredible performances, and if you haven't seen it, what the hell are you waiting for? do so immediately you won't regret it trust me!.The Direction is masterful.

Samuel L. Jackson is amazing here, he gives quite possibly his best performance, is hilarious, had brilliant chemistry with John Travolta, had some of the coolest lines of all time, really seemed to be enjoying himself, and just gave one of a kind performance, he was amazing (Jackson Rules!!!!). John Travolta is just as good, he rejuvenated his career, with his role here, and rightfully so. his scene with Uma Thurman in the diner, was especially awesome, he also looked damn cool. (Travolta Rules!!!!). Bruce Willis is amazing as always and is amazing here, he played one of his coolest characters, and it was basically an action role, but damn was it a good one!,Butch was my favorite character along with Jules!, he was just perfect for Butch (Willis Rules!!!!!!!). Uma Thurman also gives one of her best performances here, as the drug addicted Mia, she didn't have all that much screen time, but she made it memorable!(Thurman Rules!!!!!). Ving Rhames is excellent here as Marcellus, he was just a bad ass, and had a very cool scene with Willis!. Eric Stoltz cracked me up as Lance, he was one of the funniest characters in the film in my opinion. Christopher Walken had a cool cameo here and was great. Quentin Tarantino is actually really good as Jimmy and was quite funny. Harvey Keitel is awesome as the Wolfe as he cracked me up I loved him. Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer are both awesome as the robbers, and were just great. Rosanna Arquette(Jody) did what she had to do well. Rest of the cast do fine.

The Da Vinci Code," Certainly interesting,and fairly engaging. It's only hindrances are is,it's too talky at points.
","The Da Vinci Code is a film,I expected to dislike,mainly due to my lack of interest in the subject,but to my surprise,despite it's over length,The Da Vinci Code managed to satisfy me for the most part. It's not that I don't believe in god,cause I actually do quite a bit,it's just the whole subject really didn't seem to keen for my interests. The film is very low key for the most part,keeping the action and suspense to a minimum,focusing more on, the plot and dialog. While that isn't necessarily a bad thing,I did however,want them to get on with it a couple of times. The locations are absolutely beautiful,as are the set pieces,it created a nice atmospheric type mood to the film. I had heard how Tom Hanks was miscast as Robert Langdon,and how he played it too straight. I thought he was a key component to this film,he and Audrey Tautou shared chemistry and charisma together. The film itself is quite confusing sometimes,and hard to follow|The twist at the end came out of nowhere for me| but I managed to find The Da Vinci Code,quite the interesting time waster. I don't think it's a film that deserved to make well over 200 Million at the box office,but it was a decent film.Performances. Tom Hanks is one of the best actors of all time in my opinion,but I was a bit worried,due to the criticism of the reviewers. Thankfully to my relief,he came through as always,with his special brand of charm and undeniable charisma. He was the main component to making this film work,he gave a sly show. Audrey Tautou started off rather mediocre,but got better once the film got going. She's classy,with the looks to boot,I enjoyed her performance. Ian McKellen is superb here. You can't take your eyes off of him,whenever he's on screen,not only that,some of his banter with Tom Hanks, are some of the film'best scenes. Jean Reno is pretty good as the bulldog type cop,he did fine with what he had to do. Paul Bettany's performance as Silas,may come across as over the top to some. I however found it to be mesmerizing,and thoroughly creepy at times. Alfred Molina& Jürgen Prochnow have small roles,but as always add some class to it.Bottom Line. The Da Vinci Code isn't something,I'd wanna sit through again,I don't think,but it certainly passed the time amiably. Recommended if your in the mood for a low key,thinking type film.7/10",7,1,4,30 December 2009
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Not to sound cheesy, but the Sorcerer's Stone is absolutely magical!.
","I was not into Harry Potter growing up, the books were forced upon me by my mother, and as a result I refused to read any of them, or have anything to do with the movies. Well last year, I finally decided to give in and have a look at them, and I started with the original, aka this one. This is now my 2nd time viewing it, and I enjoyed it even more than I did the 1st time around. I'm really not into these kinds of movies usually, they just don't interest me, but I was truly surprised by the amount of thrills it provided me with, the laughs and the likable characters it had as well. The trio of Harry, Ron and Hermoine make the perfect hero's for the movie, the movie leans heavily on them and it pays off. The final showdown between Harry and Voldermort had me on the edge of my seat. Just watching Harry go through what he did, with Hermoine and Ron was absolutely amazing. One of my favorite bits had to be the big chess game bit, it was surreal, but thrilling to watch at the same time.Performances. Daniel Radcliffe is very likable as Harry, and does well for a kid his age. He is able to carry the bulk of the film for the most part, like a pro, I was quite impressed. Rupert Grint is good as Ronald. He often had me chuckling with his bumbling magician act. Emma Watson is cute, and shows a lot of poise for her age. She had a unique charisma, that kept me drawn to her. Tom Felton is good as the egotistical kid Draco. John Cleese has a funny cameo as nearly headless Nick. Alan Rickman is great in everything he does, and he is no different here as Snape. Maggie Smith does good as the female professor, I liked her. Robbie Coltrane steals the scenes many times as Hagrid. He's goofy, but in a good way, I loved him. Richard Harris is great as Dumbeldore. He had something magical about him, when he appeared on-screen. Well known faces like John Hurt, Warwick Davis, and Verne Troyer appear as well.Bottom line. The Sorcerer's Stone is purely magical. It's thrilling, exciting and kept me on the edge of my seat. Harry Potter has something for every age, and if you were like me, really iffy about the whole thing, give it a shot!.9/10",9,0,1,2 April 2010
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Probably my least favorite of the series, but it's still engaging entertainment.
","(Credit IMDb)Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts is about to start and he is enjoying the summer vacation with his friends. They get the tickets to The Quidditch World Cup Final but after the match is over, people dressed like Lord Voldemort's 'Death Eaters' set a fire to all the visitors' tents, coupled with the appearance of Voldemort's symbol, the 'Dark Mark' in the sky, which causes a frenzy across the magical community. That same year, Hogwarts is hosting 'The Triwizard Tournament', a magical tournament between three well-known schools of magic : Hogwarts, Beauxbatons and Durmstrang. The contestants have to be above the age of 17, and are chosen by a magical object called Goblet of Fire. On the night of selection, however, the Goblet spews out four names instead of the usual three, with Harry unwittingly being selected as the Fourth Champion. Since the magic cannot be reversed, Harry is forced to go with it and brave three exceedingly difficult tasks.The Goblet of Fire remains the weakest of the series in my opinion, but that doesn't mean it's a bad film, in fact it's a very good one. There is still plenty of excitement, and action scenes that took my breath away, there was just something about it that felt off to me. Maybe it was just me, but I wasn't into it like I was the others. Though I've been treated to so many amazing Harry Potter films, my selfish side comes out. Criticism aside, it still does a lot right. Harry is entering darker territory now with each passing film, and it's a treat to watch. New relationships are formed, and we even get to see two of the most popular franchises team up. Edward Cullen from Twilight (I mean Cedric Diggory) and Harry. The ending itself is pretty effective, and made a lasting impact on me to be sure. I felt they didn't go far enough with the lingering conflict between Ron and Harry though, I'd have like to seen them carry it a bit further. The positives definitely outweigh the negatives.Performances. Daniel Radcliffe is clearly into darker territory now and he's at the maturity stage to pull it off. He's getting better with each film. Emma Watson is feisty and charismatic as usual. Rupert Grint plays a snotty type for the better part of the first half or so, and did it effectively. He was good. Robert Pattinson is OK here, but his part isn't as big as it seems until the end. Jason Isaacs's wig is a bit of a shame but he plays menacing to a T, and had a presence. Tom Felton is decent as Draco, he plays his role well. The rest perform well.Bottom line. My least favorite, but I still enjoy it very much. It's got all the ingredients to make your experience extremely enjoyable. If you're a Potter fan, and haven't checked out, I suggest you do so. Highly recommended8 ½ /10",8,0,1,6 January 2011

The Fountain," Incredible Surrealistic imagery, fantastic cinematography and spellbinding performances, can't compensate for an often sluggish movie.
","The Fountain is a very well done movie, no doubt about it. The cinematography is fantastic, the performances by Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz are absolutely spellbinding, the imagery is absolutely wonderfully surreal, and the story is at times very interesting. It's just even for just over 90 minutes, the pacing is often very sluggish, which made for a very trying experience at times. You have to pay strict attention to this film, you can't miss one little detail, or your pretty much screwed. I think I got a lot of this movie anyway. They are all inter wined together, all the three stories, anyway. The most interesting one for me, had to be the one where Hugh plays the scientist. It felt the most real, and to me was by far the most heartfelt. The least effective was the one in Midevil times. The imagery near the end made my jaw drop almost literally. I have honestly never seen anything like that, in my entire life. It was beautiful, haunting, and surreal all at the same time. The Fountain is far from a failure, and there is a lot of interesting stuff on hand, but it's just too sluggish a lot of the time, for my liking.Performances. Hugh Jackman is utterly incredible here. His multi layered performance is something for the ages. Each character he played, he poured his whole heart into. His chemistry with Rachel is what chemistry is all about. Together the two bring realism, and pure love, I was often amazed by the two. Rachel Weisz is excellent. She is charming ,vulnerable, yet strong at the same time. She has a hypnotizing face, and I often couldn't take my eyes off of her. Ellen Burstyn is very good here, per usual. She didn't have much screen time, when she did though, she added a lot of class to the part.Bottom Line. The Fountain is a movie I was very much half and half on. I enjoyed a lot of the experience, I was floored by the imagery, and the ending was one of the strangest, yet most incredible things I have ever seen. It just is much to slow for its own good sometimes, and ultimately that's what killed it in the end for me. I do however recommend it for an evening watch, just make sure you pay strict attention, or you will be lost.",7,2,4,12 January 2010
Zombieland," I wouldn't call it Top 250 worthy on IMDb, but it's certainly a fun filled ride.
","Zombieland isn't overrated by any means, but I do think calling it 250 worthy is pushing it. Zombieland benefits from never taking itself too seriously, and having the perfect balance of Comedy and Action, with a bunch of great characters that we can all root for. It starts off with a tremendous opening of the movie, introducing us to Jesse Eisenberg's character, Columbus. I loved how he gave us the set of rules that he had to survive the Zombies and that, it was funny and quite inventive. I thought the movie's main strength was the fantastic chemistry of Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson. Jessie is kind of the wimpish, yet endearing character who sucks it up when he has too, to outwit the Zombies, while Woody enjoys killing them off, and relishes it. It's just a very smart Comedy/Horror film that does what it sets out to do well. I also found it amusing how Wichita|Stone| and Little Rock|Breslin| kept conning Columbus and Tallahassee, the Bill Murray cameo was a nice touch too.Performances. Woody Harrelson is a new bad ass hero of mine, with his portrayal of Tallahassee here. He's funny, he kicks all kinds of but, and his charisma is untouchable!. Jesse Eisenberg is the perfect reluctant hero. His quirky antics, and the way he acted always managed to put a smile on my face. While Tallahassee was my favorite character, Jessie was probably the heart of the film. Emma Stone is a total cutie, and manges to inject charisma and the right amount of depth into her part. Her sassiness was not only a turn on, but it gave me a lot of chuckles as well. Abigail Breslin is a hoot as Little Rock. She is one of the rare likable kid actresses of today, and her chemistry with Emma Stone is top-notch.Bottom line. Zombieland is a hoot of a Zombie film. It's funny, action packed and an all around good time. I wouldn't put it anywhere near the top 250, like a lot of people have, but I definitely like the movie a lot, and look forward to the sequel.8/10",8,0,0,2 April 2010
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Chamber of Secrets is darker and more magical then the original was!
","The Chamber of Secrets goes to even more lengths, and more tight and sticky situations to please fans of the series, and new viewers themselves. I really thought the Tom Riddle storyline was ingenious and even quite chilling at times, they went to great lengths to keep things unpredictable to viewers who hadn't read the books before like me. I also sensed a lot of maturity into the actors this time, all of them seemed comfortable and were able to be into their roles more this time. The special effects once again blew me away, especially Aragog the spider and all the little ones, it was quite the effective scene. The movie's humor is better done then the 1st as well, any scene with Dobby whacking his head in frustration or his mischievous antics, I ended up cracking up. The twist at the end is wonderfully captivating, the only problem I had with it, and the movie itself was it was a bit too long in the tooth for my liking.Performances. Daniel Radcliffe is much stronger this time around, even though I genuinely enjoyed his performance in The Sorcerer's Stone. He's more mature, he has more to play with, and he showed off a certain sense of charisma as well. Rupert Grint is funny once more as Ron Weasley. His weird facial quirks when he was frightened or nervous, made a lot of the movie for me. Emma Watson is sassy and witty, per usual here, she makes Hermoine lovable. Tom Felton is even more nastier as Draco then he was prior to this, you'll dislike him with a passion. Jason Isaacs is absolutely chilling as Lucuius. He was so devious, so cunning and unpredictable!. Robbie Coltrane is very charming and funny as Hagrid once more, I just wish he had more time. Kenneth Branagh is a hoot as the lying Lockhart who pretends to be a masterful Magician. Alan Rickman, Richard Harris, John Cleese and Maggie Smith all do well as the respective 4, though I do wish Rickman had more time as Snape. Shirley Henderson seems to be enjoying chewing up the scenery as Moaning Myrtle, I dug her.Bottom line. Chamber of Secrets definitely equals Sorcerer'stone, and quite possibly surpasses it too. At around 160 minutes it's a lot to bare, but there's so much going on you won't even care|Hey that rhymed, yeah I'm weird, lol|. A Must see for Potter fans.9/10",9,0,1,19 April 2010

Crazy Heart," A simple, yet wonderful tale about the road to redemption. Jeff Bridges deserved his Oscar.
","Crazy Heart is a fitting title for this movie, because Jeff Bridge's is full of crazy heart. I'll be the 1st one to admit, it's not original in the slightest. Mickey Rourke did it with The Wrestler, and many other people have done it in other genres, but Jeff Bridges makes it all worthwhile. I think I could identify with Bad Blake so much, is because he kept to himself for the most part. He didn't want any trouble, he didn't want anybody really for a while, he just wanted to drink his McClure's and smoke his cigarettes, he really was a decent man. I thought the whole ordeal and story off Bad falling for Jean|Maggie Gyllenhaal| and growing a fondness for her son was so well done, and it showed the loneliness Bad had deep down. You can see resentment in his eyes when he walks off on Tommy Sweet|Colin Farrell| You can see he wants redemption, but doesn't really have the courage to do so. It was just a very well done movie, and I enjoyed the simple, yet powerful story it had.Performances. Jeff Bridges is phenomenal in his role, and most certainly deserved his Oscar. Not only is his acting perfect, but his singing was also impressive. I felt so many emotions for his character, and ended up falling in love with it. Kudos to Mr. Bridges for giving me such a captivating performance. Maggie Gyllenhaal is excellent as Jean, the protective mother, but also aspiring journalist. Her character isn't as deep as Bridges, but she is very vital to the movie's success. Colin Farrell is very good as Tommy Sweet. He didn't have as much screen time as I'd have liked, but he did well in his part. Robert Duvall adds a touch of class to everything he's in, and here was no different.Bottom line. Crazy Heart is a movie I thoroughly enjoyed. It played with my emotions, and it made me smile when it was over. It's nice to see a movie that lives up to the hype once in a while. A must see.9/10",9,8,11,21 July 2010
War of the Worlds," Spielberg does it again!. War of the Worlds, is a non stop action thrill ride, that often leaves you breathless.
","War Of The Worlds, is one of the best remakes, I have ever seen, period. I remember loving the original, and with one of my favorite Director's and one of my favorite leading actors on board, I was pumped for this one. Due to busyness, I never got around to watching it, but I can truly say, it was well worth the wait. The action set pieces, are truly remarkable, with some of the most thrilling action, I have honestly ever seen. The scene where the passenger ship comes apart, rivals Titanic for some of the most thrilling stuff, with a ship collapsing, I was enthralled. The chemistry between Tom and Dakota, truly makes a lot of the movie. As the movie slowly passes by, we see there growing chemistry with one another. The machines themselves, are quite frightening looking, it's been a while, since I have felt very squirmy in my seat. It got a little silly near the end, and the ending was sorta cheesy, but I still got a kick out of it, for some reason. War Of The World's is Sci-Fi entertainment, at it's finest!.Performances. Tom Cruise is as solid as ever as Ray. He plays an every day working man well, while bringing his wonderful charisma as well. We are able to root for him as a family man, and as a Father, he didn't deserve a Razzy. Dakota Fanning is cute as a button for her age, and has remarkable charisma for her age. She is likable, and her chemistry with Cruise, was excellent. Justin Chatwin is OK as Robbie, but his character grated my nerves, much more then once. Tim Robbins is a bit underutilized, but played a great crazy man, I felt insecure with him, more then once.Bottom line. War Of The Worlds will wow you with it's action, thrill you with it's suspense, and satisfy you with it's solid performances. Spielberg is king, and there isn't really much negative, I can say bout this. A Must see for fans of the original, or action lovers.9/10",9,3,5,7 February 2010

Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," Heartfelt and original! Something you don't see very much any more in Hollywood
","Nick is dealing with a bad breakup with everybody's dream girl, Tris (Dziena) Nick's outlook starts to get a bit brighter when Norah asks Nick to be his girlfriend for 5 minutes, so she can make an impression on Tris. It lasts longer than expected when they are forced to team up with Nick's buddies to track down Caroline's drunken friend. This is a very good coming of age film! It's got heart and originality in spades, something you don't see as often as you'd like in Hollywood. I'm sure there are many that will shake their heads at this, but Caroline's drunken adventures reminded a bit of Brenna's adventures in Babysitting! It's probably far- fetched, but maybe that was a tribute of sorts? Anyway, this movie has much more than meets the eye! It has two of my favorite things in this world! Romance and music. This film manages to combine both very well. I was really impressed by the realism and how genuine this movie was. A lot of the situations rang true for me. I liked some of the gags as well. A horny couple mistaking a yellow Yugo for a cab was hilarious. I'm not a huge fan of Cera's. His 'awkward' shtick works very well in this movie, and I have to give him credit. His witty banter with Dennings felt like conversation you would see between two people in real life. I empathized with his situation. We've all had that girl we go crazy over...despite that she's a witch. Kat Dennings was the star in my mind. It's easy to see why she went on to stardom on 2 Broke Girls. Her character is easy to fall in love with and easy to relate too. She oozes charisma. Ari Graynor is likable as the dense best friend of Norah's. Alexis Dziena is good as the embittered and devious ex. I didn't think she was that hot though. Jay Baruchel is awful as usual. Andy Samberg has a cameo near the end. I can promise that you'll grin and smile at least a few times during this movie. If you want a feel good movie to uplift your spirits, this movie will do the job. Music buffs should love the soundtrack7.8/10",7,0,0,18 November 2014

",One of the best films ever made!!!!!!! it's a true classic and deserves all the praise it gets. When i rented this film i was expecting far more then a masterpiece i was expecting one of the best films ever made and that's what i got i wasn't disappointed. The Performances are AMAZING and astounding i read this got a lot of Oscars and deservedly so the ending is VERY sad but wonderful. this movie is never boring it's always EXTREMELY engrossing with it's wonderful story. the characters are all fantastic except for one. This is just an amazing experience to sit through you will never see anything quite like this. and i am praying right now that they don't remake this BECAUSE WE DON'T NEED IT!!!!!. I have never read the book so i can't which is better. this movie is just captivating wonderful and beautifully made and directed. The Acting is one of the best i have ever seen in a movie No Doubt about it the acting Oscar Worthy Jack Nicholson is a genius his performance is just astounding he had me with my jaw dropped open as i said he is one of the best actors of all time. and he is in my top 3 list. I am not a big fan of Louise Fletcher at all but her performance here was excellent although i wouldn't say it was worthy it was pretty damn good anyway her charatcer is VERY unlikable too. Willam Refield does what he has to do well. GREAT to see Scatman Crothers again here he always cracks me up and provided a bit of comic relief. Danny Devito here in a early role he was amusing and was very cool to see him in a early role. Sydney Lassick got on my nerves a little bit with his yelling but other then that he did fine. Christopher Lloyd is VERY amusing here in a early role and he cracked me up. Will Sampson is EXCELLENT here and VERY likable and boy is he ever BIG!!!!!. Brad Douriff is wonderful as always here is no different. no gore what so ever except when we get an off the screen slit throat and we see the blood all over him and around him.

Die Hard with a Vengeance," Simon Says.
","McClaine is suspended from the NYPD and his life is in shambles. A man who calls himself Simon (Irons) wants McClaine back in action. It turns out Simon is actually Hans Gruber's brother. A Harlem store owner, Zeus Carver (Samuel L. Jackson) gets caught right in the middle of it, forcing Zeus and McClaine to team up and stomp bombs all over New York. This is the best sequel in the series by far. It's essentially a 'buddy, buddy' film, but a damn good one at that. It starts off like any typical buddy film. Zeus and McClaine don't see eye to eye and forced to team up under unique circumstances. What I loved about this sequel is that it strays away from the first two. he second sequel was a tad forced and overblown. This one felt genuine and that's probably because McTiernan was back direction in lieu of Renny Harlin. Some may get offended by the racism in this movie and I wouldn't blame you at all for that. I think it's done in clever fashion. Die Hard III did it in such a hilarious way, I can't help but laugh at it. The 'I hate Niggas' sign McClaine is forced to wear around his neck in this movie is classic! One thing that never disappoints in the Die Hard series is the action! There is a lot of stuff here to feed the adrenaline junkies. You can't go wrong with Willis and Jackson causing chaos and raising hell in New York. New York really added to the atmosphere here and made it feel more gritty. My only complaint is there are some lulls in the second half. Nothing that will ruin your experience, but it's noticeable. Bruce Willis is excellent as McClaine. He really seems motivated in this one. His character has nothing to lose in this one because he no longer has Holly and he's almost a full-blown alcoholic. It made him more of a loose cannon. Willis had some great lines and is a lot of fun to watch. He's the perfect anti-hero. Jackson is just as good as Willis. His intensity is off the charts and I relished every second he was on-screen. His chemistry with Willis is great. Jeremy Irons is very good for the most part, aside from the iffy accent. I enjoyed his rhymes. Overall, this is truly a great sequel. It has plenty of laughs, plenty of action, and everything you could want in a sequel. Willis and Jackson make one of the greatest 'buddy' teams of all time as far as I'm concerned. 8.3/10Favorite quoteZeus: You can stick your well-laid plan up your well-laid ass!",8,1,1,15 January 2016
Con Air," 'Why couldn't you put the bunny back in the box?' If you search for the definition of dumb fun, you'll most likely see Con Air as the answer
","(Plot) An ex-con, and former U.S ranger kills a man out of self defense, but winds up serving a harsh prison sentence due to his military background. The day he is supposed to be released. He gets trapped in a prisoner transport plane when the convicts decide to hijack the plane. Can Nicolas Cage save the day?*Minor Spoilers*This movie is so dumb that it's not even funny. It's loud, in your face, and totally entertaining! Right from the opening where we are treated to Nicolas Cage sporting a laughably bad Southern accent, I knew I was in for some cheesy fun. The action scenes are gloriously spectacular to watch. It's filled with explosions, cheesy one liners from Cage, and totally improbable situations which make it all the more fun to watch. How can you not love the sheer audacity of Nicolas Cage continuing to strive forward towards the baddies on the plane and act like nothing has happened, despite the fact that he gets shot in the arm while doing so. Some of the stunts in this one had to be extremely expensive. The finale in this movie takes place on the streets of Las Vegas. I won't spoil it, but let's just say the destruction that commences is somewhat breathtaking to watch. It's totally illogical, but who cares. For almost two hours, you'll get your money's worth in this one if you're an action junkie.I'm still a fan of Nicolas Cage, despite his unlucky string of many terrible movies as of late. It's not exactly a great performance, but he is a lot of fun to watch. He has a really bad mullet while having a bit of a lone wolf character, which carries a heavy heart. His breezy character is pretty illogical, but I had a hoot with him. His star power is very apparent in this one. John Malkovich can play this type of role in his sleep. Not many people can play an entertaining villain like him. I loved his show! John Cusack provides great support as the United States Marshal, and manages to overcome slight miscasting with charisma and charm to spare. He doesn't feel like the Marshall kind of type, but he did really good; David Chapelle is the comedic relief (Not that the movie needed it!) Ving Rhames, Danny Trejo, Rachel Ticotin, M.C Gainey & Monica Potter all do their roles well. Steve Buscemi is a scene stealer in this one, despite not having much screen timeFinal Thoughts: I had fun. It's very stupid, but fun. The critics that rip into it aren't getting the big picture here. You can rip into the script all you want, but this is set to entertain the masses, and that's exactly what it does. Just enjoy the fun cast, all the explosions, and have a blast with this cheese fest. 7.5/10",7,1,1,2 September 2013
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Extremely Silly, But It's Still A Pretty Funny Film
","Extremely silly, but it's still a pretty funny film. Will Ferrell and Christina Applegate are great together and provide lots of silly moments , and lots of laughs as well. The whole cast is great , and keep the film fresh and funny. Sometimes the jokes are a miss and, some of them just had me groaning, but most of the time they worked and had me laughing or at least chuckling. The Direction is good. Adam McKay does a good job here , keeping the film fresh and funny, keeping the pace fast, and doing a good job overall, nothing fancy but it got the job done. The Acting is great!. Will Ferrell is hilarious here, he exaggerates a little bit , still he is quite funny, and he had great chemistry with Christina Applegate is EXCELLENT Here, she was funny, had great chemistry with Will Played the most serious person in the film, and was GORGEOUS to boot!. Paul Rudd is also hilarious here, he is a good actor, and he cracked up throughout the film. Steve Carell is good as the Nerdish type. David Koechner is okay here but kind of got on my nerves. Fred Willard is good here with what he has to do and is a great great character actor. Chris Parnell did what he had to do well. Danny Trejo,Luke Wilson,Jack Black,Ben Stiller,Vince Vaughn and Tim Robbins are all great in there short roles. Overall i highly recommend this for a night of laughs! ***1/2 out of 5 (barely)",7,0,2,28 January 2005
American Gangster," Great gangster film, one of the best I had seen in years!.
","American Gangster was a very well done Gangster movie that really hit home, and provided a powerful experience for me, when all was said and done. Denzel Washington gives one of the most powerful performances of his career, and Josh Brolin and Russel Crowe gave him great support. The beginning of the movie was probably the most impactive for me, even though the movie is full of them. I'm quite picky on gangster movies to be honest. I disliked The Godfather saga, along with others of the genre, but this engrossed me a lot.Bottom line. American Gangster is one of the finest Gangster films I've seen, no question about it. The performances are spellbinding, and there's never a boring moment, see it.9/10",9,1,2,26 February 2010
Jaws," Never one of my true favorites, but it's still a classic indeed, with a suspenseful story and wonderful performances
","This was never one of my true favorites, but it's still a classic indeed, with a suspenseful story and wonderful performances. All the characters are fantastic, and the Shark attacks are just great, plus Roy Scheider is simply amazing in this. Steven Spielberg has another classic in his resume, with this one, and while I do think this movie is truly excellent, it's a bit overrated by some, still I really like the movie, and am proud to own it on DVD. The effects may seem a bit dated but still hold up pretty decently, and the finale is the best part of the movie, as it's extremely suspenseful, plus it has one of the most memorable openings. It also has one of the best Horror scores ever, and it's extremely well written and made, plus while it's not very graphic, it does not need to be. All the characters are extremely likable, and Lorraine Gary is very charming as Chief Brody's wife, plus the only actor in this cast that didn't fully convince me was Robert Shaw, as he was off and on throughout the movie. This was never one of my favorites, but it's still a classic indeed, with a suspenseful story and wonderful performances, and I say Go see it now!. The Direction is top notch as always from Spielberg. Steven Spielberg does a brilliant job here, with top notch camera work, a great job of adding tension and suspense, cool angles, and great POV shots, plus he kept the film at a very fast pace. The Acting is wonderful!. Roy Scheider is amazing here, he was extremely likable, vulnerable, and I really felt for him because it must have been a tough situation he was in, he also remained calm and cool under pressure as I loved that!, he played a very memorable character here, and his chemistry with Dreyfuss was also on (Roy Rules!!!!). Robert Shaw is OK here, but totally unconvincing a lot of the times, as it was hard to hear what he was saying, and his character rather bothered me, he gave the only somewhat weak performance in the film. Richard Dreyfuss is excellent here, he was very likable, funny had good chemistry with Roy, and I really enjoyed his performance, he rocked. Lorraine Gary is beautiful and very charming here as Brody's wife, she was very likable, and showed a lot of class, she did a terrific job!. Murray Hamilton is extremely convincing as the greedy mayor, as he will get under your skin. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall Go see it now. ***** out of 5",10,1,3,11 February 2006
Hancock," Very entertaining
","(Credit IMDb) A hard-living superhero who has fallen out of favor with the public enters into a questionable relationship with the wife of the public relations professional who's trying to repair his image.Okay. So this movie isn't perfect, but what superhero movie is? It had one goal to attain, that being to entertain its mass audience. As far as I'm concerned, it did just that. Will Smith has the tendency to be lazy at times, but he's gifted when he wants to be. There is a great twist with Charlize Theron's character as well. It has some well-timed humor with some excellent action scenes. The finale becomes dark and violent, but I personally enjoyed it. Jason Bateman plays a terrific straight man. I just have one question to ask... Where is my Hancock 2?7.5/10",7,2,2,6 March 2014
Ray," Jamie Fox deserved his Oscar. Unfourantley this is the case, where the performance, is better then the movie itself.
","Ray is interesting in parts, and technically it's very well made, but Ray is often sluggish, and forgets some important details about Ray's life. All the movie shows us is parts where he's in his prime, and most successful, which is good, it's just I wanted to see some bits about his older life too. Jamie Fox mimics Ray Charles to a t, at times it's absolutely uncanny. I have to say, Jamie is the reason I got through this movie. The 1st half is a lot better then the 2nd. It's more interesting, it has more Oomph, and it's nowhere near as sluggish as the 2nd. I wasn't a big fan of Ray Charles to begin with to be honest, so I really didn't have any expectations for the film, what so ever. Ray's biggest problem had to be the over length. This could've been cut very easily, with more relevant scenes, other then the ones they used. I found the early part of Ray's life when he was just starting to get successful, the most interesting. He was humble back then, and somewhat a gentleman. And while the film may have over exaggerated his actions, he got a bit too full of himself for me to care.Performance. Jamie Fox gives a performance for the ages as Ray. He looks like Ray, talks like Ray, acts like Ray. He even sings like Ray!. This is much more then an impression, I truly believed he WAS, Ray Charles. He was the heart of the film, and without his presence, this film would've been a complete and utter bore.Bottom Line. Ray is interesting at times, dreadfully dull at others. When all was said and done, I was disappointed by how routine it seemed at times. Just because it's a bibliographical film, Doesen't mean it's automatically Oscar worthy. Jamie Fox deserved his Oscar, but the movie is above average at best. Worth a watch, but if I were you, I'd keep my expectations at a rather comfortable level.7/10",7,1,2,15 January 2010
Bring It On," It's got energy and a lively spirit,with Eye candy galore,i'll definitely give it that much.
","Bring it On was extremely fluffy and cheesy,yet it had a certain charm to it that made my time with Bring It On bearable. It's pure energy is able to overcome a lot of the film's problems. I enjoyed it to a certain extent,it's not something I would watch again any time soon,but for what it was,I had a fairly entertaining time. Kirsten Dunst is very cute no doubt,but i'm often quite picky on her as an actress,thankfully she's up to the task producing a likable lead,and one we can root for. My main problem with the film had to be Gabrielle Union's character. The film desperately tries to make her character sympathetic,yet they fail miserably and here's why. I can understand her annoyance,that the Toro's stole their moves,but it made East Compton look full of themselves by how Gabrielle was acting. I mean Torrance offered them a check to do the right thing and she rips it up? she could have at least handed it back and said 'Thanks but no thanks' it was egotistical of her and ruined a lot of the movie for me,so their fore I didn't think East Compton deserved the acclaim they got.The cheer leading scenes themselves are pretty lively. Eliza Dushku was particularly impressive with her double back flips,etc. Bring It on is a good time waster,it won't make your day brighter,but it won'r ruin it either,just a couple of things here and there could've made it a lot better then it was.Performances. Kirsten Dunst is pretty good here. She plays a likable lead,full of p*ss and vinegar. Kirsten makes Torrance a likable hero and even though,I could honestly careless about cheer leading,she was able to make me care about what happened to the Toro's,even if she was a little wishy washy at times. Eliza Dushku is one of the hottest actresses in Hollywood,i'm just gonna say that right now loll. As far as her performance goes,she was my favorite character in the film. She's real,she has a good outlook on the world,and most importantly she's humble unlike a lot of her stickup counterparts. Jesse Bradford is charming in a goofy type way,I rather liked him. Gabrielle Union does what she can with her material,unfortunately the script fails her. She looks good,her moves are good,but they didn't give the character the justification she needed. I saw her as a villain,and completely full of herself,but that wasn't her fault,it was the script's. Clare Kramer&Nicole Bilderback play the dimwitted snobs to a T. Huntley Ritter plays his role well,he was rather amusing.Bottom Line. Bring It on is decent fluffy type entertainment. I doubt i'll ever watch it again,but overall I had a decent time with it. Due to it's energy,it's enthusiasm and the likable cast,you can't help but have a soft spot for it. Worth the watch6/10",6,0,1,23 December 2009
Inception," I'd bet money this takes best picture. Inception is one of the best movie experiences I've ever honestly had.
","This movie is gonna very hard to write-up, but I'll do my best. Inception is not only one of the best movie experiences I've ever had, but it's without a doubt, one of the best movies I have ever personally seen. Thursday evening I was invited to join my Sister and her fiancé to see this at the theater, but I wasn't quite sure. A lot of time when there is a ton of hype about a movie, I end up being let-down, this was nowhere near the case. Never have I sat in a theater so blown-away with what was going on, sitting in my seat just in pure amazement at the story surrounding it. Inception requires a lot of abstract thinking, and a lot of patience, because it's so mind-bending. I can't remember any time where I've spent so much time in a theater processing what was going on during the movie, and I loved it. The special effects are mind-blowing!. Some of the action sequences are sight to behold, and the set-pieces themselves were even more amazing. One of Inception's best traits was drawing you in with the characters. Cobb|DiCaprio| is the heart of the movie, and despite his turmoil, his vulnerability and the obvious sadness he possessed, I still rooted for him immensely.Inception has everything you could want in a movie. A mesmerizing story, great visuals, fantastic effects, wonderful drama, jaw-dropping action sequences, tear-jerking moments and yes, even some laughs!. It has all the perfect elements, and I really believe Christopher Nolan has created an indefinite masterpiece, and one of the greatest works in the history of cinema. The ending itself is utter brilliance, and made me think for a couple of days after-words. It was just so emotional, and it smartly left the viewer to interpret what they think the ending means. Aside from a dull-patch in the 1st half, Inception is absolutely perfect, and believe me I don't find anything to be perfect. You can't let your mind wander doing this, not even for a few seconds, because every detail counts. 2 viewings or perhaps even repeated viewings will help understand the viewing pleasure in my opinionPerformances. Is Leonardo DiCaprio Oscar worthy? Not quite, but he's certainly close to it. The man just oozes presence, and I felt completely for him. He's our hero, the main lead, the person we rely on to explain things to us, and he did it all tremendously. I think he is incapable of giving a bad performance. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's role isn't as requited, but he's very solid and I dug him quite a bit. Ellen Page is fantastic in her role. She proved Juno was no fluke, and delivered a fabulous secondary character|To DiCaprio anyway|. Her scenes with DiCaprio were awesome. Tom Hardy is quite charismatic, and he did very well here. Ken Watanabe is excellent in his role, I especially loved his scenes in the beginning and the end. Cillian Murphy plays it laid-back with vulnerability, I dug it!. Tom Berenger and Michael Caine have small roles, but I loved them both. Marion Cotillard managed to pull off quite a balanced feat. She made me fear her, and make her sympathetic. Her scenes with DiCaprio were wonderful. Bottom line. I can't say enough about Inception. It is a movie that needs to be treasured and appreciated for what it truly is, a masterpiece and one of the greatest movies of all time. Believe the hype, and go see it as soon as you can. I'll be rooting for this to win best picture.10/10",10,4,17,2 August 2010
Sherlock Holmes," I actually didn't like it all, I was bored silly.
","Robert Downey Jr. is an actor I admire, and I loved most of the cast, but Guy Ritchie's style didn't sit well with me, and in the end I caught myself looking at my watch more then once. The action set pieces are impressive, at least some of them but it's quirky style often bothered me a lot of the time, with Downey Jr's performance not being that great in my opinion. It was way too talky for my liking at times, with Rachel McAdams character not having much to do, and that irked me to no end because she's capable of so much more. I enjoy a lot of the older adaptations of Sherlock Holmes, but this one just didn't cut it. The atmosphere they had right, the costumes were magnificent and Downey Jr looked fittingly drugged up, but I just felt bored by it all and often wondered how it brought it in so much money.Performances. Robert Downey Jr. is OK, but nothing more then that. He is convincingly drugged up he puts his swagger on, but I just felt he over did it sometimes, especially with the mumbling. Jude Law is much better here. He didn't have as much to do, but his performance felt more real. Rachel McAdams is gorgeous of course, but her character is terribly wasted in my opinion.Bottom line. I didn't get what all the fuss was about, and in fact found it to be a very boring affair. If there is a sequel I'll probably check it out, but I won't be too eager too.5/10",5,1,2,13 June 2010
The Good Shepherd," Long, drawn out, and downright boring look, at the history of the CIA.
","Credit IMDbLaconic and self-contained, Edward Wilson heads CIA covert operations during the Bay of Pigs. The agency suspects that Castro was tipped, so Wilson looks for the leak. As he investigates, he recalls, in a series of flashbacks, his father's death, student days at Yale (poetry; Skull and Bones), recruitment into the fledgling OSS, truncated affairs, a shotgun marriage, cutting his teeth on spy craft in London, distance from his son, the emergence of the Cold War, and relationships with agency, British, and Soviet counterparts. We watch his idealism give way to something else: disclosing the nature of that something else is at the heart of the film's narration as he closes in on the leak.I really don't remember a whole lot about this one. Other then it had a great cast, I found nothing overly interesting. Tremendous cast, a capable director in Deniro as well as an actor, but the insight wasn't proper for me, and I had trouble staying awake doing the duration.Bottom line. I usually remember stuff from movies, not this one. Bored me to tears 2/10",2,2,4,27 May 2011
The Blind Side," Sandra Bullock gives her best career performance in this wonderful heart warming drama!
","The Blind Side was a movie I really didn't think much of to be honest, I thought it was another typical sports biopic, but when I heard all the praise for it, and how good Sandra's performance was, I had to go see it. Quinton Aaron's portrayal of Michael Oher is absolutely terrific. You are able to feel the pain with him, because he does not know how to learn properly and the more harder he works at it, the more you root for him. I think the most amazing aspect about this movie is the fact that a rich Southern Family like the Tuohy's let in a poor Black man into there lives, let alone parent him it was really quite amazing and humbling to watch. One of the scenes that truly hit me the most had to be when Leigh Anne|Bullock| goes and visit's Michael's mom|Aaron| at her place, even though she's as high as a kite, it was emotional and well done. The Blind Side isn't an overly complicated movie, in fact it's rather simple, but in the end it's a touching film that is mostly worthy of all the acclaim it's received.Performances. Sandra Bullock gives a career defining performance here, and believe me it is worth the hype. I've always adored Sandra Bullock but here she takes her game to the next level. She deserved her Oscar completely, because she put her all into the role, and she completely resembled the real Leigh Anne, it was quite remarkable. Quinton Aaron is brilliant as Michael. His facial expressions told all a lot of the times, and in the end I loved his performance. Tim McGraw surprised me with his excellent performance here, and his chemistry with Sandra was fantastic. Jae Head gives a sly and wonderful performance as the kid S.J. I don't like kid actors, but he was terrific, I especially loved his scenes with Quntion Aaron. Kathy Bates has a small but very important role in the movie, and once again brought some class.Bottom line. The Blind Side is one Of the best movies 0f 2009 by far, and thankfully lives up to the hype for the most part. It's just a movie that truly warms your heart in every way, and I'm thankful I viewed it. An absolute must see.9/10",9,1,2,23 April 2010
The Conjuring," This is what horror should be all about
","They don't make horror movies like they used too. I still find some to be entertaining, but not many can scare me these days. The Conjuring is a big exception to that rule. I read this was based on a true story. In all honesty, I wasn't that excited for it. Once I began reading all the positivity regarding this movie, my outlook began to change. It's been a long time since a recent horror movie has frightened me like this one. The 'Low budget, found footage' style has seemingly taken over, so it was refreshing to see an old fashioned horror movie. This is set in the 70's, and I was so impressed about how they managed to mirror the time period like they did. Whether it was the hair styles, the retro clothing, the cars, or something else, the 70's atmosphere floored me. I was amazed by the slickly shot jump scares. The jump scares aren't the phony one's you see in a Paranormal Activity film, these legitimately startle you. Director James Wan does a very smart thing by letting your imagination do the work for a little while, before revealing frightening close-up's of the spirits. You're never fully comfortable, and the slow build-up does wonders for this movie. They have not executed a possession film so adroitly, since The Exorcist. We also get characters you can rally behind. Everybody in this movie is likable. Patrick Wilson is ironically in Insidious 1 & 2, so he's no stranger to haunted house films. He rocks some fantastic sideburns, and conveys his emotions very well. There is a reason he's becoming one of Hollywood's top actors. Vera Farmiga is the best actress in Hollywood as far as I'm concerned. There is nothing this woman can't do. She absolutely nailed her role as Lorraine Warren. She was so intense, and I was on her side the whole way. The Warren's have quite a reputation in real life, and I felt Wilson & Farmiga did them justice. Lili Taylor scared the hell out of me, plain and simple. She makes Linda Blair look like a pussycat in comparison. This part had to be rigorous for her, no doubt. She also manages to pull off a convincing mother who I'd try and save any day. It takes quite a feat to be so likable, and then so creepy. It was a magnificent showcase. Ron Livingston made me forget about Office Space, and gave a great performance. He underplayed it, and I dug it; special mention to the kids for being so brave, and likable. It is a rarity where every character is sympathetic. The finale is full of chaos and non stop frights that had the back of my neck hairs tingling. It does get a little bit conventional, but it's done so adroitly. Final Thoughts: You'll have trouble going to sleep when you're through with this one. I had my room door closed, all the lights off, and food in hand. It felt good to be scared again. The Conjuring is not only one of the best of its kind in recent memory, but one of the best in history. Believe the hype, folks. 9.7/10",9,0,3,13 December 2013
Platoon," A disturbing War Film that deserves the praise it gets *Possible Spoilers*
","A disturbing war film that deserves the praise it gets. This is one powerful film with many shocking scenes that will give you the chills . the performances are AMAZINGLY good (more on that later). I was actually expecting this to be very overrated but it wasn't at all and i enjoyed it very much even if it was pretty disturbing. This is a very important viewing for everyone but it's not pretty and hard to watch at times. there is LOTS of graphic violence but not hat much gore. We get some bloody gunshot wounds, TONS and TONS of bloody corpses , a brutal beating with a gun, (and what's said after that had happened is very disturbing). a VERY graphic bloody gunshot wound to the head with blood and brains splattering, and TONS and TONS of very graphic but non bloody gunshot wounds. The acting is Oscar worthy. Charlie Sheen is utterly fantastic and gives an Oscar worthy performance here , he is EXTREMELY likable and did a fantastic job. Tom Berenger is an awesome actor and did awesome here but his character was VERY unlikable. Williem Dafoe is great here as usual i liked him lots. Forest Whitaker and Johnny Depp both do fine with what they have to do and John C. McGinley does okay and Kevin Dillon annoyed me. Overall a classic film that is a required viewing for everyone ***** out of 5 (a true classic)!!!",10,2,4,12 December 2004
Scream," very entertaining but no classic
",this movie is almost a classic but not quite it is very entertaining and extremely well made and quite well acted and i did really like it its just it is not quite as good as everybody says it is i thought the killer was predictable and it was pretty bloodless but still the ending rocked and there are a lot of cool ideas going for it like the twist ending so this is a must see **** out of 5,Null,1,3,19 December 2003
Carrie," Whoa! Slow down....
","Carrie White is an emotionally repressed teenager that is abused, bullied, and over-protected by her domineering mother, who is overly religious. To make matters worse, Carrie has a target on her back from Chris Hangensen because Chris got in trouble for picking on Carrie. Sue Snell feels bad for Carrie, decides to make Carrie feel welcome by making her boyfriend, Tommy Ross take Carrie to the prom. Things start off well, but things go awry when Chris Hangensen decides to get revenge on Carrie. Big mistakeI've never understood the fuss over this movie! I don't like to use the word overrated, but Carrie falls into that category. I will admit that the storyline does evoke sympathy from the viewer. The emotional turmoil and abuse Carrie goes through is disheartening and riveting at times. Carrie is a girl we can all sympathize with and relate to as well. How many of us have been chastised and bullied for marching to the beat of your own drum...or being different? The judgment and teasing about this sort of thing still goes on today. Carrie automatically garners sympathy for this. Watching her be normal for a little while at the prom before chaos erupts is very rewarding and touching. My problem is that everything seemed so rushed! There was so much more they could have done with the storyline. More on Carrie's telekinesis would have been ideal. It's all subdued and somewhat vague until the infamous prom scene and the ending. The reason this movie gets the 'classic' reputation, is because of the last 30 minutes or so. Yeah, it packs a wallop, but it wasn't anything that deserves all the praise it has gotten over the years. There are powerful scenes scattered here and there (The shower scene with Carrie freaking out about her period is very disturbing) but I don't think this movie deserves to be hailed as a classic. The acting is pretty good. Sissy Spacek is a revelation as Carrie. She is alternately creepy and sympathetic, exactly what I wanted. She really makes this movie better than it is. Piper Laurie gives an unbearably hammy performance as Carrie's Mother. She is WAY OTT! I have no idea why people love her performance. It's highly overrated if you ask me! Her constant babbling made me wanna smack her! Religious fanatics like her are a reason why I frown upon religion at times. Nancy Allen steals the show with her vindictive performance. She was the perfect antagonist for Carrie. William Katt is very charming as Tommy. His hair was pretty cool, too. Amy Irving is decent as the girl with a heart. I thought she was off and on. John Travolta is a hoot as Nancy Allen's boyfriend! Horror legend, P.J Soles does well as Nancy Allen's accomplice. Stephen King adaptations are often a mixed bag. I enjoy certain aspects of this movie, but it's very overrated. It's nowhere near as powerful as it wants you to believe. In all honesty? I think it's a bit dated. This is a DECENT horror movie! that's it. 6/10",6,0,6,12 October 2014
Blow," Excruatingly boring story of a real life Drug dealer George Jung.
","Blow is a movie I just couldn't get into due to the sheer boredom it provided me with. I am a big Johnny Depp fan, and I love real life influenced movies, but this one dragged along like torture. It starts off well with George telling us a bit of his childhood and how he considered his dad his hero, but it's slowly downhill from there. In order to make a great biopic, you need an engrossing story, and the proper actors for the movie. Johnny Depp did good, but It's not one of his best performances.Performances. Johnny Depp is good, but not great. The role requires him to be great, but the script isn't able to pull that off for him. Penélope Cruz is billed as a top star, but really doesn't appear until well later into the movie. Franka Potente did well in her short time. Rachel Griffiths looks to young to be playing Johnny's mother, but her character certainly did it's job. Ray Liotta is a class act as usual, and it was nice to see him play a nice guy for once.Bottom line. Blow wasn't my kind of movie, in fact it's a huge disappointment in my opinion. Biopics need to be engaging, and this one is far from engaging. Depp fanatics might wanna check it out, as for people who are fascinated by George Jung, others needn't bother.4/10",4,0,1,10 May 2010
1408," A rare occurrence when P.G horror shines (MAJOR SPOILERS!)
","This review is for the Director's cutMike Enslin is a depressed atheist, who has lost his daughter due to illness. He's separated from his wife, and is bored of debunking paranormal occurrences in haunted places, and wants to find something that is real. He gets interested in the infamous room at the Dolphin Hotel, room 1408. The manager (Samuel L. Jackson) gives Cusack a caveat to not go into the room. He offers him fancy booze, private files from the room, and all the accommodations you could think of, New York Knicks tickets included. Mike Enslin ignores him, and goes into the room anyway. Not only does the hotel end up frightening him, but it toys with him as well. I'm a rated R guy. I don't like P.G horror films. It's not that I always want a gore drenched movie, but when you are Rated R, you're not so limited. 1408 surprised the hell out of me, not only with the high amount of competence, but how creative and sinister it was. It's also been a really long time where I have squirmed wherever I was sitting. Despite the P.G limitations, this was oozing style, and there were many times I felt trapped and highly uncomfortable from that room, due to its undeniable mystique. They put a lot of emphasis on the room, and the effort paid off. You wouldn't catch me in there for all the money in the world. This hotel is a mean bastard! There is no line it won't cross to intimidate you in the most sadistic ways imaginable. Mikael Håfström is masterful at raising tension levels. There were many neat tricks that were thrown my way. The scene where Cusack tries to climb out the window, onto the ledge to get into another room was terrific. The way they made the building look much bigger gave me the willies. I'm sort of afraid of heights, so that was pretty creepy. I found the family storyline to be absolutely riveting. The flashback scenes of Cusack, his daughter & his wife chilled me to the bone. Even though John Cusack's character is a bit bigoted in the first half, I couldn't help but feel for him, because he was in despair. His showcase was fantastic, and I feel it's one of the best performances of his illustrious career. He goes through so many emotions, and conveys them all to near perfection. This is his movie, and we are embarking on his harrowing journey. Cusack has to be one of Hollywood's most unheralded actors. It was pretty powerful stuff. Samuel L. Jackson doesn't have a ton of screen time, but his intensity knows no bounds. He was great. Mary McCormack adds solid support as Cusack's separated wife. It's one of the most thought provoking horror films you will find. It makes you realize life is so short, and that living your life in such a selfish way, benefits nobody. I couldn't stop thinking about it for a while. These are my thoughts on the two endings I saw. The director's cut & the theatrical cut. If you don't want to know, stop reading this instant. Don't say I didn't warn you Director's Cut endingCusack burning the room and dying so he can get out of the hotel was very depressing. He passes away, and the hotel manager approaches Lilly to offer Cusack's belongings. Lilly denies it, and Jackson winds up seeing Cusack's burned body in the car in the backseat. They also show Mike Enslin & his daughter reunited, going up to heaven. The ending was rather deflating. After everything Mike went through, this crushed me. At least it has some semblance of happiness, but it was rather morbidTheatrical EndingI honestly prefer the theatrical ending. It's more upbeat, and more satisfying, and it also lets you interpret as to what happened. Does the wife hearing their daughter's voice on the tape recorder mean she now believes Cusack saw their deceased daughter, or does it simply mean they are both trapped in the hotel? I like to believe Cusack got out. Either one is possible, though. That's what makes it so great, because it's left to your imaginationFinal Thoughts: I can't begin to tell you how impressed I was with this movie. It's scary, disturbing, and provocative. If you want an intelligent horror film that is recent, this one is a perfect choice. 8.7/10",8,0,3,16 November 2013
Raging Bull," Very Overrated(In My Opinion) And Not My Favorite Boxing Film, However It Definitely Deserves It's Reputation Of Being A True Classic
","Overrated and not my favorite Boxing Film, however it deserves it's reputation of being a classic. the acting is incredible, and it's extremely well made, however i didn't find the movie that exciting, it had it's share of engrossing moments, and Deniro is phenomenal in it and deserved his Oscar, but in my opinion i found the pace to be inconsistent. However having said that it is a true classic, it is one of the best movies ever made, i'm sure back then it was exciting as hell, however i didn't find it that exciting.There are a LOT of powerful scenes, and some of them were quite shocking and the last 30 to 40 minutes are awesome, plus the boxing matches are great!. I actually liked the use of black and white, and i must say this once again Deniro is phenomenal!, The Direction is brilliant!. Martin Scorsese, does a brilliant job here, nothing fancy, but as always Sscorse's direction is always perfect(except for the pace at times_ here is no different, he is one of the best directors of all time!. Robert De Niro gives one of the best performances ever in a movie,and is AMAZING as always, and unquestionably deserved his Oscar, he played a bit of a jerk though, and i found it hard to like him, however his performance is incredible, and his portrayal as Jake Lamotta is perfect!(Deniro Rules!). Cathy Moriarty, is excellent here, she is beautiful likable ,as Deniro's wife and i felt sorry for her. Joe Pesci is fantastic here, and plays a character similar to Goodfellas and Casino, and it was awesome!. Frank Vincent is great with what he has to do. Overall Not my favorite boxing movie and a bit overrated however it is one of the best films ever made, and deserves it's reputation of being a true classic a Must see this instant!. ***** out of 5 definitely",9,2,4,28 March 2005
Step Up," Despite the endless string of sequels, this movie is pretty entertaining.
","(Plot) Tyler is a troubled young man with untapped dancing skills. He has moved from Foster home to Foster home throughout his life, vandalizes a very posh arts school, takes the fall for it, and does community services for his unwise decision. He meets and falls for a beautiful, talented dancer named Nora (Jenna Dewan-Tatum) who helps turn his life around, and capitalize on his dancing skills. I actually enjoyed the second sequel to a certain extent, but this series is starting to get a little old now. Before they decided to get every last dime they could from this franchise, they made a fairly moving film like this one, which started it all. I'm not much of a dancing fan, but some of the stuff Channing, Jenna, the rest of the guys did made my jaw drop. It was truly impressive. Tyler's (Channing Tatum) story of reformation is a rather uncomplicated one, but effective all the same. It's not going to dazzle you with the plot or anything like that, but it sets out to entertain the masses, and it does that quite well. Channing Tatum gets a bad rap from some. (I'd venture a guess, that it's resentful husbands or guys with a girl that has a crush on Channing) I'm a guy, and I actually like him! He comes across as a little green at times, but he manages to overcome that with presence, charisma, and believability. His chemistry with Jenna Dewan is quite transparent, and it's easy to see why they fell in love for real, in real life. Channing worked hard and I commend him. Jenna Dewan is stunning. It also helps that I could relate to her character with ease. Final Thoughts: I admit to being sick and tired of this series, but this movie manages to entertain me. It's not rocket science, just a very nice story about redemption and defying the obstacles in front of you. It's a good movie, at least I think so7/10",7,0,0,25 September 2013
Vanilla Sky," One of the most incredible movies I have ever seen, as it's absolutely mind blowing, with a mesmerizing story, and stunning performances! *Minor spoilers*
","This is one of the most incredible movies I have ever seen, as It's absolutely mind blowing, with a mesmerizing story and stunning performances!. All the characters are amazing, and it will leave you thinking about it for a long time after you have finished watching it, believe me, plus Tom Cruise(especially), Cameron Diaz and Penélope Cruz are all simply incredible in this, and Kurt Russell is amazing!. I have not seen the original Open Your Eyes yet, but I found this film to be simply incredible ,and Tom Cruise delivers another dynamite performance, as he pulled off an incredibly difficult role with perfection, plus I found this film to be extremely creepy for some reason (but in a good way). Cameron Diaz also deserves tons of props with her incredible performance as she was also creepy, and The car crash scene is especially disturbing, plus the ending while confusing was absolutely brilliant as it blew me away!. It's brilliantly made and written, and all the characters are extremely likable, plus Cruise had outstanding chemistry with both Diaz and Cruz. However if you don't pay strict attention you will get lost, as it is a very hard film to follow, and Cruise's smashed up face was extremely creepy but wonderfully done and realistic looking, as I don't know How Cruise managed to pull that off but he did,plus it's very, very complex as well. This movie will especially not be for everybody, as it really is one of a kind film, and is an acquired taste, plus the psychiatric scenes with Cruise and Russell were fantastic. I really loved the incredible angles Cameron Crowe did, and This film has plenty of disturbing and shocking moments as well, plus that mask Cruise had to wear was very chilling. Even at 136 minutes it was never overlong, and I would put this in Cruise's top 5 best performances, plus this should be way higher then 6.8 in my opinion. It's also a brilliant Sci-Fi film as well, and The opening dream Cruise had was really cool, and somewhat creepy, plus I loved the script as well. I will be definitely checking out the original, since I loved this one, and dare I say this should be in the top 250?, plus I think it's quite cool that Penélope Cruz decided to play the same role twice as she played the same role in the original!. Everybody was just perfectly casted, and all the stars look just great, plus while I am a huge Cameron Diaz fan I wasn't sure if she could pull this off or not as it was quite a difficult role, boy did she ever prove me wrong. I don't know if anyone could have played his role as well as Cruise did,and as far as remakes go (even though I have yet to see the original) this is as good as it gets, plus Cameron Crowe proves here why he is considered one of the best directors out there!. I'm going to say anything more, because I want the viewers to go in without knowing anything. This is one of the most incredible films I have ever seen, as it's absolutely mind blowing, with a mesmerizing story, and stunning performances,and if you haven't seen it please do so immediately, every movie buff should watch it!. The Direction is incredible!. Cameron Crowe does an incredible! job here with amazing camera work, outstanding angles, giving it a really dreamy like feel to it and keeping the film at and incredibly engrossing pace.The Acting is simply stunning!. Tom Cruise is amazing as always and is incredible here, he had to play an incredibly difficult role and he did it with perfection he was also extremely likable, very charming, and you will feel for his character and what he is going through, he simply blew me away in a lot of scenes, especially when he is horribly disfigured just his walk, and his reactions it was amazing, he is especially incredible near the end,but fear not Cruise fans that smile will be seen often throughout the film, this is one his absolute best performances! (Cruise Rules!!!!!!!!!!). Penélope Cruz is also incredible here in her scenes as Sofia, she is incredibly gorgeous, very sweet and charming, had outstanding chemistry with Cruise, and was wonderfully energetic I loved her! (Cruz Rules!!). Cameron Diaz is amazing as always and is also incredible here, she is incredibly gorgeous, but also very creepy here, the famous suicide scene with her gave me the chills she was just so convincing, it really shocked me, she also plays the obsessive type extremely well too! (Diaz Rules!!!!!!!). Kurt Russell is amazing as always and is amazing here as the Doc, he is extremely likable intense, had some great scenes with Cruise, I just wished he had more screen time!. Jason Lee is awesome as Cruise's best friend he was funny and intense at the same time I really liked him. Rest of the cast are fine. Overall if you haven't seen it please do so immediately every movie buff has to see it at least once. ***** out of 5",10,2,5,24 March 2006
X-Men: First Class," I wasn't floored by any means, but it is unequivocally entertaining
","(Credit Twentieth Century Fox) Before Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr took the names Professor X and Magneto, they were two young men discovering their powers for the first time. Before they were archenemies, they were closest of friends, working together, with other Mutants (some familiar, some new), to stop the greatest threat the world has ever known. In the process, a rift between them opened, which began the eternal war between Magneto's Brotherhood and Professor X's X-MEN.After two terrific movies, they hit a wall with X-Men: The Last Stand. The Wolverine films are fine entertainment as stand alone films, but a reboot of sorts was needed. They went the prequel route here. As far as entertainment is concerned? This movie delivers in that aspect; however. I thought it didn't delve nearly enough emotionally like it should have. I didn't care for some of the characters. Angel, Azazel, Emma Frost, etc. I know they tried to inject new life into the X-Men series by adding new characters, but they just felt there to me and rather disposable. Erik (Magneto) had a background story that had a lot of potential to be riveting, and it was to a certain extent. I just felt they didn't delve deeply enough like they should have. The friendship between Charles and Erik isn't anywhere near as potent as the film would like you to believe. They felt like strong acquaintances more than anything else. The action is where this film truly delivers. Those that love action won't be disappointed in the slightest. The finale is especially exciting. Performances are great, can't deny that. James McAvoy is uncannily good as a younger Charles Xavier. I don't know if Patrick Stewart saw this film or not, but he'd be impressed, I bet. Michael Fassbender is very good for the most part, but more angst would have been nice. I'm probably being a bit too finicky with this, but that's my only carp about his performance. Jennifer Lawrence is tremendous as Mystique/Raven. Kevin Bacon is effectively sinister as Sebastian. He is beaten rather weakly in all honesty tho. Hugh Jackman has a brief cameo that winds up pointless. It was rather illogical as well. January Jones is actually solid, but I didn't care for her part. Rose Byrne isn't given enough importance for my liking, even though her role is substantial. Hoult and the rest of the cast are fine. Overall thoughts. I was entertained, but not exactly impressed. It was a bit too shallow at times for my liking. That being said, it does fly by for a film that is over two hours long. It's definitely worth a look. I'm looking forward to the upcoming collaborative film, X-Men: Days of Future Past. 7/10",7,0,1,11 March 2014
The Wolverine," A pretty efficient sequel that manages to entertain
","I prefer the first one to be perfectly honest with you, but this one is pretty enjoyable as well. The tone is much darker than the original and it tends to work both ways when it comes to this movie in terms of effectiveness. The darker tone manages to make the story feel more important, you can feel the agony from Logan's character in this one. It's actually somewhat tough to endure with how much Logan is going through. His desire to live is completely overshadowed by the pain he is suffering from Jean Grey's death that took place in X-Men III. He no longer wants to fight, just to live like a hermit and get drunk. I thought it was a really good look at a drastic character change from Wolverine. On the other hand, the lack of humor really hinders the movie at times. It takes itself so seriously at times that it almost becomes draining, especially at over two hours long. It isn't as well-rounded as the original either, despite being a tad more emotional. I did love the storyline of Wolverine having his power taken away to essentially deal with immortality. It made for some great storytelling. I dug the setting in Japan for the most part. It delivers some fantastic action scenes. My favorite is the one on top of a train. That one was absolutely exhilarating. Hugh Jackman is fantastic as usual. He is at his most intense yet as Wolverine. As I explained at the start of my review, his character takes a drastic turn that is filled with despair and agony. He is an extremely flawed hero in this one, showing plenty of courage and intestinal fortitude. Aside from his performance in Prisoners, this may be the best he's ever been. Tao Okamoto is a bit cantankerous and ungrateful at the start, but she turns in a decent performance when all is said and done. My favorite female performer is Rila Fukushima. She had plenty of spunk and charisma. She was also rather bad ass and had terrific chemistry with Jackman. Svetlana Khodchenkova is engagingly menacing as Viper. She had the right facial expressions to creep anyone out and made a terrific enemy. Hal Yamanouchi and Ken Yamamura do great jobs as Older and young Yashida respectively. Famke Janssen's role is nothing more than a glorified cameo. She is still deceased and pops up here and there in dream sequences to give Logan moment's of truth. It served its purpose. There is a bit of a plot hole that puzzled me. Jean claims to be lonely where she is, yet Scott Summers dies in the beginning of X-Men III. You'd have thought she would have some company. I realize Jean loved both, but still. I don't know, maybe I missed something. It just struck me as a bit oddFinal Thoughts: This is a very good sequel in it's own right. It's dark, mean, and very enjoyable. You can't go wrong with Wolverine 1 or 2 in my opinion. If you want two hours or so of entertainment, check this one out. I hope Hugh Jackman decides to reprise his role as Logan in the third installment7.6/10",7,2,3,22 February 2014

Dennis Quaid is really good here as the QB Jack Rooney, I dug his character, and he was quite likable. James Woods is OK here but didn't have much to do as the Doc and was kind of wasted. LL Cool J is pretty good here, and as I said before I think he is a good actor. Lawrence Taylor is actually good here too!, I was really surprised.

Iron Man," A bit overrated as far as film enthusiasts rate it, but it's still a great summer blockbuster.
","(Credit IMDb) Tony Stark is the complete playboy who also happens to be an engineering genius. While in Afghanistan demonstrating a new missile, he's captured and wounded. His captors want him to assemble a missile for them but instead he creates an armored suit and a means to prevent his death from the shrapnel left in his chest by the attack. He uses the armored suit to escape. Back in the U.S. he announces his company will cease making weapons and he begins work on an updated armored suit only to find that Obadiah Stane, his second in command at Stark industries has been selling Stark weapons to the insurgents. He uses his new suit to return to Afghanistan to destroy the arms and then to stop Stane from misusing his research.My problem with The Iron Man movies always consist of one sole thing, Tony Stark! His pompous attitude is hard to deal with, no matter how much charisma Downey has. Therefore this pegs the movie down a few notches for me. I also wasn't wowed like many other people were by the action scenes. I certainly enjoyed my time with the movie, I loved the cool attitude it had about itself, and it had many memorable characters, but I just didn't buy into all the hype. I know it sounds like I dislike this movie, but actually that is very much far from this case. I like Iron Man a lot, it's a great film for the genre, but I just don't think it was the second coming of Super Hero films like people claimed it was.Performances. Robert Downey's charisma manages to make Stark bearable, but boy is it hard to bear down and accept him. His arrogance had me annoyed on many occasion, and unlike the 2nd film, it does a great job of balancing him out, and rescuing his likability. Terrance Howard is a hoot as Rhodey, and did a far better job then Cheadle did. Jeff Bridges is absolutely wonderful as Obadiah. His sheer presence along helps the movie, but he managed to make the character memorable. He is the perfect foe for Downey. Gwyneth Paltrow is classy and beautiful as the infamous Pepper Pots. She made a great love interest for Downey, and I enjoyed the chemistry they had with one-another. Clark Gregg is amusing in his role as The Agent.Bottom line. Overrated a little bit, but I still enjoyed it very much. It has plenty of action, and funny situations to entertain us all. Don't go in expecting the greatest Marvel adaptation of all time, and you'll have a blast.8/10",8,2,5,18 December 2010

Bruce Almighty," Above average comedy WARNING!!!!!! SPOILERS!!!!!!!!
",Above average comedy that is well made and funny. now i am not a big fan of Jim Carrey at all but he was good in this movie usually he annoys the heck out of me but he was perfect for this part and actually was quite likable and funny. Jim Carrey can be really funny but most of the time i think he over does it. this movie is helped a lot by the good acting from everyone that was in this movie because this movie has LOTS of clichés and quite frankly i wasn't expecting much at all but what i got was an above average comedy that was entertaining enough. The Acting is VERY good. Jim Carrey is actually VERY good in this and was surprisingly funny and likable believe it or not. Morgan Freeman brings a strong presence and class to any movie he is in he is one of the best actors out there and was very funny. Jennifer Aniston is in my opinion VERY cute and does well here as Bruce's husband i liked her lots. Overall well worth the watch *** out of 5,Null,1,3,20 October 2004
Casino Royale," The Best Bond Film Ever Made
","(Credit goes to Simon on IMDb!) James Bond goes on his first ever mission as a 00. Le Chiffre is a banker to the world's terrorists. He is participating in a poker game at Montenegro, where he must win back his money, in order to stay safe among the terrorist market. The boss of MI6, known simply as M sends Bond, along with Vesper Lynd to attend this game and prevent Le Chiffre from winning. Bond, using help from Felix Leiter, Mathis and having Vesper pose as his wife, enters the most important poker game in his already dangerous career. But if Bond defeats Le Chiffre, will he and Vesper Lynd remain safe?I've seen this movie three times! Not only is it my favorite Bond movie, but one of my favorite movies period. It's everything a Bond movie should be! It revitalized the Bond series and made it feel special again. I liked Brosnan as Bond, but the movies were getting mediocre. They needed something to get people talking and inject some much-needed life into it. They decided on Bond's beginnings! as 00. It was an audacious move, one that paid off big time. We get one of the most incredible chase scenes that has ever been filmed in the beginning! I'm not hard to please, I just don't get wowed very often. The chase scene in the beginning is one of the rare times my jaw dropped. It has some death-defying stunts, especially the crane jump. That really sets the tone for what is to come. This movie has almost everything! Twists, action, tons of suspense, treachery, betrayal and a finale that will excite you and break your heart at the same time. This movie reeled in many Bond fans that were tired of sub par quality. They chose great location and the photography is absolutely fantastic. When you're not being wowed by chase scenes, you get some intense no- holds barred fight scenes! The action is spaced out beautifully. Rarely does a movie click with everything! Even the storytelling is damn near flawless. There is one scene in the Casino that was pulsating! They know how to push your buttons. Daniel Craig makes a wonderful Bond. He's suave, charismatic, but he's got a mean-streak in him that hadn't been seen since the days of Timothy Dalton. Craig is pugnacious, impulsive and cold-blooded, but not dispassionately. I enjoyed the man's show and rank him as my second favorite Bond. They also added a human element, which I thought was very touching. You don't see Bond 'truly' in love very often. Eva Green knocked my socks off with her performance as Vesper Lynd. Her beauty is one thing...but her mysterious character stole many scenes. Her chemistry with Craig is genuine and their love storyline is one for the ages. These two will tug on your heart- strings, I promise you that. She's the best Bond girl of all time and much different than the norm. Judi Dench is excellent as M! what else is new? Her banter with Craig was a hoot to watch. Mads Mikkelsen makes a great villain! I enjoyed his quirks, such as the bleeding eye, asthma...among other things. I never get tired of watching this movie! I love it that much. They outdid themselves and set a standard for future Bond films. Skyfall came close, but I don't see any Bond movies matching or outdoing this one. You won't see many action movies that click on all cylinders like this one. If you dislike this movie, seek help! I'm all for opinions, but I can't see how anyone could not like this movie. Thank you Daniel Craig! 10/10",10,0,4,27 December 2014
Before Sunrise," Absolutely delightful. Ethan Hawke & Julie Delpy make a marvelous pair
","(Credit IMDb) American tourist Jesse and French student Celine meet by chance on the train from Budapest to Vienna. Sensing that they are developing a connection, Jesse asks Celine to spend the day with him in Vienna, and she agrees. Passing the time before his scheduled flight the next morning. How do two perfect strangers connect so intimately over the course of a single day? What is that special thing that bonds two people so strongly? As their bond turns to love, what will happen to them the next morning when Jesse flies away?I've seen this movie and the sequel, After Sunset. I have yet to see Before Midnight. This movie is one of the best romance films you will ever see, simply because it is brimming with crisp dialog and creativity. It also makes sure to avoid clichés. I actually dig chick flicks, even the predictable ones. I do love it when something spontaneous and creative comes along like this. Not sure if this will appeal to female teenagers, it might move a little too slow for them, I hope I'm wrong on that. But, adults will love this movie. Another reason this movie is dynamite is because of the performances from the two leads. These are two lost souls, pining for excitement in their lives. Watching them fall in love during one night was a real treat. It wasn't just thrown on screen to make you believe their in love, I felt it. I could feel their love. Ethan Hawke isn't a favorite of mine, but he excels in a big way here. He's charming, likable, vulnerable, and witty. I enjoyed the hell out of him. Julie Delpy is his match as the stubborn, but beautiful and caring love interest. Their chemistry is top-notch. Final Thoughts: Hawke and Delpy are essentially the whole show here and they are more than up to the task. Even people who don't like romance films should appreciate this one. It's a must see9/10",9,0,0,20 February 2014

Identity," excellent thriller WARNING!!!!!!! SPOILERS!!!!!!
",excellent thriller that is very well made and has a nice creepy atmosphere throughout the film plus i was into this big time until the silly finale (in my opinion) kinda ruined it for me (i said kinda) i didn't see the need for that twist i was happy the way it was going myself. a cool engaging thriller until it brings on the silliness. I did however somewhat like the ending as it was kinda cool but also disappointing in a way. i liked all the characters well except for Clea Duvall's who's constant crying aggravated me. But other then that no beef at all with any of them i liked them all. the acting is AWESOME!!!! John Cusack is amazing here giving a wonderful performance and people say that his performance is weak watch this film again i thought he did a great job he was on the ball credible and very likable!. Ray Liotta is terrific here and was great i LOVED him even though his character was loud obnoxious and unlikable. but he always plays that role so it didn't bother me.Amanda Peet does WONDERFUL here as a you know what and was HOT!!!! to boot! she was likable and her character was full of emotion and i felt for her. Clea Duvall on the other hand i did not like she was to whiny and her constant crying irritated me. Rebecca Demornay does okay here but her character is annoying. the rest of the cast do very well especially Larry as the motel manager. overall a great thriller that would have been awesome if not for the silly second (in my opinion) half. **** out of 5,Null,0,1,16 September 2004

Live Free or Die Hard," Not perfect by any means, but definitely a lot of fun!
","One night, McClaine is asked to pick up a pesky hacker, Matt Farrell (Long) and his night is supposed to be finished. It turns out to be much more. McClaine brings Farrell to DC with him to try to stop a cyber terrorist (Olyphant) I was insanely hyped for this movie's arrival. I've been hyped before, but rarely like I was for this sequel. I'm an avid fan of the first three Die Hard movies. Die Hard 2's enjoyment has started to wane for me, Die Hard 1 and 3 are two of my favorite action movies of all time. This movie didn't live up to my unreasonable hype (How could it?!) But it did entertain me heavily. My main mistake was expecting the 'old style' of Die Hard when I first saw this. It was a little weird seeing a Die Hard movie take place in 2007. Despite how entertaining it was, it didn't feel like a Die Hard movie when I first watched it. Everything was far too modern and advanced. Upon further viewings of this movie, this is no longer an issue. I've seen it 4 times since it first came out, and I always manage to enjoy it a lot. The action delivers in a big way. McClaine was beginning his transition from lucky to Superman, but the action scenes are great. There is a great one with a lot of vehicle carnage in a tunnel. Another good one is in the finale. It's ridiculously OTT, but it provides a lot of thrills. If you love action like I do, you won't be disappointed. I do think they could have gone further with cyber terrorism. That's a minor carp though. Bruce Willis is as dependable as ever as McClaine. He hadn't lost a step and he was a joy to watch. There aren't many things better than watching McClaine do his thing. When Willis is motivated, he's always a blast to watch. Justin Long is Bruce's match. His incessant whining entertained me. I also loved his chemistry with Willis. I was really disappointed he wasn't brought back for the 5th sequel. Timothy Olyphant is decent as the villain. His intensity is surprisingly lacking and he was weirdly subdued for his standards. He has flashes of brilliance, but I felt he could have done more with the part. Maggie Q plays a sexy badass! Not much more to it. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is fine as McClaine's daughter, but her part is a bit thin. I also thought the estranged relationship with McClaine could have been more powerful. Kevin Smith is OK. I did wonder why they didn't add Bonnie Bedelia! I wanted my Holly fix.I watch this at least once a year and proudly own it on DVD! It may not have been what I hoped for, but it's a solid action movie without a doubt. The action is tremendous, the storytelling is good enough to keep your attention. It may not be the sequel we deserved, but I like it anyway! It's certainly better than parts 2 and 5. 7.3/10",7,2,3,10 May 2015
X2: X-Men United," 'Sharing the world has never been humanity's defining attribute' One of the best superhero films ever made
","After Magneto has been imprisoned in an impregnable plastic chamber, the whitehouse is invaded by a mutant named 'The Nightcrawler' His assassination attempt on the president goes awry. Meanwhile, Logan is trying to regain his memory to find out where he comes from. His former nemesis, William Stryker breaks into Prof. Xavier's school, while Magneto escapes with help from Mystique. It isn't very often that a sequel transcends it's predecessor, but X2 manages to not only surpass it, but in a huge way. Despite that the movie is over 130 minutes, it never feels overlong. As a matter of fact, it leaves you wanting more. It is completely exhilarating. The first X-Men was very exciting itself, but this one takes it up several notches. What I was most impressed about is how the story manages to be as strong as the astounding action (That plane sequence in the finale is incredible with Storm & Jean working their magic with their respective powers). I love action movies, but the action usually ends up making the film. The writers deserve all the credit in the world, along with Bryan Singer's amazing direction. It is a really multi-layered storyline. Despite that it was for selfish purposes, I got a kick out of seeing Magneto on the good guy side, and some characters that didn't get a chance to shine as much as I'd have liked in the first get to do so here, like Storm, Bobby, and a couple of others.Hugh Jackman is as wonderful as ever as Wolverine. His anti-hero routine never gets old. The love triangle between Logan, Jean & Scott continued even further. Patrick Stewart doesn't have much to do but succumb to Stryker's son, Jason. Ian McKellen is a treat to watch as Magneto. Not only he is menacing with his performance, but creepy at times as well. Halle Berry had a little more to play with in this film. I would have liked to seen even more, but i'm happy with what I got. Famke Janssen is beautiful in more ways than one. Her character would be elevated even further in X3: The Last Stand with her alter ego, Phoenix. Kelly Hu is certainly cool looking, even if her character doesn't have a lot of depth. That being said, she didn't need any depth. Her battle with Wolverine was impressive. Brian Cox is excellent as the cunning Stryker. I'm not sure why they didn't bring him back for Wolverine, but they should have. William Stryker's character has just as, if not bigger part in Wolverine. Alan Cumming adds intrigue with his Nighcrawler character. Anna Paquin, Rebecca Romijn, James Mardsen (Fantastic emotional scene at the end) Aaron Stanford, Shawn Asmore all do what they have to do extremely well. Final Thoughts: This is one of the best superhero films you will ever see. It is up there with The Avengers, Spiderman II, Superman & Superman II. I consider X-Men to be a fantastic movie in its own right, but this one completely outdoes it. The action is completely exhilarating, the storyline is very engrossing, and it has plenty of great humor as well. I would have to call this film the complete package. It would take a big step back with the overblown X-Men III, sadly. 9.4/10",9,1,2,20 January 2014
Lucy," Mixed feelings on this one!
","Critics weren't overly fond of this movie...and moviegoers seemed to be divided on it general. That being said, it made a ton of money at the box office, becoming a hit in the process. I was mixed on the movie overall. For such a thought-provoking premise, they didn't delve nearly enough into it. Luc Besson had a ton of unique material on his hands, but i'm not sure he fully knew where to go with everything. I usually don't like it when movies are two hours long, but this one definitely could have used a longer running time. Honestly? the first 45-50 minutes are well done and very entertaining. The second half is when things begin to unravel and become overly silly. The ending felt like a rip off! It ended very abruptly and very anti-climatically in my opinion. I wouldn't say it's filled with action, but there is certainly enough to satisfy the adrenaline junkies. The acting is fun, I'll say that. Johansson is fantastic as the lead! She's forced to become monotonous for a lot of the movie, but I felt it added to the atmosphere. She put her all into the role and I thought she did an excellent job! Morgan Freeman is OK, but doesn't have that much to do. We all have bills to pay! This was clearly a paycheck role for him. I wouldn't say this was worth watching in theaters, but it's worth a look on DVD or Blu-Ray. I was never bored and the first half is especially good. It's too bad the second half got way too silly. 6.4/10",6,1,5,16 September 2014

RED," R.E.D= Retired & Extremely Dangerous
","I've been spoiled rotten with action films as of late, when it comes to all star casts. Red is refreshingly creative in its approach, and never has a boring moment. When you have a cast like this one does, it's pretty hard to mess it up, but I was very pleased with it. The fact that it never takes itself very seriously works in its favor. The energy of the cast just seems to permeate throughout. They feed off one another. I wouldn't exactly call this a mainstream action movie. It's a bit quirky at times, but those that are willing to delve into it, will be richly rewarded with a really fun action movie. It does have some enjoyably silly things like Bruce Willis, walking out of a vehicle, unscathed while it's spinning out of control, so he can shoot someone. It has plenty of great explosions, and good fight scenes, especially one involving Bruce Willis & Karl Urban in an office. It was hard hitting and rather nasty. So the mainstream fans will have stuff to enjoy as well. I really liked the dialog. It was intelligent and witty. Bruce Willis is clearly having a blast with this film. He actually plays it low-key for the most part. He had some terrific lines, and was the perfect man to lead this movie. His chemistry with Mary-Louise Parker was a lot of fun. Parker is great as the damsel in distress. I've not seen much of her over the years, but she always impresses me with her acting skills, when I do. Morgan Freeman is hilarious as the cancer stricken patient, who wants to go out in a blaze of glory. Helen Mirren is as classy as they come, and has that special something, not many other actresses do. John Malkovich is delightfully hammy. He stole every scene he was in. Karl Urban plays his oblivious part very well. Aside from Brian Cox's accent, I enjoyed his chemistry with Helen Mirren. Final Thoughts: This is a really fun movie. It's easy to see why it became somewhat of a surprise hit. The energy of the cast is infectious. I'm looking forward to Red 28/10",8,1,2,2 December 2013
Final Destination," All the pointless sequels have diminished it's impact a little bit, but this still remains a great Horror film.
","Final Destination remains one of my favorite Horror films that I have in my collection. At the time a plot like this was not only unheard of, but absolutely frightening as well. It wasn't just about who could get killed off in the most brutal ways, or how many buckets of blood they could spray when a death scene hit our screens, at one time it wasn't just about making money, Final Destination was once scary. In a sense I do believe Death has a design planned for all of us, so that only made things more scarier for me in the end. Everyone fears death, even the people who say they don't, deep down they do and to see Death going out of its way to kill these characters off, it just sends chills down your spine. The opening airplane sequence has to be one of the most inventive and scariest openings I have ever seen. Just the way they had Alex|Sawa| dream it before hand, and then to have it happen after was brilliant in my opinion. When you 1st watch it it's really unpredictable on who will live, and who will die. We have a feeling who may live and who may die, but it's never fully clear. Final Destination wasn't always a money-making machine, Final Destination used to be scary, and now that 10 years have passed, I can say it still holds up well.Performances. Devon Sawa does very well as Alex. He displays all the right emotions, and has all the ingredients to make the perfect hero. His relationship with Clear, and his chemistry with her was the key to the movie in many ways. Ali Larter is gorgeous without a doubt, but she also gives a fantastic performance to boot. It's really nice to see a horror film heroine who doesn't have all the predictable clichés tagged on her. Kerr Smith is grating to watch, but that's because the way his character is written. He's always bullying people, he's always angry, always bitching about something, I was surprised they left him on as long as they did. Kristen Cloke plays emotional very well, but after a while I wanted to slap her one to snap her out of it. Chad Donella plays Alex's best friend to a T, why couldn't they have let him survive a little longer?. Seann William Scott plays his usual comedy routine, only a little less arrogant, and it's in a Horror film, I like him but it isn't much of a stretch for him. Tony Todd is basically playing his Candyman part in his cameo.Bottom line. Final Destination's impact has dwindled over the years a bit, due to all the pointless sequels, but it still remains an original and fine Horror film. Smartly written and most importantly scary, see it.8/10",8,1,2,2 April 2010
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," I thought Two Towers couldn't be duplicated, I was dead wrong.
","Return Of The King is one of those rare movies, that I have so much trouble coming up, with a decent review, because I'm absolutely speechless. Return Of The King is also one of the rare films, that actually surpass the hype!. I have rarely been so emotionally exhausted in my life time!. It's a known fact, that I dislike Fellowship, but adored Two Towers, so I had high hopes for this one. Return Of The King has so much action going on, it's honestly hard to keep up. There is something going on at every turn, with unbearable suspense. All the characters are even better this time around, especially Frodo. I was amazed at some of the selfishness he had this time around, instead of the goody two shoes routine he usually did, it made for some really gripping suspense. The performances are absolutely incredible for the most part, everybody has truly grown up. I avoided the Lord Of The Ring series, for so many years because of the constant over hype people gave the series. Well It's nice to be proved wrong once in a while, and Return Of The King especially, shut me up but quick.Bottom Line. Return Of The King is a masterpiece plain and simple. It's one of the best movies in the history of cinema, and I thank Peter Jackson, for giving me 3 or so hours, of wonderful cinema. The Two Towers is a masterpiece itself, but it does not compare to the brilliance of this one. Even if you aren't a fan of the genre, this is still an absolute must watch.10/10",10,0,3,28 January 2010
A Night at the Roxbury," Mediocre SNL Comedy, that's Unfunny and quite tiring
","A Night At The Roxbury is very unfunny, as It took me a while to get through it, as I was only amused a couple of times, and it gets quite silly when the brothers get into a huge fight and way too sappy, plus while Chris Kattan, and Will Ferrell make a good team are way too annoying, as I just felt like slapping them, plus what was a quality character actor like Dan Hedaya doing in this he was OK but I often wondered why.The soundtrack is great no doubt about that, and it has a decent cast, but the problem is gets too tiresome way too quickly and never once did I laugh out loud, plus The ending was pretty stupid in my opinion. Most of the Saturday Night live movies are pretty lame in my opinion, as they get too tiresome too quickly, and I just don't find 2 morons bopping there heads throughout amusing, plus Thankfully Will Ferrell has moved onto bigger and better things. Overall this is an Unfunny tiresome film that I say you pass on unless you have something better to do. *1/2 out of 5. The Acting is OKWill Ferrell is OK here but not as funny as usual, he also tends to over do it at times, and I just found his character more irritating then anything else, not one of his better performances. Chris Kattan is even more annoying he is so unlikable and selfish, I just didn't find anything funny about him. Richard Grieco plays well himself. Loni Anderson and Dan Hedaya are amusing but not much else as the parents. Lochlyn Munro is unfunny in his role I didn't laugh once. Molly Shannon is somewhat amusing, but never laugh out loud funny as Emily who is obsessed with Ferrell. The rest do OK as cameos and short roles",4,1,6,21 June 2007
The Purge," This was unlikable, boring, and unpleasant. I almost fell asleep
","Why did people make this a box office hit? To be perfectly honest with you, I wasn't looking forward to this one. It seemed like a variation of The Strangers to me, and I was also reading a lot of poor reviews. I finally gave it a go, and it's what I expected. The potential is certainly there. If done right, home invasion story lines always manage to get to me, simply because your home is where you are supposed to be the most secure. The thought of psychopathic people invading your home is terrifying. I also liked the idea of allowing a purge (including murder) for a 12 hour period. It could have been lethal and memorable, but the execution is extremely flat, and I was bored silly. They did a decent job in The Strangers, but they really missed the boat with this one. I felt it lacked the proper suspense to really be effective, and there is nobody to root for. Ethan Hawke's character is almost as bad as the people invading his home. I understand wanting to save your family, but throwing a homeless man to the wolves? His character improves in the second half, but it was too little too, too late for me. I had trouble connecting to any of the Sandin family members. Ethan Hawke came across as a little too abrasive and blasé for me. It's not that he performed badly, but his character put a bad taste in my mouth. Lena Headey comes across as a bit better as the wife. I felt more sympathy for her. There isn't much gore to speak of, but we do get some nasty moments. We get some harsh gunshot wounds, and a really nasty broken nose, which made me cringe a bit. The ending was also underwhelming. A sequel has apparently been green-lit. Let's just say I don't approve of that, and I really hope they change their mind on it. I didn't like this movie at all, but others may feel differently4/10",4,5,6,5 November 2013

Casino," EXCELLENT movie but it's a bit too long and it can't match Goodfellas!
","EXCELLENT movie but it's a bit too long and it can't match good fellas. The story for the most part is very engrossing and it had 3 great main leads and they were all a lot of fun to watch. But this does tend to drag at times and it's a bit long in the tooth, however it's still an excellent movie, with great characters and lots of harsh violence. The direction is AWESOME and very stylish with some very cool camera work, Martin Scorsese is one of the best of all time as far as i am concerned. There is TONS of bloody violence. We get vicious bloody stabbings in the neck with a pen , bloody hammer hit to the hand Lot's harsh bloody beatings, bloody gunshot wounds, 4 graphic bloody gunshot wounds to the head with blood and brains splattering, slit throat more bloody beatings and some EXTREMELY bloody beatings with a baseball bat. The acting is almost Oscar worthy. Robert Deniro gives an EXTREMELY good performance here he had a lot of powerful scenes with Sharon Stone and he was quite marvelous. Sharon Stone is just as good she gives a dynamic performance and is STUNNINGLY GORGEOUS to boot, although she actually freaked me out when she went all crazy. Joe Pesci basically plays the same character he did in Goodfellas and did another Marvelous job!. James Woods is always great here is no different but he was kinda wasted. Overall a MUST see just don't expect another Goodfellas! ****1/2 out of 5",9,0,1,27 December 2004
Hart's War," Very solid war film, that's quite engaging, with a good story, and fantastic performances!
","This is a very solid war film, that's quite engaging, with a good story and fantastic performances!. All the characters are great, and extremely likable, plus Bruce Willis is simply amazing in this!. The ending is very powerful, and quite sad, and it had a pretty cool unexpected plot twist as well, plus Colin Farrell surprised me here once again by giving another top notch performance!. The court scenes are actually pretty interesting, and this one works more on story then War action, plus it's very well made and written as well. Don't expect Bruce to be the main star in this film,granted he does have a fair amount of screen time, but Colin Farrell is definitely the star in this movie, plus Terrence Howard is especially good in his role as Scott!. I did find it a little strange that the Nazi's were so nice to the soldiers, and it did drag in certain spots, but it was never boring, and quite engaging most of the way, plus it will keep you guessing throughout. This is a very solid war film, that's quite engaging, with a good story and fantastic performances, I highly recommend this one!. The Direction is great!. Gregory Hoblit does a great! job here, with very good camera work, solid angles and keeping the film at an engaging pace for the most part. The Acting is top notch!. Bruce Willis is amazing as always and is amazing here, he is intense, very likable a very honorable man, and while he is not the star in this film, he still put on a very powerful performance, and the scenes involving him and Farrell were especially good! (Willis Rules!!!!!!!). Colin Farrell is in top form here, he is very emotional, focused, had some standout scenes with Willis, had a great character, and this was his film, he is seriously beginning to grow on me!. Terrence Howard is very impressive here as Scott, he was really likable, and had some very good lines, I liked him a lot. Cole Hauser is very good as the asshole Bedford and did his job very well. Marcel Iures is good as the main villain. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall I highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5",8,7,10,24 January 2006

","This is a great football comedy, that's quite amusing, with fun performances and some funny football action!. All the characters are cool, and the story is good as well, plus Keanu Reeves is simply amazing in this!. The cheer leading auditions were quite funny, and I thought this was pretty well made and written as well, plus Gene Hackman is wonderful in his role as the coach!. I tend to enjoy most Football movies because I am a fan of the sport, so this one was no different, and I thought Brett Cullen played the dick real well as the greedy QB Martel! plus Reeves and Brooke Langton had very good chemistry together. All the characters are extremely likable (except Martel), and while it won't have you falling down in laughter or anything, it will manage to keep amused through it's running time, plus while the ending is predictable it still was pretty cool!. It is somewhat underrated and I thought Reeves was perfect for the lead role! plus if you don't take the football action seriously, you should enjoy it!. This is a great football comedy, that's quite amusing, with fun performances, and some funny football action, I highly recommend this one!. The Direction is great!. Howard Deutch does a great! job here with very good camera work and just keeping the film amusing and at a fast pace. The Acting is a lot of fun!.

The Hangover Part III," Better than the second, but that's not saying much. I hope this is the end for the series
","Alan (Zach Galifianakis) is off his medication, and continues to disappoint his parents, with his immature ways. Alan's father dies from a heart attack, and The Wolfpack gives Alan an intervention. It doesn't amount to much. They try to take Alan to a mental hospital, but the Wolfpack gets assaulted on the way, and Doug (Justin Bartha) is kidnapped. The Wolfpack is forced to try and track down Mr. Chow, so they can save Doug's lifeI loved the first movie. It was hilariously raunchy, with many memorable laughs. Then this series succumbed to sequelitis (my made up word) and ruined the original's impact a little bit. This sequel is far better than the dull second movie, but that doesn't exactly mean I'm exalting this movie. This movie has very little laughs, and it's clearly here to cash in on the franchise's immense success. Much of your enjoyment might depend on how much you enjoy the characters. I can't stand Mr. Chow, and his part seems to increase with each film, much to my chagrin. I hate Ken Jeong himself. He's got this irritating laugh, and I don't understand why people find him so funny. I've also gotten tired of Zach Galifiankis's childish character. He was hysterical in the first movie, and then he starts becoming like a lot of hilarious characters do, a caricature of himself. Am I supposed to find antics, like buying a giraffe, and watching it accidentally get decapitated on a freeway funny? It just seems like they tried to get more and more shocking with the gags as this series went on. I liked the original because it was genuinely funny. This one exploits heart attacks, and funerals, all for the sake of cheap laughs. I don't get offended very easily at all, but I was a bit irked by some of the stuff in this one. Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis, and Bradley Cooper all seem to be on autopilot here, especially Cooper. The charisma that they oozed in the first one is long gone. Bradley Cooper has that boyish charm about him, but he seems to be phoning it in. Zach Galifianakis is the main focus here for the most part, and he becomes a bit exposed. At least his character gets closure, with an admittedly amusing, glorified cameo from Melissa McCarthy. John Goodman is great, and I wish he had more screen time. Stay tuned for the end credits. It's by far the funniest thing involving this movie. I laughed my ass off. It might mean a sequel, but I truly hope not. If you're a wrestling fan like I am. There is a scene where Melissa McCarthy is watching wrestling on her T.V. You'll probably find CM Punk wrestling John Cena to be a hoot as wellFinal Thoughts: I'd recommend it over the second one for sure, but its average overall, and lazy as well. Watch the original, and call it a day. The sequels only remind you of how great the original was5/10",5,2,3,30 October 2013
Fast Five," Action fans will love it!
","O'Conner (Walker) and Mia Toretto (Brewster) successfully hatch a scheme to free Dom from going to prison. In order to properly flee from the authorities, Brian & Dom call some old friends & unlikely allies to help pull off an elaborate robbery. The only problem is that relentless federal agent, Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) stands in their way of freedom. You know what you're gonna get with these movies! I'm an adult, but I'm not afraid to say that I enjoy these movies. What else can you possibly want as far as popcorn entertainment goes? After the mediocre, Fast % Furious: Tokyo Drift, this series was in need of a reboot of sorts. The fourth installment (Fast & Furious) was very entertaining and things got back on track in a big way. Fast Five transcends it's predecessor quite easily. It's bigger, badder, and a lot of fun. There are quite a few action scenes that stand out, especially the last 20/30 minutes. I also appreciated the emotion in this one. Brian & Mia are a believable couple that are easy to sympathize with (Making Mia pregnant was a nice touch) Even Vince was brought back into the fold. A lot of effort was obviously put into this movie and I appreciated it. The performances are a hoot. Vin Diesel has never been a great actor, but his presence is undeniable. He makes a perfect anti-hero and his chemistry with Paul Walker was excellent as always. Paul Walker improved immensely since the first movie. He gives a mature performance that I enjoyed very much. Jordana Brewster is solid as the love interest. Dwayne Johnson completely stole the show in my eyes! His gruff character was a blast to watch and I relished every second he was on-screen. This guy oozes with charisma. Tyrese Gibson is a bit of a loudmouth that is alternately annoying and amusing! Ludicrous was tolerable at best. The villains are a bit underdeveloped, but the movie is so entertaining that I didn't really care. I wouldn't call myself a fan-boy of these movies, but I've enjoyed every movie in this series except for the third one. This one is filled with great action, solid storytelling, lots of cool characters, what more do you want?! I haven't seen Fast Six so I'm gonna call this the best movie in the series. Note! Make sure you stay for the end credits! There is a huge twist8.5/10",8,2,3,16 September 2014
Honey," I thought it was a below average film, buoyed by Alba's charming performance.
","Jessica Alba is a good hearted young woman, and a talented dancer. She becomes close with her mentor Michael (David Moscow) He becomes a little too close for Alba's liking, and Alba is forced to do things the hard way, and make it on her own, without his help. What is it with dancing themed films? I don't understand the appeal of them. They look cool, don't get me wrong. I enjoyed Step-Up, and its second sequel to a certain extent, but I don't get the infatuation with them. This came out before Step-Up, but it has nowhere near the competency that Step-Up has. It's thoroughly predictable, the dialog is pretty laughable at times, with plenty of tough street talk. It comes across as groan inducing more than anything else. Every time Alba would utter the line 'Your flavor is hot!' I would cringe. It wasn't very convincing. That criticism aside, I have to commend Alba for the most part. This film is very mediocre, but it could have been a complete mess if it wasn't for Alba's charming performance. Her genuine character, and determination was very easy to empathize with, and she made this movie a lot easier to digest. It doesn't hurt that she's drop dead gorgeous, either. Mekhi Phifer (Chaz) disappears for too many stretches for my liking. His love story with Alba was underdeveloped, and came across as phony and quite awkward in my opinion. Romeo Miller is extremely annoying as Benny. His gangster act got old quickly. I realize he was just a kid at the time of the release, but kid actors can be quite intolerable. David Moscow plays a great sleaze ballFinal Thoughts: If you insist on watching this. Your viewing experience will be buoyed by Alba's solid performance. It's not a very good movie though, and if you're into the dancing thing, I'd suggest watching Step- Up (the first one)4.8/10",4,0,1,27 September 2013
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Cheesy, but undeniably entertaining. It's probably my favorite Twilight film
","(Credit IMDb) As a string of mysterious killings grips Seattle, Bella, whose high school graduation is fast approaching, is forced to choose between her love for vampire Edward and her friendship with werewolf Jacob.I'm not a Twilight Junkie. I'm not on Team Edward, Team Jacob, Team Bella, or any other silly stuff like that. If you're one of those people reading this review, skedaddle! I do blame the Twilight franchise for making crazy teenagers think that this is what vampires is all about, but I'm far from a hater. The first Twilight gets blander each time you watch it. New Moon is a bit more fun, and Breaking Dawn Part 1 was at least well done for the most part. I truly feel Eclipse is the best movie of the series. While New Moon really started Bella & Jacob's feelings for one another, this movie explores it even further. I've always felt Bella & Jacob had far more chemistry with each other. Robert Pattinson is a decent actor, but his Edward Cullen character was inferior to Jacob's in my opinion. I've never read any of the books, but Bella & Jacob are far more interesting together. As decent as New Moon was, it was a bit too serious in my opinion at times. This actually has some goofy humor, which serves this movie well. Kristen Stewart is considered laconic to many, she gets plenty of meme's made about her lack of emotion on the internet, but I think she's one of the best actresses in Hollywood. Watch stuff like Cake Eaters, Yellow Handkerchief, Welcome to The Riley's, Speak, among other things, and you'll see I'm right. She's solid as usual as Bella, but some of the stuff she does made my eyes roll. She kisses Jacob because she is torn between him & Edward. She is rather promiscuous. If I was either one of them, I'd say 'Sorry, hunny. You're on your own!' It made me laugh, don't get me wrong, but it makes it hard to root for Bella as a character. Robert Pattinson is OK, and has much more screen time in this one. That's either a good, or a bad thing, depending on who you are. Taylor Lautner has some natural charm to him. He isn't necessarily a great actor, but he does have semblance of charisma. He has more to play with as well. The rest of the cast range from adequate to solidFinal Thoughts: It's cheesy as hell, but I enjoyed. There! I said it! I always give credit where credit is due, and I always try to give films a fair chance. This is entertaining, if nothing else7/10",7,1,7,3 December 2013

","This is an excellent adaption for the most part, that's very engrossing and well made, with incredible performances, only problem is the mid section is draggy. All the characters are brilliant, and the story is wonderful, plus Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt and Kirsten Dunst are all simply incredible in this!. I absolutely loved the ending as it put a big grin on my face, and I have to say Dunst stole some scenes from her co stars! plus Cruise and Pitt had excellent chemistry together. I Haven't read the book, but I really enjoyed this movie, and the set pieces were so incredible, plus all the costumes were so wonderful and lavish looking!. It's extremely well made and written, and everyone was perfectly casted in my opinion, plus it's also very bloody and violent at times too. It's often very suspenseful, and I loved Cruise's makeup as well, plus the scene where they abduct Luis, and Claudia is very disturbing and freaky. I loved the atmosphere it had as well, and I also loved the dialog as well, plus the music was great. This is an excellent adaption for the most part, that's very engrossing and well made, with incredible performances, only problem is the mid section is draggy, still I say it's a must see for everyone!. The Direction is wonderful! for the most part!. Neil Jordan does a wonderful! Job here for the most part, with brilliant camera work, excellent angles, adding some great atmosphere, using great set pieces, lavish costumes everything about it was just perfect, just the mid section was the only problem. The Acting is incredible!. Tom Cruise is amazing as always and is incredible here, he truly is Lestat, I am huge Cruise fan, but even I myself questioned the casting of him, boy did he prove me wrong in a big way, he had the arrogance,cockiness down just perfect, I also loved his dialog, and he seemed to have have a blast playing the role, he gave another top notch performance(Cruise Rules!!!!!!!!!!). Brad Pitt is also incredible here, I'm not a huge fan but he really impressed m here, he just had this sadness about him, he was also vulnerable, lonely, and intense, him and Cruise had some very powerful scenes together, and considering bot there star power, I was impressed how well they worked together, Pitt was a big reason why this film was so successful!. Kirsten Dunst is also incredible here, she steals many scenes from her co stars, and was very intense, this is quite possibly the best performance I have seen her give, I loved her!. Antonio Banderas is charming as usual and did fine as Armand, I really liked him. Christian Slater is amazing as always and is amazing here, he didn't have a whole lot of screen time as the Interviewer but was brilliant when on, he brought his usual charisma, and I thought he rocked! (Slater Rules!!!!!!!). Thandie Newton has a small role here and did OK. Rest of the cast are fine. Overall a must see for everyone!. ****1/2 out of 5",9,1,2,30 April 2006
The Ugly Truth," A bit too cynical, and mean spirited for my liking.
","The Ugly Truth passed the time for me easily enough, but it was a bit too bland tasting for my liking. I liked the idea of the message, The Ugly Truth was trying to send out, but it did it in a mean spirited way. I'm a male, but believe in the respect of a woman, and this movie basically trashes them. The crude sequence of a kid holding a vibrator remote or whatever it was in the restaurant, turned out to be more disgusting, more then anything else, completely inappropriate in my opinion. Katharne Heigl is a very charismatic actress, but she can only do so much with the material, same goes to Gerad Butler. I didn't like the concept of the movie to be honest. Having A woman lie about her true identity, and who she is, to get the guy, didn't seem true at all to me, I always believe you should be who you are. Heigl and Butler's chemistry carry this movie farther then it should have gone, because this is a pretty ugly movie, and very hard to like. It's original, and the idea had potential, but they did it for all the wrong reasons, and in the end, I didn't care for it, even if it did pass the time.Performances. Katherine Heigl is beautiful, and makes for a very charming lead, just like she did in 27 Dresses. Here she is robbed, with the nasty material, and as a result her charisma can only take her so far. Gerard Butler is a guy who i've been high on now, for quite a while. His charisma is off the charts, and manages to make a potentially unlikable character, into a heart throb for the woman, and someone to root for, with the fellow guys. Eric Winter is a somewhat likable, if a little bland love interest of Heigl's. Cheryl Hines may be familiar to 'Curb Your Enthusaism' fans, and she did fine here.Bottom line. The Ugly truth, is ugly all right, and that really hurt the film in the end for me. It's not a terrible film, far from it, just a rather average one, that's too cynical for my liking. Worth a look, but there are better Rom Com's out there.5/10",5,0,2,31 January 2010

This film is really underrated in my opinion, and there are so many explosions to enjoy as well, plus you will feel for Cage's character and root for him. It also has some good humorous moments, and I thought the ending was the best part in the film as it was so sad and very emotional, plus it's pretty well made and written. While it did have a long running time, there was so much action that it didn't bother me, and while it's not the best War film it's certainly a really good one, plus Cage had a really cool training scene in this one with him running on the beach!.

The story itself is nothing all that spectacular, despite being based on true events. You've seen this type of stuff before, but the way they managed to pull it off is what really made this movie. You may question Carter's tactics at first, but you'll soon rally behind him, and that's the powerfulness of Samuel L. Jackson's performance. The fact that he would go on strike and hold up games, simply so his players would improve academically; It's brazen, but it really got to me. His intensity was off the charts and the man was often magnetic to watch. It's a memorable performance which I rank as one of Jackson's best. Rob Brown is best known for his great performance in The Express, and he was solid as a rock here. Ashanti actually does decent here, whilst Channing Tatum makes an appearance in one of his early roles.The character that I related to the most was Junior. I empathized with his plight, and I give credit to Nana Gbewonyo for his awesome performance. It also helps that the Basketball action is very exciting to watch. It felt like I was watching a real basketball game at times, and that's one of the biggest compliments I can give itFinal Thoughts: This is an excellent film. If you love basketball, true stories, and Samuel L. Jackson, I can guarantee you will find things to like about this one. At least I hope you do8/10",8,1,1,29 August 2013
The Runaways," Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning prove the the doubters wrong in this fascinating biopic.
","Credit IMDb.In 1975, San Fernando Valley teen Joan Larkin reinvents herself as Joan Jett, a guitarist who wants to form an all-girl punk band. She pitches the idea to a sleazy manager, Kim Fowley, who pairs her with a drummer and then searches for a face: he finds Cherie Currie, at 15 the perfect jailbait image for his purpose; by luck, she can sing. Two others round out the band, 'The Runaways.' Fowley books a tour, signs them to Mercury Records, and packs them off to crowds in Japan. Seeds of conflict sprout early: Fowley puts Cherie front and center in the publicity, she's soon strung out on pills and vodka, and jealousies arise. Without adult supervision, where can Joan and Cherie end up?Even though I have a huge crush on Kristen and think she's a tremendous talent, I didn't have much hope for this movie. Joan Jett was such a dynamic individual, a one of a kind, and the fact that Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning were slated to play Joan and Cherrie worried me. Luckily the two were up to the task. The story was very engrossing, and I loved how it unfolded. This a prime example of how you should do a Biography.Performances. Kristen Stewart does her own variation of Joan Jett and I was utterly engaged by it. As I said, I am a big fan of hers, but I questioned the casting decision, wondering if she had been miscast. Turns out I was pleasantly wrong, and she delivered a great performance. She looks great with the Rocker hair too. Dakota Fanning also delivered a great show as Cherrie. She's clearly growing up, and if what I saw is a testament to the future, the future holds bright things for her. Michael Shannon steals every scene he's in with his performance. He was awesome. Scout Taylor-Compton's role isn't as big as Kristen's and Dakota's, but she did fine as Lita Ford.Bottom line. The Runaways is a great movie, it's as simple as that. To the point, engaging, and an in depth look at The Runaways. See it 8 ½ 10",8,3,7,9 April 2011

","This is a masterpiece in all aspects,John Hughes is simply put a genius!. All The Characters wonderful and you can relate to all of them, and i thought the story was fantastic, plus The cast are all simply amazing in this!.It's brilliantly written,and each character has there own special talents. Let's see you got the Wrestling Jock, The Prom queen,The trouble maker,the brain and the princess, all very 5 unique characters, all put together on a Saturday in a detention hall, in my opinion that is quite a unique premise, and John Hughes pulls it off perfectly, plus Judd Nelson cracked me up throughout the film, the only thing that bugged me was we never did get to hear the rest of his joke!. I found the closet scene quite powerful, as Gleason (Principal Vernon), delivered some harsh words for Judd (John Bender), as it also has some other great emotional moments as well, plus it leaves the viewer thinking a lot after the movie is finished.What i also liked is how all of the 4 characters constantly made Principal Vernon look like a fool (the toilet paper scene for example!), and how they always defied his orders, plus, each character had there own problems, and i really enjoyed hearing the stories all the characters told!.

Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Least In The Trilogy (In My Opinion), But Still A Fantastic Sequel, With Top Notch Performances From Ford And Connery!
","This is the least in the trilogy (In my opinion), but still a fantastic sequel, with top notch performances from Harrison Ford and Sean Connery. A lot of people consider this the best in the trilogy, while i can't agree with that, i do think it's a wonderful sequel, with lots of exciting action, plus Harrison Ford and Sean Connery, had fantastic chemistry together!. It has a few dull spots here and there (as they all do), but it's never boring, as the finale, is very exciting, plus, the main villains were very good.The effects were awesome, and it has a lot of humor in it, plus, the scene with Adolf Hitler was hilarious!. This is the least in the trilogy (In my opinion)< but it's still a fantastic sequel, and if you have not seen it, what are you waiting for? see it!. The Direction s fantastic!. Steven Spielberg does a fantastic job here, with some amazing shots, great camera work, awesome angles, excellent POV shots, and lots of other fantastic shots as well, plus he kept the film, at a very fast pace!. The Actining is amazing!. Harrison Ford is AMAZING as always, and is amazing here. He is extremely likable, funny, kicked that ass, had fantastic chemistry with Sean Connery, and was always tons of fun to watch!, he is one of my favorite actors (Ford Rules1). Sean Connery is also amazing here, he had fantastic chemistry with Ford, was very witty, added some nice comic relief, and it was just awesome to see him and Ford together in a film!. Denholm Elliott is very good here with what he has to do, i liked him. Alison Doody is decent looking, but got on my nerves, and was only adequate at best in my opinion. John Rhys-Davies is good here, and it was good to see him in the series again. River Phoenix is good as the young Indy. Overall this is the least in the trilogy(In my opinion), but it's still a fantastic sequel and you must see it this instant!. ***** out of 5",10,0,0,19 May 2005
The Bourne Supremacy," 'Get some rest Pam, you look tired'
","Jason Bourne begins a new life with Marie in India. When he figures out they are being hunted by somebody (Karl Urban) , Jason decides to take Marie, and get to safety. Marie is tragically shot in the head and killed. Jason figures Treadstone is behind it, but he's told that Treadstone is defunct. Jason is being framed for a CIA operation gone wrong. Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) is relentless in her pursuit of Jason, leaving him forced to try to clear his name. This is inferior to the original, but most sequels are! All you can ask for is some entertainment. I'm glad to say this movie offers entertainment in spades. This one may be more personal than the original. It has controlled tension, slowly building up to a crescendo. Once the action commences, it rarely stops! It's a real thrill ride that knows how to reel the viewer in. My favorite is the lengthy car chase in the finale! It's really pulse pounding. There are some really powerful scenes in this movie. The scene where Jason is underwater, realizing that Marie is dead always makes me emotional. It's debatable if Jason should have shown more emotion, but considering his cold nature, I thought it was perfect. If you look closely, you can see the emotion on his face anyway. Those that like good fight scenes will be pleased. Matt Damon is really fast with hands, and looks legitimately like a bad ass. My only carp is Paul Greengrass's shaky camera work. Some like it, but it annoys me. I hate the quick camera cuts as well. Matt Damon continues to amaze as Bourne. He's the perfect anti-hero. Very cool under pressure, and really charismatic. His no-nonsense act is a blast to watch. Franka Potente is adorable, but barely in it. I'd say she has 20 minutes. I hated that they killed her off, but I understood it. Joan Allen is solid in her role. Her naivety made things interesting, and I enjoyed her intensity as well. Brian Cox is excellent, but I predicted the twist a mile away. Stiles, Urban, Mann, are all good in their roles. Chris Cooper has a brief cameo in flashback scenes, but his 'soldier' talk felt corny. This sequel is as good as it gets! It's a great story of revenge, and how you can't change what you are. Jason is a killer, but watching him show off a humane side made for some riveting storytelling. I've seen this movie many times, and it never gets old. 8.3/10",8,2,2,20 February 2015
The Proposal," Fun at times, but the mean spirited ending completely ruined the storyline for me
","The Proposal isn't a bad Romance movie at all. I dug the chemistry between Reynolds and Sandra, it had a fair amount of laughs, and I really enjoyed the cast, but they wanna throw that all away, for that mean spirited ending?. When this came out in theaters, I had heard people calling it, the best romantic comedy in year's, so needless to say, it put a lot of hype on the movie for me. While I wouldn't say it's the best Romantic Comedy in years, I did enjoy a lot of the movie. Seeing Sandra Bullock rapping around Betty White in the woods, had to be the biggest laugh for me, it was so silly, yet so funny at the same time. SPOILERS. I didn't like the ending. Betty White faking a heart attack, to get them to stop fighting? That was way too over the top, and kinda sickening to joke about, and it really brought the enjoyment value out of it when all was said and done.Performances. Sandra Bullock can do this stuff in her sleep, luckily she's game as always. Her character is bossy, and manipulative, but I still couldn't help but love her, not to mention she looked great!. Ryan Reynolds did very well in his role. He's a likable gent, and proved why he's one of the best up and coming actors out there. Mary Steenburgen and Craig T. Nelson do fine as the parents. Betty White is funny, but her character kinda repulsed me in the end, as I already mentioned. Malin Akerman plays a nice part.Bottom line. The Proposal was a film that was decent, but not totally successful for me. I laughed a fair amount, I had a decent time, but it was ultimately forgettable in the end. Worth a watch though6 1/2 /10",6,0,1,27 February 2010
Hustle & Flow," Terrence Howard's star-making performance
","Hustle & Flow has the perfect balance of. Drama, Music, and performances. I firmly believe without the passionate performances, this movie wouldn't have been as strong as it was. Terrence Howard's character is a tad bit abrasive at times, but his heart of gold, and his never-give up mentality made the character perfect in my opinion. What really made the movie for me was it's realism.. The characters felt real, the situations seemed real, and the ending wasn't all that far-fetched either, and really made me smile. The ending is one of the best things about the movie because it wasn't all that unbelievable. You will hate Skinny for what he does, and it will certainly mess with your emotions. I firmly believe this movie isn't for everyone, due to its violent language and the fact that not everybody is into Rap. But it is worth it in my opinion.Performances. Terrence Howard is Oscar worthy here. It truly was a star-making performance, and I loved everything about his character. Despite some of his abusive and abrasive actions, he remained likable. He was the heart and soul of this film. Anthony Anderson can actually ACT!. I was shocked at his maturity and how good he was here. Taryn Manning is fantastic as the vulnerable, and often overlooked woman. I felt for her on many occasions, and thought she did a great job. DJ Qualls is excellent as well surprisingly. He injected a nice amount of humor into his part. Taraji P. Henson is solid as the love interest. She was likable and never overdid it. Ludicrous played scum perfectly. I couldn't stand him as Skinny.Bottom line. It's powerful, engrossing and a joy to watch. Don't be turned off by it, because of its subject material. Critics were 100% right about this one. A must see.9/10",9,0,1,7 September 2010
Warm Bodies," A zombie film for teens that is actually very enjoyable for adults!
","A zombie named R saves a beautiful girl named Julie, but kills her longtime boyfriend in the process when he needs to feed. After initially being reluctant to trust the Zombie, Julie learns to have fun with R. Their love story might just transform the current state of the world. I honestly wasn't expecting much with this film when it was announced. It seemed like P.G nonsense that I would dread. I started reading positive reviews for it and suddenly, my expectations began to rise. I never thought the 'friendly' zombie type could work. I'm a big believer in zombies being threatening, so naturally I thought the idea was ludicrous. Guess what? It worked in a big way. This is mainly due to the fantastic chemistry between Teresa Palmer & Nicholas Hoult. Palmer is lively and gorgeous. Hoult is an absolute star with his portrayal of R. The two manage to make it all work. I thought Rob Coddry stole the show as a fellow zombie. He's proving to be one of the best comedic actors going today. It isn't just the acting, it's the story as well. Don't be warded off by the P.G rating. It is genuinely a very heartwarming film. You'll find yourself smiling throughout the movie. My only major carp is the ending itself. I thought they rushed things a little bit, and they could have gone a lot farther with it. It was still enjoyable, though. 8.5/10",8,1,2,15 January 2014
Cinderella Man," Wonderful Underdog Story,With Fantastic Direction,And Oscar Worthy Performances!
","This is a wonderful underdog story, with fantastic direction and Oscar worthy performances!. Due to all the hype surrounding it i decided to check it out for myself, and i must say i wasn't disappointed due to the Oscar worthy performances from Russel Crowe and Renée Zellweger, and the extremely engrossing story!.It's heartwarming, and all the Boxing matches were great plus, the ending will have you standing up and cheering!. It helps that Russel Crowe's character is so likable, and the chemistry between him and Zellweger is amazing, plus you may shed a few tears (i didn't). It was very sad due, to they didn't have any heat or food, and i was rooting them on all the way, plus the last fight is a knockout!. Craig Bierko is very menacing as the main opponent,and the story is completely fascinating, plus this is surely to be up for best Picture!. This is a wonderful Underdog story, with an extremely engrossing story, and Oscar Worthy performances you must see it now!. The Direction is fantastic!. Ron Howard does a fantastic job here, although the camera work was a little shaky, it's still excellent, and i loved the angles, plus he kept the film at a very engrossing pace!, fantastic job. The Acting is No doubt Oscar Worthy!. Russel Crowe is AMAZING here,he is extremely extremely likable, vulnerable, had amazing chemistry with Zellweger, was fascinating to watch, and really did an Oscar Worthy Job!. Renée Zellweger is also AMAZING here, she is extremely likable, had amazing chemistry with Crowe, and while she didn't have as much to do as Crowe did, she still gave a memorable Oscar worthy performance in my opinion. Paul Giamatti is brilliant as The Manager, and had some awesome dialog, i loved him!, he should definitely be up for best supporting actor!. Craig Bierko is excellent as the menacing opponent, and his job extremely well. Bruce McGill is good as the greedy asshole. Connor Price,Ariel Waller and Ariel Waller are all excellent and likable as the children. Overall You must see this now!. while Rocky is still my favorite i loved this one too! ***** out of 5",10,1,3,9 June 2005
Valkyrie," Certainly intense at times, but I wasn't fully satisfied like I should have been.
","Let me just state for the record, that I find the Hitler era to be fascinating. I disliked Hitler's methods, I thought he was a ruthless human being, I didn't agree with his leading style, but the man was fascinating. Tom Cruise wasn't an issue for me, the man almost always delivers, the only thing I didn't like was he didn't put on an accent. This is not an action thriller, it's a carefully plotted suspense thriller, that moves slowly but surely with a great buildup to it, well some of the time anyway. My big gripe with Valkyre was I didn't get enough information as to why Stauffenberg was so intent on destroying Hitler. I mean I knew why, but I was really hoping for more emphasis on that, that's why I was so disappointed, even though I enjoyed many bits of it. The ending is not a fun one, in fact it's very powerful and saddening, it will hit you that's for sure.Bottom line. Valkyire is interesting and engaging at points, slow moving and disappointing at others. I craved more then what I got, and in the end I became only half full. It's well worth a look though.6 1/2 /10",6,1,1,22 March 2010
The Soloist," Great performances, but it's nowhere near as deep as it likes to believe it is.
","The Soloist disappointed me in many ways. The performances are not a problem, Robert Downey Jr. and Jamie Foxx are both absolutely tremendous, but the movie itself is good at best. When this 1st arrived on the scene, I think a lot of people expected awards and nominations for best actor for both, but in the end it really didn't live up to the high expectations it had for itself. The main problem with The Soloist for me was it felt too cold a lot of the time. As much of the pain I felt for Nathaniel|Foxx| I had a lot of trouble warming up to him, and despite the fact that Steve Lopez|Downey| changes a bit neat the end, I also questioned his motives many times. I was also a bit frustrated that I didn't get all the background info I wanted for Nathaniel. I wanted to learn more, I desired more, and I suppose I shouldn't gripe too much but I wanted more with that. This movie is good, but if it didn't have the performances of Downey Jr. and Foxx, I truly believe this would be above average at best.Performances. Jamie Foxx is one of the best working actors in Hollywood today, and he can chalk up another brilliant performance here. His ticks that he had, the little nervous rambles, the way he looked it was just amazing. My only complaint was I felt a little cold by his character sometimes. Robert Downey Jr. is great here. His suave characteristics and his charisma are hard to match these days, and once again gave an engaging show.Bottom line. The Soloist was a good, but underwhelming film in my opinion. It tries so hard to be Oscar worthy, that I think it tried too hard at times. It's well worth a viewing, but don't expect an Oscar worthy show.7/10",7,0,0,2 April 2010
Dodgeball," Pretty Funny Comedy, That Benefits From A Great Cast!
","This is a pretty funny comedy that benefits from a great cast!. It had a lot of laughs lots of likable characters, and an amusing finale, predictable but amusing. It never takes itself seriously, and Stiller is excellent, plus the film had a lot of cool cameo's. Some of the jokes were a miss, but most of them were pretty funny, and it's good natured. It's predictable at times, but this mostly a pretty funny time that made me laugh quite a bit. The Directing is pretty good. Rawson Marshall Thurber, does a pretty good job here with keeping the film at a good pace, good lighting, great use of colors, and overall he did a solid job!. The Acting is very good!. Vince Vaughn does a great job here, he is likable, a good leader, and goo in the acting department, he is a very Versatile Actor and was perfect for this part!. Ben Stiller is HILARIOUS as always, and was great here, he could be an ass at times, but he was likable, and cracked me up. Christine Taylor is GORGEOUS!, and does very well, and had decent chemistry with Vaughn, and it's funny that her and Stiller are married in Real life!. Rip Torn does a very good job here, as the coach i liked him. Justin Long is funny, and very likable in a geeky sort of way. Stephen Root is very funny as usual and plays the usual nerd role. Joel Moore did what he had to do well. Chris Williams had a few funny lines but didn't have that much to do. Alan Tudyk is very funny here, especially in that Pirate getup!. Gary Cole is good as the Announcer, he is also an excellent character actor!. Lance Armstrong,Chuck Norris,William Shatner,David Hasselhoff do great in there cameo's. And Julie Gonzalo is very cute, and did her job well, as the cheerleader. Overall i highly recommend this one, it's good for a night of laughs! ***1/2 out of 5",7,0,0,4 February 2005
The Martian," I wasn't overly fussy about it to be honest...
","(Credit IMDb)During a manned mission to Mars, Astronaut Mark Watney is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew. But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meager supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive.The Martian was a major disappointment for me. Mars looks fantastic and everything looks great, but I wasn't able to ever fully get into it like I wanted to. It never felt like Matt Damon was in any true danger to me despite how it was presented otherwise. It tries way too hard to be epic and that's one of the reason it fails. I also felt it lacked suspense. One thing Gravity did well was deliver suspense, but The Martian doesn't. This surprised me a lot because Ridley Scott is a master at suspense. Even though I didn't really go nuts over this movie like a lot of people did, Matt Damon is fantastic. He holds the film together with his excellent performance. I can't really say the same for the rest. Everybody else isn't developed that well. Jessica Chastain is a very capable actress, but she isn't given much to do as I'd hoped. Wiig, Daniels, Bean, Mara, Ejiofor all do fine in the roles they are given. Ejiofor and Mara shine the most out of the people I listedThis movie has its moments, but I was very disappointed overall. It looks great, Damon is superb, but I wasn't in love with it like so many others. Hopefully I'm not alone 6/10",6,27,55,15 January 2016
Law Abiding Citizen," A hit and miss for my liking, with an abrupt ending.
","Law Abiding Citizen was a fairly entertaining watch for me, mainly due to the masterful performances from Jamie Foxx and Gerard Butler. I really dug the opening to Law Abiding Citizen, because not only was it powerful but eye-opening as well, seeing Gerard break down over what happened to his family was heartbreaking. What bugged me about Law Abiding Citizen was it's annoying inconsistency with its pacing. It really seemed to drag on at a few points by being too talky, and it left me looking at the clock to see how much time was left. Also I had trouble feeling sympathy for Gerard or Jamie's characters because of them were quite selfish in many ways. Gerard's took it way too far to prove his point to the point where I stopped feeling sympathy for him, I don't believe in killing innocent people. Jamie's character was always in it for himself, not really thinking of what Gerard wanted and became more and more stubborn through the film until the end. The ending itself just seemed to be all thrown together, and as a result I didn't get the payoff I wanted.Performances. Jamie Foxx is excellent as Nick. He's ruthless with a good heart at the same time, though his increasing stubbornness and his unlikable character at times had me having problems relating to him. Gerard Butler gives one of the most intense performances I've seen in a while. While I didn't agree with his actions and therefore it ruined some of the experience for me, his performance was nothing short of outstanding, and I especially loved his confrontations with Jamie at the prison.Bottom line. Law Abiding Citizen has it's entertaining moments, but its too inconsistent for my liking. It had a promising start, and the potential was there, I just couldn't relate to the movie as a whole. It's worth a look to pass the time, just keep your expectations low.6/10",6,3,4,22 April 2010
Up in the Air," Honestly? I didn't get what all the fuss was about, even if I did enjoy the performances.
","Up in the Air is a well made movie, it's acted wonderfully it's just a lot of time it just seemed to be very bland for my tastes. For starters I didn't really feel satisfied with the whole story set up and in the end it didn't really go anywhere either. Ryan Bingham's character isn't that easy to root for. He fires people on a daily basis doesn't seem to show really any remorse from it, and he seems to be quite self-centered until Vera Farmiga's character shows up. The movie itself is very cold, watching all these decent people get laid off from their jobs wasn't very fun at all to watch, it's just a very depressing movie in my opinion. While George Clooney isn't a favorite of mine, he can be quite a good actor when presented with the right script, but it just seemed to be trying too hard, and I had trouble getting into all the hype. Anna Kendrick is by far the best hidden thing about this movie, and her performance was absolutely fantastic. Up in the Air is yet another major Oscar contender that has disappointed me, I just didn't see the point in it all, even if it had its moments.Performances. George Clooney's charisma is enough to get you by the movie, but his character is distant from the world, and he is really hard to garner sympathy for. Vera Farmiga is good when she's on-screen, but her actions at the end disgusted me. Anna Kendrick is adorable plain and simple, her character is the reason I was able to enjoy a bit of this. Lots of famous faces appear like Sam Elliot, J.K Simmons, Danny McBride.Bottom line. I know I've not given more criticism than praise to Up in the Air, but that does not mean I think it's a bad movie, it just left me feeling very cold. It's well worth a viewing just don't expect an Oscar worthy one.7/10",7,1,2,4 May 2010
V for Vendetta," Not for everyone, that's for sure. I personally found it to be provocative & unique.
","Hmmm, I'm not too sure what I fully thought of this one. It's definitely a provocative and interesting movie, but unlike any comic book movie I've ever seen. I appreciated its originality and authenticity. It's a fantastic visual experience, and heavily stylized. It also had me thinking about it after it was over, so that means it was a very effective movie. I wouldn't exactly say I enjoyed it though. It's a bit too heavy-handed and dark for my liking. The leads are not your typical heroes either. They are very much the definition of anti-heroes. Hugo Weaving is not exactly very sympathetic as V. He does things a hero shouldn't do, and that's what made him so fascinating. He is filled with regret, remorse, and pain. His chemistry with Portman is what really made this movie. Weaving was excellent, but it's Natalie Portman who deserves the most praise. Her character goes through many stages of emotions, and she nailed every one of them with perfection. Her transformation in the second half speaks volumes about her range as an actress. I adored her. Stephen Rea is very good as well as the relentless detective who uncovers how corrupted the government is becoming. It does have some scintillating action scenes, but it's more about character development than anything else. Final Thoughts: It's a very interesting film, and one that stuck with me. That being said, I don't think I'll ever watch it again. It's got skill to spare, and the acting is fantastic, but it's not something that requires multiple viewings for me. I've had my fill. Do I recommend it? Absolutely! 8/10",8,0,1,18 September 2013
Furious 7," Insanity doesn't even begin to describe it!
","I'm not gonna lie! I love this franchise. Aside from the third movie, I enjoy each one of them. You can't ask for much more when it comes to action movies. This series has always been a box office attraction, but the real story is Paul Walker's tragic death. I remember being really saddened when I read about his untimely death. He had come such a long way as an actor. He was getting better and better, and the sky was the limit for him. I was so pumped to go see this movie! My expectations were pretty high. I'm happy to say that it not only met my expectations, but transcended them as well. If you're looking for a great story, look elsewhere! This movie isn't about that. It has plenty of emotion and a decent enough story for this type of thing, but this puppy is all about action. I thought after the 6th one, they had nowhere to go after it. What else could they possibly do, how could they top themselves? Well, they did it! In convincing fashion. This is like 5 action movies in one. If you think you've seen it all, you haven't! There are action scenes in this movie that I didn't think were possible. They are incredibly unbelievable and WAY OTT, but undeniably exhilarating. I thought some of the situations they got out of in the 5th and 6th movies were ridiculous, this one takes the cake. It rarely gives you a chance to breathe! Just when you settle down, along comes another action scene to amaze you. As an adrenaline junkie, I loved every second of it. I'm not gonna list all of them, but I'll mention a couple. One involves Brian and a huge truck at the edge of a cliff. It's completely implausible, but I was on the edge of my seat! Another involves Dom and his destruction of vehicles. I won't spoil them, but they are memorable. The acting is solid! Vin won't ever be known as a great actor, but he has a lot of presence and charisma. He is always reliable in these movies. Paul Walker is really good as Brian. I was really happy with the tribute they did for him at the end. It was very moving and touching. The Rock (Dwayne Johnson) Is a hoot as Hobbs. It sucks that he didn't have as much screen time, but his crazy antics were a blast to watch! Great lines as well. Michelle Rodriguez isn't the Letty we know. She's damaged and vulnerable. I'm so used to seeing Michelle playing bad-ass roles, so it was cool. Jason Statham is a fun villain. You know what to expect when it comes from him. Kicking ass and taking names. Jordana Brewster doesn't have much to do, but she was good. As a huge Kurt Russell fan, it was a treat to see him again. He was hilarious and a lot of fun to watch. Ludicrous and Tyrese Gibson do well in their roles. Special mention to Tony Jaa and Ronda Rousey! Tony Jaa actually gets a chance to showcase his phenomenal skill set. His fight scenes with Paul Walker will get your adrenaline going. I hate sitting in a theater for over two hours, but it was completely worth it. You don't have time to get fidgety in your seat. There is so much going on that you'll be glued to the screen. I'm not sure if they should do an 8th movie or not. If they make one, I'll be more than happy to see it! But I think this was the perfect ending to this franchise. Whether it's the end or not, thank you for some great entertainment. 9/10",9,87,116,10 April 2015
The Godfather," It is indeed a true classic and one of the best films out there however best movie of all time i would have to say NO! *Spoilers*
","It is indeed a true classic and one of the best movies out there, however best movie of all time i would have to say no. It does indeed deserve it's reputation as one of the best movies of all time, however based on the fact it was number 1 on the IMDb top 250 i was a tad disappointed. I was fascinated by it's very engrossing story telling, the absolutely stunning performances and the incredible direction from Francis Ford Coppola . It's a pretty powerful movie with a lot of disturbing moments. It starts of a little slow but once it gets going it never fails to grip you. The direction is Incredible. Apart from the slow beginning the direction is flawless, with an EXCELLENT pace,awesome camera work and the way the camera moved with the characters it was great!, plus he created a great atmosphere!. There is LOTS of bloody violence. We get LOTS of EXTREMELY bloody gunshot wounds, knife in the hand, bloody gunshot wound to the head,severed horse head in someone's bed (VERY bloody), a harsh beating and , an very gory gunshot wound to the eye. The Acting is some of the best i have ever seen. Marlon Brando without a doubt deserved his Oscar for his groundbreaking performance, however having said all that Al Pacino deserved the Oscar just as much, it also was hard to understand what Brando was saying at times!. Al Pacino's performance was just as good and was also deserving of The Oscar, he and Brando had some cool scenes together and watching Pacino was just plain fun to watch!. James Caan was EXCELLENT here in his scenes here and wish he had more screen time , he is a terrific actor!. Robert Duvall is very good here with what he had to do i liked him lots. Diane Keaton is excellent here as Pacino's wife and had awesome chemistry with Pacino. Talia Shire was very good here but went a little crazy at times and she sure broke a lot of dishes! (LOL, and the rest of the cast did a tremendous job as well. Overall this indeed a true classic and one of the best movies out there however i was expecting a little too much and was a tad disappointed however i HIGHLY suggest you buy or rent this now just don't go in expecting it to be the best of all time (although a lot of viewers will probably think it is). ***** out of 5",10,7,13,1 January 2005
