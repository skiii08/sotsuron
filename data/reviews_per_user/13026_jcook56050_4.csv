The Blair Witch Project," Documentary gives it a 3
","Honestly, at some age many of us are scared of going into the woods. But, for those of us who have been there at night with some preparation, it's really not that scary. The creatures come out to do what evolution and nature have given them the tools to do. In the winter, it's quiet, peaceful, and no senseless screaming. I kept watching and watching expecting someone in this acting group to calm down, look around them, assess their situation, and do something about saving what would have otherwise been a nice little outing. Alas, these bimbos kept whipping themselves into a self induced psychological frenzy; you know, the type that might get people killed. The real torture for me was trying to stay with the film until the end.That said, I do recognize the elements of film making here that may have appealed to the, supposedly, young audience that fed the hype machine. 'The Blair Witch' breaks several of the cardinal rules that ran Hollywood motion pictures since the early history of film. Yet, the fact that it hyped its way to a huge profit will be the only footnote listed in the history books. It just doesn't stand up to good storytelling.Finally, one last observation. I gave this movie a 3 for one reason; I found the documentary about the Blair Witch Legend to be passable. However, for those of us from Tennessee, the parallels and similarity to our 'Bell Witch Legend' is so obvious it's almost insulting. But, take heart. No one in Hollywood has yet made a passable film of our legend yet.I read today that the producers have announced they may make a sequel to the film. Be careful when you go back into the woods guys. I hear that the Hollywood money machine still lurks in the dark.",3,1,2,11 August 2009
The Alamo," David Crockett
","I found this motion picture very interesting, and discovered that the producers had exerted some admirable effort in attempting a more authentic look, feel, and historical interpretation to a story that has been extensively researched and debated for more than a century by experts and amateur historians alike.I have visited the original Alamo in San Antonio, and I was very closely involved with one of the finest exhibits on the life and times of David Crockett compiled and constructed by the Tennessee State Museum in the 1980's. One of the minor controversies that continues to bother me about these films is the use of the name 'Davy' as a nickname for Mr. Crockett.The name Davy got its start in the stage shows that idealized the life of Tennessee's Congressional Representative while allowing a hefty dose of entertainment. In the 1960's, Walt Disney Productions took the name, and engraved it upon the American psyche to such a degree that film makers hesitate to simply discard a name that does not appear to have been Crockett's choice. If you read his autobiography, you will not see it mentioned. Not once. Crockett's book is a wonderful work by a masterful politician, and admitted humanitarian. It is well worth reading.That being said, I will recommend this film for what it is, .... a much better attempt at telling a part of American history with less legend and more fact. What a grand method of bestowing the gift of history to children! Perhaps it might even inspire them to read a good book on the subject.",Null,2,3,24 December 2007
August Rush," It's the Music
","August Rush is not one of those films you can watch from the middle. In order to comprehend and enjoy the artful filming, seamlessly integrated music track, and a subtle story line that works on so many different levels, one must see the film from beginning to end several times. If there is one particular aspect of the film that sets it apart from so many others of its genre, a tip of the hat must be given to how hard the producers worked to join the actions on screen with the carefully chosen and performed music. Too many films of this type attempt to convince the audience that the main characters are musicians of extraordinary caliber, and end up convincing us there is no relationship between what we are seeing and what we are hearing. August Rush shows us moments of music creation that do not necessarily need to be perfectly synced to convince us that extraordinary talent is being given a chance to rise above the mundane and ignorant realities of everyday life. Here we have a music genus seeking expression with an innocence of youth that transcends the frustration and violence of his temporary keeper, a sadly flawed man who is doomed to roam the halls of mediocrity and short sightedness. Rarely do we savor Robin Williams with no sense of humor, but 'Wizard' Wallace manages to make us feel uncomfortable every moment he appears on screen. Most people of extraordinary ability tend to understand their art to a depth and breadth that extends far beyond the comprehension of their audience. The film makers have certainly given us a small glimpse into the world of such genus. The teachers of Julliard School immediately see Rush's talent, and are ready to help him, though so many such talents simply go unseen and unfulfilled in the world. August Rush hears music all around him, and is forced by an inner drive to compose. He also subliminally understands that his music message will bring him the one thing he wants most of all, to be reunited with his real parents. What wonderful music that moment becomes.",9,2,3,5 August 2009
Saints and Soldiers," Down to the human level
","A lot has already been written about this little film that could. So, let me say that one of our local Christian stations played Saints and Soldiers on Memorial Day. I had my doubts, but it's rare that a highly rated film gets placed on the schedule for midday from this station. So, I sat for a while to check it out. By the time I knew what was happening, the film was over. Wow. That doesn't happen very often.For such a low budget film, this is one of the best human interest stories I've ever seen from the World War II perspective. It gets down and dirty in the trenches and explores the inner doubts, fears and certainties of the soldier's reality. It even, God forbid, shows us that even the enemy can have members that are both compassionate and understanding in the face of mindless human tragedy and death.My compliments to the extraordinary effort the technicians and extras put into placing these actors into real human situations and into a scenario that is hard to detect as a forest in Utah. We had a hard time figuring the location, even though we had been there in person. If high budget motion pictures had just a fraction of the attention to detail and freedom to express real stories that this one has, what an amazing set of movies we'd see on the big screen.I can do nothing other than highly recommend this film. It is exceptional. (written by a U. S. Coast Guard veteran).",8,6,9,27 May 2013
