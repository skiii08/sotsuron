The Blair Witch Project," Scariest movies of all time?
","This has been described as one of the scariest movies of all time. Well, I don't think it lives up to that description, but it is pretty gripping stuff. I really like the style of this film: the hand held video footage and realistic feel to the piece. I also liked the fact that you didn't actually see anything - it was left up to the imagination. The only thing I would say is that it was a little too long for me. I found it dragging in the middle. Otherwise, a good film.",7,0,1,2 July 2002
North by Northwest," Still fresh even today
","Until now, I've never actually seen this film all the way through.Like much of Hitchcock's work the film is well crafted, technicallyinnovative (for it's day), darkly funny, and with a strong sexualundercurrent. In fact, this is Hitchcock at the height of hispowers. I wouldn't say it's one of my favourite of his films, but itis hugely enjoyable, and still fresh even today. Yes, there arepassages that have dated, but these are certainly few and farbetween. The famous set pieces, such as the crop-sprayer scene, arejust fantastic.",8,0,2,14 July 2002
Eyes Wide Shut," Both intriguing and exasperating
","I found this both intriguing and exasperating. Apart from the advantage of having the always watchable Nicole Kidman in, it also has an interesting plot line (a study in jealousy and fantasy). There were also some good set pieces.  However, many scenes just went on too long, with dialogue that was sometimes a poor imitation of Pinter. And I became a bit irritated by Tom Cruise's rather laboured performance. On the whole, though, it still manages to be an interesting, and at times quite mesmerising, film.",6,0,1,3 July 2002
Donnie Darko," An impressive debut
","This is certainly an impressive debut for writer/director Donnie Darko.  It is an inventive piece of film-making which is funny and surreal - heavily influenced by Lynch in places.  However, the storyline is full of pseudo science and clever complexities that in the end don't add up to anything. It's still an enjoyable film, though, if you don't take it seriously, and Kelly is definitely a director to look out for.",6,0,1,20 July 2002
