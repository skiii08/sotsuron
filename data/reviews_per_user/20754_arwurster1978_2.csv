Requiem for a Dream," CLassic
","I am definitely an Aronofsky aficionado and remember the wait for Pi when I saw some stills and heard the soundtrack to it in mid 1998. Requiem for me is a modern classic, a horror a sci fi. His use of editing, sound, music, is all right on the money. Watching the descent of all the characters into their own personal hells was one of the most disturbing filmic experiences I have even seen. I recently bought the DVD of requiem and have seen it regularly over the last six months and even now I find it as disturbing as I did the last time even thought I am familiar with most dialogue and I know the film almost shot for shot. It show us how much most people are addicted to any number of things, be it TV or heroin.",10,0,1,6 June 2005
Pi," Intellectual tour de force
","I really enjoyed the real intellect behind this film and coupled with the lo fidelity digital video it was shot on and the sound, music made this a truly great film experience. Even now seven years after first seeing it it really disturbs me and entertains me as does his brilliant follow up Requiem for a Dream. The thematic devices Aronofsky used, the stock market, Jewish mysticism, chaos theory, I thought all were tied together really well. The way he raises tension in this film and subsequently in Requiem got my blood pressure way up there like few other films ever have. I eagerly await his next project,'The Fountain' when ever it finally comes out after many rumors of difficulty.",10,0,4,6 June 2005
