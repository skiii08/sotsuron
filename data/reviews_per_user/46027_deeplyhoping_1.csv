First Man," A great human story and space movie!
","A wonderful, real movie about angst and triumph~
I loved the historic rendering of what actually happened so long ago in July 1969.
My major criticism was that the film was apparently shot without a steady cam or stabilization. The constant shaking of the camera and particularly with the constant close ups caused me to feel sick.A good movie to see for any space exploration junkie!",10,0,2,28 October 2018
