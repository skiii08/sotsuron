The New World," A movie about knowledge !
","'They are gentle, loving, faithful, lacking in all guile and trickery. The words denoting lying, deceit, greed, envy, slander, and forgiveness have never been heard. They have no jealousy, no sense of possession. Real, what I thought a dream. ' -Captain Smith says about the Indians.He wished he could be like them but he's not! He fall in love whit Pocahontas but he can't forget why is there.His job is not to fall in love but to explore.That's why he remain cold,loyal to his job because he knew that his place was not there with Pocahontas...Pocahontas didn't care about anything,she just let go because she didn't know much. She learns in time that letting go is dangerous and with John Rofle she is more careful.There are many things in this movie i can give at an example of how knowledge makes everything different.Is like the things you know like an adult in comparison with how things seem to be when you were a child!Pocahontas feels the change in her life because of the knowledge and she become happier.I really love this movie from the beginning till the end.What a wonderful soundtrack ! What a wonderful shots ! What a wonderful world in this film ! What a wonderful movie!",10,2,5,21 November 2008
