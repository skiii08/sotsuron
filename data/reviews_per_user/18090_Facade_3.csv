The Rock," When will the bad guys learn?
","First off, I enjoyed this movie. As usual, if I had directed it, it would certainly have been better! The actors give very good performances, and the action scenes are exciting, and well shot, even if the locations are a little unbelievable. (Is there really a vast abandoned mining complex beneath Alcatraz? Why do all furnaces have unnecessary cogs and pulsed flames, like the crusher in Galaxy Quest?).My main gripe is with Ed Harris. Why on earth does he give the government so much time? They could effect an electronic transfer in minutes, so 4 hours would have been ample. Mind, this would rather have shortened the film!On a technical note, is that really how chemical weapons are constructed? BAN THEM NOW: THE RISK OF DISASTER IS TOO GREAT! The bomblets would never survive being carried to the launcher, never mind being fired!Facade",9,1,1,25 June 2000
Chicken Run," Something is missing.....
","I expected to enjoy this film, everyone said I would enjoy this film, the TV and Newspaper hype said I would enjoy it, but I didn't! The animation was excellent, but I was disappointed by the final product. It lacked the humour and inventiveness of Wallace and Grommet, and seemed lifeless to me. There were a few amusing scenes, as opposed to funny, and a few good one liners, but really this is not enough.At least they don't sing all the time....",Null,0,1,3 July 2000
X-Men," Good, but could have been better..
","First off, I'm a big fan of comics made real (we don't talk about The Phantom though!!), and I enjoyed this film. I was a bit irritated at the obvious priming for a sequel that was going on throughout the film, leaving me expecting more, there was certainly time, as the film is quite short. I can't say too much, without spoiling the plot, but I couldn't really see why Magneto was doing what he was, when the more obvious course of action was how the film ended anyway.FacadeWhy didn't Magneto use his powers to bend Wolverines little adamantium skeleton?
