Iron Man 3," Loved it.
","Great story, great pace, believable characters and soooo glad it wasn't just iron man punching another iron man/iron men again.My favourite of all three.This isn't the longest review because lets face it, who cares what I think? I just wanted to get my 10/10 in with all the haters and trolls complaining about the Mandarin and how blah blah blah wasn't like the comics.The buddy cop style of partnership between Stark and Rhodey really shines in this movie, I didn't really ever 'buy' their relationship in IM1 + IM2 but I really get the sense that they're friends in this movie and it makes for some great banter.Wonderful movie.",9,5,12,8 May 2013
