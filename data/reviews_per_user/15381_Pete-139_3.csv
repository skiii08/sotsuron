The Blair Witch Project," The best horror film since Halloween
","Here it is.  The first horror movie with a new idea since Halloween (unless you count _Scream_'s idea of mixing self-reflexiveness with straight-ahead slasher scariness)._Blair Witch_ is too good to give away.  It's not a jump-out-of-your-seat scary movie, but is increasingly creepy and nerve-rattling.  The premise is brilliant, the execution is perfect, and the acting is uniformly excellent.There are no flaws in this film.",10,2,3,19 July 1999
The Iron Giant," A Perfect Movie
","Everything about this movie is perfect.  The animation style mimics live-action filmmaking to a tee.  The merging of CGI and hand-drawn animation is invisible.  The plot is great and the acting is sublime.But more important than all this, the film is great entertainment while communicating important messages without being obnoxious.  It gently makes a comment against guns, while at the same time reminding audiences that each one of us has the ability to choose who and what we are in life.",10,1,2,13 February 2000
The Matrix," One of the best reasons to think in a movie theater eve
","This movie is a fantastic combination of philosophy, theology, action, and eye-candy. Good acting (even some decent work from Keanu), great writing, directing, art and technical aspects. A feast for the mind and the senses.If this one doesn't make you think about your life, you just aren't inclined that way at all.",10,0,1,30 September 2002
