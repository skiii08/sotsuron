The Ring," Horror
",When I saw this film the first time the ring 'video' was shown at the end my phone started to ring! no lie. But it turned out to be a friend.If you have seen the film you will know just how spooky that is.its a great film will have to see the japanese version now.,Null,0,0,12 October 2003
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Excellent
",What we have all been waiting for thought episodes I and II for. A very dark film with bite.A tragedy really. How one mans evil can cause a galaxy of horror.How the weak and frightened can be manipulated by the strong to do the most awful things in the name of good.Haven't we all seen that in real life? 60 years ago and today we never learn. On a personal note I have waited 28 years since I heard the publicity for the first one and a chance comment that stuck in my 6 year old brain that Vader the way he is because of a fight with ken-obi on an active volcano.Now I have seen that fight.Its nice to have closure but I will miss star wars.Unless they make the other 3. Heres hoping :),10,1,5,19 May 2005
