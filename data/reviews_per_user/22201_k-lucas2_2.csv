The Expendables 2," Sly hits target with explosive sequel
","The gang are back a long with a few exciting inclusions such as Jean-Claude Van Damme and 70 year old Chunk Norris ( who's in better shape then the others ). Unfortunately the story is a bit of a let down in this film, i know what you're thinking ? not many action flicks don't have a good story line so no surprises there, but it more then makes up for it with the juicy smorgasbord of action heroes that work together for the common goal, even with a scuttle case of ribbing along the way. For the fans of the action films of yesteryear will very much enjoy this movie, the younger guys have a big role to play, but the legends really steel the show.I really enjoyed this movie being a action film fan myself, i gave it the score i did because it did get a little slow in parts but believe me its worth sitting through. Awesome film.",6,1,4,21 September 2012
The Bourne Legacy," The latest Bourne film left no legacy
","The Bourne Legacy like the movies before started off very well, introducing you to new characters and re-introducing old ones. I must admit that the beginning was hard to follow, but as a fan of the series i did understand it this is why i strongly suggest that before seeing this film that you should check out the first 3.The story basically takes place at the same time as the last movie (The Bourne Ultimatum 2007) as the US government is hunting Jason Bourne, another unstoppable weapon is in training. The storyline is very good but there is a lot information to process through the film, also the action was very flaky when you finally get to see some.Jeremy Renner gives a strong performance as Aaron Cross ' The new hero' of the film, with Rachel Weisz who plays Dr Marta Shearing who is in the center of the Cross' interest.",5,0,4,26 August 2012
