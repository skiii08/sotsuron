Kill Bill: Vol. 2," I loved VOL. 1, but I don't love VOL. 2...
","KILL BILL VOL. 2 is a very different film from VOL. 1. I don't consider it a continuation at all, but a completely separate film--in essence, 'The 5th Film by Quentin Tarantino.' In terms of characters, story structure, editing, film style, and even soundtrack choices, the two films are so completely unlike each other that I can't even imagine seeing them together. I simply can't see how VOL. 1 wouldn't be completely dragged down by VOL. 2. I honestly feel that those viewers who have not seen VOL. 1 and are not familiar with the various action genres that inspired Tarantino are in perhaps the best position to enjoy VOL. 2.VOL. 2 is slower and more devoted to dialogue and character, a task made easier by the much smaller cast of characters (two major characters, four significant supporting ones). Which would be fine if the dialogue was clever or profound or had the black comic edge of the first film. Or if the characters were developed at all. I found the characters interesting (and wonderfully played by the cast) but I didn't learn enough about them. I never got drawn in or emotionally engaged the way I was with the first film. There's a lot of dialogue but not much information. We're asked to believe in a love story at the heart of it, between Bill and the Bride. I never bought it. So the emotional pay-off--when it came--meant nothing to me. I should have been in tears, but I didn't feel a thing. I felt cheated. If, as a viewer, you accept the love story then you'll have an easier time with this film than I did.There isn't much action: two major fight scenes, neither of which is long enough; a kung fu training sequence; and one quick violent confrontation. The fight staging isn't nearly as clever or imaginative as it was in VOL. 1. The kung fu sequence--a flashback--belonged in VOL. 1. It's out of place here and is inserted smack dab in the middle of a suspenseful plot thread and so completely disrupts the rhythm of the piece that I was thrown off and never got back on track with the rest of the film.If you're expecting the baroque cinematic flourishes of the first film, with its eye-catching color schemes, fluid tracking shots, spectacular action, diverse range of characters, anime sequence, and eclectic musical numbers, forget it. I didn't find anything comparable in VOL. 2, which is much more stripped down, with much of the action taking place in the desolate stretches around Barstow, California. The soundtrack consists almost entirely of snatches of Italian western music (mostly by Ennio Morricone) and Mexican-style numbers put together by Robert Rodriguez. While the musical choices on VOL. 1's soundtrack were consistently inspired, these seem kind of arbitrary and never adequately blend with the images.
I was deeply disappointed by this film. I intend to see it again, though, to try to get over my initial resistance and perhaps find a way to appreciate what Tarantino was trying to do here. As a fan of his for twelve years now, I owe him that much. But the euphoria I experienced at each of four big-screen viewings of VOL. 1 never re-surfaced during my much-anticipated viewing of VOL. 2.",Null,0,1,14 April 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," The Disneyland of Asian action films, or Welcome to Quentin's World
","For fans of Hong Kong kung fu, Japanese samurai and yakuza, Italian westerns, and other disreputable (usually foreign) genres, Quentin Tarantino has fashioned an alternate universe in Volume 1 that will feel wonderfully familiar and comfortable, yet not without a host of constant surprises. He does it all with a cinematic flourish that is almost nonexistent in Hollywood anymore, which might explain why he had to go to China and Japan to do it. There isn't a single wasted shot or motion or edit in this film. Those of us who 'get it' (and by that I mean those for whom it plugs right into the subconscious region of our brain) are immediately swept up in Quentin's world and taken along on a wild, gripping, compelling ride.I would argue that Volume 1 marks the first true Asian/Hollywood film hybrid in that it represents a complete fusion of Asian and American sensibilities and styles. Moreso, I would argue, than ENTER THE DRAGON, THE YAKUZA, FACE/OFF, and THE MATRIX, to name a few you might suggest. For one thing, Tarantino is one American director who truly loves the Asian action genres he recreates here (anime, samurai, yakuza, kung fu, etc.) and has totally immersed himself in them. He has also surrounded himself with distinguished Hong Kong and Japanese collaborators, not to mention a Chinese crew. When he shoots Asian-style action, he gets it right (or almost right, which is still more than any other American filmmaker has managed to achieve). Nor does he ever stop to explain anything (as THE YAKUZA, admittedly, had to) or condescend to the American mall audience. He just says, 'Welcome to my world' and plunges us all into it. Not everyone will want to take this ride nor will everyone understand its appeal, but some of us will need no map to follow it nor have to stop and ask for directions--the route is already imprinted in our subconscious.",Null,0,0,13 October 2003
The Terminal," FORREST GUMP II: A rich man's fantasy
","THE TERMINAL is something of a metaphor for Hollywood and how people in its top ranks view the rest of the world. Everyone fawns on the white movie stars (Tom Hanks and Catherine Zeta Jones, in this case) and the terminal's black, Latino and ethnic working people all serve their every need--not for pay, but out of the goodness of their hearts. It's like a Disney movie where all the animals of the forest stop behaving like animals and decide to join together to tend to the needs of Snow White for no other reason except that she's...the star! There's even a scene where all the workers in the terminal run from their work stations to flock around Hanks and shower gifts on him. Sure, Hanks' character distributes a little largesse now and then, in the form of a favor or two to a couple of the workers, but the quid greatly outbalances the quo. Hanks' character even crafts an elaborate work of art in the terminal--without any interference from airport or construction personnel. So Spielberg has transposed his ideal world (being taken care of and made comfortable without having to pay for the privilege; no front office interference in the creation of one's art; 'regular' people helping him court the girl; no emotional lows--only artificially inflated highs; and everyone loving him) onto a supposedly real world setting.
As a result, there is not a single believable human being to be found in this blatantly condescending racial fantasy. Which is too bad because there's at least one interesting character in Gupta, the senior citizen from India who mops the terminal floors, played by an engaging actor (Kumar Pallana) whose performance transcends his director's utter lack of interest in the actual behavior, motivations and nuances of real working people. And there's a very clever and inspired plot twist, revealed late in the film, which belonged in a different, better movie.However, if, on the other hand, you buy into our prevailing celebrity culture and you constantly crave false 'uplift' in your entertainment, then THE TERMINAL is for you.",Null,2,4,13 June 2004
