Deja Vu," Good Movie -ending was weak
","This movie was entertaining through out most of it, however, it was hard to follow at times unless you watched closely. The ending really sucked and failed to meet expectations after such major drama! How about Deja Vu being used somewhere! I would list this a good weekend movie, but I can see why it did not do good at the theater. I would not watch this one again, even if Denzel and other great stars were good (not their usual greatness). I can't say it was his or anyone's best work but very entertaining.....clearly I'm an ending girl! Paula Patton was very good, even with her limited experience. I'd like to see her in more, maybe a love story with Denzel.....!",7,1,2,28 April 2007
Gangs of New York," Great movie!
","This was a great movie with lots of actions. I understand that Scorsese took liberty with some of it, but still very good and theatrical. DiCaprio and Day-Lewis were incredible and the acting was wonderful. I could not believe that it was Daniel Day-Lewis in the role of 'The Butcher' until I looked it up! Wow...what an actor. This movie is not for the kids, lots of violence but great action film. I would watch this movie more than once..actually I did watch it three times. The last time I watch this it was on television and was a cut down version. Still great movie! Also, who knew that Diaz could act like theatrical actress. She was the best part of this movie, even considering that DiCaprio and Day-Lewis were in it.",9,0,1,28 April 2007
