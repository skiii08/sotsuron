Requiem for a Dream," One line review: Simply the greatest movie you'll never want to watch a second time. Very minor spoiler.
","If they had premiered this movie near a cliff or a construction site, they'd have needed to hire security to keep people from jumping after leaving.My wife spent three days in bed after we saw it on a Friday night.I love Jennifer Connelly to death. Now the line 'Can you come home... today?' is forever etched in my mind as the single saddest moment in my movie experience.Apropos of nothing, this is a case where the book and movie are a perfect pair. Neither is better or more complete. That's a tribute both to Selby's power and concision and Aronofsky's mastery.Despite the headline, I've watched the movie several times. Erin Brockovich was a good movie, and Julia Roberts gave a worthy performance, but it paled next to Ellen Burstyn's portrayal of Sara Goldfarb's pathos and desperation. She'll rip out your heart and hand it to you still beating.",9,0,0,4 August 2017
