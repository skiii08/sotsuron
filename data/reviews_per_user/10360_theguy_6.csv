Ford v Ferrari," Not the movie I had hoped for.
","It was entertaining, but it was not the movie I had hoped for.They skipped the Mark I and Mark II entirely and went straight for the Mark III.Nothing was mentioned about all the hardships and failures - even the crashes resulting in the death of the driver - all during races Ford lost.There was no struggle to overcome. I had hoped for a movie which included the design engineering to resolve the problems.The true story is so much better!",7,2,5,25 November 2019
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Poorly Executed
","This movie felt like Disney rushed it - it was not well executed.The story was scattered - it didn't flow well. Entire scenes and lines we were shown in the trailers were absent from the movie.No Jedi, or Lightsaber duels - these things make Star Wars what it is (or should be).Disney crammed in every little Easter Egg they possibly could - and it took away from the story immensely. Does Disney think we are idiots, hypnotized by shiny Easter Eggs, such that we don't notice how bad the movie really is?Ponda Baba and Dr. Evazan on another planet before (chronologically) we see them in the Tatooine Cantina? WHY?Absolutely TERRIBLE CGI Tarkin and Leia! And we are supposed to be somehow 'wowed' by that terrible CGI?!And Vader is clearly (terrible) CGI during his lightsaber battle. Vader never (ever) moved like that in any other movie. Why does he move like that now? We see Vader in Episode 4 just a few weeks later (chronology) when he fights Obi on the Death Star - and Vader does not move like that!As many of you, I am a 'die hard' Star Wars fan, so much so that I volunteered to work for one of Lucasfilm's subsidiaries for 7 years - I actually have business cards with the trademarked Star Wars logo on them - and I absolutely hated this movie.",Null,1,3,5 January 2019
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Awesome special effects - no plot - missing the last reel of film.
","Hollywood seems to have started a new trend -- movies now seem to contain awesome special effects, with little or no plot.The most recent Star Wars movies (The Phantom Menace and Attack Of The Clones) are good examples of this trend.  Stephen Spielburg's Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) is another shining example.I know what some of you are saying -- 'How can you say that?  Lord of the Rings is a classic!'  I agree the novels might well be classics that do not translate well onto the silver screen.An average moviegoer who knows nothing of the novels will see three hours of chaos, senseless violence, and an ending which leaves you wondering if the theater forgot to play the last reel of film.Thumbs down...  WAY down.",Null,0,0,7 August 2002
Avengers: Infinity War," Absolutely awful
","Complete downer movie. I can't believe I paid money and wasted hours of my life watching this trash. If I could go back in time and stop myself from seeing it, I would. I don't watch superhero movies to walk out of the movie MORE SAD than when I walked in!",1,11,22,16 August 2018
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," This should have been Episode I
","I saw a sneak preview tonight (Tuesday night). The action starts right off the bat and does not stop until the very end! Lucas should have skipped Episodes I and II, and just started with this one!Everything a Star Wars fan wants is here -- amazing Lightsaber duels, huge space battles, and a plot which keeps you guessing. You just THINK you know how it's going to turn out! :) Lucas remembered to seal all the plot holes this time around -- the ending connects nicely with the beginning of a movie he started 20 years ago. Very well done.Everything you hated about Episodes I and II have been removed from Episode III. Anakin isn't a whiner. The Padme/Anakin love story isn't so sticky sweet. The acting didn't seem nearly as 'forced' as in the Episodes I and II. Jar Jar shows up in only one scene, and only says two words in the entire movie! Even the battle droids seem to have 'grown up' -- they're not as geeky, and seem more authoritative... :)My largest gripe about Episodes I and II was that Lucas seemed to want us to stare in amazement at the special effects, and not pay attention to the plot or the actors on the screen. Episode III finally puts the special effects where they belong -- in a supporting role to the plot!",10,3,9,17 May 2005
The Greatest Showman," It had promise...
","The Greatest Showman had promise - it failed with the Broadway musical approach.Sets were constructed as if for a broadway stage (low budget and poorly executed by movie theater standards). Musical numbers were catchy and relatively good, but did not fit the movie or the venue.The bottom line is this - if I want to see a Broadway play, I will go to New York City and see a broadway play. I do not want to see a Broadway play on my local movie theater screen. (Fences was a perfect example of this failure, and now The Greatest Showman is added to that list!)",4,1,1,12 January 2019
