Ghost," You can't spell forever without love
","Leave it up to Unchained Melody, Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze to make pottery making into a cinematic statement screaming beauty, love and suggestive undertones. If there has ever been a more romantic scene in either film or real life, than I certainly haven't seen it! Ghost is giant melting pot of romance, thriller, suspense, comedy and a hint of the supernatural and with the loudmouth medium Whoopi Goldberg added to the roller coaster ride, you know it also has the vibrant and colourful cast to match. A young couple move into their first apartment together; she's an artist and he's the corporate type. But once again love sees no class because these young kids are deeply in love, aww how sweet, I think I might need a tissue. However soon tragedy strikes as Patrick's character Sam Wheat is murdered but what seems at first at the hands of a low life street mugger. But this is Ghost and love is so powerful and eternal that not even the afterlife can keep these two apart as Patrick spirit returns. How unfortunately the only person who can see or hear him is medium Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg), so the pair must work together in a race against time to save Demi's character Molly Jensen's life when it to comes under threat. When I say the power of love, you say; Pretty Women, Dirty Dancing, an Office and a gentleman and the Notebook, but for me the true heavyweight in the world of romance is Ghost, the very epitome of love conquering all. You can't spell forever without love.",6,1,2,4 September 2014
Casablanca," As time goes by, the film will still suck!
","WARNIG! Don't watch Casablanca because you will regret it, 'Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life.'The biggest travesty and atrocity a kid could ever be inflected with, is when you're given the crushing blow that Santa is not real. Well take that dreadful feeling and then multiply it by a thousand, and you might just be able understand the heart wrenching pain that I felt after so many years of eager anticipation to watch supposedly one of the greatest films of all time, only to find out the hard way upon watching Casablanca, that the film doesn't live up to anywhere close to all the hype surrounding it. Trust me finding that Rudolf, the elves and Santa workshop didn't exist was a walk in the park compared to this! 1941 was in the grips of a deadly second world war, but while the rest of Europe was going up in flames, Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) was living it up in the sun, sea and sand of Morocco where he remained entirely neutral whilst cozying it up in a nightclub and gambling den in Casablanca. But trouble is at foot as the Germans come looking for a famous Czech Resistance fugitive leader by the name of Victor Lazio. But then to shovel another tone onto Ricks plate; 'Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine.' The love of his life Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) that once broke his heart returns to cause trouble again. Okay so what's wrong with it, gosh there is so much to point out, I'm going dizzy just thinking about it. Now I'm sat down, let me make it easier for myself, what's good about it...umm well? I'm stumped, I've literally scratched my head so much, I think I've left myself with a bald patch. The first blatant criticism is the rotten acting that leaves a wretched smell in the air and horrible unsavoury taste in the mouth. Like come on if I wanted to see such wooden performance I would go to a Shakespeare in the park where all the character are played by actual trees! Imagine how many times in the entire film did Rick ever show even a flicker of emotion in the film, the answer is (drum roll please) zero, cero and null. But this ain't an episode of who wants to be a millionaire and I'm not Terry Crews, so don't be expecting any cash prizes. Instead from Rick all you get is one long continuous monotone delivery of each and every line, which unfortunately to my ears sounds similar to a heart monitor flat lining. But don't think for a moment that Ilsa will resuscitate the morbid desolation that becomes of Casablanca at the hands of Rick. Because Ilsa has the habit of always turning smiles upside down, her character has no backbone and merely sways back and forth between both Lazio (Husband) and Rick like she were a hula skirt in the wind anytime she sees fit. In the entire film I'm pretty sure she doesn't have a single thought in the film that doesn't involve either one of the two men. However on a good note, while the acting was crummy, the words coming from their mouths were surprisingly rather good. I've used quite a few quotes from the film in my review because the dialogue in Casablanca was clever, witty and enjoyable to hear and thus quite right the scriptwriter pair of the Epstein brothers and Howard Koch received Oscar recognition for their exploits. Also what I do applaud is the way Michael Curtiz weaves into the film the ethos of always having the courage to resist and triumphing against whatever evil the world may try to put in your way. Anytime you see inside of Rick's bar it is constantly brimming with joy and happiness, which is a refreshing sight to witness when you consider that above all their heads is suffocating Nazi shaped black cloud. The best illustration of this is in the scene where Victor he spurs the customers in Rick's cafe to a deifying yet beautiful rendition of Marseillaise, effectively drowning out the chorus of Nazis singing. But don't confuse my compliments with me softening up to Casablanca, the film still sucks!",6,5,12,1 August 2014
Chinatown," finest ever screenplay to emerge from Hollywood
","Robert Townes scripts probably the finest ever screenplay to emerge from Hollywood, once again reaffirming America's choke hold on the summit of film. An unforgettable narrative achievement that gives us something different every time we have the pleasure of sitting down and re-watch Roman Polanski's (Rosemary's Baby) seminal noir pastiche to the 30's made popular by the like of the Maltese Falcon, but still in its own rights; Polanski architects a detective film masterpiece. It was even placed 3rd greatest screenplay of all time, by the Writers Guild of America (WGA) amongst such titles as Casablanca, The Godfather and Anne Hall, which arguably I feel is the greatest of them all. Starring Jack Nicholson in what I believe to be a career defining performance, even surpassing his Oscar winning exploits with One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest and even his ever chilling performance in The Shining. Chinatown starts off as just another mundane detective TV drama, as a distraught wife; appear in Jake Gittes office requesting a private eye to solidify her suspicions of her husband's infidelity.But just like in life, nothing is ever what it seems, and just like life, Chinatown is as unpredictable as the English weather, as from that moment in the office, we suddenly swept up in a whirlwind of excitement, tensions, laughs and shocks; as we find ourselves in a ever engulfing circle, consisting of millionaire corruption, murder, sheep, farmers. But when you thought that was it we sprinkled in some incest and water scandals for good measure. As we are placed side by side with Jake on his roller coaster ride through kicks to the head, cuts to the nose and a steamy love affair with a woman Fane Dunaway also from Bonnie and Clyde) who may just be the key to his eventual downfall, helping in laying down the foundation to one of the most ironic ends in film history. They said Michelangelo had a hard time painting the sixteenth carpel in a lifetime; imagine trying to keep a piece of art like Chinatown in a review of 500 words or less, now that is a miracle. Because Chinatown is a magnificent cinematic and technical achievement that may never again be rivalled in American cinema. The film is so good, I feel that it should be compulsive watching in all film schools for all young writers and directors with dreams of a career in the film – actually better yet forget film school, just sit at home and watch Chinatown, that's the only film education you really need. So don't be a feel, stay out of school and watch Chinatown.",10,2,3,9 November 2013
Citizen Kane," overrated
","As you sit in your office, room or coffee shop, as you read this excellent review, you could quiet easily walk out the front door, and stop any passerby and ask them a simple question 'what is the greatest film of all time?' Some would say the Godfather, others would say Casablanca, but the majority would point to Citizen Kane. Is there a joke the world gets that I don't? Is there a massive party that I simply didn't get an invasion too? Because I can understand the 'some' and the 'others'- but I although I would rather point their attentions to Chinatown or Manhattan for title of greatest ever. But I'll let them off just this once. But the overwhelming inclusion of Citizen Kane on lists of the greatest films of all, is frankly ludicrous and a complete and utter head scratcher! Such was the extent of the head scratching I almost bore a hole into my skull. For me Citizen Kane is no more of the greatest film of all time, as much as you could say Zack Effron is great actor. Citizen Kane is simply the most over hyped film in the history of the universe. Orson Welles produces, writes, directs in this picture as well as playing the title character Charles Foster Kane. A newspaper tycoon who dies almost at the start of the film, and through the eyes of reporters, Kane's life is slowly unravelled before our eyes via an anti- chronological narrative. Driven by the desires to discover the significance and meaning behind 'Rosebud', the one word Kane utters on his death bed. Don't get me wrong. Citizen Kane on a purely technical endeavour is absolutely superb. With the effective use of innovative angles and stunning manipulation of deep focus lenses too represent the various viewpoints of Citizen Kane on a visual plane is absolutely staggering and ingenious. But despite this people seem to forget that film making is the art of storytelling. I repeat film making is the art of STORYTELLING. True it relies heavily on aesthetics and visuals representation of conveying of said story, but story is still the main event of any film. Narrative is substance and A list stardom whereas the visuals are merely the supporting act. Although I have to credit Welles on his heavy handed involvement in the film, but I feel the film would have reached greatest heights in my eyes, if he were to have relinquished some of the roles to people of greater experience, because don't forget the fact that Orson Welles was merely 25 at the time (Looks like need to get a move on). A fact I believe that might have been the bases of the reasoning behind the decision by American Film Institute (AFI) to place Citizen Kane at number one on their list of 100 greatest American films of all time. Which is insane, just because he was young doesn't mean he should receive any preferential treatment. Just because a kid in primary school makes a finger painting, doesn't mean is should stand in an art gallery next to a painting by Picasso. But if Citizen Kane were to still remain on the list of 100 greatest, long after I'm gone. I'm adamant it will be of no heroics on Welles part and the story behind Citizen Kane, but more from the hard work of the likes of Gregg Toland (cinematographer) and Robert Wise (Editor) and there technical achievements, that have acted as magicians and tricked the whole world into believing that Citizen Kane is the greatest film of all time – Dynamo and David Blaine takes some notes, that's what I call real magic!",4,2,6,5 December 2013
Brokeback Mountain," a master piece that should be celebrated
","It makes cowboys cool again, breathing warmth into archaic notions of not only cowboys but also stereotypes of masculinity and what it means to be a man, saying to all that watch that it's okay to possess emotion and actually have feelings, but to still be considered a man. I personally felt it was a beautifully sculpted, film art work that provides us with a brave and heart wrenching exploration into forbidden love, which evokes every emotion from all over the rainbow, making it almost impossible not to fall in love with the two main characters, almost at the same time as the two main characters fall in love with each other. An Ang lee (Life of Pie) film tells the story of two cowboys, -Jake Gyllenhall (Zodiac, Jarhead and Donnie Darko), and Heath Ledger (Oscar for best supporting actor in his role in The Dark Knight). Who meet and fall for each other on the Wyoming landscape. But due to the nature of this relationship, it's a love that is wrongfully hidden from the world. Also featuring supporting actresses Anne Hathaway (Les Misérables), Michele Williams (Great Gatsby) and Kate Mara (We Are Marshall) to name a few, who play their parts well, to ensure this film becomes a classic. It's a massive complement to our hearts and minds, that Ang lee pays us as the audience, providing us with a story that brings the LGBT community to not just too mainstream cinema, but to our homes and our hearts. But it's not just a film about two gay men, it's a story about true love, that should not be shamed, or stashed away out of sight, but instead celebrated and accepted.",8,5,5,11 August 2013
500 Days of Summer," Think Romeo and Juliet meets Christopher Nolan's Memento
","Love! In one stances can be the most beautiful of human experiences that change a life, and bring a person whole oceans full of happiness. But at the same time, it can make people go their entire life searching for it, risking heart ache, pain and rejection and yet still never really finding it in the end. Then when you do find it, it makes you do crazy and stupid things, and when it comes to February the 14th, you're left with an empty wallet and remortgaged house just so you can put a smile on her face and a ring on it. So why go through all of it? Why, I'll tell you why, because its love, it's that unbelievable, confusing yet exiting sensation that no amount of words in the entire world could ever have a hope for defining. While Hollywood sucks at sequels and remakes, it seems these three godfathers of romantic films in the shape of When Harry met Sally, The Note Book and Titanic, has shown that Hollywood has had better success in the area of love and I feel that with release of Marc Webb's sensational depute 500 days of Summer is certainly a film that on merits, as time goes by will certainly join the before mention ranks. Don't you find the same old boy meet girl story rather boring and contrived? And don't you absolutely hate the word romance films? First of all the title is not at all guy friendly, and certainly not a word you want to be throwing around in the guys changing rooms. But 500 Days of Summer is as far removed from a conventional and predictable romance film, as Saw is from a Disney family film. Why? Well when you think Romance films you think about fairy tales and happily ever after's, but in 500 Days of Summer it doesn't try to delude its audience, instead its franc, realistic and extremely relatable. Then secondly it's not just your standard boy meets girl, then they fall madly in love and finally get married in that same order time and time again, instead what writers Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber (Fault in our Stars) did so ingeniously was rip up the boring old blue print, and put it back together in a fresh new and wacky way; think Romeo and Juliet meets Christopher Nolan's Memento. Meet Tom (Gordon-Levitt), an aspiring architect stuck in a dead end job working for a card greeting company, that does nothing but inspire boredom from him. He's one of life's go- getters, internal optimist and a real glass half full type of guy. Oh and in a interesting roles reversal, he is absolutely obsessed with the notion of true love and soul mates, while on other hand we have the fresh faced, definition of cute secretary Summer (Zoe Deschanel) who doesn't buy the whole love thing, and would rather remain single than allowing it to consume her life. I can guess what you're thinking; you couldn't get any more diametrically opposed than if you brought chalk and cheese or day and night together. However sparks do fly between them and through a nonlinear sequence of events we jump, back and forth to various points of their relationships; from the highs to the lows, funny to the serious and the comedy to the drama as their differences make their relationship very difficult. If you wanted me to list all the superlatives I have for 500 days of Summer for you, you would be spend days reading my review, after I had spent weeks writing it because the truth it, I loved the film from beginning to end. First the whole concept of the nonlinear telling of the story was both imaginative and interesting and certainly stands out above most of today's romance films with its inspired innovation. The script was phenomenal all the way through, provided a barrel of laughs whilst also injecting a sense of depth to the film that really made you pause and rethink things, and the fact the story was based on actually real world relationship experiences that the writers had, was probably why the film was able to resonate so deeply with its audiences upon release. If you were already a fan of the TV show New Girl staring Zoe Deschanel and you thought that she was really funny in the show, then watching her in this will send you to the hospital for literally bursting out laughing. But that is no disservice to my man Levitt, who offers a light hearted relief to his stone cold, lifeless performances in the Dark Knight Rises and Looper. I was also particular impressed with Marc Webb's directing, especially seeing that this was his debut film, which I would rank up there with the likes of Mendes with American Beauty and Tarantino with Resiviour Dogs in terms of best depute film exploits. All in all, I would highly recommended film to all manly men, pessimists or horror fans, because it a lot more than just a romance film, it's a film about real life that I feel we can all learn a great deal from.",8,0,2,9 July 2014
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," witty one liners, daring train robbery's, adventure and excitement
","No other film in the history of sweeping landscape of the western genre conjures up more vivid images of witty one liners, daring train robbery's, adventure and excitement than those elicited when you think about the epitome of the Wild West outlaws Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Just as the film makes an effort to state at the beginning, the whole story behind the film was based loosely on fact, there were really two train robbing outlaws who migrated to Bolivia in search of a more successful criminal career and they were really called Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, although their real names were Robert LeRoy Parker aka Butch Cassidy (played by Paul Newman) and his partner Harry Longabaugh aka the 'Sundance Kid' (played by Robert Redford). The film starts off with a slow sweeping sepia drenched shoot of a small American town, we soon settle on Butch looking longingly out a window to the sepia streets that lay beyond it. The colour grading almost make it feel that we have stepped into a nostalgic snap shot of time that we as well as Butch feel is coming to a slow agonising end. Later on through a poker match we introduced to Sundance, which the scene later seems ironic because it best represents who Sundance is, someone who likes to keep his card close to his chest, and even though on the surface he may hold a indecipherable poker face, just like Clint Eastwood in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, there is so much more under the surface. While for the first 25 minutes of the film, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid may seem like polar opposites, Butch being a loud, obnoxious smooth talker and Sundance the brooding silent one. They actually make a great team, Butch is the brains and Sundance is the brawn or should I say guns of the team; together not a safe on a train anywhere in the world can keep them away from its money, even if it's not down to the most subtle of techniques, which means almost blowing up an entire train with far too much dynamite, they always still get it. But the owner of the train would then say; full me once shame on you, full me twice shame on me and full me three times and I'll hire an almighty relentless gang that will follow you from hell and back again, then twice around the moon and I'm pretty sure Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid could confirm that statement, as they spend days trying to lose the gang, with ever increasing difficulty. Eventually with a whole lot of courage or some would say stupidity, they are soon able to gain enough distance to allow them to unite with Katharine Ross as Etta Place and migrate to Bolivia, taking their thieving habits with them. But once again there old foes find them... Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid went on to win four academy awards, for best cinematography, Best Song for Burt Bacharach and Hal David for 'Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head', best score and best screen play, however despite being nominated it lost both best picture and best actor for Paul Newman too Midnight Cowboy and Jon Voight (rightly so). But as good as the award winning score and cinematography was, I felt the best aspect of the film was the was the passion, enthusiasm and talent that both Paul and Robert brought to their respectful roles, and I truly believe that in any other year both of them would have walked home with the statue. I simply loved their camaraderie and sheer respect they had for each other; you could really tell that they respected each other's craft and presence, feeling at times as if they were really brothers in real life, making it such a delightful experience anytime they share the screen together. Katharine's inclusion was ultimately small but crucial, she brought all that tender, vulnerability from The Graduate, but this time she added a whole new layer of steal to the character which I felt showed that she had greatly developed as an actress. It's difficult to review some of the plot elements of the film, due to the fact that is based on a true story, so you don't know what parts are for audience entertainment and what other parts were historical fact. Let's just assume that it was purely fiction, I was annoyed at how the fact they built up the 6 pursues so much, yet you never actually get to see them or see first-hand what makes them so formidable which was highly fascinating. But that was just me being nit picky. The only thing that came close to the performance of the two leads was the screenplay, rightly ranked #11 on its list of 101 Greatest Screenplays ever written by The Writers Guild of America. Every scene had a laugh out loud witty patter between the two leads of the or from the minor characters that left your side in stitches. But I do feel that director George Roy Hill and writer William Goldman should have held some of the gags back and opt for a more serious tone to the film, because these were two guys who knew the end was coming, and all they could do was make jokes? But on the whole Butch Cassidy and the Sundance will always going down as probably top 10 greatest westerns films ever, a title I feel that it earned and greatly deserved.",7,0,0,2 May 2014
Lost in Translation," two 'lost souls' finding each other
","In the wake of the announcements of the Oscar nominations, a certain unassuming film going by the name of Her, looks destined to be a surprise, yet justified inclusion for Best Picture category. But great similarities can be drawn to a film that predates it by 10 years, Lost In Translation. Yes both include similar themes of two 'lost souls' finding each other, but ultimately each is inherently, superbly and wonderfully unique. And certainly it's no coincident that both use the same actress in Scarlet Johansson and directors Spike Jones (Her) and Sofia Coppola (Lost in Translation) were in fact married at one point, show that each has been heavily influenced by the other. Lost in Translation is set into the neon lit, beautiful land of the rising sun, were two individuals from two completely different sides of the social spectrum converge in the in Japan for dissimilar reasons on the surface but beneath, it's a desperate last ditch attempt at for two lost souls to find something they have been looking for but can't find. For Bill Muarry (Groundhog day) a middle aged actor, well past his prime, Japan provides him with one last chance to make serious money before the uncertain twilight years of his career, as well as his marriage, which you feel he has grown disillusioned to come to an end. Whereas for scarlet Johansson (Avengers), a woman in her mid 20's yet to find her true calling in life, so when her husband is given an opportunity to photograph there, she takes an ideal opportunity to find what she's been looking for, meaning. Both character look for it, but none of it are found in Japan, but might be found in each other. Writer/director Sofia Coppola shows relatively matured assuredness for a director relatively young and inexperienced in her directing career; although to be fare, she was born into a family where film is almost second nature; with her cousin being Nickolas Cage and her father being Francis Ford Coppola. It is plain to see that she inherited the talent for amazing character studying from the later, although unfortunately her carer since with only highlight being the recent Bling Ring, it has showed us that she may never really come out from the long shadow of her father. But let's remain focused on the Positives, Lost In Translation was a phenomenal film and should be no surprise to know it earned Sofia a Oscar for Best screenplay, as well as making her the first ever female American director to earn herself a Best Director node – a fete only outdone by Katherine Bigalow who won the award in 2009 for Hurt Locker. I felt that the film was a finally painted portrait on compelling characters in a place so foreign yet so familiar, which Copploa gently with a brush, was able to add a beautiful tint of honest emotion in both Bill and Scarlet, because just like in Her the relationship is one based completely on emotion, without the need of a physical connection, as in the film they only share on kiss , but because of this and not despite, it allowed me so grow more and more engaged with their thoughts, feelings and action with each passing minute. A truly lovely film.",8,0,0,14 January 2014
Apocalypse Now," a tale of a world teetering on the edge of Darkness
","In film it's a very rare occurrence – thus highly sort after, that a film can possess the holy trinity of a combination of a; great script, a legendary director and an almost god like actor. But such is the elusive nature of this endeavour, it never has quite has been attained in the history of film – well that's before a certain masterpiece going by the name of Apocalypse now graced our screens with this almost mythical alliance of this magnitude. The director: Francis Ford Coppola (Godfather trilogy). The story: a tale of a world teetering on the edge of Darkness almost ready to descent into primal madness, as Capt. Willard (Martin Sheen) has to navigate his way through hell on earth to find and kill AWOL Col. Kurtz (The actor:) Marlon Brando (On the Waterfront and Godfather 1) - whose very name is translated into greatness in almost every language known to man. The epic tale of this coming together will probably never happen again or would even have another three components assembled that will ever parallel it. So it something to be marvelled at, as you sits down in your comfortable chair to watch such a spectacle. It has been widely reported from a variety of different sources about the hardship endured by the production team. Such as shooting in a country notorious for typhoons, even at one time the place they were story the film burnt down, but luckily it remained safe, and the little fact that the main character Martin sheen was a supposed alcoholic, and would turn up on set with hangovers. All this helps to perpetuate the legend that is apocalypse now, and the irony that they were facing their own war, just at the same time they were filming it.But what I love most in film, is when bold story and director hold up a mirror to society, penetrating through the shards and illusions of morality and believing that we are able to distinguish between good vs. Evil as if it was between black and white, that we like to delude ourselves with every day, but then when we enter the battlefield it seems our civilised selves gets left behind as lines get blurred. And that is what Apocalypse now does best, it blurs the line. And with lines blurred it not a surprised that the main characters go insane, pretty much anyone would, in the face of a world that turns the world you lived and knew upside down. But my only criticism of film, is the focus of the film, I feel it waved far too much into the obsession of Martin Sheen's character as he tries to find Marlon Brando, when I feel that they could have taken time aside to explore the war from the perspective of the other men accompanying him on his journey, particularly Laurence Fishbuornes character who was just 17, so it would have been interesting to hear things from a black boy fighting in a white man's war.It obvious my stance on the film, that I believe is must see for all, but if the first paragraph wasn't enough to persuade you into watching Apocalypse now, here is another, I would go as far as to say that Vittorio Storaro cinematography was as if watching a walking and talking Picasso piece, such was the extent of the visual art mastery he conjured up in Apocalypse Now, as if he were the offspring of Gandalf and Dumbledore. The final few scenes with Marlon Brando were simply captivating, short but sweet. Vittorio Storaro's blending of darkness and shimmers of light streaking across Brando's face was simply breathtaking, giving Brando an almost god like aura. The scene itself probably belongs hanged up on a wall in the Tate Modern as much as it deserves to be on a film screen. The benchmark for all to follow.",9,0,1,14 August 2013
The Exorcist," Turn down lights. Turn up the sound and enjoy The Exorcist.
","The mere sound of the most infamous film score in cinema history; sends dogs cowering back into their kennels, cats clambering up trees for dear life and children's hiding under their covers, fearing the worse. 'I was always thought that film should be an emotional experience; it should make you laugh, cry or be scared. But it should also inspire and provoke you and make you reflect.' And that's exactly what Williams Friedkin's The Exorcist does, it both scares the audience witless, but most importantly it posses the intelligence to provoke and ask questions. When we think about the battle between good and evil, we looked to heaven and hell, too the superhero comics, too the war field of opposing countries. What we cease to forget the most prevalent battled between good and evil, is the one we all have to deal with on daily bases. For the greatest battles occurs on a more personal plane, the struggle we all face as we must choose between what is right or wrong, or the struggle of one's decision to accept region or two turn their back on it. The Exorcist is a film that seeks to unravel the mystery around faith, and the chilling truth between what we deem to be evil. And it's the ability of The Exorcist in to delve such an honest and uncompromising subject that has been neglected by cinema for so long, in exchange for the big budget spectacles, rather than focusing on the more important, the human condition. That has meant over 40 years later, its messages and themes, are still as relevant and potent as they were in 1973. But most importantly, after all those years as effortlessly retained its ability to frighten, and should be no surprise that no matter if you watched The Exorcist when it first came out or 40 years later, it still takes you on a bone chilling journey into your deep darkest nightmares. And guess what! It's all based on a true story, 1949 in Silver Spring Maryland to be exact. William Friedkin's takes both William Peter Blatty's novel and screenplay and weaves frightening real life tale of a movie stars who fights to determine the reason behind her daughter Regan (Linda Blair) violent mood swings, retreating health, and rotating head. She seeks medical, physiological and finally spiritual help to determine whether it is a deep seeded mental and physiological issue or is she truly being inhabited by a malevolent entity. The cinematography in The Exorcist is probably the best in horror film history; the delicate balance between light and dark fashioned by Owen Roizmans complements the piece superbly, acting almost as the perfect metaphor between the delicate balance between good and evil. You just have to look at the scene that has rightly been used on every advertising campaign and poster for the film, the one where Father Merrin steps out of the taxi in a fog filled street, only partially lit by one solitary light, It was both artistically stunning yet goose bump inducing chilly. The inspiration of the composition came to Friedkin from the portrait Empire of Light by Rene Magritte, which I felt suited the film perfectly. Another aspect of the film I enjoyed the most, where ironically performances of the two actors void of any acting experience before hand. Linda Blair was practically forced to audition for the roll by her mother and Jason Miller who played Damien Karras, wasn't even a trained actor and was in fact a play write and was studying to a real life priest. But looking back I suppose it was the lack of experience that brought so much fresh energy and vigour to the roll, because they weren't so self-conscious and preoccupied with how they were acting and pleasing Friedkin, but instead focused on actually being present in the scene, feeling all the same emotions the characters would be feeling. 'Over the years I have discovered that most people take out of The Exorcist what they bring in to it'So if you throw your entire being into the film and are willing to suspend your disbelief, then I guarantee The Exorcist will scare you in such away, that it will permanently leave a mark on your deepest subconscious, whilst shaking you to the very core of your being. So if you're ready, then I suggest you turn down lights. Turn up the sound and enjoy The Exorcist.",9,2,4,7 April 2014
Independence Day," spectacular
","It certainly doesn't possess the witty repartee of a Woody Allen, or does raise big philosophical questions like a Stanley Kubrick and doesn't even possess the technique or score genies of a Sergio Leone, but what Independence Day lacks in those areas, it more than makes up for it in; special effects wizardry, slick, epic fast paced action sequences and fun, humours performances, that once assembled, combine to make Independence Day a film that is a eye catching, heart pounding, awe inspiring Saturday night extravaganza that will never fail to entertain. Almost from the start it's clear to see that Roland Emmerich burrows extensively from all godfathers of Alien encounter films that came before; from the way the Alien space craft arrives in the sky surrounded in a plume of stormy clouds like scenes from the remake of War of the Worlds, the very look of the Aliens themselves clearly draw comparisons with Ridley Scots 'Alien', then you have the possible extinction of the human race to deal with, similar to The Day the Earth Stood Still. Some may say this is a signal of lack of imagination and originality on writer Dean Devlin part, but the way I look at it, imitation is the sincerity form of flattery, and I see Independence Day as more of a allusion or a homage of the highest respects to those past greats, rather than a mere cheap carbon copy (Well costing at 75million and grossing over 800 million, more like a very expensive and successful carbon copy). Being a typical big budget Hollywood film the premise is as simple as ever, a massive fleet of alien space ships arrive on earth after travelling billions of light years, but there isn't a ET amongst them, these guys mean business! And they didn't come to earth for friendly game of stuck in the mud or a casual stroll in the park whilst sightseeing; instead they are came here to destroy it and everyone on it. But once again, with this being an American Hollywood feature, the only guys equipped to save the world is the president (Bill Pullman), a computer genius (Jeff Goldblum) and a highly skilled jet pilot (Will Smith). Queue the waving of the flag, handing out of American pie and an Elvis Presley greatest hits album. But there nothing wrong with a little bit of patriotism, but Bill Pullman gives the customary great American speech about unity and courage, and the rebranding of an American holiday into a global holiday, Independence Day does take patriotism to a palpable extreme, often venturing into the irritating and ridiculous as it makes every other country seem incapable of coping without out their help. But I digress, after the US army seems incapable of penetrating through the Aliens shield, with all their bullets and bombs, Jeff Goldblum being the computer genies that he is has the genius idea of simply disarming the shields – wow give the Einstein an Nobel Prize right? Well one problem, to administer the computer virus that will infect the mother ship that will in turn disarm all the other ship's shields for around two minutes, they have to get up close and personal to do so – queue loud mouth, charismatic Will smith. To say that Independence Day was high concept film would be a massive understatement; it would be the same as saying Beetles were just a rock band. But I feel films that get labelled as high concept always get such a bad rep. What's wrong with appealing to all four quadrants of the film market, isn't watching films supposed to be an inclusive, communal experience. A film can bring together different; races, religions, genders and ages, surely that something that should be celebrated and encompasses everything that makes cinema so magical. And watching Independence Day was truly a magical experience; you just have to look at the performances, well the performance of Will Smith, who stands heads and shoulder above everyone else, in a film that made him an eventual global superstar. Like I said, he was loud and charismatic, making his character so enticing and exciting to watch. I simply love the scene when the Alien crash lands and tries to get out of its ship, only to be punched in the face by Will Smith, 'Well come to earth' which would probably go down as one of my all time favourite move scenes and quotes ever. His performance was almost as big and spectacular as the special effects even though they are from 1996, I feel they easily outdo some modern day big budget films such as the embarrassingly bad Olympus has Fallen. Independence Day is a truly enjoyable fantastic film that rightly deserved all its finical success; defiantly looking forward to seeing it again.",6,0,0,22 April 2014
Saving Private Ryan," a truly gripping and harrowing war film, unparallelled in the last 20 years.
","To everyone else, Saving Private Ryan would be a career defining film, both a critical success and a box office smash, but for Steven, it's nothing more than another stone in the pillar of greatness that is Spielberg, - just when you thought he had laid out all his cards on the table, he finds a way of surprising us again and again, as with each passing of a decade, he is constantly reinventing himself. With the like of; E.T, Schindler's list, Jaws and close encounters of the third kind, he has successfully cemented himself as the greatest living directors in the world. And Saving Private Ryan is testimony to that, a truly gripping and harrowing war film, unparallelled in the last 20 years. Blending breathtakingly stunning cinematography, skilled and controlled camera movements and sublime storytelling that is now regarded as a staple of all Spielberg films. But not too forget the help he received from an almighty performance by Tom Hanks, star of such films as; Toy story (1,2 and 3), Forrest Gump and most recently Cloud Atlas. From the gecko, we see instantly know why Spielberg won an Oscar for best director, as near the beginning of the film when the troops land on Omaha Beach on D-day in the midst of a horrific and bloody tug of war with the Germans - In a scene lasting for a staggering 24 minutes, but I would have gladly sat for another 20 on top, due to the share epic that it was. From the start of the scene, the camera work is somewhat very unstable, Spielberg's use of hand-held camera movement during the scene, helps add the effect of confusion and a rush adrenalin, so from the very start we are almost swept into the scene and immersed into the carnage. The instability of the camera movements perfectly reflects the total and utter chaos that the soldiers experienced. And I love this, because it showing us rather than telling us through 10 minutes of the soldiers talking about how bad the war is, making it far more captivating – a smart move from Steven. It is also interesting to note that the opening sequence is filmed in de- saturated colours, emphasising the negativity of the situation, making it seem more morose. This visual pathetic fallacy continues with the dark, stormy weather, making the death seem all the more cold and devoid of emotion. I could easily just review the opening sequence, because it was just that good! It should be taught at film school as a manual on great cinematography. Eventually amongst all the anarchy we discover the dead body of soldier with Ryan written on his backpack. Then fast forward a few days later, Army Chief of Staff Gen. George C. Marshall (Harve Presnell) reveals to Capt. John Miller (Tom Hanks), that all three Ryan brothers from the same family have been killed, and he tells John to find the fourth Pvt. James Ryan (Matt Damon), so his mother can have at least one son alive, so she doesn't have to go through that pain of knowing all her sons are dead. John Miller then brings together a troop of trusty soldiers to aid him in this quest. Consisting of; Cpl. Upham (Jeremy Davis), Sgt. Horvath (Tom Sizemore), plus privates Mellish (Adam Goldberg), Medic Wade (Giovanni Ribisi), cynical Reiben (Edward Burns) from Brooklyn, Italian-American Caparzo (Vin Diesel), and religious Southerner Jackson (Barry Pepper). What follow is a heart wrenching journey for both us and the men, as Spielberg cleverly draws out of us all, the colours of the emotional wheel as we've; Laughed with them, felt regret as some of them die on their journey, we have been scared as the ever looming Germans approach, we felt anger, frustration and the occasional breathtaking triumph. But what the performance I love the most out of that list of talented actors a superb performance is was performance of Tom hanks, outside the storytelling and the cinematography, it truly stood out for me, from the first time he pops up in screen, during the being on Omaha Beach, When we move on to one landing craft in particular, through a series of close ups we see the share terror in the eyes of some of the soldiers, then we shift to a close up of Tom Hank's hands shaking, and from that moment you could tell this was going to be a stellar performance from Tom, and he certainly didn't disappoint. Because he was just playing the character, he was living the character. As he's attention to detail throughout the rest of the film, helps us believe that is a hero who plays a good front for his soldiers, but is as sacred, and consumed with a feeling of trepidation and fear, just like the rest of them. To conclude, cinematography, Spielberg's geniuses and Tom hanks performance, are the most vital areas that needs to be covered when reviewing a spectacular film such as Saving Private Ryan, but most Spielberg, because without his brilliance and nonchalant camera angles, Saving Private Ryan may not have ever won 5 academy awards, or never would have become a modern classic, as it unfortunately came after the superb likes of; The Deer Hunter, Platoon, Full metal Jacket and Apocalypse Now, so the academy could have thought there wasn't another worthy story to come out of a War film due to the amazing stated, but Steven breaths ingenuity and intelligent filmmaking, to add new life to the war epic, standing up tall next to the greats of the war genre.",8,2,3,4 September 2013
Lawrence of Arabia," Game changing
","In 1962, the British film landscape was barren as compared to its glamorous and fruitful cousin across the pond, but appearing from the distance, almost a mirage at first, David Lean and Lawrence Arabia came forth, allowing the world to once again fall in love with British cinema. Based on a true story, Lawrence of Arabia tells the tale of T.E Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) as he ventures into Arabia to unite the fractured Arab tribes, in the hope he can galvanise them forward to victory against the almighty Turkish Empire during World War 1.I love how the cinematographer paints a masterpiece that wouldn't look out place in a art museum; using almost exclusively wide shots and wide mid shots, to allow always for the enormity of the breath taking landscape to be kept consistently in shot, and Lawrence himself only acting as a small dot upon the horizon, to the extent that he appears as merely just another trivial grain of sand on the desert carpet, as they agonizingly trudge across, showing us how unimportant man really is compared to the beauty and power of mother nature. But what stands out to me, almost equally, is the contrasting of two scenes that best represent the futile nature of war, because in the end no one really wins. This is best illustrated in one scene where Lawrence turns back into the desert to save Gasim, who wanders aimlessly through the desert alone. Constant editing cuts to the sun, act like a numberless clock, counting the hours to his demise, only to be rescued from the jaws of certain death by Lawrence. But only for Lawrence in a later scene, having to execute Gasim for a crime he commits that threatens to disrupt harmony between the Arab tribes. Lawrence's silhouetted figure dressed entirely in white against the blazing sun, towards the later stages of the film almost in one image capturing his entire essence of meaning to the people Arabia, they see him as a divine creature sent from the heavens to bless them. Even the audience is sometimes fooled into believing this also. In all our eyes, this blonde hair, blue eye person, is truly a messier, but lurking behind those same blue eyes, is a blood thirsty savage and I felt that Peter O'Toole was not just able to do this role justice, in my eyes he exceeded all expectations, and took the character to whole new depths that I'm sure even writer Robert Bolt wasn't expecting. Lawrence of Arabia is also blessed with a beautiful soundtrack that perfectly wraps up the entire masterpiece into a neat little bow, going a long way to explain why the film was described by Steven Spielberg as a 'miracle of a film', and for me directed by a miracle of a director. 'Tributes for a prince, flowers for a man' David lean is a prince of cinema that deserves all the tributes he gets, a true inspiration to all that follow. Lawrence of Arabia is a film that should not be missed.",9,0,2,6 February 2014
The Incredibles," Is it a bird, no it's a plane, no it's the Incredibles
","Is it a bird, no it's a plane, no it's the IncrediblesImagine if one crazed scientist had a colossal sized blender and put the love and affection of The Modern Family in it, then sprinkled some dysfunctional madness of Malcolm in the Middle and then added superpowers to the mix, I guarantee that what comes out still won't be a match for the crazy, adorable, high octane and utter zaniness that are the Incredibles. The dad is supper strong, the mother can stretch like taffy, and the teenage girl can become invisible and throw up force fields and the 10 year old is lightening fast, which is quiet lucky when they must come up against the rich, genius of the villainous Syndrome, who seeks to destroy the hero he once worshipped in Mr. Incredible and an the whole city along with him. Despite the film being an animation featuring a story line that was extremely fantastical, not once did I remember it was a movie. The actions scenes were spell bounding and highly imaginative. But most importantly, I really believed in these characters that spat witty sharp dialogue at each other at a furious pace, not just because they were funny, but because the characters were so believable and relatable. Subsequently it should come as to no surprise that film was nominated for a best screenplay Oscar, which is a rarity for an animated film, but this ain't just your average animated film, it's an Incredible animated film",9,9,12,29 May 2014
2001: A Space Odyssey," A exploration of time and space, and mans insignificant part in it all
","A lifeless corpse of a film that masquerades itself as one of the greatest SCI FI films of all time, to some poor unlighted individuals that clearly haven't seen planet of the apes (the original of course – remakes are just the sound of Hollywood's brain cells dying) Sometimes in life reputations exceeds reality, and this is none more true than Stanley Kubrick's a space odyssey. Before watching it I was expecting a symphony of cinematic perfection, but unfortunately it did not live up to the hype and hope of my expectations at all! If for some random reason I had a time machine, do you the first thing I would do? No not go back in time and invest in apple and Microsoft, or back in time and warn my younger self not to be a reading fan, unless I wanted to be miserable and constantly heartbroken, but instead to be a glory hunter like most of my friends and just support Manchester United, but instead I would go back in time and un-watch 2001. There are two completely different films within one. The first is an uneventful first 1 and a half hours, full of mundane, over drawn scenes that contribute very little to the tempo of the film, or don't help move the narrative forward. As the film starts off with two conflicting groups' of prehistoric man learning to hunt, until one of the two groups learns to use tools and conquers the other. Then we are propelled into the future when man has perfected space travel, the two events only connected by the appearance of a large slab known as the monolith. But it's not all bad; every cloud has a silver lining. As the second half and particularly the third act is roller-coaster of some thrills, excitement and mystery. *SPOILER*As man venture to the planet Jupiter, aided by the supposedly infallible Hal 9000 the most advance computer man has ever created, but after a malfunction, it goes crazy and upon hearing that the two remaining astronauts - Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood, to not be placed into suspended animation, wants to terminate Hal, due to an error. It then out of fear, attempts to kill every person on board the ship. *SPOILER* The final act is a strange scene, where the one of the astronauts spends the rest of his time in a large room, only to die and to be reborn into a gigantic space baby. But despite a better second half the film still lacks. As the popular saying goes 'A team is only as strong as its weakest member' so in this case, despite the film picking up in the second portion, it stills wasn't good enough to off seat the mind numbing beginning. But on the other hand the film is blessed with the most beautiful and mesmerising sound track I have ever heard, that is quite possibly the greatest collections of music in one single film that complements it perfectly. With scores I never knew the origins of but where a staple of everyday life, I was completely unaware that they came from odyssey. It also use of special effects and set designs, far ahead of its time, putting shame to some of today's uninspiring use of poorly created CGI. So from a technical view point it's a phenomenal fleet by Kubrick, but the story still lacks, it raises more questions than it answers, sometimes it works and they say art is subjective but it just didn't work for me in this case.",5,2,6,11 August 2013
The Graduate," Mrs Robinson, you're trying to seduce me?
","'Mrs Robinson, you're trying to seduce me'New wave meet American cinema, American cinema meet new wave. No other country in the history of cinema have contributed more to film and the splendid and beautiful tapestry of dreams that can so easily captivate a whole generation that it is, than America and France, insurmountable juggernauts – the very godfathers of the medium. So you would think collaborations between the two were a given right? That similar to football where a team would do what they can to get the two best players in the world in Ronaldo and Messi on the very same team and that's what every director would do with America and Frances. But fortunately for, a marriage of so much potential did come to fruition in the winter of 67, accompanied with a certain Midnight Cowboy, and would go on to be the most defining decade for one of modern cinemas greatest talents in Dustin Hoffman. The guy, who also brought us an Academy award winner Rain Man, was the very same guy who was told by a certain aunt that 'You can't be an actor. You are not good-looking enough.' Boy was she was wrong, but that's a great message for all you kids, people may say you can't do something, but if you believe in yourself, and with hard work you can do anything – anyway enough of the mum and dad speech, back to the review. Director Mike Nichols's The Graduate tells the tale of Benjamin (Dustin Hoffman) and his chaotic whirlwind of life, similarly experienced by most college graduates, where constant pressure about your future, from both interior, parents and the media are perpetually subjecting you too, when all you really want to do is just lay about in your parents pool and do nothing – one problem, your next door neighbours wife, to answer the quote I started with, yes she is trying to seduce you. But after a few casual and meaningless affairs with Mrs Robinson (Anne Bancroft), a spanner is thrown into the work when Ben falls in love with Mrs Robinson's daughter (Katherine Ross) - duh duh duh Soap opera moment right there! But it's not as cheesy as it might seem, on the contrary in fact, it does play out with a lot of comedic flair, but at the same time the brilliant acting performance exhibited by the three main charters add an element of heart and emotion, every bit as captivating as you would find in serious film like Schindler's list. If I sat down and gave you every superlative that came into my mind to describe what I felt whilst watching The Graduate, I would literally run out of words, not only in the English, but quiet possibly every language none to man, even the made up ones. And I say all this, because The Graduate is an absolutely masterful piece of cinema, that give us an interesting insight in middle America and their scandalous life's portrayed through articulate social commentary. And what I also love is the very later ball characters, despite being words apart economically; the film helps you remember we are all connected through love and pain. But the very best aspect of The Graduate is that it is blessed with quick, snappy and witty dialogue, cleverly architected by writers Calder Willingham and Buck Henry, based on a novel by Charles Webb. You just have to refer to the quote above, which I'm pretty sure you would have already heard thousands of time before, but couldn't quiet place it, but lucky for you I have come to rescue, the film is The Graduate. Go watch it, then when you're done, watch it again so you can take in every last tiny portion of brilliance that it is, and watch out for the extremely ambiguous ending, it will leave you praying at Oscar winner Mike Nichols's door step for a sequel, just like me.",Null,0,0,12 October 2013
Rocky," A true underdog story
","'In comes this big lug who weighed 220lbs, didn't talk well, and acted slightly punch drunk. He said he had an idea for a boxing script and wanted to star in it' - Rocky Producer Irwin Winkler.To make things slightly clearer, Let me paint the picture, the year was 1976 and a 31 year old had a script which took him just three days to write, but he wasn't just content with just a measly writing credit, he was adamant in the fact that he wanted to play as the lead, he was offered mine boggling figure to sell the script outright so that producer and execs could add a more recognizable lead – because let's face it, the guy so strapped for cash, had to appear in – well let's just say, films of a adult nature , for a messily 200 bucks, just to make ends meet, then for the next few year he had the occasional lead role, in let's just say, not the most fashionable of films, but mostly his body of work consisted of bit parts. Then when he was able to retain his place as the lead of the film – well the rest was history, the guys name was Sylvester Stallone (eventual star of the Rambo films and The Expendables) and the film was called 'Rocky', which went on to nominations for Best Actor and Best Screenplay at the 49 Academy Awards, making the Stallone the third man in history to be nominated for those two award from the same film. The film itself was the very first sports film to win Best Picture and even picked up a Best Director for John G. Avildsen (The Karate Kid).Your classical rags to riches story, as a poor young man from Philadelphia, takes the opportunity to fight the world heavy weight champion, whilst at the same time trying to win love. I felt it was an almost herculean effort for a first time writer. Although true it's a simple premise, I would admit. It takes no Newton to understand, but there is genius in its simplicity, and because of that enduring quality it renders it as a powerful and inspirational film that strikes a chord with so many of us. Rocky it a film that the whole family can enjoy over and over again, well the first Rocky anyway, did I forget to mention that there were 5 sequels that all sucked, to the existent that they became a parody of themselves. But no matter how bad they get – and they do get bad, they will never distract from the genies and uplifting Rocky, with the killer sound track 'Gonna Fly Now ' (my new ring tone) played over the montage(which inspired me to work out) is probably one of my favorite sequences in film, but wait we can't forget the stair running scene, so iconic it's ridiculous, I would literally swim to America just so I could run up the steps (if I still have the energy left over from the swim) But all in all in my opinion rightly so that Rocky was the winner of Best Picture award.",8,0,0,12 October 2013
Some Like It Hot," Marilyn Monroe. Enough said.
","'Movies should be like amusement parks' filmmaker Billy Wilder once said 'People should go to them to have fun'. So If Some Like It Hot was an amusement park: it would Thorpe Park, mixed in with Legoland, added with a dash of Disney land. Some Like It Hot is the granddaddy of comedies, the Godfather of laughs and the Mike Tyson of punch lines. Heck! Watching this film is like getting into the ring with Muhammad Ali, as you're constantly hit with fast paced gags. Even when you're least expecting it you're hit with a punch line so funny it leaves your side aching, or a piece of slapstick comedy that leaves your eyes running. Even the fade out line has been regarded as the funniest and most famous in history. Once you hear it, you'll guarantee never ever, ever to forget it. Trust me, it's hilarious! After playing witness to a routine gangland shooting, two penniless Chicago musicians, Joe and jerry decide it is the perfect opportunity, to remain safe and get paid a easy buck when they decide to take up residence in an all girl band heading to Florida, crossed-dressed as Josephine (Tony Curtis) and Daphne (Jack Lemmon). But with the only simple aim of getting paid and avoiding the mob, things soon get a little more tricky when a ditsy singer named Sugar (Marilyn Monroe) captures the heart of' Josephine' and a eccentric playboy millionaire falls for 'Daphne'.Some Like It Hot is one of those rare occasions, where everyone involved is at the very peak of their powers. Billy Wilder's directing is subtle but instrumental in loading every scene with comedic material ready to pop out like a wound up jack in the box. The writing is excellent, it constantly moves at a furious pace. Imagine Usain bolt on roller blades with jet pack attached to his back, and still that's not even as fast as how the dialogue rips through every scene. People may say that the comedy is too high concept, but for me that's the very reason it's so damn funny , as well a begin genius, because it means that the jokes will stand the test of time and span all generations because it's so easy to understand. Anyway who likes having jokes explained to them? No one! But you can't talk about Some Like It Hot, without mentioning Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon, who were absolutely perfect for their roles, each adding a feeling of assuredness to theirs, as well as bucket full's of originality with every facial expression as well as every line. Initially I was not convinced by Marilyn Monroe, as I felt she was slightly overrated, but in her role as Sugar, she brings a lot of composure to the role adding balance to the high energy of Tony and Jack, but still getting her laughs not through straight jokes but by simply being able to deliverer every air headed line with great delivery and timing. Whilst still being able to remain sweet, helpless and innocent, even as she plunges picks into a solid cube of ice with great fury, as she talks about her weakness for Saxophone players. Some Like It Hot it like a magician of comedy, you never know what to expect next, as with every new scene you so excitedly anticipate what piece of comedic magic it will pull out of its sleeve. For me Some Like It Hot is the funniest comedy film I have ever seen, even though it is almost 55 years old, its comedy is still so accessible and funny too!",9,13,14,4 January 2014
12 Years a Slave," Only once in a decade do you feel that a film has truly opened its soul to you
","Only once in a decade do you feel that a film has truly opened its soul to you; we have had the likes of Apocalypse Now in the 70's and its brutal honesty about the destructive power of war. Shindlers List in the 90's and its personification of mans remarkable ability to change and self sacrifice. Now in the 2010's we have 12 Years a Slave, which I consider to be a Pandora Box story at its centre, showing that hope can often be the only thing left strong enough to guide you through some of the most unspeakable cruelties. Director Steve McQueen's 12 Years of a Slave is a historical drama based on real life accounts of Solomon Northup, a Free African American family man with a beautiful musical gift (Chitwetel Ejiofor) who in 1841 who was wrongly sold into slavery for 12 years. During that long struggle, his every turn was fraught with pain of being kept away from his family and the pain of watching his fellow people subjugated to stomach turning horror. But unlike on TV, when the horror gets too scary and real, you can't change channels. During those years of being sold and moved, he encounters a wide spectrum of different people and masters; on one side he comes under the ownership of Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch) one the very few slave masters who seem to have some semblances of a moral compass as he tries in vain to keep a family together instead of allowing them to be sold separately. Then later on we have a cameo from Brad Pitt playing Samuel Bass, a builder who seems to be the only white person in the film who voices adamant objections to the treatment of the slaves. While on the offer more sinister side there is Tibeats Paul Dano a man who is clearly threatened by the far more intelligent Solomon who is fast becoming a favourite of Ford, which causes Tibeat to seek to humiliate Solomon and punish him at his every whim. But the real villain is Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender) who starts off as the most ambiguous of the other slave masters encountered. In the beginning he seems passive and submissive to his wife, but as the film progresses he grows more and more deranged and insane fueled by his predilection bordering on obsession with Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o), a cotton picking slave girl. This truth infuriates his wife (Sarah Paulson), causing tension between the two of them, especially when the wife is faced with the crushing blow that she will always play second fiddle to Patsey. Just to play devils advocate, from four amazing actors who brought you Tyler Durden, Eli Sunday, Magneto and Sherlock, one of my few criticisms on 12 Year of Slave is that I would have wanted to see a little more of these fine actors and the characters I felt remained largely unexplored in the film. On a film diet consisting of emotional drenched Marlon Brando ramblings and big resounding Al Pacino speeches, initially it perplexed me how Nyong'o's and Ejiofor 's more subtle and less extravagant performances were able to garner a Oscar win and nomination. However upon reflection I realized that the performances were perfectly suitable to express both characters systematic beating down, the time and era and the emotional stress each was under throughout. And because Nyong'o and Ejiofor were able to evoke and encompass such difficult hardship in natural understated manners, it showed their deep understandings of the text as a whole and the unique turmoil of each character. In terms of an overall response to 12 Years of a Slave; I initially didn't know much about this subject because back in school I always felt that the slave trade was a segment of history that was always underexplored. But this film sought to correct that, as it offered a great educational experience teaching me a lot about the plight and hardship unfairly thrust on to these innocent people.12 Years also reminded me again that cinema has the ability to transcend from shackles of just being about entertainment and the spectacle, when in fact it can be so much more than that. It can be a way to hold to our society a mirror reflecting only unflinching sincerity exposing the truth of humanity, from our compassionate nature too our darkest and sinister capacity for evil. While at other times a single film can teach you a lot more than an entire library of textbooks, because while a good book asks you to engage your mind, a great film asks you to engage your entire being and soul . Another thing about 12 Years that I enjoyed was Patricia Norris's good enough to put Downton Abbey to shame costume design certainly which caught my eye. At times it was like watching a beautiful 1900's painting of the bourgeoisie coming to life. 12 Years of Slave remain on the fine light between the arguments of; is it is important to constantly remind ourselves of the past so to ensure that it never happens again? Or does such reflection only ensure that the past is repeated because by continuing to look at the despicable atrocity of the history, you only succeed in adding more timbre to the blaze of hostility and breed more mistrust. But my stance on the subject is rather cleaner cut; by ignoring of the past is denying the essences of these good people the solace of allowing their suffering to act as a reminder to all future generations of how not to treat people, because whilst the slaves lost their bodies to the slave trade, the masters and owners lost more in the way of their souls and humanity.",9,0,1,31 August 2014
To Kill a Mockingbird," sweet and tender
","Arguably the strongest bond of any relationship between two human begins, more than; the husband and wife, more than two sister and even more than a mother and her daughter. The strongest of all bonds is the one shared between a father and his son. The father being the mentor, whose job it is to help his son, to guide his son through the unsteady, turbulent and sometimes painful sea that is life. His kind words of encouragements must act as sails boats to guide us into man hood. Well Mockingbird is not strictly just a father and son relationship, there is also a daughter added to the mix, but despite that, Atticus Finch is the perfect illustration of what a good father should be as with stern love and mostly importantly education, he teaches his children to love in a world full of hate, and for me that's the greatest lesson any father could teach his children. And To Kill a Mockingbird is the perfect illustration of a true American classic. Based on the Pulitzer-Prize winning masterpiece novel by Harper Lee (Her only novel), writer Horton Foote and director Robert Mulligan, ingeniously guide us through a painful period in human history for all those involved, a period of economic turmoil and the very apex of racial tension in the deep south, Maycomb, Alabama, in 1932 to be more precise. But what makes the film the even more compelling is how we are shown a world filled with so much ugly, but at the same time we are lead to a single red rose of beauty, because we are shown the world through the eyes of 6 year old girl called Jean Louise 'Scout' Finch (Mary Badham) a high spirited and precocious young girl, who despite her innocent smile, you certainly don't want to find yourself on her bad side. On her journey she is accompanied by Brother Jeremy Atticus 'Jem' Finch (Phillip Alford), neighbourhood friend Dill Harris and last but not least farther Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch. But it's through Scouts eyes we see her father a nigh-on perfect, eloquent and intelligent lawyer seeks to uphold what is true and just, in a world that seeks to abuse and belittle a whole race of people, as he puts it upon himself to protect a black man in court against the bigoted arm of injustice. The black man is Tom Robinson and he has been accused of raping a poor white girl named Mayella Violet Ewell, but as you would expect in 1932, an all white jury sees him as guilty even though the film consistently paints him a positive light, suggesting he is innocent. Despite this, Atticus still endeavours to protect a man he firmly believes is innocent, leading to one of the most impressive and compelling (and longest) courtroom scenes in history. The two things that stood out to me the most was, for one Gregory Peck performance as the father, which I felt he defiantly deserved his Best Actors Oscar for his performance, because as many times as I watch the film back I can't help but fall in love with it again and again, because peck is able to take a onion layered character who one point his a pacifists, loving father, then a second later he shots down a dog 100 meters away with just one bullet, as if he was in a Clint Eastwood film. And it's this ability to take such a complex character, with so such juxtapositions at his core, and be able to do Harper Lee's character a great service with a gentle, controlled and fine paint brush flick from a true artist. The second thing that stood out for me was the three young actors who made the film such an enjoyable and funny watch, each brought passion and enthusiasm to the role, which helped Foote's script truly come alive. Ranked 33rd greatest American film for a reason! An intoxicating watch, I strongly recommended it as viewing for all occasion.",8,1,2,30 January 2014
Jaws," You Will never want to go back into the water
","The 1970's was the very first to start the blockbuster trend? Yes no prize for guessing, it was the 70's, let me illiterate once more if you haven't got the message – the 70's was the greatest decade for film, like ever! So what film and director started it all off? Well that prize goes to a little known director named Steven Spielberg and the honour of being the first blockbuster film goes to..drum roll (queue drum roll- well at least you tap the desk) please .. It is – Jaws a film that made every resident of a small town, scared to go into the water. Yes Jaws was officially regarded as the very first film to coin the term blockbuster. It was the summer of 75, and a little known director, with just $9 million in his back pocket had a little film called Jaws that he wanted everyone to see, of course it doesn't take a genius to guess what a film with the name Jaws would be about. Would be about a killer shark? – but wait your wrong, it isn't about just your average shark, no in fact it a giant killing machine shark! Ha never saw that coming did you. Well anyway to cut a long story short, Spielberg took that little known film, and with a clever marketing campaign, we was able to turn $9 million, into $450 million and became rich and successful, then he decided to release a little known film in 77 called Close Encounters of a Third Kind, which made$340 million from $20 million, then from there he became even more rich and successful then he was already. How nice for Spielberg. But what I think made Jaws so successful and a completely chilling watch, was the fact that during the entire film, you rarely actually get to see the shark full on – which abides to the rule of all good horror film, DON'T SHOW THE MONSTER! Although technically they didn't show the shark because at that point CGI was not in use, so they had to use a rubber shark, and let's be honest who is scared of a rubber shark.",Null,2,5,12 October 2013
The Wrestler," Not quite the WWE
","After the catastrophe that was the Fountain. Giving Darren Aronofsky the one two punch of having boomed in the box office and being universally panned by critics, it seemed Darren's Hollywood career was down for the three count – but all was not lots, it seemed the heavens had parted, and the film gods had bestowed upon him a saving grace in the form of an almost a fly on the war documentary-esk poignant exploration into the very real and not so glamorous side of professional wrestling, consumed with obsessions, addiction, loneliness and depression, almost a world apart from the allure and intoxicating magnetism of the bright lights of the world famous WWE.Playing the title main character and also making his way back from the Hollywood grave yard, from a short spell and mild success in professional boxing, Mickey Rourke (staring most recently in Iron Man 2 and The Expendables) was built for this role as his character was coming to the end of this career battered and bruised, which is exactly what Rourke went through in the twilight years of his professional boxing, and with this firsthand experience pays dividends in his breathtaking and occasionally poetic performance as Randy 'The Ram' Robinson, who can't quite give up life as a professional wrestler, even though long as gone; the thousands of fans, the money, the women and his health. What is now left behind is a; two inch shorter man living in a trailer, which he struggles to pay for with the little money he earns from the shifts he has to almost beg for at the local supermarket, and where the manager takes every opportunity to put him down and make another stupid wrestling joke. Even his wrestling career is not what it used to be, instead of a sell out crowd in Madison square garden's, is now a crowd of just under a thousand in a high school gymnasium. You would think the guy would quit, but he's love that sometimes borders on the side of obsession for wrestling, keeps him going - that and the fact he is too scared to face the real world. But luckily for him he is given a new lease of life when he is given the opportunity of a lifetime to recapture past glories when he is offered a rematch with the Ayatollah, who at the high of his fame, fought years ago in the 1980'S . But standing in his way is; a heart attack, a daughter that hates him in the shape of Evan Rachel Wood (The Ides of March ) and a stripper slash love interest in Marisa Tomei (My Cousin Vinny and In the Bedroom) who wants him to quit the business before it gets him killed. I personally felt the director captures magnificently the juxtaposition of emotions that a wrestler can go through in matter of milliseconds, from one point having the feeling that they are on top of the word filled with the euphoria of a deep sense of belonging as hundreds and thousands of people scream your n name, then after the count of three and the sound of the bell, the sense of belonging almost seems to despair as right after the match the wrestler return to their solitary and lonely existence. These polar opposites are conveyed perfectly in the opening few scenes, as we start in the midst of a high profile match, seeing montage of pictures of randy on top of the world with fans screaming for more, to a few scenes later where he returns to his trailer park only to find that it's been locked out – he even has to break in just to have somewhere warm to sleep for the night. And I felt it was refreshing to see such an honest portrayal of the world of an athlete, which I felt would have been a far better sequel to Rocky, then the rubbish we were subjected to for another 4 predictable and unnecessary 5 sequels, so if Rocky was the perfect start to a career, then Wrestler would be the end. 'Randy the Ram Robinson giving absolutely everything he's got! This is the very definition of heart!' - That is a quote from the very first scene as we hear the commentary of a match, but those few words seem to set the pace and tell you everything you need to know about the film, which is about heart and following your dreams no matter what. The wrestler is a welcome return to our homes and our hearts by two comeback kids, Darren Aronofsky and Mickey Rourke.",8,0,1,29 August 2013
Platoon," In war no one wins
","'First real casualty of war is innocents; the first real movie on the war in Vietnam is Platoon'That is a quote from the trailer that I felt encompassed what I felt about Platoon to a T. What makes Platoon so realistic is that it is part of those rare occasions where you have a story born from a director's firsthand experience, but that's what you get with Oliver stone, who served as an infantry soldier in Vietnam, allowing him to create an almost autobiographical account, and in some instances a documentary into the under belly and less glamour side of war – and by glamorous I mean not a place where you shot bad guys, then come home to a giant marching band and a handshake from the president, but instead it's actually a place where real and sometimes innocent people die. With so much realism it should be no surprise that Platoon won four Oscars in 86 in the best director, picture, sound and cinematography categories. Platoon tells the story of a student named Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) in the late 60's who joins up for the army believing in his heart that he is fulfilling his patriotic duty, and I feel in some part that deep down he believes that he will go to Vietnam fire a few bullets and return as a hero. But upon reaching, he joins up with a diverse platoon of men, in the outside world would probably never rub shoulders with, but here they move as one, lead by two men; Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger) a man with a scared appearance, that adds to his mystical aura of being a man that cannot be killed and the other Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe) who through the use of mind altering drugs is able to maintain an air of calm. But Chris Taylor's dreams of heroism are quickly obliterated as they delve deeper into enemy territory, witnessing acts of despicable evil towards his fellow man by the very same men he serves within the same platoon, making him quickly realises how naive his ideas of war as they are not a rite of passage he once thought but instead war is actually hell on earth where no side wins, captured perfectly in dark and sinister cinematography. Reading of the credits was like a who's who of Hollywood icons, it was probably one of the most successful bringing together of star names up until then, with the likes of; tom Berenger, Willem Dafoe (Born on the Fourth of July), Forest Whitaker (The Last King of Scotland), Keith David (The Thing), Johnny Depp (Pirates of the Caribbean) and Kevin Dillon. You are guaranteed to find a name amongst them that is one of your favourite actors. But in a sea of big names and future big names, I still felt Charlie Sheen (Hot Shots) was able to stand out and deliver a convincing portrayal of a conflicted man, caught up in the ultimate battle with himself as he has to choose between what's right and doing whatever it takes to survive, so basically choosing between safety of the body or safety of the mind. I also felt with such complex emotions he had to show at a drop of a hat, and doing them so well that it was a surprise and travesty that he wasn't nominated for a single big award. I really do feel that a man's innocents is truly lost in a war, and it is a shamed you don't get to see it played out on film, but that is what also makes Platoon so special because unlike previous films based on the war in Vietnam such as; Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter or Coming Home. Platoon is the very first not to look at the war from the wide perspective, and not get caught up in the big budget special effects. Instead it takes a profound and uncompromising leap into the very depths of the human condition; never shying away from exposing the sinister side to us such is in the case of Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger) and penetrating through the sense of false bravado to leaving a film offering a sincere exploration of self.",8,1,1,21 August 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," The third in Christopher Nolan's trilogy
","How did a film that went so right go so wrong? The Prestige, memento and Inception, need I say more, a film CV that any director in the film industry what kill to have. All three being the creative offspring of a director, that likes to blend big budget films, with complex narrative and intriguing plot twists. Not like another certain director cough, cough Michael bay... Following on the duck tails of Batman Begins and then The Dark Knight, we have The Dark Night Raises, with Christian Bale again playing the capped crusader. The last in what should have been Hollywood's greatest film trilogy and the perfect way for Christopher Nolan to kiss bon voyage to the comic book world, in a memorable fashion. Instead we the viewer, where meet with the unenviable task of watching a great film dynasty, crumble in front of our eyes. Nolan had the simple task of building on what he did so well in the first two instalments, but instead he tried to be to overly ambitions. In other words the guy was one on one with the keeper in the world cup final, but he got to clever and tried, one too many tricks and ended up shooting the ball wide. The dark knight rises tells the story of a fallen hero, billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne and his alter ego batman. Who has to rise up to the occasion and stop the powerful bane or in banes words 'mumble muummble batman Ummm mumble' as he plots to destroy Gotham city. Not only this he, faces the aftershocks of events that proceeded from the dark knight rises, as he lost his love interest, and other the physical challenges in the form of escaping a massive hole in the ground. There was me waiting to watch a slick, sumptuous, action packed extravaganza, instead I was meet with a preachy lecture on social commentary and the ideology behind a mask man in tight, unflattering spandex, gyrating in front of me. Coupled with the minor, insignificant detail of not being able to understand what one of the major characters in the entire film - bane played by Britain's own Tom hardy was able to say. The dark knight rises was an excruciating watch that I wouldn't recommend, even to my worst enemies.",6,2,5,11 August 2013
Moonrise Kingdom," window into our childhood, in the shape of this heartwarming coming of age film
","So precise and uplifting it has to be alien, but yet so raw and heart aching, it can't be anything, but human. Writer/director Wes Anderson's takes us down a picturesque; autumn, country side road into our youths. A cinematic time machine that propels us back in time, to a simpler land, where peace and tranquillity run supreme. 1965 is the year that moonrise kingdom takes places, a warm and enchanting coming of age fairy tale, where love can brings together two lonely 12 year old misfits, one being a smart, awkward and resourceful scout, the other is a deadpan girl with anger issues, as they set out to take on the world. Whilst coming out the other side, smelling of roses and with no sign of heat break in sight. But not all goes to plan, due to them running away; they soon have to escape the ever-advancing arm of the law, in the form of scout matter Ed Norton and local officer Bruce Willis. But during this whirlwind of chaos, a violent storm threatens to change the lives of the entire sleepy inhabitance of New England forever. I would go as far as to say that Wes Anderson is an artist, as every scene is painted with rich, vibrant and bright textures, which light up the scene. Injecting a hint of magic into the air. Which I thought perfectly represents the innocents and vivacious quality of the two child main actors. Stylistically, many can draw comparison to Royal Tenenbaums, a film directed by none other than Wes Anderson with a similar feel, including misfits and dysfunction characters wading through life with dry humour and a scene of togetherness, which I feel that this form of characterisation, is an acquired speciality of Wes Anderson, Coincidently leading him into two nominations for best screenplay Oscars, for moonrise and the royal Tenenbaums. As much as I applaud Wes Anderson, beautiful story, I'm just not convinced by the performances of mister Die Hard, Bruce Willis and Ed Norton aka hulks smash, reason for this is that they are just too big and brash, for this sort of film, and can't quiet fit into this small and unique world that Wes crafts so well. It's like forcing a square peg into a round hole. Often being quiet difficult to endure both actors poor attempt to show true companion, leaving me so tempted as to fast forward any time they appear on screen, until I reach the runaway performance of both main characters, Kara Hayward and Jared Gilman. In a world full of big, over the top blockbusters, leave it to a small indie-esk, Wes Anderson picture to allow our imagination to fun free, and provide us with a story with true escapism to blow the rest away. Last year was a good year for films, but moonrise kingdom should be on top of everyone's 2012 list, a must see for all film lovers.",7,0,0,11 August 2013
Her," how many times can I fall in love with this film?
","2014 will go down in history as one of the greatest single year for films; it has proved to be a year that truly offers a spectacular selection of talent and genius, laid out before us for our film enthusiast ravenous consumption of each and every one of them. With the likes of; the historical epic set in the times of slavery in 12 Years of a slave, Gravity a monstrous journey into the far reaches of space and Dallas Buyers Club a welcome return to the silver screen for Matthew Mconaughey. Each of them, are absolutely excellent and will thus make the race for the Best Picture Oscar an undeniably thrilling, compulsive watch, but for me the only true stand out competitor for Best Picture is Her written/directed by Spike Jones, a fantastic exploration of love in the future, but really behind the futuristic gadget and gizmo's, it is really a film that shines a satirical mirror against our very own society wedged in between a war involving love and computers in a fight for a place in our hearts. Her tells the story of introverted writer (Joaquin Phoenix) of love card and letters, which is ironic when you consider his life is void of all love, but that soon changes in the most extraordinary of circumstances when he falls in love with his computer's highly advanced operating system voiced by Scarlet Johansson, yet your left wondering if the tin man can actually have a heart, as they grow closer and closer together; but is she really reciprocating the same feelings like a human being would or is that simply just in her or it's programming? While other reviews I simply had to use my mind and finger tips to write, whereas on the other hand; reviewing Her for me is like opening my heart and soul and allowing it to do the writing for me, because to simply put it, how Joaquin Phoenix feel in love with his computer is how I have fallen in love with Her. A beautiful multi-layered story, that operates on so many different levels; it appeals to your heart via the marvellously sculpted characters and the performance behind them (there gotta be Oscar for voice over work right?), the way it has so much to say about our modern world and whether this over reliance on the digital phenomena is actually good for humanity in the long run. Finally, it is filled with Oscar nominated stunning set pieces and production design, as well as dazzling cinematography that almost makes you feel as if you fell as sleep and work up in the middle of a Picasso gallery, but I wonder if the drenching of the colour orange in the film was intentional or by accident. But the one drawback I couldn't help ignoring, was that I felt the story was to linear and didn't offer much subplot in the way of Amy Adams who plays Joaquin Phoenix best friend, because I felt it would have been really interesting to see how her relationship with the operating system developed and how her marriage degraded, which I felt what of added more emotional richness to the Her palette.",9,0,1,27 February 2014
The Breakfast Club," That the grass isn't always greener on the other side.
","Serving detention on a Saturday morning is a teens absolute worst nightmare, but then also having to do it with your natural born enemies, makes medieval torture seem rather tame. But only when their worlds collide could they find out they have a lot more common than they originally might have thought; whilst also finding out that the grass isn't always greener on the other side. It should come as no surprise to find out that the king of all teen films, had to be helmed by John 'the king of the 80's Hughes', who with the most seminal of all teen and coming of age films ever in the Breakfast club, single handedly brought a fresh teen view and perspective to the adult masses. Of course he has ventured into the world of teen films before with the likes of sixteen candles and Pretty in Pink, but in The Breakfast Club he takes it t all new conquering heights. The American high school experience is generally always coupled with the notion of clicks, your cheerleaders, nerds, geeks etc. but when you see Breakfast club with its jock, popular girl, rebel, geek and the weird girl, it is plain to see where the archetypes and labels come from. It wasn't just the outstanding pioneering accomplishments Hughes brought to BC, but it was the uncompromising honesty and heart he brought to the film as well, which is its true selling point. Throughout BC 97 minute run, it never once degrades itself into the realm of pandering to cheap stereotypes and gags just to raise a few laughs and fill screen minutes, instead it chooses to explore the painful truth of adolescence; the never being able fitting in, never seeming to be good enough or never being able to comply with your parents ideals and their suffocating high expectations no matter how hard you try. Being a teenager can at times be about struggling to find 'self' when you don't know what 'self' is and being crushed by the weight of endless possibilities. Whilst at the other end of the spectrum it can be about having the world at your feet inviting you desperately to explore it in its entire splendour, as well allowing you to become the very definition of care free. So it was this fine exploration of the paradoxes and delicate balance of adolescence that Breakfast Club was so effectively able delve into, leaving a profound after effect on not only me, not even a whole generation, but on cinema itself. What I loved best about BC, was the verve and energy all the young actors brought to their roles, but trying to choose a favourite amongst the five main characters, is like trying to choose your favourite child, because each of them has found an equal place in my heart. Another aspect of the film I simply adored was the heart wrenching closing scene when despite everyone objections, popular girl Claire bursts everyone bubble by telling the painful truth, that no matter how strong they thought they bonded with each other, the fact remained that because they are all from different clicks at school, come Monday they would go back to being merely passing strangers in the school halls again just to save face in front of each of their friends. I've watched the film 4 times already, but as long as my computer keeps on working and the DVD keeps on playing, then I'm going to keep on watching.",8,1,1,25 July 2014
Donnie Darko," head scratching, thought provoking, sweat inducing experience
","Have you ever tried Sudoku, Brain Training on the Nintendo DS and watching Countdown all at the same time? Sounds like a difficult task right? Well that's exactly the level of head scratching, thought provoking, sweat inducing experience I had while watching Donnie Darko. I have literally watched the film three times and I still don't understand one iota of the mind bending Rubik cubeness of this film. What does it all mean? Because I literally don't have a clue! Donnie Darko is one of those few films that I have found completely impossible to distinguish whether it is so far out the box that it is actually the box itself type of master piece, like Stanley Kubrick's 2001 Space Odyssey or Shane Carruth's Primer or is merely utter rubbish masquerading itself as an intelligent and unique film, such as Minority Report and Oblivion – Ummm I wonder what both films have in common? From what I can decipher from Richard Kelly's (director/writer) story line, is it is based around this character Donnie Darko – sound like a superhero right? Well that character is played by Jake Gyllenhaal, which I'm pretty sure every mother, daughter and girlfriend already knows who he is. The guy has been know to have demonstrated time and time again that he posses a lot of range as an actor, appearing in films such as Zodiac and Brokeback Mountain. But in this particular film he once again plays against all heartthrob type casting by playing a genius teenager who knows everything there is to know about the Smurfs – make him President right? But at the same time he is a very troubled young man, one of these troubles manifests itself in a 6ft tall bunny named Frank who tells him that the world will end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes and twelve seconds. So for the rest of the film he tries to unravel the mystery around the strange occurrences plaguing his life. Along the way the bunny that only he can see, keeps popping out of now and telling him to do stuff such a flooding the school and setting someone's house on fire. But don't worry it's not all doom and gloom, there is some really cool science stuff revolving around time travel and all its possibilities for you SCI-FI enthusiasts and there is also a love interest in the form of Gretchen and beautiful girl whose life is riddled with misery for all you romantic types. The film is also riddled with a abundance of acting stars, such as local author Patrick Swayze, cool and mysterious teacher Drew Barrymore and high achieving older sister Maggie Gyllenhaal – and yes they are related in real life. Okay now we got that out of the way, what works in the film? Well the acting performance are all subtle, no one is playing to outperform anyone else's, instead the main cast all remain true to their idiosyncratic odd ball characters which makes them all so endearing and likable. My favourite performance was Jena Malone's, who was able to build a character that at the drop of the hat can be strong and fierce one moment, then sweet and fragile the next, which was why it was always a delight to see her come on screen. Another aspect of the film that I loved, was the way the film never wants limited itself to just the one genre, instead it was constantly evolving and changing; one minute its wacky and funny shown best in the family meal scenes, the next its sci-fi awesomeness in the scenes between Donnie and the sciences teacher and it suddenly becomes sweet and lovely, illustrated best anytime Gretchen and Donne are together. but what I didn't like in the film was the way they had such captivating and interesting characters, mainly being Drew Barrymore's teacher character who I felt could have added so much to the narrative yet was given such a passive inconsequential role. I also felt that Richard Kelly should have added a lot more in depth meaning to the piece, because it seemed all to shallow and lacking in any real direction and strong ideals to convey. Okay sure I still don't know if I loved or hated it, so all I can say for certain was that I enjoyed watching the film and would strongly recommended anyone who is in the mood for something unique and off beat and with plenty of amazing acting gold.",6,1,3,3 April 2014
Beetlejuice," An imaginative, eccentric macabre extravaganza
","There are very few directors currently working in Hollywood today that you will describe as unequivocal auteur of their own films. The few examples you could point to would be Martin Scorsese and Wes Anderson, whose every film almost seems to have been single handily sculpted by their own very bare hands, adorning each with their signature and flare. But as good as those two are, for me the grandmaster of auteur directors in our modern day world of film is indisputably Tim Burton; known for such classics as Edward Scissor Hands and Alice in Wonderland, is the very godfather of black comedies, quirky characters and zany plot lines, three characteristics that I could also use to describe Beetle Juice. An imaginative, eccentric macabre extravaganza that paradoxically inspires both fear and humour in its audience as they sit down entranced by every outlandish, skittle coloured nightmarish frame that Tim Burton wonders us with. Beetle Juice tells of unfortunate tale of a newlywed couple Barbara and Adam Maitland, (Alex Bald and Geena Davis) find themselves trapped amongst the dead after a fateful accident involving a dog, a river and a bridge. But the mere fact that they are dead, which is quiet hard for them to come to terms with it at first. But that just the good news, the actual worst bit of their predicament is that they find themselves trapped in their house with the excruciatingly irritating Delia Deetz wonderfully played by Catherine O'Hara, who is so annoying she makes all younger brothers and sister the world over look like delightful saints. Delia comes accompanied by her husband Charles (Jeffrey Jones) and their eccentric daughter Lydia, who looks like she could be queen of the Goths as well as a long lost relative of the Adams family all at once, but she turns out to be an actually nice person - I guess you should never judge a book by its cover. But after a lot of failed attempts to scare the Deetz family out of the house, involving such pathetic fêtes as using a bed sheet with eye holes cut out, something that even Casper the friendly ghost would be embarrassed by. The couple admit defeat and turn to the foul mouthed, belching, farting and idiotic self proclaimed 'bio-exorcist' known as 'Beetle Juice' played expertly, hilariously and with ferocious abandon by Michael Keaton (Batman). But unlucky for everyone, the deceitful and rotten Beetle Juice is not a person to be trusted... Warren Skaaren and Michael McDowell screenplay is full of laugh out loud moments brought upon by dastardly, demonic one liners that always promise to pack a punch, couple that with Tim Burtons ingeniously choreographed special effects, set designs and make up and styling which they rightly earned Beetle Juice a Oscar for and topped of with perfectly crafted offbeat, wacky performances from the entire cast, all of which help make Beetle Juice a electrifying, exhilaratingly fantastic watch best served with the lights switched off and the volume turned up.",Null,0,0,24 April 2014
