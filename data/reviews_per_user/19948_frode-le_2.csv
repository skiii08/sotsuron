Blade Runner 2049," Same story could have been told in an hour less
","This is the second time in my entire life I've found myself struggling to stay awake in the cinema (last time was during 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind '). The plot itself is interesting, but everything is just so dragged out for the sake of dragging things out. If you read the reviews, tweets or general comments from people who loved the film their argument is that everyone who thinks it's too long and slow paced are too stupid to follow the plot, or demand constant action. If that was the case I would not have enjoyed 'Interstellar', but I was absolutely mesmerized by it and the just below 3 hours it lasted went by like it was nothing.I enjoyed the general dark tone and cinematography, but that's pretty much it.About halfway through the movie picks up the pace a bit, not action-wise, but the story starts coming together. Sadly at that point I had completely stopped caring about any of the characters and I just wanted it to end.",4,7,14,9 October 2017
The Hateful Eight," Why is it almost 3 hours long?
","Unlike many others who gave this movie bad reviews for the violence or the excessive use of the 'N-word', I don't think that's the problem. After all, it's a Tarantino movie.My main gripe with the movie is that it is simply too long and boring. I liked it at first. The cinematography, landscape, props and costumes are all really good and sets a great mood. But it just feels like someone is constantly turning a knob to just slow down and stall every single event. Every piece of dialogue feels watered down and dragged out. The cast is solid, but they can't magically turn almost 3 hours of mediocre dialogue into a great movie. There are some funny moments, but not nearly enough to save this movie.For the first time, I've actually felt disappointed after watching a Tarantino movie, and I honestly think that if any less known director had made the same exact movie, it would not have been called 'brilliant' or a 'masterpiece'.",3,15,30,24 January 2016
