Scarface," The stench from this movie is gagging, pure Toilet Fodder!!
","If you are interested in Gut wrenching Awful movies then this is the film you should see, wallowing in unpleasantness for nearly three hours, how many people have seen this movie and become cocaine addicts because they envyed Tony Montana, and Michelle Pfeiffer it seems the only acting talents she has come out when she acts like a BitchIf you want to see her best film I suggest **Hollywood Knights**As for Scarface stick to the 1932 film with Paul Muni and George Raft Instead This film zero stars out of five",Null,0,1,24 November 2003
Once Upon a Time in America," Sergio Leone's 'Once Upon A Time In America'
","I have been reading all the reviews for a movie 'Once Upon A Time In America', and I have never been dissapointed with the movie, but the lack of interest by the part of the movie going public.Today unless a movie has a nasty loud Rap soundtrack, and things are constantly being blown up, movies hold no interest for movie patrons expecially those under 30, I have seen Once Upon A Time In America over 50 times, I have seen the short version(119 Mins), I have seen the longer version(227 Minutes)(Laserdisc), and now on DVD for the 1st time I have seen the Cannes(229 minutes) version which was only shown in Europe up to now.I read one review on the DVD where someone did'nt like how the DVD(Disc 1) ended in the middle of a scene, actually anyone familiar with the movie would tell you the scene was over, they actually could have removed the intermission on Disc 2, but they don't have a full intermission as on the Laserdisc it is 4 minutes.I have a copy of the Soundtrack, Two copies of the Laserdisc and Two copies of the DVD, this is a fantastic movie and a new found classic by the current movie junkies(Not those who listen to Rap Music), I am talking about people who listen to classical music and like it!!Also to appreciate a 4 hour movie, you need to watch it alone, no wife distracting you or kids annoying you which keeps pulling you out of the movie, remember movies were designed to be watched un-interrupted.This is not a 'Chick Flick', it is doubtful that women would enjoy this movie expecially the violent rape scene, this is a movie for the kid in all of usThe reason why the DVD is one two discs is because Disc oneu uses both layers and preserves the quality and sound, the same is said about disc two, if the movie was on one disc it would be grainy and the sound would be terribleMy gratitude to Warner Brothers for doing an excellent job on this DVDMovie(*******) out of (****)",Null,2,5,14 July 2003
X2: X-Men United," X2: X Men United(Jealous Aren't we)Fantastic Movie!!!!
","I have read the reviews on this movie and I mean come on people, from the opening scenes of the Nightcrawler attack on the President to the closing scene this is a fantastic movie!!, longer than the original, but it has to be due to all the new characters, I didn't see one wasted sceneBrian Singer has truly proved that he is a great director, the fight scenes were all choreographed by professionals and everything is convincing, no un-believable over the top scenes that stretch credibility, but truly awe inspiring actionI truly hope there is an X3 and as good as the first two movies have been I am sure that one will please as well(****) Out Of (****)Note: To those of you who make comments like 'I want my money back', I wasted two hours of my life and I want it back!!', and statements like that you need to get a life!!, Stop wasting our time with those Quipps!!",Null,0,0,26 November 2003
Dodgeball," Forget the Nay Sayers!!, This is a Damn Funny Movie!!
","I just watched Dodgeball last night and I can't remember laughing so hard at a movie in years, from Vince Vaughn finally being cast as a person you can like to Rip Torn who is always at his best as the sarcastic coach who is full of colorful one-liners, and I didn't start out as a Ben Stiller Fan, but his movies have seriously picked up in quality latelyFrom the supporting cast and the cameo's everyone does a top notch job, Gary Cole is especially amusing as the sports announcer and his always missing the point sidekick, The Dim bulb Chris Klein type Dimwit on Vince Vaughns team adds to the hilarity, and Missy Pyle(What A Babe!!)Forget what all the Negativity from the other reviewers state, this is a comedy, a comedy is meant to entertain, it is not Casablanca or the Producers, but it is not meant to be(****) Out Of (****)",Null,122,165,12 December 2004
