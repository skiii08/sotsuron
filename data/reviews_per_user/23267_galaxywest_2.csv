The New World," Magical Movie of the Earth and Love
","I finally got to see The New world on DVD. I was expecting it to be the kind of movie that I like, and I was not disappointed. Wow. I have not read EVERY user comment here at IMDb, but what I have read I can only second. Well, I went to Rotten Tomatoes to see what the critics said. 58% liked it and 42% didn't. Well, there are a lot of morons in the ranks of the critics who JUST HAVE TO BE CONSTANTLY ENTERTAINED. No car chases, I guess. The CNN critic said it was like watching a 'snail crawl across a eight lane highway.' How dumb. This is a problem with all the BAD CRITICS -- they have attention deficit disorders, I guess.",10,3,7,6 June 2007
Gravity," Gravity's Big Miss was Important
","It's 'big miss' is the already admitted impossible 'let go' of George Clooney's character Kowalski by Sandra Bullock's Character Dr. Stone. (When Dr. Stone let's go of Kowalski's hand Kowalski would not have floated off into the wild black yonder, he would have stayed exactly where he was. And, in fact, there was no reason to let go of Kowalski's hand -- all she needed to do was pull him back to the tether line ... because he's weightless. It seems that it's no big deal to the people who like this film a lot. Well, I liked the movie too but there are a lot of other ways that Kowalski could have 'died' in the movie and any one of them would not have been as dumb as the one they used. (What if in 'Gone with the Wind' Scarlett floated down the staircase instead of walking down the staircase.) But ... since this is a space movie such a dumb impossibility is forgiven.",7,2,4,14 December 2013
