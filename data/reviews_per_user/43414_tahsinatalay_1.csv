Blade Runner 2049," Much appreciation after second watch
",After watching the movie a second time i was able to appreciate it more than the first time around. The choice of stylistic aesthetics for the visuals were pretty sweet and the Soundtrack let's you immerse into the slowly unfolding plot which i found pretty open until the end. One of those movies i regret not watching it in the cinema.,7,1,9,13 September 2019
