The Blair Witch Project," 2nd movie is so much better!
","This movie was a bunch of crap, every other word was F*** and the whole time they were arguing over who lost the map!! I didn't want to see the second one but my friend  made me see and it is actually scary and interesting. They shouldn't have even made the first and just made the second one!!Common People!!",Null,0,1,25 June 2002
