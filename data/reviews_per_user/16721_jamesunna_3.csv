The Incredible Hulk," OK but doesn't really stand alone
","Edward Norton is great - the special effects are amazing. If I'd watched this film aged 10 I would have given it 10/10, but at aged 28 I'm a bit more cynical. The thing that annoyed me the most is the lack of a clear ending. I mean the latest Batman film 'Dark Knight' is amazing and although its left open it doesn't feel like the first part of a two parter. This film does.Maybe I'm being harsh only giving it 6, after all I was annoyed when the film just ended in what I thought was the middle, I could happily have sat and watched another 2 hours of this. Its the film equivalent of junk food, not the best but you can eat loads of it.Take your kids - they'll love it, but if you were expecting comic book excellence on a par with 'Dark Knight' you'll be a little disappointed.",6,2,5,19 September 2008
Doctor Strange," Ever wandered what taking DMT or experiencing a K-hole is like?
",Well wonder no more. Without wanting to include any spoilers I will say that this film has special effects that nail the visual aspect to a full on psychedelic experience. DMT or a decent K-hole are just as visually spectacular but somehow more... strange. For a taste of what is possible with recreational pharmaceuticals watch this movie!,8,1,1,22 October 2017
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Thoughtful film about what makes us who we are..
","A girlfriend or boyfriend that doesn't work out can be one of the most painful things we can ever experience. If given the chance would you really want to erase them completely from your memory? The title of this film could be written as a question: Is there eternal sunshine for the spotless mind? Or perhaps we have to take the risk of great pain if we are to ever experience great joy and to really live life.The science behind it is kinda reminiscent of the science behind the matrix. Somewhat questionable. However as with the matrix if you can suspend disbelief it doesn't matter. The film is one that needs to be watched at least twice. The order is not strictly chronological and on the first watching you might not have a clue what's going on. However bare with it. When it started to make sense to me it bought tears to my eyes with its poignancy.One of my all time great films. Jim Carey who got on my nerves in Dumb and Dumber is excellent in this more serious role. Great script, great acting and a haunting soundtrack make a great movie. A must see.Oh and well worth a watch with a plate of special K. Hehehe...",10,0,2,28 March 2006
