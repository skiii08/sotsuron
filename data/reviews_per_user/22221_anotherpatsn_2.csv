Kill Bill: Vol. 2," super bad
","I've never seen a worse sequel in my life. This movie is so boring and shitty it made me wish I was watching The Talented Mr. Ripley. The tiresome attempts of Bill's assassins getting to Uma are about the same as the coyote after the road runner. You know it's just not going to happen. All you know is that Uma will kill Bill. And I expected it to be ten times better than when Uma took on Oren-Ishii. instead I felt let down by Quentin Tarantino for the first time ever. And yes I have seen Jackie Brown. I think it's a damn good movie. But you just have to a fan of Shaft and Superfly, Foxy Brown, and that type of s**t. Kill Bill vol. 2 was like church to me unfullfilling and an utter waste of time and money. I could have spent a Friday night watching a Twins game or something worth while. Perhaps even PAINT DRYING!",1,21,41,19 July 2004
Batman Begins," Not the best Batman but worth the 8 bucks.
","This Batman was incredible with it's action scenes. Christopher Nolan was a great choice as a director for the film. However the script by 'BLADE BUTCHER' David Goyer, and the Batman performance by Christian Bale left me wanting more and more to go home and watch the Michale Keaton Jack Nicholson Batman. However Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne was simply terrific. He just was a crappy Batman. Scarcrow is a complete fag too. I WANT TO KNOW WHERE THE HELL TALIA WAS! Ra's Al Ghul's hot daughter Talia was no where to be found in this film. But it did feature Katie Holmes' nipples through a silk shirt. FABULOUS! Morgan Freeman seemed a bit underused but not near as much as Rutger Hauer. Liam Neeson as Qui Gon Jinn, I mean Henri Ducard, if you can find the difference you tell me.",7,0,1,15 June 2005
