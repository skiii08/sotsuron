The Expendables 2," Fantastic
","This review is the easiest I've ever done.If u haven't seen this yet, why not? Simply put, if u r a fan of action movies this is a must. Its just 90 mins of complete FUN so do yourselves a favour, get some popcorn/treats, make yourself comfortable & enjoy the Expendables 2, u wont regret it. ENJOY. There is nothing more to say but as i need 10 lines..... FUN, A BLAST, AWESOME, TERRIFIC, FANTASTIC, AMAZING, WONDERFUL, EXPLOSIVE, FUNNY, GREAT,STUPENDOUS, DYNAMITE, BRILLIANT, CRAZY, EXCITING, INCREDIBLE, MIGHTY, MAGNIFICENT.Got the idea yet? i gave this a 9 purely cos nothing is perfect but this movie is about as close as I've seen an action movie get to being perfect. Watch it & see for yourself.",9,2,2,17 October 2012
Prometheus," Not sure what to make of it.
","I am a big fan of Ridley Scott & am a big fan of the alien movies but to be honest this film confused me. i found it impossible to have any kind of sympathy for the characters & when characters were killed off i actually enjoyed watching them die as it meant i would,not have to see them on screen again. The action set-pieces are exactly what id expect from Ridley Scott- awesome. As an action movie i would have rated it higher but as im rating this as part of the alien franchise i have to say i am disappointed. The DVD re-cut is supposed to answer the questions that this film left unanswered such as the ending,( the ending on this version tbh confused the hell outta me ). And apparently there's a supposed tie-in to Bladerunner in this movie (oh god, pls say its not so). so to sum up...If you are in the mood to just sit back & watch an action movie then this movie is great for you & there are worse ways to waste 2 hrs but if you are like me & love the alien movies then i think you will be disappointed so get the DVD & pray the alternate cut is what this movie was supposed to be.",4,1,4,17 October 2012
