Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," What hasn't been said about this movie?
","George Lucas has done it again. Set thirty years before the events of the original trilogy, THE PHANTOM MENACE gives us a glimpse at the golden age of the Republic before the 'dark times'. The writing, the direction, the SFX, and the triumphant music of John Williams all blend together into one incredible movie that will be watched over and over by fans and non-fans alike. I mean, who didn't get chills when the STAR WARS title appeared and went backwards and the traditional title scroll appeared? This is a STAR WARS movie in every sense of the word. We have good guys, bad guys, aliens, spaceships, robots, and crazy alien sidekicks. This is what we grew up on, it's all here, but expanded upon and given a new epic feel. I feel sorry for those bashers who say this movie has no plot, you couldn't be more wrong. The story in THE PHANTOM MENACE is more complex than the ones in the original trilogy, it not only gives more depth to the saga overall, but it starts the ball rolling for Episodes 2 & 3. THE PHANTOM MENACE is an excellent first chapter in Lucas's sci-fi saga. I can't wait to get into Chapter 2!",10,0,0,20 December 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," An excellent continuation of the prequel trilogy.
","SPOILERS FOLLOW-YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!
So we return once again to a galaxy far, far away and I couldn't be more happier. Ten years have past since the events of THE PHANTOM MENACE, now there is turmoil in the Galactic Republic, the Dark Side is clouding everything and a young Jedi apprentice named Anakin Skywalker is torn between his devotion to the Jedi Order and his love for Padme Amidala, former Queen of Naboo.ATTACK OF THE CLONES is the fantastic second chapter of the Prequel Trilogy, which spellbinds you from the first ever ROLL-UP in the STAR WARS films as we see the beautiful Naboo Royal Cruiser making it's way to land on Coruscant. It's a beautiful sequence but also had a note of foreboding to it as well, only moments later we see the ship destroyed by an assassin's bomb.
As with any epic saga, THE PHANTOM MENACE was the first chapter that set up everything and gaves a few hints at what's to come. Despite the naysayers, TPM is still a great solid STAR WARS film in the tradition of the original trilogy but has a flavor all its' own.ATTACK OF THE CLONES starts moving and never lets go until the moving ending, where Anakin and Padme are married in a forbidden ceremony on Naboo. The action, the story, the music and wonderful digital effects by Industrial Light & Magic are just first rate here and it astounds me that people hate this movie. Ah well, it's their loss isn't it?Like I said before, these prequels are much more epic and sweeping in tone than the original STAR WARS movies were. That's because they take place in the last decades of the Old Republic, where things are more formal and classical in tone. This includes the romance between Anakin and Padme, it's not a 'tacked on' plot device. It's a romance that has its' roots in the purest Shakespearean sense, the two lovers who come from different worlds, are drawn to each other despite it being forbidden for them to do so.
I don't want to give anything more away but I will say this, I *cannot* wait for Episode III. *grin*George Lucas proves once again why he's regarded as a master storyteller and why the STAR WARS SAGA will live on for many decades to come.",10,0,2,18 February 2004
