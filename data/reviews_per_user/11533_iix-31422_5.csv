Ford v Ferrari," Story between 2 friends.
","It's not a race movie. The racing part, is to give context to the relationship. If you know anything about Carol Shelby you would understand that relationship was everything to him.
I read somewhere here someone complain about the fact that it was ' Utterly predictable' Ha ha ha. Yes, it is based on a true story. ;)
Were there a few rehashed pedal and stick shift scenes? Yes. Where the race scenes exaggerated with 'Gas pedal' room to overpass other cars? yes. But overall, it's a movie. The amount of people in real life that actually put the pedal to the floor is a small percentage. If you have never put you car on a race track,,, there is always 'gas pedal' room to pass other. It just makes it more 'actionny' for humans that don't race.",8,2,3,7 December 2019
First Man," Didn't even make it to the 'no flag' scene.
","All this noise about not seeing the flag on the moon in the movie. I didn't even make it the take off to the moon. If you asked the camera guy to shake the camera more, he would probably answer that it is physically impossible. The original film of the flight to the moon didn't even shake that much with 60 year old tech. I was also not interested in seeing actors's pimples in these never ending close-ups. I gave up after 45 minutes wandering why I was watching this. I was learning nothing new and it was just torture to the eyes.",1,3,9,12 January 2019
Captain Marvel," Poorly executed
","Just not that great. Would I watch it again? No CGI was worst than Black Panther which weren't very good. As for Brie Larson, if you are going to be silent (lack of interesting dialogue) make sure that the actor can convey emotions and is eye candy like Brad Pit in 'Legends of the Fall'.
It's a B-movie. Probably not going to be re-watched a lot. I would have paid 5$ to see the movie. Not 14$",3,7,14,9 March 2019
"I, Tonya"," When the description of the movie is not what you get.
","They described the movie 'Competitive ice skater Tonya Harding rises amongst the ranks at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships,' When in reality it is a story of abuse between deranged people. I was getting ready to watch a sports bio pic... There is no rise amongst the ranks in this film. That story-line is the 17th most important in the story-line after the fact that her idiot husband can't fix a car. 
I gave it a 4 because the cast was good. They are really good in the movie but it is just not a good movie to be in.",4,16,37,28 December 2017
Man of Steel," I love this movie.
",I watched maybe 15 times. I always feel good after watching it. It's been 6 years since it came out and still the best DC movie out there. Are the fight scene a little long? Maybe but besides that.... Superman should have never mixed in with Batman. I hope they make an other one without the DC universe.,10,2,2,18 September 2019
