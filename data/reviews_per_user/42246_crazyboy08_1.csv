50 First Dates," All kind of emotions
","I was a little kid when I first watched this movie in 2005. Although it has been broadcasted many times on television since, I simply always enjoy to watch it every now and then. I almost never re-watch movies, but I always check this one out when it's on.The jokes are funny, but it's not just a laugh. The story has some sad parts and it really got me as a child, I still seem to find it a bit sad.In short I would say it's a good, romantic comedy movie about a really difficult relationship. From the moment Henry meets Lucy, to when he finds out about her memory difficulties and starts to make her fall in love with him everyday. In the beginning it comes with a lot of funny situations, but later on it starts to get harder when her family and Henry start telling Lucy about the accident every morning and she wants Henry to go on with his life without her. After a lot of struggles they still work it out and the happy ending shows Lucy and Henry are having a child now and are still together, while she still has the memory issues.I think the end the best ending this story could have had. I personally hate to watch a movie like this and have the characters split up at the end. I also would've disliked it if they made an ending with Lucy wonderfully getting her short term memory back, after one of the doctors they visit in the movie found a solution or something for it.I give this movie a 7 out of 10. Far from the best, but very enjoyable for me. The actors were great too.",7,2,2,24 July 2016
