Howl's Moving Castle," A Weak Miyazaki Film, But Still A Miyazaki Film
","I'm an enormous fan of Hayao Miyazaki. With each and every one of films one can expect lavish animation, an enormous amount of creativity and imagination, and an experience that pulls the viewer into another world. I find in each of his films there is a scene or two that simply puts one's jaw to the floor and leaves this sense of epic satisfaction. All of the above exist in Howl's Moving Castle, as does a certain amount of flaw. This flaw lies in two elements, and unfortunately they're the most important elements in the film, the story and characters. The story takes place in a fictional world of sorcery and magic. A laboring girl named Sophie falls under and aging curse from an envious witch. She ventures, somewhat unwittingly, to the home of the wizard Howl, which is a large castle capable of moving anywhere in the fabric of existence. In short, the story is overwhelmingly complex and contains a lot of separate factors that conform around the leading characters. As you can guess, Howl's Moving Castle suffers from trying to pack too much into one plot. We have multiple character arcs, not a mention of war going on at once. Now that doesn't sound too difficult, it's been accomplished before. But this is Miyazaki film, and things are extremely deep with a lot of subliminal work that there's just not room for. The story comes off as being very choppy as well as rushed. What's worse is, the spaces between the many chunks of story are very small, and could have been resolved with an extra thirty seconds of dialogue and animation. The story also lacks a time lapse, and the viewers are supposed to buy that all happens within a relatively short amount of time, which is fairly difficult with all things considered. I think this is in part due to the fact that Howl's Moving Castle is not original piece unlike most Miyazaki films. This was actually based off of a novel by Diana Jones. And it displays all the flaws one has come to expect of a book to film conversion. Not to mention Diana Jones is a British author and Miyazaki is a Japanese animator, so there may have been a slight amount cultural disconnect. The flaws of the story spill into the flaws with the characters. Now the large cast of characters are very well developed, three dimensional, interesting and entertaining; however they're not very consistent. Sophie's actions constantly contradict either something she previously did or said, or anything a reasonable person would do. Howl is said to be a cruel, heartless womanizer who exploits and tortures women, yet we're never shown him doing so. And the above isn't just a rumor amongst the characters; it's a firm fact, and its existence is one of the main plot points. Not to mention there's one scene where he acts like the complete opposite of his character in the rest of the film. All of this boils into a climax, that while drawn and executed perfectly, is mind-boggling and makes no sense whatsoever. Another thing worth mention is: while watching the film (I preferred to watch it in Japanese, which is my recommendation) the subtitles frequently displayed dialogue in which I couldn't hear anyone talking. Either this is the result of a faulty DVD, or really bad sound mixing, likely the latter. I know it sounds like I'm really bashing the film, but it's just one of those movies where the positives (which there are plenty of) are just hard to put into text. The art direction and the way the story is expressed through the animation are spectacular and the atmosphere it creates is nothing short of magical. The story contains a lot of passion, and its themes of lust, deception and warfare are integrated very well. I found myself very attached to the characters and the scenes are so well crafted, they alone make Howl's Moving Castle worth multiple views. My favorite animated movies, which I also view as the best, are films that succeed at the surface but really strive beneath it. Films such as Princess Mononoke, The Fox and the Hound, and The Secret of NIMH are examples of films that do this perfectly. Howl's Moving Castle gets better and better the deeper the experience goes. The subliminal messages, the emotion and the attachment are absolutely perfect. But it's at the surface where it fails. I really wanted to love Howl's Moving Castle, but the rough story and two-faced characters kept me from doing so. I did however like it, and it's pretty hard not to.",6,0,1,16 May 2011
Princess Mononoke," A Masterpiece of Animation
","Hayao Miyazaki, Japan's equivalent of Walt Disney, has given us some of the best animated films in history; including Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle. Princess Mononoke, in my opinion, is his finest creation. Princess Mononoke centers around the young and noble hearted Ashitaka, whom after being cursed by a demon, must journey to the sacred forest to be exorcised before the curse ultimately destroys him. On his journey, he encounters several forest spirits, a group of iron workers, and a mysterious girl raised by the forest's wolves. The story focuses on the constant clash of man and nature, and how both must make sacrifices in order to coexist. There are no heroes, and no villains. All shareholders have motivations that can be sympathized with, and some that cannot. The story is deep, compelling and flows very well. I will admit at times it can become moderately confusing, especially when elements of mysticism are introduced. However it's presented so well, I feel that the confusion is my fault, not the film's;. It's as if my insufficient mind isn't capable of grasping the magnitude of the plot. The characters: human, animal and otherwise are all well developed, multi-layered and interesting. The animation is the Miyazaki standard: very bright, very vibrant and always carrying energy and emotion. The action scenes are some of the best in all of animation and the entire film carries with it a sense of awe and wonder. The film even manages to take several actions that we would otherwise consider disgusting, and make them appear beautiful. The music corresponds to the scenes perfectly and moves the story almost as much the animation and dialogue. I recommend you watch the film in Japanese as the English dub is very good in places, but downright annoying in others. Once I realized that Toki was voiced by Jada Smith, I switched over to the subtitles. But watching the film in English won't take much from the experience. I could praise the film for hours and it's truly one of the greatest films I've ever seen. It's gripping, creative, intelligent and correctly delivers one of the most difficult to execute themes in all of film. Absolutely watch Princess Mononoke.",10,0,1,7 April 2011
