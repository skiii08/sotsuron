Walk the Line," Almost there ...
","I found Walk The Line to be a good, enjoyable movie; Witherspoon and Phoenix both are excellent, and it strikes me that any time Reese wants to switch careers to become a C&W singer she's probably got a legitimate shot at being a star. When was the last time you saw a Hollywood movie with the principals doing their own singing *and* it all worked out? (Moulin Rouge me no Moulin Rouge, Obi-Wan was strictly amateur hour) That being the case, I've a few nits to pick. With a couple exceptions, the first half hour of the movie left me wondering how far I'd get before flipping the DVD off. Phoenix's voice in the early going was dull, flat, and nearly lifeless (although I wonder whether it was just that his timbre and range were far better suited to Cash's later music?), and you had no sense that this would become a legendary singer. The early exposition was terribly rushed, going from vignette to vignette in a choppy, barely-explored fashion. Beyond that and throughout, it struck me that scenes with other stars (such as the ones with Waylon Jennings and Elvis) were thrown in more for their namedropping than any dramatic purpose. It kept the movie from being truly great, IMHO.7/10.",7,0,1,10 January 2007
Requiem for a Dream," Horrifying, amazing story
","I admit I forced myself to watch the whole movie; there is more pain and torment in it than I wanted to watch and almost more than I could stomach. The movie deserved that much, is all, from the writers to the director to the actors whose skill made it so terribly real.I've since thought that the worst thing about this movie is its rating. Teenagers shouldn't be banned from seeing this film ... this terrifying depiction of the possible consequences of drug addiction should be *required* viewing in every secondary school in the land, and it'd have far more of an impact than any DARE program or 'Just Say No' ever could.Unfortunately, that won't happen, because far be it that our children should watch a film that has (gasp!) deviant lesbian sex in it, however much it's the least erotic non-rape sex scene in cinematic history -- and is also likely a reason that this film didn't attract Oscars. (I've long since thought that Jennifer Connelly got her Academy Award in A Beautiful Mind for being little more than eye candy because the Academy didn't dare to give her one for her incredible performance here.)I couldn't honestly tell you whether this was a 'great' movie or not, but it is a *necessary* movie.9/10.",9,1,2,29 December 2006
Ali," Let's consider this: movies are STORIES.
","This one wasn't.We nearly turned off the DVD in the first ten minutes, a vastly overlong montage during which the Cooke tunes effectively drown out what dialogue there was, and the perspective keeps changing in a dizzying and incomprehensible melange of unrelated events.Eventually the movie pretended to follow a linear plot, but only in jerky vignettes with damn near zero for exposition. My wife and I are both Smith fans, but while I'm a sports historian and am quite familiar with Ali's history, she wasn't. Even with my knowledge, I was painfully aware that the movie inferred without actually telling; yep, that must be Malcolm X up there ... yep, I know Clay became a Muslim and changed his name ... yep, Bundini Brown was his longtime sideman ... yep, Howard Cosell was an involved commentator ... Over and over again, I had to stop for a moment to think 'Oh, right, this is THAT incident, gotcha,' and filled in the background from my own memory.My wife wasn't nearly as lucky, and any movie in which I pause ten times in the first forty-five minutes so that I can tell others what in the heck is going on isn't worth spending another hour of our lives on.3/10, and that's pretty much of a gift for this wasted opportunity.",3,2,3,27 December 2007
Juno," I seem to have missed the part where this was supposed to be a political documentary.
","Let's get a few procedural matters out of the way, shall we? (1) Quite aside from the bizarre (if common) view that failure to explicitly condemn/praise a point of view = condoning/rejecting it, sometimes people make choices. It's not the job of a film to - somewhat dishonestly - suggest that protagonists must consider every possible option with equal weight or make a choice in a sensible and clear-headed fashion. Neither must such a choice reflect political or moral allegiance to one side or the other; a lot of human beings, weirdly enough, do what seems good at the time or pick the least bad option. Oddly enough, quite a few pregnant teens *do* reject the option of keeping the baby out of hand in favor of abortion or adoption, and if this *were* supposed to be a political polemic, do we really want to encourage 15-year-old single mothers? (That being said, plainly Juno *did* consider the option. 'I'm a kid,' she said, kicking the notion to the curb.) (2) Sometimes people (and even teenagers, and even their families), react in level-headed, supportive ways in a crisis. For everyone who screeches that Juno is unrealistic because her parents don't take (too many) swings at her, physically or verbally, gosh ... parents have been known to react that way. Not everyone is a hot-headed screamer.(3) Works of fiction are not required to (and seldom do) 'handle things responsibly.' Kids screw up. *People* screw up. And some brush themselves off and muddle through as best they can. I'm sure it would have satisfied the amour propre of many of the critics if Mac came after Bleeker with a shotgun, if Juno went through screaming fits, if she and Mark slept together, and if somehow Juno was grotesquely punished for her sins, but dern it all, you didn't get to write the screenplay.(4) Kids use 'dude,' 'like,' 'whatever' and all other manner of jargon all the time, and have since Ugh the Caveman complained to Ughina about how disrespectful the cave kids were. Wrap your head around the fact and move on.I know, it's really hard. You all want the movie to be exactly what you want, with characters who make the exact choices you would yourself (or pretend you would, anyway), reactions that exactly meet your preconceptions, and with those people whom you peg as good guys and those who you peg as bad guys getting what you think they ought to have coming to them ... and most of all, to agree thematically with your political, social and moral philosophies. It's a pity when you run into a flick that doesn't measure up.Where I differ, though, is in the sheer *indignation* I'm reading in the comments: how dare this movie not reflect my worldview? And that's desperately unfair.8/10: it's realistic, it's honest and ... it HAPPENS.",8,1,3,10 September 2008
The Devil Wears Prada," Just too damn formulaic.
","Disclaimer: I'm unfamiliar with the book. But my wife and I are Anne Hathaway fans, so we picked the flick up at the library to view.Now, yes, the cast does their parts professionally, competently and with as much verve as the script allows, no error. It just seems that the film missed no opportunities to hit every single possible clich√©, and there wasn't a single moment you didn't see coming a mile away: * You know that Andrea is going to turn into a fashionista (it isn't as if Hathaway hasn't done the Ugly Duckling routine before) suddenly become Ms. Competent Workaholic with no time for her Ordinary Friends and Boyfriend, but nonetheless go back to being Sweatshirt Girl with the Serious Meaningful Job before the end.* You know that Miranda's going to be a complete, unreasonable bitch.* You know that there's going to be the heartwarming moment where Miranda has her own personal crisis, and you know the period of sympathy the audience momentarily has for her will be limited to the seven minutes it takes for her to pull her next screwjob.* You know that Nate will be ordinary, down to earth and soulful (hey, he's wearing black eyeliner all around his eyes, of course he's soulful and deep) and rebel against his lady's work hours.* You know the affable wannabe boyfriend will prove to be a user before the final reel ...And so on, and so forth. Just about the only part I genuinely appreciated was Andrea's calm speech about how no one would bat an eye at these behaviors were they done by men, but that isn't enough to sustain a movie.5/10, and only because the acting performances were solid.",5,2,4,23 July 2008
Die Hard 2," Sorry, I'm just not dumb enough.
","Look. It'd be nice to like this movie. Bruce Willis is himself, after all, and presents the same engaging, Everyman cop he did in the first Die Hard.But it's not that you have to suspend disbelief to enjoy this movie, you have to abandon everything you know about the real world.For Chrissake, it's not that there are a few alternate airfields within two hours' flight; it's that there are *hundreds*. Let's leave aside the nonsense that the snow's enough to close National, less than 30 miles away as the crow flies: there are five other airports that can handle 747s in VIRGINIA (not counting BWI), even if you leave out the military bases.And even in pre-9/11 days, terrorists crashing Dulles? We wouldn't get a single anti-terrorist platoon, we'd get a REGIMENT. Can't crack the terrorists' radio communications, right near the headquarters of the NSA and the military's codebreaking establishment at Fort Meade? Can't signal the other planes to go elsewhere, when you've got the military airbases at Andrews, Bolling, Anacostia and Quantico right next door? So many other boners: a plane empty of fuel blowing up like it's carrying a hundred tons of TNT? Jet fuel lighting up with open flame? A stream of flame catching up to a plane at TAKEOFF SPEED? SMG bullets penetrating SWAT body armor? Grenades with the longest fuse times in cinematic history? Ejector seats that blow a couple hundred feet in the air? On and on and on go the idiotic bloopers. No wonder Bruce Willis hated this film.4/10, on the back of Willis' performance alone.",4,1,5,12 March 2015
Moulin Rouge!," A stunning waste of opportunity
","I was one of the many with a strong urge to walk out during the first ten minutes, but Tropical Storm Allison was outside the theater, so I stuck it out. The movie settled down thereafter, but never decided what it wanted to be. A contemporary Disney musical, done live action? A Pythonesque chaotic farce? A dark tragedy? A show piece for how good Nicole Kidman looks under colored filters? A ploy for Oscars for production values?Look, Python could have done its bits twice as well at a tenth the budget. In the meantime, while Obi-Wan sang credibly, I pay $8.50 a shot to see professional performers performing professionally - amateur hour we see for free on local cable - although poor Kidman was born 50 years too late to be the musical superstar she may have been. MacGregor sang as well as Travolta did in Grease, and that's all the praise he merits.(Meanwhile, did anyone notice that for all the money spent, not one thin dime went to anyone who could dance a lick? Vaudeville dancing WAS slightly more than flipping skirts to show skin while legs kicked spasmodically in random directions. Props to the director for the quick cuts to make it tough to notice how poorly executed the dancing was)Top 250 of all time? Bah. This movie was no better, in the end, than the bottom five movies I've paid to see. That list includes Moment By Moment, The Last Temptation of Christ, Plan Nine From Outer Space, and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. You get my message.2/10, and *only* because of my wistful musings of how Kidman would have been the complete package in the days of American musicals.",2,3,6,19 June 2001
The Dark Knight," Epic Suck
","I don't know if this is the most overrated film ever, but it's the worst one I've seen in a long, long time. Almost as long as this steaming waste of three hours of my life. Let's review: * Suspension of disbelief is part and parcel of the superhero world, but c'mon. You're telling me this psychopath has recruited dozens of henchman, purchased mountains of equipment and rigged several hundred barrels of explosives in locations all over the city, and the world's greatest detective can't find a SINGLE BLEEDING CLUE without some Mr. Wizard cell phone stunt? Yeah, sure, half the cops are on the take, but are all of them blind, in this post-9/11 world? The Joker's band is comprised of escapees from an asylum, but they're all lean, mean, disciplined and competent? * This may be the widest ratio of screen time:plotfree of the decade. Too many characters. Too many side scenes. Too many random encounters. Too much exposition that doesn't actually expose anything. What do we leave this movie knowing? Anything? * The sheer quality was poor. Much of the film was too dark to see, and the sound was terribly spotty, yoyoing between blaringly loud and inaudible.* Yeah, Ledger did a good job, so stipulated. He still wouldn't have cadged an Oscar for it without the posthumous sympathy vote.* Finally ... this just blew a hole through the genre. Aren't the good guys supposed to WIN? They spend the movie losing ... dozens of people getting murdered, hundreds wounded and terrorized, chaos, mayhem, death and destruction and violence, and they pretty much lose at the end too. There's very little hopeful or uplifting here.2/10, barely.",1,10,24,19 January 2010
It's a Wonderful Life," The greatest movie ever filmed.
","I was all of 31 when I first saw the movie, when my ladyfriend found out I hadn't yet seen it, and incredulously sat me down on her couch, whipped a VHS tape out, and made me watch it on the spot.It's become an annual ritual since; my wife and I watch it during Christmas season, and I still feel warm from seeing it again just a few nights ago.So many other commentators have lavished remarks on this film that saying much of anything else would be gilding the lily, yet two elements stand out in my mind. First off, how many actors were ever the equal of Jimmy Stewart for the depth and quality of his expressions when he *wasn't* speaking? Possibly the dramatic high point of the movie is when Ruth tells George about his brother's career possibilities, and in the moment after she leaves him you can see better than any actor has ever done the wave of bitterness, disgust, the realization that he always has been and would always *be* trapped in the stultifying small town he hates.Secondly, I'm sorry, but any man who sees this movie who wouldn't have married Donna Reed on the spot is either gay or crazy. Her performance radiated charm in torrents.10/10; this movie is the unsurpassable standard by which all others are judged.",10,0,4,29 December 2006
A Beautiful Mind," Just no fizz to it.
","Alright, it was a well done movie for what it was, and interestingly executed, but it had the feel of a dry non-fiction work. It almost seemed like the hype and the Academy Award voting were tactical; you couldn't give Jennifer Connelly an Oscar for her brilliant performance in Requiem For A Dream, for instance, because after all Academy Awards can't go to naked women performing explicit kinky sex on camera in druggie films, but Beautiful Mind was just that sort of painfully earnest movie for which Academy members can impress one another at parties by claiming to have given it their votes. Now Crowe did a workmanlike job, Connelly was the spectacular eyecandy she's been capable of being her entire career, and the alternative to voting for this flick would have been to give Moulin Rouge a Best Picture nod, which would have been a crime against nature.But that aside, while I saw this at Dollar Night at the Wollaston Theater, it's still two hours of my life I won't get back.Rating: 4/10 and that's generous.",4,0,1,18 August 2003
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," If I could go back in time ...
","... I'd shoot everyone who had a hand in deciding to make this film. No jury would convict me, as long as we kept Gen Xers off the panel.Now I'm sure I would have found this mindless heap of treacle screamingly funny too when I was twelve years old, but I had the misfortune to see it for the first time at age 46 as part of a nostalgia haul my wife brought home from the library. Not a great movie? If it were even *passable*, but it's grainy, often not quite in focus, the dialog pauses between the principals sound so patently like they're reciting painfully memorized lines, the alleged 'cool' Rufus has about two minutes total screen time, and you'd have to be drunk or stoned to swallow the premise.If you can ignore all of that ... the movie still reeks.Now there were a few amusing lines, the sequence of the historical figures in the shopping mall was genuinely humorous, and the 'oral presentation' had legit energy, but that's what keeps this flick from getting a rock bottom rating. I thought in the Eighties based on the trailers that this film was for subhumans only. I wasn't wrong.3/10.",3,6,16,19 October 2006
Goodfellas," Just plain overrated
","Chalk me up as another reviewer who found this movie to be vastly overrated. My wife and I saw it a couple nights ago, for the first time, and it just pales in comparison to cinematic triumphs such as The Godfather movies or The Sopranos.As much as anything else, there are no likable characters. Part of the reason you could keep turning in to The Sopranos is that you could genuinely like and identify with the principals, despite their brutality and crimes. Here, you can't. None of the principals have any displayed virtues: at best, they're shallow and two-dimensional.Yes, the highly lauded soundtrack has many tunes. But if you're going to use the hoary old tactic of advancing pop tunes down the years to denote the march of time, could you not be so flamingly anachronistic as all of that? They were playing 40s tunes in the doo-wop era, 50s doo-wop post-British Invasion, 60s psychedelic pop in the 70s, and early Eric Clapton in the disco era. Get the freaking DATES right.Speaking of anachronisms, the film's jammed with them, and while it's superficially a glittering, gritty portrait of the wiseguy life and the wiseguy era, the goofs just overload. Cars too late for the year. Phones too late for the year. Livery too late for the year. Did Scorsese bother at all with accuracy and continuity, or did they just say 'Eh, get an old looking car out there.' It pains me to read about how exacting and painstaking DeNiro was to get every aspect of Jimmy's personality true to life, exactly how the real Jimmy Burke did, in the middle of a blizzard of anachronisms.Most damning, there's just no dramatic tension. There's little by way of plot, little by way of suspense. The actors did good jobs with the material and direction they were given, but that's not remotely enough to sustain this seriously overrated flick.5/10.",5,5,11,20 October 2015
Atonement," A Potemkin movie top to bottom.
","I should at least start with what the movie does right. As many others have cited, the cinematography and settings are extraordinarily well done; plainly a lot of money and care went into that. The score is also evocative and is very well matched to scene, and the use of the typewriter as percussion is nothing short of brilliant. The movie is also very well cast, and the actors top to bottom do a very good job of portraying the characters and script they were given. Now that's aside, let's review: The romantic leads have their happiness shattered by a jealous little snippet, and they never get it back, each dying in cruel fashion.The molested girl marries her pedophilic rapist.The aforementioned snippet never does, actually, atone, only coming clean when she's dying and has nothing left to lose, decades after the revelations would have done anyone any good, and even then has a problem with the truth.You also have the constant flashbacks, some in near real-time, which after the first bit of Briony looking at the fountain scene are far more irritating than evocative; by an hour into the flick, we were downright scowling.Toss in Titanic-esquire ripoffs like floating dead ladies, a few anachronisms (Lancasters in 1935?? Blowing the date of the Barham tube disaster? No constant strafing at Dunkirk?), and sorry, but another reviewer was dead on: the star-crossed-lovers-in-wartime thing has been done before, and far better. Of course the Academy fawned all over it, but I see no reason to do so myself.5/10, and only for the things it did right.",5,3,9,28 May 2008
