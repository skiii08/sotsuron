Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat film
","I saw this a few weeks ago, at an exclusive screening, one of many taking place around the UK. I found many subjects particularly racist, sexist, homophobic and anti semitic however I still laughed at them. Not at the jokes however, but rather at the sheer stupidity of them.In one scene in particular, which must be described as a sex scene, I nearly wet myself with laughter just at the nastiness and humour combination, even though if I had seen the scene in any other circumstance, I would consider it to be a homo erotic act of pornography that would leave this speechless. In this film, the jokes just keep on running.Sacha Baron Cohen portrays Borat as an Anti Semite, however the words spoken and written by him throughout the film are all in Polish (which's culture is integrated with modern Judaism) and Hebrew. The film was genius and I would recommend it to anyone who is up for a laugh. I advise people, as I did, not to take the offensive comments seriously due to the fact that it is just a humorous film. If one criticizes Baron Cohen of his Anti Semitic actions, they should realise that outside of this act, he is a practising orthodox Jew.",9,4,12,17 October 2006
