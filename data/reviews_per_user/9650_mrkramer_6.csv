Requiem for a Dream," Stunning, overpowering visuals
","One of the reasons I liked Pi so much was because of the hyperactive, hallucinatory quality of Aronofsky's cinematography. The visuals make this movie as well, along with Clint Mansell returning to do yet another great, haunting film score. Not only was the camerawork excellent, but all lead performances were great. As an original and hard-hitting film, it makes its mark. It very accurately and quickly portrayed taking a hit with a few quick shots. There's a stronger emphasis on visuals than coherent story, however--I found myself concentrating on the camerawork at the expense of other aspects of the movie. Also, I could not finish watching it--during a scene where (SPOILER) Ellen Burstyn is being fed, Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans are attending to his disgustingly infected arm and Jennifer Connelly is in some sort of group sex scenario, I had to get up and leave because I thought I was going to throw up in the theater. My nausea went away as soon as I was out. I've always had problems hearing people relate medical problems and been hyper-sensitive to portrayals of pain, so that might be why (or maybe the quick cutting did it). The last time I walked out of a movie was probably in the late 80s, however, so this was very unusual. It's especially unusual because I thought it was an interesting and original film. I'd warn anyone physically susceptible to portrayals like this to wait for video, although you might miss some of the visual effects.",7,0,0,23 January 2001
Knocked Up," This has some good moments, but it's been really hyped
","Well, this flick IS better and more original than your average Hollywood fare. That's not saying much, though. I saw previews for five summer movies before seeing this film and all of them looked horrible. After seeing The 40-Year-Old Virgin I had high hopes for this movie, but it didn't measure up. I wasn't expecting them to be alike, but I hoped that Knocked Up would be as touching and funny.Unfortunately I found this movie inconsistent and the main relationship didn't make sense to me. The relationship between the two main characters seemed like wish fulfillment on the male director's or writer's part. I couldn't see her with him and I couldn't see her tolerating his teenage stoner lifestyle, however sweet he might be. It reminded me of that Seinfeld episode when George Costanza tells an attractive woman in the diner 'I'm unemployed and I live with my parents' and she turns to him with interest and says 'Hiiii!' or something like that.In contrast, the relationship in The 40-Year-Old Virgin was sweet, quirky, enjoyable and much more realistic. All the characters were great and the jokes in that movie came thick and fast. There were a number of very funny moments in this film too, but there were also scenes that were very unrealistic or boring--i.e., the one with the bouncer outside the club, and part of the Vegas scene. I really wanted to smack the married sister and tell her to get a life. If I were Paul Rudd's character I would have been out of there pronto.I did like it when the guys started to get into the back-and-forth insults that they used in TFYOV--I just wish there had been more of that. The two are both basically movies that accept and welcome nerdiness, quirkiness and difference, which is great. This one just didn't pull it off so well. I'd say, however, that if you're a teenage boy who likes to toke, you're going to love it!",6,12,25,2 June 2007
Enemy at the Gates," Blah....
","I've learned a lot about Russia, Germany and World War II over time. This movie was filled with improbably beautiful people acting in improbable ways. That's typical of a big-budget production, but in this case it didn't manage to interest me. I kept on thinking about the director stopping and starting these scenes in which cheekbones got more attention than the action or philosophy at hand. Go see it if you like Jude Law, Joseph Fiennes, or Rachel Weisz. Otherwise, don't bother.",4,0,1,21 March 2001
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Keanu strikes again
","Watching this film is kind of like being downwind of a large cinematic garbage dump. It was supremely, incredibly, wonderfully bad. You can smell the dialogue and acting from miles away. Keanu is in full Keanu form with his Ed Wood-en quality acting. He is choice in Much Ado about Nothing, but he runs that performance a close second here. If you didn't realize that they all received plentiful paychecks, you might feel sorry for the many miscast actors. I recommend this if you're in the right mood for it! Great fun.",2,12,24,2 April 2001
The Wedding Singer," Sweet, very funny film
","This is a very cute, warm romantic comedy that breaks out of the 'chick flick' category. It's somewhat predictable, which I normally think is the kiss of death for a film, but that's completely overcome by its genuine warmth and humor. Also, it doesn't take itself seriously, and the occasional overacting and fun mugging for the camera works well within the context of the film. In some ways, it's like the underrated 1994 comedy with Mike Myers 'So I Married an Axe Murderer.' And it's about eight million times better than big budget romantic comedy vehicles like the Tom Hanks/Meg Ryan flicks. I don't generally like Adam Sandler films because they seem to operate on a twelve-year-old boy level, but this one was worth seeing. There are good cameos from character actor Steve Buscemi and others such as Billy Idol. Those who have been to tacky weddings, suffered a humiliating, incredibly painful romantic break-up or grew up in the 80s will relate. Some scenes make me laugh every time I've seen it.",9,0,1,30 January 2001
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Okay movie with great soundtrack
","I've always liked the Coen brothers' films, with my favorites being Raising Arizona and Fargo. This one is stylistically good and filmed very well, with some fun over-the-top performances from George Clooney et al., but for some reason it didn't resonate with me on any emotional level. I found it ultimately fairly forgettable. In short, it's my least favorite of their films. I probably won't see it again. The soundtrack is wonderful though--I don't even like country/folk music as a rule, but it's stayed in my mind so I just had to go out and buy it! It's beautifully sung and has some wonderful American folk music on it.",5,0,3,16 January 2001
