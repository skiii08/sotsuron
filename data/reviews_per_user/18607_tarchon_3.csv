Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Over-the-top quasi-ethnic comedy with a keen eye for the ridiculous
","If you hate ethnic jokes, you really don't want to see this movie. Two things set it apart from the average ethnic stereotype spiel though. The first is Cohen's spontaneity and timing as the main character, Borat, and the second is the way that the ethnic 'stereotypes' being ridiculed are often actual people. It's hard to argue that the 'drunken college boy' is an unfair stereotype if they're filming real drunken college boys. The single funniest thing I found in it is Cohen's brilliant send up of anti-Semitism, which is all the funnier because it is so close to the mark on the absurd way Jews are often mythologized, as if they're mysterious beings from another planet. I think a lot of people who were really put off by this film were put off by it because they don't realize how much of the off-the-wall ridiculous stuff in in it is perilously close to reality. There really are people in this world who believe that Jews have horns, for example. There are also a lot of instances where at first glance, it might seem as though the movie is making fun of a particular group of people (urban black youths or charismatic Christians for example) but really the humor is not so much in what they do in their own social context, but in the way that Borat interprets what they do. It is often not gentle humor though, and it intrudes on the boundaries of a lot of comfort zones.",7,1,5,2 July 2007
28 Weeks Later," Typical horror sequel - less sense, more gore and explosions
","28 Days Later stood out of its genre as a genuinely good film. 28 Weeks Later is one of those sequels (common in this genre) that trade on the buzz of the original to churn out a standard genre flick that doesn't have much inspiration of its own to work with. It's OK for what it is, but don't expect it to have the style or subtlety of the first 28. I think they tried to make up for it by making everything a lot louder. If you grind your teeth during horror films that are driven by a chain of people doing obviously stupid things that could have no other result than a horrific bloodbath, skip this one. Most Likely Oscar Nomination: 'most gratuitous insertion of American characters to appeal to a US audience.'",5,4,8,9 July 2007
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Competently made but rather average thriller
","I went to see this based on the trailer, which gave me a totally wrong impression of it, as does the American distribution title. The 'Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' is really a rather subsidiary character and frankly not very interesting. What this is really about is an uninspired murder mystery, and the real protagonist is yet another investigative journalist, and not one with a whole lot of personality. The actress who plays the titular 'girl' makes a pretty sincere effort to turn an unbelievable fantasy into a real person, but I've seen all the relevant clich√©s rehashed too many times to have much interest in seeing them again. The 'magic hacker' trope is relied upon heavily but is never executed very credibly. Once again, we're expected to believe that any kind of data can be downloaded from anywhere as long as you wear something cool enough while you're tapping randomly on the keyboard. It's not a bad movie, but it's nothing special and will mainly appeal to people who have already bought into the whole murder-mystery pot-boiler genre.",6,7,11,17 April 2010
