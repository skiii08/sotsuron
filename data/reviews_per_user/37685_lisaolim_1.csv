The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Breaking Dawn - Grows up
","This was a film for fans of the series. If you are a fan, you will LOVE this film. The cinematography is without equal. Just watching the film will make you 'ooh and aah' even if you are not crazy about the story.You can understand and appreciate the actions of the characters and their motivations for those actions. It is a film with true feeling as anyone who has ever been in love will tell you.I really enjoyed this movie and was quite pleasantly surprised by it. I especially loved the end scene. The wedding scene was also quite spectacular. In this writer's opinion, it is a movie not to be missed by fans of Twilight!Well done, Bill Condon!",Null,2,8,21 November 2011
