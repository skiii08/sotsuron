Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Force Is Strong Wif This One,homes
","I know all of you die hard Star Wars fans think this movie sucked like poo on a stick.But for me,it was an incredible experience.I'm 16 now and i was 9 when i saw it.It blew me away.The plot might not have been up to par with Ep4,5 and 6,but what it lacked in plot and screenplay it made up for in adventure.This movie inspired a whole new generation.Ep 1 introduced my generation to Star Wars.Ep 2 expanded that experience.Ep 3 may not have been perfect,but in some ways it brought together the whole saga.So,if you sucka's think that Ep 1 is rubbish,then i guess you aren't a real Star wars fan.To be a real Star Wars fan,u gotta be forgiving.So,real SW fans,rejoice!!For Ep 1 has reinvented SW.",6,0,1,29 January 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Excellent 2nd in a trilogy!!
","This movie was excellent!!In my opinion it's better than the first movie,though only by a little.The animation was superb,especially the sea creatures,Davy Jones and the Kracken.The story was nothing short of amazing g with a terrific ending.The acting was once again terrific.Even though there was less interaction between the main characters.Johnny Depp and Bill Nighy delivered excellent performances.DMC was also funnier than COBP with superb lines from Johnny Depp.And the sword fighting sequence was probably the greatest sword fight in movie history.My only hope is that POTC:At World's End will be even greater and offer more surprises.",8,11,18,29 July 2006
