It," Nothing says 'strong together' like killing a killer clown
","I am a bit annoyed about the little sunshine features of political questions, I understand the basic underdog concept in a horror story, but somehow I feel that the 1990's pic was far more of a horror film. I think I experted a modern form of art film, a bit more avant gardy. It's funny how people demand realism in an unrealistic plot. Of course, Stephen King is widely known for his realistic dynamics especially with young characters, but that put aside, I expected more of an experimental flick. There is an annoying blockbuster feeling about this. And regarding the fact that Skarsgård did a tremendous job visualizing the clown, I felt like the children where presented like superheros in a way, and that is probably what makes med think of the politics. I don't want to see superheroes against the clown; I want to see broken kids with broken souls from broken homes and broken world views get physically dragged into the concept of challenging Pennywise.",7,0,0,30 December 2018
Passengers," A hard to chew low punch about loneliness
","If anything, this flick gives a very specific view of the human psychology. The fact that people have a hard time spending time alone, and that it is historically inappropriate to wanting to be alone, it is a message to draw from this. The capturing of the human stages of loneliness pain is flawless, and regardless whether you watch The Passenger as a psychology-class or a moral lesson, if you watch this and don't end up pondering about something hard to chew about the human psychology and loneliness, you are probably watching with half your brain. Go watch it again.",7,0,0,31 December 2018
Hot Fuzz," Brilliant comedy!
","Once in a while, some like, lets say Edgar Wright, takes a completely overused theme, twisting and turning, and let loose a conpletely outrageous piece of cliche-like art. This is what I would like to call a cliche turned great film. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost is the perfect duo, and the references to Bad Boys is awesome and pathetic at the very same time.The basic Shaun of the dead-Hot fuzz-thing is brilliant comedy. The pacing, the twisted cliches, the satire and the duality Pegg and Frost is Edgar Wrights bullseye-shots on the big british screen.I enjoyed every minute of this!",9,0,0,2 November 2018
A Clockwork Orange," Experimental bravery as it should be
","I loved this film. Took me a long while to watch it, I don't really know why, but when I finally watched it my expectations was so high I acctually thought it would be a severe disappointment.On the conterary, it was one of the best flicks I've seen. Ever. You just have to appreciate the avantgardistic bravery and the free-minded, society-blowing depth and the poetic ground the whole process stands on. It is a masterpiece because it says something. The cruel play with pacing och hanging on to scenes and testing the audience patience. It's crazy, and annoyingly simple in some ways. Kubrik set a standard för experimental flicks with this one. Stone cold crazy poetry is an unbreakable art form.",9,0,0,30 December 2018
Gangs of New York," Outstanding casting choise
","If you want actors to play out the most outrageous, colorful and groundbreaking performances, you put Leo and Danny in front of the camera and let them do what they do. Both actors go soooo deep in there characters that the dynamic between young Vallon and Butcher alone is worth the ticket.If you watch a Scorsese film you should be prepared for a nasty ride. He has a way of writing the most skin-crawling scenes without even making it explicitly skin crawling outside the actors performances.The characters are fulfilling and dynamic, and I like the way Scorsese are working with the sound. Another thing I noticed is how my focus always searching for Vallons and Butchers eyes. We see faces and surroundings in a great mix.I think it was the hand of fate that set Gangs Of New York on hold for 30 years. Leonardo DiCaprio and Daniel Day-Lewis are outstanding actors of out time, and I believe that the roles of Vallon and Cutting could not have been this amazing in all its simplicity without them.Great movie. Outstanding casting choise.",9,6,7,3 November 2018
