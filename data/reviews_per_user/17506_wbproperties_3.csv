The Incredible Hulk," Great movie much better than the last Hulk
","The last hulk almost made me not go see this. Then I saw the star line up. Mainly the fact that Edward Norton was in it, as he does great films I decided to go. He does a great job as usual. I think I need to dust off primal fear his best film next to American history x. All in all it had a decent story line sure some parts were a little cheesy but had to be, to be PG-13 but hey who are we fooling todays PG-13 is 10 years ago rated r. It had a good beginning, middle and end. I loved how they tied in other marvel stuff and the cameos were cool. The action scenes and graphics were good not the greatest but good. I wish the would do it like Beuwolf in 3D more movies need to do that! I was very happy I saw it I think you will be too.",9,4,8,13 June 2008
Cloverfield," Are you kidding me?
","If you liked memento, crying game, flesh and bone, epic movie and asstrowsernaughts and afrohores you will love this steaming pile of crap! I could give my camera to a 2 year old and get a better movie! They tell you the first 15 minutes are slow, no the whole movie is slow. You will laugh, you w!ill cry you will kiss $5 bucks goodbye. The only high point was that I didn't pay to see this in a theater! I am a huge movie fan and will put up with some bad movie but this took the cake, My friend fell asleep and her husband said he wished he would have! There had to be 21K people involved in making this movie if 21K gave it a 10! Don't WASTE 1.5 hrs of your life instead shave your back hair or get your chest waxed",1,1,2,14 June 2008
Zombieland," Great Funny horror movie???
","Wow The birth of a new movie category - was it spoof, horror or a comedy? All I know was it was brutal and graphic and fun at the same time. I some people with kids and maybe its a sign that the times they are a changing or maybe the parents saw the made for TV trailer and said oh this looks like a great family film!? Ah no... Not unless your raising Charlie Manson II. As I said its pretty graphic, they do a great job making the zombie people being killed really look like they are being killed and they swear a lot and I do mean a lot! Now that being said you were warned and trust me, I normally laugh during Horror movies anyway, but at least in this one I supposed to. I saw the trailers and figured it may be OK like Shaun of the dead, but this one wasn't even in the same category. The acting was a great job by all the actors but a huge round of applause for Woody, Woody was top notch.Worth a watch on the big screen!",10,8,22,3 October 2009
