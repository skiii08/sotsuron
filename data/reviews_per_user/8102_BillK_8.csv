Blade Runner 2049," Fails at a (probably) impossible task
","Although knowledge of the original is not an absolute necessity to take in this film, for those of us who love the original, it does tend to set up expectations -- probably unachievable expectations.The original was -- at the time -- a fresh look into a broken future where the sunlight didn't penetrate. Where the old -- cars, buildings, city streets -- were patched and repurposed and everything was gritty and compromised outside of the headquarters of the dominant corporations. This new sequel is confused. There is sunlight in the opening scene. Maybe a mildly positive note that quickly is subsumed into a dreary, murky world without joy (except the artificial kind). Sure, that's true to the 1982 film and the source story, but the scenes take place above & away from the teeming streets that provided so much eye candy in BR. Another big shift is that while the police were a somewhat equal force to the Tyrell Corp in BR, the Wallace Corp seems the ultimate authority in BR2049. This makes for a certain inevitability in the plot development. I like Villeneuve as a director. I like his slow pacing and drawn out scenes. I like the producers' choices in casting - two particularly beautiful-to-look at artificial women and a tough, jaded police captain The leads are good. No surprise. When is Leto not great? Gosling plays a blade runner written as more jaded and less emotional than Ford's original character, and our lack of resonance with his character is distancing. It keeps us at — not in — the film. The Vangelis score of the original was full of regret and loss in synthetic tonalities. It was a thing integral to the film and something that stuck with you long afterward. Here, the score just didn't make much of an impact - it was recycled themes. Sequels don't have to tick all the boxes that made the original so special, but they have to bring something of significance to the party. In the original, Deckard was tracking 5 replicants and peeling back onion layers in classic noir style. In BR2049, it's a single mystery that is said to be linked to something profound, and we kinda get that on an intellectual level, but where's the emotional resonance? In other words, there is nothing remotely like the Roy Batty death scene. And perhaps the message of BR is just too big an idea to permit a worthy sequel. So we end up with something that - to me - was much like my experience with Prometheus. Many of the parts were there; the craft was there. The scope and budget were not compromised but the emotional hook that makes the 'big idea' truly profound did not develop. 7/10",7,4,9,10 October 2017
Train to Busan," This works extraordinarily well as an action flick with a heart.
","First, let me say that I am not a fan of the zombie genre. World War Z was okay, I thought. The Walking Dead bored me.This Korean movie will likely (like Oldboy) get a US remake so the snowflakes who are upset by subtitles will get to see a Hollywoodized version at some point in the future. No doubt the plot will be changed through committee interference. In this movie, our protagonist isn't the most likable person... and don't expect Hollywood to leave his character arc untouched.Enjoy this one in its present form. It does an excellent job with a growing feeling of dread that turns into an all out chase film with twists and surprising script decisions. Some old character stereotypes are worked in, but there are plenty of unexpected turns and clever solutions.Like The Host, another Korean film I particularly like, there's family drama at the core. But it doesn't overwhelm the sheer ferocity of the action.",9,1,2,3 April 2017
Cloverfield," The Monster Movie: this time it's personal.
","Spielberg got us partway there with War of the Worlds (a huge missed opportunity to outdo the original). These guys -- Abrams and Reeves -- get us all the way there. 'There' is what it might feel like to be in the way of something big and angry and strange in New York city.I rate this movie a 9 because it is nothing if not effective. The unknown actors are credible, the atmosphere is credible, and the scares are credible. All three are hard to sustain, especially considering the premise of this movie. The way we all are blindsided and bewildered by events that jar us -- the way we lack the 'God's eye' perspective usually offered in such films; the way life-altering events seem to come out of nowhere... all are captured in a uniquely powerful way here. Someone called this the first monster movie for the MySpace generation, and I can't argue with that. But I'm way beyond that generation, and I thought this was a breakthrough. Don't wait for rental, see it on the big screen.",9,2,6,20 January 2008
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Inglourious Hollywood
","Having a lot of knowledge about the events of August 8-9, 1969, I watched the movie unfold in a leisurely, meandering fashion, with growing apprehension about the third act.Never boring, the gradual setup dipped deep into the lives of a rising star, a has-been and the somewhat successful Hollywood workers around them, alongside the most inscrutable of the counterculture players, skipping over everyone in the middle. Dialog is obvious and off-center in turns, with moments of brilliance and opportunities for actors to show their chops. Lots of great feedback out there about Brad Pitt, but he's not challenged to move much of an arc, where Dicaprio gets the full range. Thin part for Robbie, but her whole function is to be someone you don't want to see die. Not a weak performance in the film, though some of the parts are underwritten. Not a real criticism, however, as there is a huge cast and there's just so much emotional investment a viewer can make.Tarentino loves the time period and it's a joy to watch for his regular retimue to make their appearances, however briefly (I for one hope Tim Roth is restored in a future DVD release).Music as always drives the story and the sardonic use of 12:30 by the Mamas and the Papas is particularly poignant.Thank you Quentin for the catharsis of the last 10 minutes. Easily a 9/10 and a film that will bear repeated viewing.",9,28,54,29 July 2019
Mystic River," Hugely disappointing
","Yes, I got to this movie late; seeing it on DVD. But the size of the screen has nothing to do with my reaction to it.Great performances all around, but I lay the blame for the failure of this movie at the feet of the director. A great film requires willing and continuous suspension of disbelief and empathy for the characters. SPOILERBut something goes terribly wrong here, when poor, previously-abused Dave suddenly becomes far less rational than he would have had to be to get to the point in his life where the 'mystery' takes place. Worse, his wife --Celeste -- appears not to know him at all. Perhaps her situation is that she took the only guy available to her because of some secret in her past or weakness of character, but how you have a 10+ year relationship with someone and not know their character... that requires some explanation. Maybe Lehane's book gives the background that is such a gaping wound in the film's continuity and credibility, but the sharp turn in which Celeste turns into a frightened and hostile betrayer took me right out of the movie.Much has been made of Penn's work and Robbins' work -- and that's appropriate. I felt Linney was a bit weak here in a Lady MacBeth part, but that could be the thin writing. And there's another surprise, because Helgeland brought the 'unfilmable' L.A. Confidential to the screen in such a magnificent way. So figuring out how a film with such potential could go so horribly wrong is a matter of some forensic pathology, and -- for me -- all signs point to the director.",3,2,4,18 October 2004
War of the Worlds," Dissed by Spielberg: you, me & HGW
","Okay, I'm used to big studio movies being big, loud, stupid and full of plot holes  spectacle over substance.But WotW was unnecessarily so.Here we have one of the great science fiction classics and a prior movie that had some reverence for the source material. And Spielberg's 'enhancements' are the main thing wrong with this 'new interpretation.'SPOiLERS!If the 'aliens' buried their machines in the soil in the past, they would already have been exposed to the 'bacteria, microbes and viruses' that have been here long predating man.I'm quite sure Mr. S. knows nothing about cars, but he can afford someone who does. An 'EMP' would fry the engine management system of the late model minivan the mechanic was working on. True, it might fuse the solenoid or coil, but that's the least of the problems. It's integrated circuits that are dead meat. So most older cars (including Ray's Mustang) would have been fine with little or no work.When the machine appears, the nice little 'hands' unfurl and shoot the 'death rays' at fleeing, unarmed people. Does it seem logical to you that beings that advanced would have planned to come to earth and individually shoot 6 billion people? I mean, the ones they don't put in their picnic baskets... Let's say that we'll suspend disbelief because the aliens are 'so advanced' we don't understand them. There's still one aspect of this movie you cannot avoid. You can see the specific scenes where the Universal Studios WotW ride is being previewed: the cracking pavement, the tipping ferry boat; the shaking basement of the house hit by the falling airplane... And speaking of falling airplanes: when was the last time you saw a jetliner crash that distributed large sections of plane over no more than 150 feet? The plane crash scene  again  looked like it was designed to be part of an amusement park ride rather than be realistic. But it was nice that the wreckage left a clear path for the minivan to exit.And the ferry scene. Bad pacing for a Spielberg movie. Plus, we're expected to believe that with a limited number of machines to take over earth, four of them (breaking the 'pattern of three') show up to ineffectually menace our fleeing hero and family.I'm sorry, but there's something plastic and contrived about Spielberg's 'adventure movies.' And I, for one, am getting tired of it.",7,1,5,6 July 2005
Prometheus," Are all prequels to franchise films fundamentally doomed?
","Prequels to films with fully-detailed ecosystems can play out like a grocery list of payoffs and 'tribute' scenes. Prometheus has that challenge. Sir Ridley Scott came from the world of commercials where the stereotypes must reveal/explain and play themselves out quickly. So we have all the Alien 'hooks' in place and plenty of sci fi genre hooks (Star Trek, Star Wars, Indiana Jones) all blended into a script that sometimes -- because of these hooks -- distracts rather than enthralls. Yes, there has to be a corporate expedition, and a diverse crew and crew conflicts and an amoral robot and slimy creatures. Check, check and check. But where is the growing sense of dread that worked so well in Alien? Granted, this is -- by necessity -- derivative stuff. But I watched Prometheus from a distance. Never with the sense of intimate menace that Alien so brilliantly exploited.There is one situation that is so preposterous and distracting that it took me right out of the film -- and I was barely in it, anyway. The best science fiction puts you into the world you are observing and uses that to give you new perspectives. Prometheus was at times a bit like a thing wriggling in a test tube. Fascinating, but safely removed and not really threatening.Did I dislike the film? I did not. I rated it a 6/10. It sustained my interest. It simply didn't thrill me. By all means, see it. However, do not go in with high expectations.",6,2,5,9 June 2012
Her," In a word, brilliant
","Science fiction has been dominated by 'space westerns' for so long that the occasional concept- based story situation hits a big number on my personal richter scale. What does it mean to be human? And if we create near-humans what is our responsibility to them and what is their relationship to us? These themes underpinned Blade Runner and Spielberg's A.I. And Sci Fi of the 50s and 60s dealt with machine self awareness. None of the films that touched on this subject in the past presented it so thoroughly, intimately and believably. Her is in the near future, but everything we see is within reach now: the isolation and starkness of the 'business district,' the oppressive scale of the architecture (with thin, clumsy attempts to soften its sterility) and the need for continuous connection to remote voices.A personal assistant that learns independently and takes initiative for its hapless user, 'Her' is at once the ideal tool and — who knows — perhaps closer to the next level of evolution. Pitch perfect performances and direction kept me in the story. As others have said, the locations, cinematography and even music shine in the fabric of this film. Spike Jonze is a master story weaver at the top of his game. Joaquin Phoenix is utterly credible as are all the other leads. Even Scarlett Johansson, who has not always seemed a strong actress to me performs utterly convincingly. It's an adult-themed film in more ways than one, but especially in the best way: it makes you think about a reality that's right around the corner.",9,449,614,21 December 2013
