10 Cloverfield Lane," Thrilling, Breathtaking...
","First things first, after watch this movie you will learn that nothing is what it seems to be. At the beginning you will appreciate what appears to be a well made drama, after a while you will be immersed in a thriller with some awesome actors providing you moments of fear, sadness, uneasiness, terror and disbelief.The story will make you doubt the movie at first but don't let it make you give up of watching it. You will certainly be captured by the fast changes in the narrative transforming this movie from one thing to another, where in a moment you will be happy watching it and a second after you will be terrorized by something; or wanting to know what is really happening and a moment after seeing all your beliefs crushing down by another event that reveals itself.It is a awesome movie that anyone who wants to watch different stories should invest an hour in it.",7,2,2,15 July 2016
