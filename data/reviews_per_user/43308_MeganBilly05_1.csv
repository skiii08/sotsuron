It," The Ultimate Comedy/Horror Film
","If you're looking for a really scary film to watch, maybe don't pick this. The film relies on jumpscares, however there were a few unsettling things in the background. Despite this, i absolutely loved this film. I am younger, so maybe its because i loved the comedy. Actors are amazing especially Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd (Pennywise) - just ignore the bad reviews.",10,0,0,20 October 2019
