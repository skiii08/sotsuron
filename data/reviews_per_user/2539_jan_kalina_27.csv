The Equalizer," ' I am offering you a chance to do the right thing. Take it.'
","Denzel Washington always grabs the chance to play an amazing character or to simply be in an amazing film. It's the Denzel guarantee that if he is starring in it then in no way you are about to watch a bad film.Frankly I have to say how surprised I was at the level of violence in this film. Meaning it is quite violent, I didn't expect that at all.I expected the usual P3-13 routine but this film is R-rated so you enjoy all the blood you want.Denzel Washington is the reason to see this film, he never disappoints. Chloe Grace Moretz is amazing as always but she has a very limited screen time. Marton Csokas as the Russian fixer stands out as the most surprising actor in the bunch. He is intimidating, scary and well, Russian. His character poses a great threat to our hero.As violent this film is, it also has quite inventive action. In the finale McCall uses any tool that can come in handy and he does so in quite a few unexpected ways.Antoine Fuqua and Denzel Washington made great in Training Day. This time it is even better, more perfect film. These roles of quiet men, who decided to right the wrong in the world suit Washington the best. If you want believable characters, attention-grabbing story then this is the film to go.",10,6,17,9 October 2014
Source Code," 'You cannot alter this reality while inside the Source Code.'
","'Son of David Bowie' Duncan Jones makes really great sci-fi films and one of my favorite genres is sci-fi so I really appreciate it. He started out with the super low-budget sci-fi Moon. I liked Moon but one thing bothered me about the movie, the point/twist of the movie was revealed too early in the film. Now Jones is back with Source Code and he delivers the goods once again.If you have seen the trailer then you know the basic plot. The movie starts with our main character Captain Colter Stevens waking up on the train sitting opposite to a woman who obviously knows him and calls him 'Sean' but he doesn't know her, he runs away to the bathroom and he sees in the mirror reflection a completely different man then suddenly the train explodes. We are transported into this weird capsule where he is 'briefed' about what's all this about. The movie keeps jumping between these two settings: between the Source Code (I am not going to spoil what it actually is like some professional reviewers or some reviewers here on IMDb) and the reality but that doesn't limit the film in any way. The director manages to keep the movie suspenseful, balanced with amount of 'action' scenes and mysteries to keep the audience guessing. Especially after the brilliant opening scene he' s got everyone pulled inside the film and on the edge of their seats, that's where Duncan Jones shows off his skills. The movie bears a lot of resemblance to Twelve Monkeys and Deja Vu (trying to save something/someone repeatedly or prevent something from happening or the hi-tech playing with time) so that doesn't make it completely original idea but I' m glad anyway that Hollywood still has some fresh ideas in the safe.Jake Gyllenhaal pulls here probably his best performance yet. He is quite charming here, completely believable when he is confused, funny and realistic when he is falling for the girl who he can meet only in the Source Code. He is very sympathetic and he looks great with a gun. Jake Gyllenhaal has grown into one hell of a great actor. Michelle Monaghan is cute and manages to make a great character even with the minimum of screen time. The oddly accented Dr. Rutledge, the creator of the Source Code, played by Jeffrey Wright is the only character who provides the audience with some sort of explanation.In the end this is a very enjoyable suspenseful sci-fi thriller but with a few flaws so it can't be put alongside classics like Twelve Monkeys or Inception. It's got a great concept but not just so mind bending. I hope this will be a box-office success so Duncan Jones will provide us with another well made movie",8,2,3,23 April 2011
Iron Man 3," Is that all you've got? A cheap trick and a cheesy one-liner?
","That is what Stark's opponent shouts at him during one fight. Stark's response is 'Sweetheart, a cheap trick and a cheesy one-liner could be the name of my autobiography'. Audiences have already come to expect such witty and self-referential dialogue from the the great writer Shane Black. Who is Shane Black, you ask? Well, you may not know him but you have certainly seen a lot of his films. This man is responsible for the greatness and awesomeness of the Lethal Weapon franchise, the wise- cracking Bruce Willis in The Last Boy Scout or Kiss Kiss Bang Bang ( which also stars Robert Downey Jr.)Iron Man 3 was marketed as a story where Tony Stark would meet an opponent that would break him physically and mentally. It all looked very dark and gloomy. I'm glad to say that the end result is far from a dark and gritty movie. It is actually the exact opposite. This film is just as funny and action packed as the previous Iron Man films. The main difference is that this film has taken completely different approach than any other Marvel movie. This film isn't just your typical superhero has to fight a new enemy and in the end he wins story. This is a detective story, where our favorite billionaire, playboy philanthropist in his battle against The Mandarin is forced to go on a full-tilt investigation, revisiting crime scenes, digging through evidence and even interviewing witnesses. More than just being a detective story, what makes it a Shane Black detective story is the connections to the classic noir. Tony Stark is experiencing his darkest and toughest days due to post-traumatic stress from the Battle of New York (although in The Avengers he was fine, wise-cracking and joking around), he loses his home, his hunt for The Mandarin takes him through all kinds of crazy reveals and plot twists. There's even great voice-over narration just in the likes of Raymond Chandler or Dashiell Hammett. You get more Tony Stark than Iron Man. Which doesn't mean that there is less action. No, you get plenty of action scenes just most of them are Tony being out of the suit.Robert Downey Jr. has now become the living embodiment of Tony Stark. When you think of Downey, the first character you associate with him Tony Stark/Iron Man. He is just so believable in this role. I can't imagine any other actor in this role, it just wouldn't be such fun. Gwyneth Paltrow finally gets some action scenes. The banter between Downey's Stark and Paltrow's Pepper isn't that funny and light-hearted as in the previous films. Their conversations are now more serious since they are in relationship. Don Cheadle doesn't get much screen time as Col. Rhodes but this is the funnest his character has ever been. Shane Black establishes this Lethal-Waponesque relationship between him and Tony. Ben Kingsley, well, without spoiling anything you have never seen him like this. Few years ago Guy Pearce has started playing villains and bad guys. Well, I can't complain about him he is great as always but I would just want to see him once in a while as the good guy, that's all.Brian Tyler's score is much more darker but also much more melodic. Finally we get Iron Man's heroic theme which is truly kick-ass and great to listen to. Iron Man 3 is not the superhero film I was expecting but that doesn't mean it is a bad thing. I'm glad that all those trailers, clips and TV spots didn't ruin the film. I was a lot surprised at all the stuff happening in the film. This film is also great Christmas movie. Black explains why Iron Man 3 (just as lot of his other films are set at Christmas:'It's a time of reckoning for a lot of people, when you take stock of how you got to where you are now and lonely people are lonelier at Christmas and you tend to notice things more acutely. Well, that describes the character's story in this film quite a lot. P.S. The end-credits scene isn't a tease for the next Marvel film but it gives Iron Man 3 a nice narrative framework.",10,8,17,25 May 2013
This Is the End," 'I don't wanna die at James Franco's house.'
","Some comedy premises seem to go over people's heads. Which the case with This Is The End. The film is based on an idea that the actors play exaggerated versions of themselves, based on the characters they play in their films, which seem to be the same character over and over again. Or they play completely against type - Michael Cera's case.The idea of actors playing themselves always seems intriguing to me and here it serves as a basis for letting Rogen and his friends goof off. The film perfectly serves the celebrity lifestyle and the culture surrounding them. It even briefly touches upon how people are obsessed with these celebrities. The plot revolves around a James Franco's housewarming party when an apocalypse hits the Hollywood Hills. Those who survive the earthquake, fortify themselves in Franco's house and wait for the rescue which may never come.This results in hilarious series of fights, arguments and gags. The mystery element about the apocalypse keeps interested in the film. The ending is just simply madness but that is exactly what I expect from a comedy like this: to be surprised.Rogen, Franco and the rest of the pack are amazing as always. Danny McBride plays the biggest scumbag that has ever walked the earth. If you are fan of these comedians, then you are in for a treat. Even though you are not, I believe you will have a splendid time and perhaps you will become a fan as well.",10,33,58,4 February 2015
Iron Man 2," 'It's Good To Be Back'
","And indeed it is. The first Iron Man came like lighting from a clear blue sky, a movie that started Robert Downey Jr's career, movie loved by audience and critics. Now there is a sequel and people are asking if it's worth it. And I say Hell Yeah.Now when the whole world knows who Iron Man is, Tony is having a hard time staying alive. There are two men coming after him, a Russian Ivan Vanko who has an unfinished business with Tony. He claims that he stole the idea for the arc reactor from his father (which of course isn't entirely true, he is a Russian, you can't believe those.) The second guy after him is actually a competitor in business, Justin Hammer, who, for years is trying to build a suit like Iron Man's but with horrible results. Now with the government wanting Tony's Iron Man suit and Stark Industries closed for business, he has a chance to become the leading weapons industry. The acting and the cast here are truly remarkable. Robert Downey Jr. is, well he is Robert Downey Jr. He is perfect as usual, you can't miss with him being cast in your movie. Gwyneth Paltrow does a great job being the love interest. Mickey Rourke doesn't have much time on screen but when he is you can see he enjoys the role and still tries to establish the character even with such limited screen time. Sam Rockwell is the comical villain and he is great at it. Samuel L. Jackson is a synonym of the word cool and he proves it once again as Nick Fury. He briefly appears but when he does he's got one of the best lines in the movie such as 'Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to exit the donut.' or ' I am very real. I'm the realest person you're ever gonna meet'. The weakest link in the chain is Don Cheadle. He horribly doesn't fit as James Rhodes. He is uninteresting, and he acts too serious for this role. This is supposed to be entertaining, fun movie. And when he has no idea what to do, he copies Terrence Howard's take on this character. His character changed from the best friend ever to the worst friend. He became arrogant too. He actually thinks he is better than Iron Man!! But that of course isn't true. As always there is a great little cameo by Stan Lee. I can't forget all the rush on the internet Olivia Munn being a superhero and then she had just a tiny cameo as a news reporter. I was chuckling in the theater and no one had idea why.Casting Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow was the smartest idea anyone ever had. She is the sexiest woman on Earth and seeing her in a tight leather suit is worth all the money on Earth. Her only fight scene in the hallway with like a dozen guards is amazing. It is one of the best choreographed fights of this year. It is just purely awesome, sexy, full of adrenaline and even funny.I just feel like all those composers started to try again after last year's (almost) fiasco. OK, there were few exceptions, the Star Trek soundtrack, Up soundtrack and the Sherlock Holmes soundtrack. In this year there is more than just three great soundtracks and Iron Man 2 is one of them. The score is darker and more bad-ass. Three tracks that really stand out: the first track (Ivan's Metamorphosis), Monaco Drive with this heavy James Bond feel and the track titled Black Widow Kicks Ass. Soundtrack as such features songs from AC/DC, Queen and even Daft Punk.There are more action scenes in this one than in the first movie. The action scenes are much better, they are fast paced, bad ass, simply better. There is even one car chase scene.In summary, if you liked the first then I guarantee you that you will enjoy this one too, it's a must-see for any fan of Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Iron Man or a comic-books. (There are tons of comic-book references including the Avengers, Hulk and it's just great fun looking for them.) This is a great, entertaining summer movie so go and watch it.Definitely wait until the end of the credits there is a great extra scene and you find out what agent Coulson was doing in New Mexico.",10,17,35,17 November 2010
The Adventures of Tintin," 'I will find that ship. With or without your help!'
","And Steven Spielberg has found that ship and that ship has sailed him to a brand new technology for filmmaking. Yes, I'm talking about motion capture or as Spielberg calls it 'perfomance' capture. This technology is a like a new toy for Steven. You can feel the joy for filmmaking from every shot, every detail. He plays with the camera in a way he never could while making a live-action film. For example in probably the best scene of the film the main character, Tintin is gliding on a wire and the camera is following him throughout the whole scene in a continuous shot. But you can still say, you still see that this is a Spielberg movie. You know this is a Spielberg movie since the opening title credits that will remind you a lot of the opening credits in Catch Me If You Can. Even the music is very similar.The main character is Tintin, who is a journalist who we never see doing any journalism though, but that doesn't matter because he is the textbook example of a heroic boy with boy scout qualities. The voice of Jamie Bell fits perfectly for the character. Andy Serkis gives here an incredible performance as Captain Haddock, the drunken sailor who to me was often reminiscent of a grumpy Harrison Ford. The story did seem as too much centered on Captain Haddock though, you could even say this should have been called 'The Adventures of Captain Haddock' instead of Tintin. Daniel Craig is unrecognizable as the main villain Sacharine. Although his voice did jump to his normal voice in one line but otherwise you didn't know it was him. Of course I can't forget to mention the lovable dog, Snowy. He steals almost every scene that he is in. He is very realistic, he acts like a real dog and even gets his own chase scene. I'm telling you will adore this dog.The animation is magnificent, the motion capture has gone a long way since The Polar Express. It looks very realistic, especially all the features on Captain Haddock's face. The beard, the wrinkles and the eyes, they all looked amazing. Especially the eyes, they aren't so dead-eyed anymore as in The Polar Express.The action scenes are brilliantly written and directed, the angles of the camera, the drive of the action scenes, timing of all the jokes(physical or visual) is genius. Because Spielberg is a genius. He is the master of adventure movies and there never will be another genius in adventure movies like him.Overall Spielberg has created an old-fashioned style adventure movie for the whole family to enjoy,where the important things are just the hunt for the treasure, the friendship two people can make and the most important thing of all that it is an entertaining ride. Spielberg never disappoints, it doesn't matter if you are a fan of Tintin or not, you will enjoy this film nonetheless",8,86,125,30 October 2011
The Expendables," 'You Look Nervous'
","Great. Awesome. Jaws-dropping. Even beautiful. All these words can be used to describe this movie. Sylvester Stallone has done it; he made a movie for all the action fans. He gave them what they wanted, a good old-fashioned (80's) action with minimum CGI and bunch of guys beating the crap out of each other either by fists or with fire weapons.It quite surprised me that this movie actually had a plot. I thought that this will be just about a group of mercenaries just killing people but it was a little bit more than that.The Church Scene: That's one of the reasons you all are going to see this movie and I assure that this scene is great. Arnold Schwarzenegger's cameo is one of the best cameos in movie history. Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger are both trying to steal the scene for themselves but Arnold wins. It's just so great to see him on screen again. This scene will decide if you will like the movie or not because if you are not smiling from the beginning 'till the end of this scene this movie might not be for you.The cast Sly got in this movie is amazing. Sylvester Stallone and Jason Statham are practically the leads and they have/share the most of the screen time. Terry Crews is probably the third best character from The Expendables after Sly and Jason. His scenes with him and 'his big bullet-exploding gun' are pure genius, pure awesomeness. Mickey Rourke's character steals every single scene he is in. He is awesomeBrian Tyler's soundtracks always sounds so, sorry for the word, expendable. Now he has two exceptions: Eagle Eye and Expendables.The action scenes could have been a little more creative but that's the only thing I have to point out. Overall this is a fun action (80's style) movie which is set to delight action fans all over the world. Solid 8 out of 10.",8,4,10,28 August 2010
Interstellar," 'Mankind was born on Earth. It was never meant to die here. '
","Nor should the audience be drowned in mediocrity of today's cinema. Some filmmakers seriously lack any ambition. Ambitious is the first word that pops up in my head while describing Interstellar. Christopher Nolan is the most ambitious director working right now. He's on a completely different level. His films are intelligent, thought provoking but still infinitely amusing, fun and re-watchable. And foremost his films are always a spectacle.Interstellar is at its core a story about the father/daughter relationship when the Earth is slowly and surely becoming an inhabitable place. Plagued by frequent dust storms, the crops can no longer sustain mankind. In secret a plan is hatched to find a planet in a different galaxy, which would meet the demands for sustainable future of mankind. Cooper, a former engineer now turned farmer, is mysteriously drawn to join this expedition, an expedition for which he was his whole life. Facing many obstacles the most important is the simplest one. Will he ever see her daughter again, and save her and the mankind? From this very brief plot summary and when you will watch the film, you will be surprised ho emotional the film is. Important is that all these emotions, every event, every obstacle, every grace and beauty and danger these characters encounter, you will feel with them. That is how this film will pull you in, absorb you.Matthew McConaughey gives a stellar performance (pun intended). Since he has turned his career he became a great actor but I was getting tired of his one key characters. But in Interstellar he gives a marvelous performance where you feel all the pain his character feels. Biggest surprise is once again the child actress in a similar way it happened in Spielberg's War of the Worlds. Mackenzie Foy as Murph is just simply put magnificent. She is even better than her older version played by Jessica Chastain who is also amazing. Michael Caine is Nolan's lucky charm, whenever he is in his film you can bet it won't disappoint. Matt Damon was a public secret. All I will tell you is that he is a very important character. Anne Hathaway's stubborn professor might be a little unconvincing to some but she certainly fits the part. In other words Nolan always know who to cast in his films.What is the most mesmerising is the music. Hans Zimmer has simply outdone himself once again. The score is chilling, emotional and as many other aspects of the films in some moments little reminiscent of 2001: Space Odyssey. In no way can I stretch enough how different this sounds from previous Zimmer's scores.It's the music which you will want to hear again immediately after leaving the cinema.As Nolan has stated he made a film which you don't experience through characters, you experience it along with them. Seeing this film in IMAX definitely helps. It's an incredible movie-going experience, one you will regret for a long time if you miss it on the big screen. It's a refreshingly ambitious film with story to tell made with the right tools, told on a massive scale. And it was incredible. Undescribable.Interstellar is Nolan's message about the importance of science, the experience of parenthood, human curiosity and the beauty of exploring which comes from it, the will to survive, the nature of humanity and the value of love. It is a film which fills you with hope and curiosity. You will certainly look up to the sky with wonder as we have used to.P.S. I didn't experience any issues with sound, as reported on some film sites, so I guess if you want to see this film in the right way go to the IMAX in Prague. I have heard every line of dialogue and every note in the score.",10,3,10,8 November 2014
21 Jump Street," 'Where do we report to? Down on Jump Street. 37 Jump Street... wait, that doesn't sound right.'
","What is up with the directors of animated films directing live-action films? Not that I have something against it. Their films are even better than the works of live-action film directors, working for years in the business. Brad Bird showed us that the Mission Impossible hasn't lost its spark after the brilliant third installment and gave us one of the best films in the Mission Impossible franchise. Now the directors of an animated hit Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, Phil Lord and Chris Miller made one the best comedies ever and surely the best comedy of 2012. I have never seen the original series this film is based on but that didn't stop me any less from fully appreciating this comedy. The whole film stands on the genius script written by Michael Baccall (I'm sure that Jonah Hill did not just collaborate on the story that he worked on the script too) the co-writer of the marvelously amazing Scott Pilgrim vs The World. The film makes fun and pays tribute to all those clichés of buddy cop movies and a lot of action films. One of the funniest scenes making fun of action films is the wonderfully shot chase scene on the highway. The running gag with explosions is award worthy. The screenwriter really knows all the clichés and when to make fun of them or make a good use of them in the story.Jonha Hill has grown into a wonderful comedian. He never was as funny as he is in this film. Chaning Tatum, whom I have only seen in G.I. Joe surprised me the most from all the actors. He is actually a great comedian. They both play such wonderful idiots. The chemistry between these two actors is so well translated to screen. It almost like from Lethal Weapon. Ice Cube as the police captain of the undercover division steals every scene he is in. He has some of the best lines in the film. Just wonderful. In the end this is one of the best comedies of the past years and one of the best comedies of 2012.",10,4,10,26 May 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," 'I'm just a kid from Brooklyn.'
","The film business is flooded with superhero films. I think that the audience is being tired of those films too. These movies always have to start with this origin movie - movie where our hero/superhero is introduced and these origin movies are pretty much the same story over and over every single time. They are interesting if we've got an interesting character like Iron Man, Wolverine, Hulk - men with flaws. I've never liked Superman - he was just too (for lack of a better word) good. The same thing is with Captain America, he is such a goodie goodie. That brings me to the main problem with this movie - the characters. The characters in this movie are not very much established, they are very one-dimensional and so the audience can't create any feelings for them.Chris Evans has proved before that he is a good actor, playing this cocky Johnny Storm, or nerdy hacker in The Losers. Here he plays a wimpy and skinny Steve Rogers, a man turned through 'science' into a superman. He has just one goal to help people fighting in the war. Hayley Atwell is very good looking woman but she has no purpose than just to provide a love story which is very uninteresting in this movie, not like the other Marvel movies. Hugo Weaving is great as usual but again pretty one-dimensional character. Tommy Lee Jones stands out as the Colonel Chester Phillips. He has the best one-liners in the movie. Tommy Lee Jones never disappoints and delivers another grumpy man turned to faith in the main hero. (I've always liked how they incorporated a Stan Lee's cameo into the movie and into the plot but here it was quite unnecessary) When you go see a blockbuster summer movie, you expect great action scenes. Well, you don't get them here. The action scenes are very average and the addition of throwing shield as a weapon is going to change much. The setting of the movie is within this futuristic retro World War II and I didn't like this messing with history, that Captain was fighting this science Nazi division and all that. I know I shouldn't take this movie too seriously but all these futuristic machines in this retro setting were just way over the top.Another thing is this movie feels very rushed, there isn't much happening but it just quickly wants to get to the end, so we would be excited for the next big movie from Marvel studios, The Avengers. Sure, it makes you excited for The Avengers, especially if you wait till the end of the credits as usual for a little teaser, but I wanted high quality movie like Thor or Iron Man. The movie is just too straightforward, full of clichés and it has way too formulaic plot. The film starts out well, in an interesting way but when our main hero is transformed into Captain America it just goes down the same route we have seen before in hundreds of other movies. Nothing new here.",7,7,16,14 August 2011
Now You See Me," 'First rule of magic: always be the smartest person in the room.'
","Louis Leterrier is a very smart director. Since my first encounter with Leterrier's work (Transporter 2) I was looking forward to his upcoming projects. Clash of the Titans was a well made summer blockbuster with one condition: you have to tun your brain off before watching it. It got a lot of hate but the problem wasn't with the director. Then came his best movie yet and that is the kick-ass The Incredible Hulk. A film with great characters and great action scenes. But after these movies Louis Leterrier had a problem: he was typecast in Hollywood as an action director. When he showed interest in making Now you see me, the studio didn't want to let him direct this movie since they were afraid he wouldn't handle the characters well. No one thought that he could tell stories. But Leterrier proved them wrong once again. Now You See Me is a great very fast paced heist movie where the crew pulling off the heist consists of magicians. There is plenty of action, magic and the camera has no time to stay in one place. That is probably my favorite aspect about this film the camera work. There is no shaky cam in this film despite that being Hollywood's biggest trend in movies. Yet still the camera is never static, it is always moving. Circling around the characters,spinning or zooming in and out.The cast assembled in Now Yoou See Me is truly marvelous. Jesse Eissenebrg who has two on screen personas - the shy stuttering neurotic or the cocky and arrogant smart ass. Here he plays the second one. And well he is pretty good at it. Woody Harrelson is always a fun addition in any movie. Mark Ruffalo who probably has the most screen time is becoming more and more likable in recent films and here he does a great playing the FBI agent who is incapable of catching the Four Horsemen, the group of magicians. Seeing Morgan and Michael Caine is always a pleasure and just seeing these two act is a joy for a every movie fan. Isla Fisher plays one of the Four Horsemen but she serves more as a distraction for the audience so you pay attention to her and not what is happening in the film. Dave Franco once again gets his chance to shine. He has proved he can be very funny in 21 Jump Street and here he shows he can pull off a serous role too.If you are looking for a well made suspensive heist movie with some action or just looking to cool yourself down in the cinema I believe that you can't go wrong with Now You See Me.P.S. Solid cast, original story and a good word of mouth helped to make this film one of this summer's biggest surprises. When something has success in Hollywood it gets a sequel. Even though the film is a wrapped story. Not sure where they want to go with these characters next but I'm cautiously optimistic about the next film.",8,2,6,30 August 2013
The Grand Budapest Hotel," 'There are still faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughterhouse that was once known as humanity... He was one of them. '
","Wes Anderson is one of the last directors -auteurs- who's got complete control on the film set and has the power to make whatever kind of film he desires. His distinct visual style is apparent since his 1996 debut Bottle Rcoket. But that was just a start, with every film he made he was perfecting his technique more and more. This marvelous attention to detail, the way he composes his shots( tracking shots, the symmetry, the characters running in slow-motion), chase scenes, love story, nostalgia, explanatory montages, the colourful set design and the prevalent theme of every one of his films: family. This all adds up to the reason why the audience enjoys Anderson's film so much. This all is brought to perfection in Grandhotel Budapest. Through complex narrative framework, which itself is a mockery of all these films that are being narrated by someone and is also being an excuse for not being too realistic, we get to a story of a young lobby boy named Zero Moustafa and Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes)the concierge of the Grandhotel Budapest. Many of the female guests of the hotel mainly come to enjoy Gustave's company. When one of these ladies passes away, Gustave grabs Zero and boards a train for her mansion. Soon he's blamed for her murder and hunted by police led by Edward Norton and a grim-faced assassin played by Willem Dafoe. There also is a love story between two young teens - Zero and Agatha (Saoirse Ronan) who has a birthmark in the shape of Mexico.I frankly don't understand how can this film be successful in the USA. This film is just so typically European, that I guess some aspects of the film Americans just aren't familiar with. Some of the humor reminded of old French, Italian and Czech comedies. Wes Anderson remains to be a stand-out filmmaker who never disappoints with any of his creations and is a safe bet to rely on his qualities. You won't want to return to the real world when the credits start to roll.",10,222,292,25 April 2014
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," 'Mission accomplished!'
","I have to start with saying that I haven't doubted Brad Bird for a second. I knew he would make an amazing transition from making genius animated films to making genius live-action films. And he accomplished that mission.This movie is the perfect film for the holidays. They should watch this movie at film schools to learn how to make action scenes. The best, the most amazing scene of this film, of course, is the whole sequence in Dubai. Seeing Tom Cruise climbing the Burj Khalifa, tallest building in the world, will have you on the edge of your seat. It is truly glorious, then it is followed by another great scene of trying to switch a valuable information( I won't specify this] for a wrong one. Genius editing. Followed by foot-chase and a car-chase in a sandstorm. One word to describe this: Mindblowing. You have never seen anything like this.This doesn't mean that this movie is only about action scenes. As any other Brad Bird film this film is also about characters and story. Mainly about the characters here. Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt gives another amazing performance. I have to say that I have never seen a bad movie with Tom Cruise. And that's something that can't be said about every actor. There is a significant subplot concerning Ethan's past and it tells a lot more about the character. Jeremy Renner as the mystery new character is surprisingly brilliant. I remember when I saw Renner for the first time I didn't really like him, but here he was such a likable character. There are great and funny dialogue between Renner and Simon Pegg's character, who is awesome every single time. I just have to say that I really like Renner now and I look forward to seeing him in this type of role (but not taking over this franchise as was originally intended.) Simon Pegg as the computer and tech go-to guy gets the most of the best lines in the movie and is just absolutely brilliant. Paula Patton as Jane, another member of Ethan's team really brings in the word 'sexy' into the film. She is essentially the Bond girl of the film but she also gets to kick some ass and it sure is worth it.This brings me to the main point that this movie feels a lot like a Bond film. The Incredibles from Brad Bird did have Bond/spy film atmosphere. So it was obvious that Bird is a big fan of Bond films. Though, this is the closest he will ever get to directing of Bond like film. Simply put this film is Bond film, but this time Ethan Hunt can't make it on his own and is need of a team.There are few complaints I've got to make. The film would use a more complex story. The whole story seemed to me as unused concept for a James Bond film. Another thing is a better villain would be good but this film is an example of a movie where the better outweighs the worse. All the actions scenes and fun is a patch for simple but still great story.This film is an amazing, thrilling ride that the second it starts, it never slows down, never stops till the end credits. I recommend you to see this in IMAX, then you will be as excited from this film as I am. Believe me seeing this film on a giant screen, you will definitely enjoy it to the max.",10,8,14,25 December 2011
22 Jump Street," 'Do the same thing as last time. Everyone's happy'
","I don't why this film works but it does. It takes the almost exact premise from the first movie but it also keeps the self-awareness and the same creative duo of directors who are nowadays the biggest stars in comedy business. To me 21 jump street is a modern classic and so I was afraid that the sequel won't be as funny and will be repetitive. But with Phil Lord an Chris Miller on board you can bet that it will be hilarious. They are trying to convince the whole film that this is exactly the same as the first and that you should not expect any surprises but that is their plan all along. The film is filled with surprises and twists and turns. Its range of pop culture references goes from Annie Hall to Benny Hill and some of the jokes are so fast you might miss them at the first viewing. Since the first one was making fun of the Hollywood trend to remake and reboot old films and TV shows, the sequel makes of the necessity of starting a franchise when a film is successful. The end credits make fun of the studio system of franchising anything and they are possibly the best end credits of all time and surely are the funniest. Contrary to all this they are the great ending to the franchise.The bromance between Hill and Tatum is even more prominent than in the first film and you can see that these guys are big friends in real life and are having a good time. Ice Cube get much more screen time as Captain Dickson and once again he is part of the film's funniest scenes. Wyatt Russell as Jenko's doofus friend is amazing and I am looking forward to seeing this guy once again.Phil Lord and Chris Miller stated that their biggest influence was Bad Boys II and that's exactly what this film is. The Bad Boys II of comedy. Bigger budget, bigger action and mu cm more self aware than the first film. But I'm afraid that they milked the idea to the fullest and that the creators know it. 22 Jump Street is'n as fresh as the first one but it is as much innovative and fun as the first. So go watch it now, you will be laughing about some scenes long after you have left the cinema.",10,6,16,20 August 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," 'I'll die surrounded by the biggest idiots in the galaxy'
","Star Wars for today's generation. And maybe even a little better than that because it is just packed with such fun that I haven't experienced in cinema for a long time. Marvel has outdone themselves once again. Marvel and Disney have been worried that this film will be a financial failure but I haven't been in such a crowded theater since the start of the year.This origin story of this band of misfits starts out with an emotional scene, then the tone changes into this Indiana Jones in Space adventure, then it deliberately makes fun of itself and at last all these tones merge into one and the film keeps this tone for the whole length of the film. When it needs to be emotional it is, when it needs an action scene peppered with humor you get and action scene you haven't seen before. Everzthing in this film works except maybe the main villain. He isn't very menacing but you have so much fun in all the other aspects of the film so you are happy to overlook these details. Plus Ronan The Accuser serves just as build-up for a much greater threat.Every character steals every scene they are in. There is no way you will be able to pick your favorite character because in every scene suddenly all of them become your favorite. Chris Pratt has turned over a night into a household name all thanks to Marvel and his charm and likability. Before he served as a professional goof ball but I don't think that will be the case anymore. He shows such a wide range -switching from comedy into action/adventure or a quick-witted scoundrel. Zoe Saldana has established herself a long time as the go-to-action actress and once she shows why she has earned that. She can be sexy, funny and kick ass all in one moment. Dave Bautista is a real surprise here as the warrior taking thins way too literal and therefore his actions and dialogue end up as some of the funniest in the entire film. Bradley Cooper has tried to make his voice unrecognisable as the Rocket Racoon and he has created not another CG animated character but a character from flesh, blood and fur. His cynical, gun-toting maniacal raccoon will surely end up as the fans favorite but as I have stated before all the characters get the same time to shine. Groot, a sentient tree with a limited vocabulary is the most innocent of all of the members of the team.James Gunn had to abandon his dark humor and frankly a little weird for the mainstream audience but what is more than obvious is the enthusiasm that this film was made with. In every shot you can see the filmmaker who finally got the budget to realize all his dreams and ideas and so he stuffs into this film, all those shots and camera angles of his dreams are all here. The film is therefore such an amazing ride which sucks you in for 2 hours and then spits you out and you will want to go and see it immediately. It's that kind of a movie.This is the film that all the teenagers are going to be talking about when they are 30 years old in the same way the Star Wars generation talks about that experience today. The whole Marvel Cinematic Universe is a history in the making which I am sure will be talking about for a long time. The choice is yours if you want to go and see heavy intense drama disguised as a summer blockbuster go see the Dawn of the Planet of the Apes . But if you want a self-referential light-hearted fun go see the Guardians of the Galaxy. It is one of the best films you will be able to see this year.",10,16,32,1 August 2014
Frank," 'You play C, F and G?'
","If that is all I need to know to be in a band then I can basically be a one man band. Frank shows how weird artists can be but I guess it is a requirement for an artist to be a little weird. The fans and the audience demands it, you have to differ yourself somehow.Despite the title Franks isn't about the titular character as it is about Jon's journey. Jon played by Domhnall Gleeson is an aspiring struggling musician who stumbles upon a opportunity to play with the band 'Soronprfbs' led by Frank. They invite him along and Jon thinking it is just a weekend gig later finds out that they are making a new album. Jon tries to find his place in the band and he also shoots videos, posts pictures and writes about the band online thus creating a viral campaign for the band.Domhnall Gleeson is turning out to be a very sympathetic and promising actor especially after last year's About Time. The film stands on his likable persona and if anyone else would be cast but him the film wouldn't be so enjoyable. Recently I always find myself to be watching a film with Scoot McNairy, who is turning out to be one of my favorite actors. I just never he is in some film and then he pops up and he is just delightful. Really hope this guy will be getting more and more roles. Michael Fassbender delivers a great performance even though we only hear his voice for most of the time. But even with theses limits he has he still can create a compelling and fully fleshed out character. The only problem in the film isn't the pacing or the script or the quirky humor it is Maggie Gyllenhaal. In my opinion she is one of the worst actresses in the world and mostly I find it very hard to look at thus making her character extremely irritating.Jon finds out that you don't need to have an abusive childhood or mental illness to be a great artist - musician in this case. You just need to write songs from your heart and live. Not try to be somebody who you are not. You need to be creative plus a little talent doesn't hurt.",8,5,11,25 September 2014
Jack Reacher," 'There's this guy. He's a kind of cop, at least he used to be. He doesn't care about proof, he doesn't care about the law, he only cares about what's right.'
","Warning: This is not your typical Tom Cruise film. If you were expecting an action ride with impossible stunts ala Mission Impossible then you will be mistaken. But I guarantee, you will not be disappointed there is plenty of action in this film. It is just more of a detective story than any other Tom Cruise film.Opening with a particularly frightening and suspenseful sequence filmed through the sniper's eye, the first act of the film has a very heavy atmosphere. We are introduced to our main character through series of lines stating that the government, police, nobody knows anything about Jack Reacher. They can't find him, he shows when he wants to be found. As if on cue Reacher comes inside the room. He is at first reluctant to help but he finds that there is more than meets the eye to the shooting of five random citizens. What comes next is a thrilling ride filled with great fist fights, shoot-outs, amazing car chase and the quarry-set finale is the icing on the cake. What truly stood out to me was the bathroom fight which brilliantly mixed violence and humor. I am sure that this scene will go down in history as one of the funniest fights ever.Tom Cruise is as usual very believable with his tough guy persona. He gives a marvelous performance but that isn't very surprising as I was sure Cruise will be amazing. I have never read the novels (but I sure am going to after watching the film)so I can't compare with the books. Robert Duvall has little screen time but you can clearly see how much he is enjoying his character, throwing funny lines here and there. He was truly the highlight of the scenes when he was on screen. Jai Courtney is great as the villain's chief henchman, can't wait to see him as John Mcclane's son in the next Die Hard film. Rosamund Pike ,who has previously played a lawyer in Fracture, gives a good performance but she is mainly here as the eye candy and she does that very well. In most scenes that she is in you get quite distracted by her beauty. The cameraman sure knew how to capture the best of her.Christopher McQuarrie, mostly known for penning the scripts to The Usual Supects and Valkyrie, has a very steady hand as a director and delivers an amazing old school crime thriller which can boldly stand among other classics of this genre.",10,10,20,31 December 2012
Thor," 'Your ancestors called it magic but you call it science. I come from a land where they are one and the same. '
","Surprisingly Thor has got the magic of an amazing, popcorn overflowing, comic-book movie. I have to say I was quite sceptical about this movie, the footage in the trailers looked pretty lame and stupid, but the great reviews I kept reading about this movie made me change my mind to go and see the movie.When I read that Kenneth Brannagh is directing Thor I had no idea what to think about it, I mean a renowned Shakespearean director and actor at the helm of a high-budget comic book movie? It just didn't seem like a good idea, but I didn't believe that Jon Favreau could pull off a good movie with Iron Man and he proved us wrong and so does Brannagh. It seems that Marvel has got good hand on picking the directors. The character of Thor is a tricky one to translate to screen. Firstly Thor isn't like other superheroes, he isn't human, he is a God, one who was worshiped by ancient Norsemen. The story might be simple but that doesn't matter if it's well told. Thor is cast down to Earth by his father Odin for his reckless actions that reignite an ancient war and is forced to live among humans. Thor is one of the most charismatic, arrogant, noble, physically imposing, powerful and romantic characters that have come on screen recently. Chris Hemsworth brings all that into the character so he proves himself as a great actor. Brannagh handles the action scenes very well. A guy huge like a mountain fighting his enemies with a hammer sounds silly but it looks great on screen. Hell, it actually kicks ass. The action is exactly how I expect it from a comic book movie: it's cheesy, little bit over the top, fun and kick ass. Brannagh was chosen for this movie for another reason, he knows that in a summer movie the action can't be simply there just for the sake of having action scenes in a movie. You need emotions and he delivers that through almost Shakespearean family tragedy. Anthony Hopkins as Odin is amazing, when he shouts 'Silence' nobody ,even in the cinema, says a word. Tom Hiddleston gives here an incredible performance as Thor's devious brother Loki, who is scheming against everyone, hidden under this facade of a meek. Natalie Portman as a beautiful young scientist hasn't got much to do in this movie just to be amazed by Thor and you can see that she really is. When he kisses her hand as a noble man you can see how she is falling for him in love. I love how the writers incorporated S.H.I.E.L.D. into the story in such a casual way. Once again we get the marvelous Agent Coulson. His interactions with Thor are the funniest and also the most tense one. Idris Elba as Heimdall the guard is a perfect casting choice. He is calm, great in action scenes. He is just perfect. There is also Rene Russo as Thor's mother Frigga but unfortunately she doesn't get a lot of screen time.In the end this is exactly what you pay for and even more. Thor is one of the greatest comic book adaptations, it's funny, has great characters and actors,great score/soundtrack by Patrick Doyle, amazing visual effects, great action scenes. In my opinion it's a comic book movie the way they are supposed to be made.Watch out for a great Stan Lee's cameo and as usual with Marvel movies stay till the end of the credits for a genius post-credits scene.Thor will return in The Avengers.",10,10,20,29 April 2011
Edge of Tomorrow," 'You see this isn't the first time that we've had this conversation. '
","Why do we go to the movies? To be entertained, to laugh, to be amused, to be pulled into situations that are far from ever happening to us. The only certainty in today's film world that the film that you pick to watch in cinema is Tom Cruise. If you go into cinema and see any of Cruise's films you can be damn sure that that film won't disappoint you. Tom Cruise sure picks great projects. Frankly, I have to say that I haven't seen a bad film starring Tom Cruise.Edge of Tomorrow is described by the director himself as 'Groundhog Day meets Starship Troopers'. The former mentioned is actually quite important since the trailers made this film look pretty dark, which is not the case. This is fun action film with lots of humor. Humor that perfectly fits this film. The time-loop allows the Cruise's Colonel Cage to remember exactly the situation he repeats over and over, which is many times very funny. At films with time-loop I am alway worried that the film might get repetitive. Well you don't have to when Doug Liman is at helm. The film has no time to get repetitive when it is moving at such fast pace. An action scene follows an actions and the scope is just mind blowing. This film packs in so much in just two hours. Other films usually keep the best scenes for the big finale. In Edge of Tomorrow all the action scenes are the best scenes of the film.Tom Cruise doesn't act as his usual self here, he plays against type. He always tries to come up with something new in his films. So in what role you haven't seen him yet? A wimpy coward. He once again shows what a versatile actor he is. Emily Blunt, as the kick ass Rita, has never been more likable in any of her films than here. she handles the action and the drama perfectly. Bill Paxton mostly just repeats his commands and lines about victory, but he is just so great at that he ends up as one of the funniest characters in the film To me this comes as no surprise, that Edge of Tomorrow is yet another sci-fi Tom Cruise film, which kick ass from start to finish. What roller-coaster ride! This will be hard to top in the upcoming summer season. There is nothing wrong with this film. It's got everything. Even a helicopter crash!",10,292,352,3 June 2014
Inception," 'You Are Not Prepared For This!'
","That's what Leonardo DiCaprio was shouting at me for months from all those trailers and previews (there wasn't many of them) and he was right I wasn't prepared for this awesome, mind-blowing experience.Finally I have seen the most anticipated movie of this year (for me) and I know you are all excited for this movie so I try do describe the movie without giving away too much of the plot. The story tells of Cobb who is a extractor, someone who enters human minds through their dreams he and his team create and steals valuable information from the subject's mind. He is a wanted fugitive in the U.S.A, which is a problem for him, because he's got kids there and coming back home to them is what he most desires. During his last assignment he meets a mysterious Japanese businessman, who doesn't ask him of extraction but an inception, planting an idea in someone's mind and that is much more complicated. So Cobb sets out to recruit a team and finish this last job alive.All the actors here do an outstanding job; Leonardo Dicaprio is at his best in this movie, Marion Cottilard does an excellent job as 'The Shade', Ellen Page, one of the prettiest young actresses of today, is always great. Tom Hardy plays here the character with the right bad-ass attitude, they should offer him more roles like this.The biggest surprise for me was Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Arthur, never seen a movie with him he surprised me how charismatic he is and how great he pulled off the role of Arthur.If you think the soundtrack from Hans Zimmer in The Dark Knight was unbelievable then wait for this one, I have to go and call this The Best Soundtrack of the Year.This movie features one of the best movie fights ever where Arthur is fighting one of the subconscious' defenses and the gravity is always changing. That fight is just so breathtaking and suspensive. It's just a like Ariadne says 'It's pure creation'.The movie is just so brilliant, it works on many levels. It's suspensive, mysterious, filled with action, the visuals are breathtaking, there is the typical blockbuster/Nolan humor in it too. Christopher Nolan is once again playing with the mind of the audience and until the end you don't know what's going to happen and you don't even know after the end. That's the beauty of it Nolan lets the viewer interpret the ending by himself. Nolan made this masterpiece, this modern day classic and it's a one hell of a ride and it's one hell of mind-blower.If you think about it, Nolan has planted an idea in your mind which you will be thinking about for months.",10,8,15,27 July 2010
The Wolverine," 'This isn't going to end well!'
","Says Jean Grey during one of her visits in Wolverine's nightmares and yet she is right. The Wolverine might have started in a good fashion but it is not a good movie by any means.First of all I have to say that I didn't want to see this movie in the cinema but I did because my friends wanted to go. I knew right form the first trailer that this won't be a good movie. This is one of the things when I'm not glad I'm right. I enjoyed all the previous X-men movies but the paradox is I loved most the X-men Movie which featured none of the cast from the previous movies and had a completely different director: X-Men: First Class.The Wolverine is the exact opposite of what the fans desired and the creators of this film promised. The fans were promised a take on the character that would be more faithful to the comics and and above all more violent. I guess we never get an R rated Wolverine or X-men movie which is a huge pity. I mean this is a character who has claws in his hands but actually never see any blood. We just hear the sound of his claws ripping through someone and the look of pain on his opponent. So we have to let the imagination roll. Wolverine is a brutal killing machine but with his heart in the right place. That's not the case in the movies. Here his portrayal seems to me as quite wimpy, and he gets wimpier and wimpier in every movie. Hugh Jackman is perfect fit for the role of Wolverine, which makes more sad that we probably never get a proper X-men or Wolverine movie with this actor. This movie doesn't move Wolverine's character arc anywhere. This is just a bridge between 2006's The Last Stand and next year's Days of the Future Past, which you also get teased in the mid credits scene, which might be one of the best scenes in the movie. The movie doesn't have a villain. I mean there is many figures who are the bad guys but it lacks a main villain. You know what they say, that the hero is just as good as the villain. The movie takes place in Japan however director James Mangold makes no use of the Japanese element. In fact it seems to me that is film is quite disgraceful to Japan and its culture when almost all the Japanese characters are portrayed as evil, greedy and hungry for wealth and power. The music is as generic as it can get with a summer blockbuster. No sign on of Japanese element in the music, which could have been very helpful.Don't waste your many on this piece of garbage and wait for the next year's Days of the Future Past which will once again an ensemble X-men movie. Looks like solo movies about one character from the X-men universe don't work.P.S. X-Men Origins: Wolverine, the previous solo X-men movie which got a lot of hate is much better and more fun film than this.",1,23,55,25 July 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," 'This city needs me'
","We need you too, Bruce. After four years of waiting finally a third sequel, the conclusion to one of the best film trilogies in history arrives in cinemas. The question which comes to everyone's mind is: Is it a worthy conclusion? Of course it is. Did you expect a different answer?I noticed that people nowadays can't just simply enjoy a film. They look for mistakes, nitpick plot holes, details, clichés and complain about twists and turns in the story. They should be grateful for any twists and turns in the story when some movies completely miss a plot whatsoever. When I was coming out of the cinema I heard all these people and my friends too complaining about Bane or the ending. I was the only one who stated that I enjoyed the film. I mean isn't that what's important? Whether you enjoyed the film overall or not. The ensemble of actors in this film is truly magnificent. All of them give a tremendous performance. Bane is not such a fun and charismatic villain as the Joker but Tom Hardy makes the character fun to watch in its own way. You have to admire his brutality and fight skills which really let shine in the first and best hand-to-hand fight scene with Batman. It really seems that he is undefeatable. I also enjoyed how he questions loyalty but he doesn't give a damn about the lives of his henchmen thus being a hard boss to be loyal to. First I didn't like that muzzle he has over his face but in the film it just merges with the character and you don't notice it at all. I found nothing wrong with his voice. Yes, maybe it is a little bit muffled but I found it quite fun and engaging into the film when you don't understand everything a character says. I believe that it is no surprise that Joseph Gordon Levitt is amazing once again. While being extremely gorgeous Anne Hathaway gives one of her best performances in her career. She funny, witty and sexy, amazing at kicking asses. Everything Catwoman should be but she is never referred as Catwoman in the film only as Selina Kyle but trust me it all has a very good explanation. And of course Christian Bale gives tremendous performance as Bruce Wayne/Batman. Now that the film is once again focused on Bruce Wayne Bale has change to show off his acting skills. That was what was bothering me with The Dark Knight, it wasn't about Batman. Hans Zimmer this time not working with James Newton Howard doesn't bring many new tunes to the film. Still the few of new themes as Bane's or Selina Kyle's are magnificent.Cinematography in this film is absolutely amazing. What is being done with the camera in some of the chase scenes or the opening scene which will leave you breathless is just Wow! Wally Pfister deserves an Oscar for every film he worked on and this time he truly deserves it so I hope he will win this time.In the end I want to congratulate to the genius of Christopher Nolan for making this amazing trilogy, for giving us such amazing experiences with each film and for presenting us with this wonderful take on Batman which we will never see transformed on screen as breathtaking as from Christopher Nolan",10,7,15,6 August 2012
Lucy," 'Life was given to us a billion years ago. What have we done with it? '
","Luc Besson has always been one of the most creative and original filmmakers therefore he has been one of my favorite directors. Besson, known for strong female leads, continues to do his best in Lucy. After Mathilda in Leon we get another woman who doesn't let herself to be kicked around.Scarlett Johansson, always delivers an amazing performance. In Lucy she perfectly captures all the ranges of her character. From the scared, clueless woman to the fearless, no nonsense all knowing, all powers possessing 'god'. Morgan Freeman does his standard routine of an explaining professor but there is nothing wrong with that he fits into the story flawlessly. Amr Waked as the policeman Pierre Del Rio, who helps Lucy is a great addition to an already diverse cast. Besson always had knack for attention-grabbing villains and Mr. Jang played by Min-sik Choi is no exception.Despite the fact that the trailers made this film seem like an action ride this film is more than anything a celebration of humanity. The theory that people use only 10 percent of their brain is proved to be false but here it is used as a metaphor. By which Besson is trying to say that we are not using our fullest potential. Imagine, if we really tried hard enough to not be that lazy, to be more creative and to be adventurous. So the film's message is wrapped around a summer action fare but I think that most moviegoers should not just pass this along as a science nonsense and give it a second thought.I have also loved the use of inter cutting to documentary shots to emphasize the situation the character is currently in. For example the shot of the mouse approaching the mousetrap. By this Besson proves that there still are new and fun ideas how to present an idea. I also love how some films are just definitely written by Luc Besson and you can sense from a mile away. The premise, ideas and action scenes are just so Besson you know nobody else could have come up with them.In short, if you love Scarlet Johannson, Luc Besson's work, an amazing scifi film with some message to give you something to think about, then Lucy will certainly will be an enjoyable time at the cinema.",10,13,30,28 September 2014
Godzilla," 'You're not fooling anybody when you say, that what happened was a 'natural disaster,'.
","Monsters Reloaded. That is what essentially Godzilla is. Gareth Edwards simply upgraded his film debut with a dose of a bigger budget and a famous brand stamp. Monsters is a film that relies on the atmosphere and the kind of documentary camera. More than anything it is a character study and a long tease before you see any aliens. But that's exactly the way to build suspense.Now with a bigger budget Edwards has a chance to let himself run wild and stuff his film with plenty of action scenes .. only some people might be bothered that they don't involve the title character. All the monsters in the film are here just to serve as the background, to paint the broader bigger picture. In the same way as, for example, in The Perfect Storm - the natural disaster serves as a background for the story.The film boasts an impressive cast, but some of these actors are seriously underused. Sally Hawkins just simply stands around doing nothing while being a female counterpart to Dr. Serizawa. Speaking of him, this character, played by Ken Watanabe, has got to be one of the most WTF characters ever to grace the screen. Most of his scenes have him gazing into the horizon with a terrified/confused face or spout exposition dialogue, because he is a scientist and Japanes. Therefore out of all the characters he has to know most about Godzilla, which equals satisfied Japanese audience. Bryan Cranston gives a stellar performance with his limited screen time. Main actors are Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen. Johnson as Ford Brody, a soldier and bomb disposal expert, has a simple task to get back to San Franciso and save his family. His character has all the character traits I would expect from a solider, so no complaints here. However Elizabeth Olsen shapes up to be more than just another pretty face in the film industry.Gareth Edwards made a film that might not meet everyone's expectations. But if you go along with the take and the direction this film is taking, then I'm sure that you will enjoy this not very typical run-of-the mill 'summmer blockbuster'.P.S. What is most promising about this film is the director. The way he builds suspense will remind you of early Spielberg films. Some images are also reminiscent of Spielberg (train on fire, bodies in the river, conspiracy theory obsessed character), Edwards doesn't show the carnage, he shows you the consequences through the little bit of the puzzle, so you can work out what happened yourself. I just can't wait what to see what Gareth Edwards cooks up for his next film because out of all these young talents, he is shaping up to be the most talented.",10,9,20,3 June 2014
Kingsman: The Secret Service," 'Do you like spy movies, Mr. De Vere?'
","A lisp speaking billionaire philanthropist Richmond Valentine poses this question to a gentleman-spy Harry Hart, currently in disguise; which results in the smartest and funnest conversation you will see this year. From every frame of this film the love for old espionage and old James Bond films is tangible and mostly it is in this scene where the protagonist and and the antagonist of this film profess their mutual love of 'far-fetched theatrical plots'. Also a point is raised that the adventures were as good as the villain. The love for making films, having fun and letting yourself loose in the whirl of ideas can be felt throughout the whole film.The strength of any film is to have rightly cast actors. Taron Egerton, the most important piece of the puzzle, is the most promising talent to appear in the film since Jack O'Connel in Starred Up. He is charming, witty and just straight-up lovable. If the audience would not like him or sympathize with him the film would fail. Luckily, that is not the case. Colin Firth's talent is finally being used in the proper way. I finally started to enjoy Firth as an actor in last year's Woody Allen's Magic in the Moonlight and here he plays completely against type. The idea behind his casting was – Who is the least likely people would imagine as a spy?' Colin Firth is delivers the performance of his life as the typical British gentleman with incredible fighting skills. Mark Strong is fun and entertaining as ever, this time differing himself with a Scottish accent. Samuel L. Jackson is the funniest and funnest villain you have seen in a long time. Matthew Vaughn decided to turn the villain formula on its head and Jackson spiced things up with a speech pattern, which results in the most ridiculous bad guy I have ever seen. I also always enjoy a villain with a noble cause. Sofia Boutella as Gazelle, Valentine's partner in crime is a great play on the typical henchman we see in the movies. Her having blades instead of legs is one wicked idea. Michael Caine of course is a national treasure and it is such a pleasure to see him in any film because no one has a screen presence as him.The camera work in Kingsman is the best I have seen since Bad Boys 2. The cinematography is fluent - no furious cuts, steady - no shaky camera, and is usually done in one take. The pivotal and arguably the bes scene of the film is the people are calling the 'church scene'. That scene is when everything cuts loose, people go berserk and generally mayhem ensues. This is the most violent, bloody action sequence you will see this year and it is all done in seemingly one take.That brings me to the highlight of the film. Since the film is not censored by American studio executives Matthew Vaughn was completely in hold of the reins. He could cut himself loose. Therefore one of the film's biggest appeal is its ultra violence. Now, I don't want to sound like some blood-lust psychopath but having people be killed in a movie without any blood or the consequences shown is wrong and it hurts the viewer's enjoyment (if I want to see Sylvester Stallone film I expect blood, which wasn't the case with Expendables 3) and it hurts the psyche of a potential young viewer who might get the wrong impression of violence.Vaughn's taste in music is very similar to mine. I have always dreamt of hearing Dire Straits's 'Money For Nothing' in a film and that is the song the film starts with. I was immediately in a paradise. The brilliantly put together soundtrack continues with Lynyrd Skynyrd's 'Free Bird' and KC & The Sunshine Band playing at the most inappropriate times resulting in a great comedic effect.Matthew Vaughn is ,for me, one of the smartest directors, since he is always is in sync with the audience's taste and its demand. So run to theater as fast as you can to see the best action film in years and the best movie of this year. I guarantee that you won't regret having an amazing time with this ultra violent, mega fun, self-referential spy action masterpiece.",10,4,11,14 March 2015
The Hangover Part III," Do you even know, what's going on? Yes, I do. Phil's doing all the work, I'm his assistant and you are standing there looking like an idiot!
","The end of one of the most unnecessary film trilogies is finally here. First, I have to say I never was a fan of the first Hangover. I never understood why such a mediocre comedy is getting so much attention and praise. There are so many more better comedies who would deserve more attention and praise, or a sequel. The original spawned two more follow- ups, where the first one got a lot of backlash for bringing the same narrative structure and plot. Critics disliked it and fans disliked it. Although I enjoyed the Bangkok adventure more than the first. Mainly because of the direction and the situations the characters found themselves were actually funny. While watching the first movie I just couldn't find the situations funny, the plot seemed too serious to me. That wasn't the case with the second one. Director Todd Phillips even said himself in a recent interview that all the hangover films are not straight-up comedies and they never have been. The second one went a step further and became a black comedy which appealed to to me much more tan the bland first one. The Hangover Part III goes even further, but not probably in the the right direction.It was obvious from all the previous Todd Phillip's movies that he desperately wants to make an action movie. In every single one of his films there is at least one actions usually involving a car. Warner Bros. studios probably didn't let Phillips make an action movie so he jammed a gangster story involving kidnapping, robbery and dead bodies into this so-called comedy. What worked in the previous films was that there wasn't a main character, all three of them were main characters. The story didn't focus on neither one of them. This time the story focuses on Alan, played by Zach Galifanakis, who again plays the man child, which he is famous for playing in every movie he is in. His annoying mentally retarded fattie worked the previous movie for his limited screen time. That is not the case her. Part III is his story only, but luckily his character goes through some development here and in the end he there is an catharsis waiting for him. The rest of the Wolfpack, Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Stu (Ed Helms) are reduced to supporting characters this time. In most of the scenes they just stand by and watch Alana and his crazy escapades. Unfortunately the man who shouldn't be allowed near a camera, and a very unfunny man, Ken Jeong (originally he was a doctor but then he became an actor) as Chow gets more screen time to the point of being quite unbearable. Doug (Justin Bartha) once again disappears from the story right in the beginning, which is a pity. I wish he would be present at least once in the Wolfpack's adventure.In the previous Hangover films lot of the humor came from these shocking moments, this time the shock value has reached a new high. There is a lot of abuse to animals - dogs, chicken and mainly a giraffe. This film features a giraffe decapitation scene, you have probably seen it in the trailers but in the movie you see much more. You see the decapitated head flying through the air. I know it is CGI so I shouldn't be offended but I don't find this funny. If you are a die-hard Hangover fan then go and see this movie, but if you are looking for a comedy that will make you laugh,then keep looking because this one will just bring a few smiles.P.S. Since Old School Todd Phillips has such great cinematography in his movies, I dare to even say beautiful cinematography, this film is no exception. Also he has an excellent music choice using here once again Billy Joel or Harry Nilsson. Every song he uses in the film fits perfectly to the mood of the scene or as a great joke.",4,4,7,6 June 2013
Pineapple Express," 'In case you haven't noticed - which you haven't, 'cause from what I can tell, you don't notice anything ever - we are not very functional when we're high. '
","Some scenes in Pineapple Express seem to send out a warning to the viewer that smoking marijuana is bad - I mean consider all the things Dale and Saul get into - car chases, shootout out with gangsters. Of course that is just an exaggeration. I guess there is no a message like that. The message of this film is similar to other Rogen/Goldberg/Franco films. It is about the importance of friendship. Mainly in Pineapple Express the message is that you can find friends at unlikeliest place in the unlikeliest circumstances.I have seen this film six times already since the first time I have seen it. It is a film that always gets me out of a bad mood. It is an incredible comedy that works its way into an incredible crazy action climax. Number of jokes is just the characters just stating the obvious or doing something incredibly stupid and I rarely like that. But here it fits my liking and I roll with laughter throughout the whole film. The funniest ones for me are the whole sequence in the woods and the car chase.This was the film that kick started Rogen's career and people started to be aware of this guy. Though he usually plays the straight man to Franco's wacko maniac, Rogen does pull some crazy stuff in this film that is worth your watch. James Franco can pull off a great dramatic role and a great comedic one. His constantly high drug dealer Saul is the high point of the film and every single thing he says or does is laugh-out-loud funny. Danny McBride as Saul's friend Red is an amazing both sides playing scoundrel. Craig Robinson and Kevin Corrigan as the constantly bickering duo of killers are just mesmerizing. Ken Jeong is also in this film in somewhat limited screen time, so look out for him.Pineapple Express is for me one of the best comedies of the last few years and it is the film that properly introduced me to Rogen's kind of humor. Watch it if you want to have a great time with your friends and prepare for one of the best comedic experiences ever.",10,7,12,4 February 2015
