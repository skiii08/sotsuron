Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Could have been better - yes, lamest of the three - no
","Yes, the movie could have been better. I don't agree that the veteran acting was all that spectacular. Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor are accomplished talented actors and they didn't seem to have any motivation for the scenes they were in. They tried hard. I give them points for trying. But 'try not do or do not there is no try' as a short alien with big ears might say.
On to other things. The obvious racial stereotypes. I really believe that Lucas did it on purpose. He is saying look at how silly stereo typing racial and ethnic differences is. Perhaps he is trying to make that point. I think that despite the fact that you could not understand him, JarJar provides comic relief that is needed. No one complained that Chewbacca and R2-D2 couldn't speak an understandable language. Why do they complain now?The acting that was good Natalie Portman, who I had the honor of seeing shooting her current movie the other day (along with Ashley Judd), was good. I am not sure what Lucas is think though because Queen Amidala is about 14 or 15. Natalie Portman is about 17. The time between Episode One and Two is said to be about 15 years. That means no Jake Lloyd but still Natalie Portman. I wonder how they will get around that. Pernilla (Ms. Skywalker), was also impressive as someone who can see that her son has a destiny that is great. I don't get the whole there was no father thing but I am sure everything will be explained.In the end before anyone can pass judgement on this one film they should remember this is 1 of 3 which is really 1 of 9 given the Timothy Zahn books. If the character development was less than adequate remember Obi-Wan (Ben) Kenobi from A New Hope was not developed very well either. There are lots of questions. I liked the movie. When I start to think of the flaws, I remember that 1 I couldn't do any better writing/directing and 2. All will be explained in the next 2 films.",8,0,0,5 August 1999
Fight Club," Not what you expect
","Fight Club is from the same person who gave us 'Seven'. If that doesn't tell you something of what to expect, it should. There are many levels to this movie that I won't go into simply because it would be like giving away the ending of a great mystery. Yes, I agree with the critics who say whatever you think this movie is about, it really isn't. I will go see this movie again simply for the things that I missed on the first viewing. The acting in the movie is incredible. Edward Norton (Rounders, American History X) gives a very believable performance. Brad Pitt is also very good although I would say that Norton's performance is more on target that Pitt's. This movie is not something the academy gives nominations for but if the screenplay adaption does not get some kind of recognition, I will be very surprised. Helena Bonham Carter gives her usual fine performance. If you do see it, remember rules 1 and 2 of Fight Club. Do not talk about fight club. Although it is over 2 hours long it doesn't seem that way at all. I give it nine stars.",9,0,1,17 October 1999
Shakespeare in Love," Truly a Winner
","I saw Pleasantville. I saw Saving Private Ryan. I saw Shakespeare in Love. After having seen the 3 favorites. I have to say that Shakespeare in Love is not only the best of the three films on a story level, it is the best acted of the 3 films. My only regret is that I hadn't seen it in the theatre before the academy awards so that I could know what the entire audience was truly cheering about. I hope that Gwyneth Paltrow continues to choose roles that allow us to see what a wonderful actress she is. I loved the way they combined some of the story lines of Shakespeare plays to add realism (inspiration) to the movie. Pleasantville might have been a tad more original but S.i.L. was truely the better picture. I enjoyed S.P.R. but it didn't need to win. It was a remarkable film in all aspects. The academy did independent studios a great service by letting Shakespeare in Love win. ***** out of *****",10,0,1,5 August 1999
