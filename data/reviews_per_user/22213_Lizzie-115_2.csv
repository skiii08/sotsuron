Black Swan," Speechless..
","Watched this film for the first time last night. Was left feeling unsure about this film, don't know if to say it was amazing or over rated. It isn't for the weak stomached as myself, bits that had natalie portman ripping at her skin and winona ryder stabbing herself left me with hands over my eyes. However natalie portman does a brilliant job taking on this role, which put her across as a mental person. Mila kunis is also very good. Just don't know if it is as amazing as some reviews have made it sound. I was left feeling abit confused and abit disappointed, maybe i expected a little to much, but from a Oscar winning movie, you can expect it to be better than just good to be honest.",8,1,2,4 February 2014
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," simply amazing
","After reading the reviews on this film i felt i had to add my own.. I have seen all of the twilight saga films and Breaking bad part 2 is easily my favorite, off course like many other people the ending being the best part, when the Cullen's finally come head to head with the voltoree. But the journey to the final battle is also very good, you get to see other vampires and their unique talents. Kristen Stewart plays her vampire role brilliantly, as we see in the first 2 movies shes not the best of actresses but if you have read the book you will know that she is meant to play that awkward, timid girl.. which she does beautifully but also badly. So her transformation into this beautiful brilliant vampire is just perfect, she plays the part brilliant. One downer to this film is the sex scene, its very lovey dovey when in the build up to the vampire on vampire sex i was expecting Edward to throw Bella about.. just me?? lol. Robert Patterson plays his part brilliantly, just like he did in all the other film. Overall i was very pleased with his installment of the twilight saga and very gutted its now come to a end.",10,2,10,4 February 2014
