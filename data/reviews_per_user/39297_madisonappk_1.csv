Lucky Number Slevin," Great Great film!
","All around very entertaining. The acting is great. This movie made me like Josh Hartnett and Lucy Liu.It's an modern noir, that takes 70's looks as compared to a 50's style. You may beable to figure out everything at the beginning , but that will not stop you from enjoying this movie. It is funny is all the right places, it has action , and again the acting is the best part. Most people forget to mention the acting of Stanley Tucci, and maybe he is not the best from this one, but his character and acting really holds it all together.When you are having one of those days where you don't feel right, and you just don't know what movie to watch (a comedy? action? horror?) just put this one in and enjoy. Its not a big budget action or comedy film. Its just there. Its something to find on a rainy day and be pleasantly surprised.",10,3,5,4 February 2011
