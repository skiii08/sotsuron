The Devil's Advocate," Very good Devilish movie!
","Al Pacino I have to say, was absolutely brilliant at playing as Satan/Milton. He was just so funny when he admitted to Keanu Reeves' character Lomax that he was was the devil in the end. His attitude and corniness would definitely make you laugh honestly. You wouldn't realise what a best actor he is!Anyways I thought the movie was very good, I was annoyed that I miss midway of it because I forgot that my tablet was running, while I was out. So yeah, it's a bummer but sure, at least I didn't mess the best ending part! I'm glad the movie has got a great lineup of well known cast such ad: Charlize Theorn, Keanu Reeves, Craig T. Nelson and of course Pacino himself! It made the movie looking swell for a devil movie!",8,0,1,21 March 2016
Black Swan," One of the best!
","I swear, this is in my top 10 movie list. This movie was so incredible! Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis relationship was beautiful yet disturbing as it was all to do with being the best of the best. The choreography that was put into this film really stood out, you wouldn't normally see actresses these days trying out dancing before they hit the big screen. By god this movie has shown us to the best of their abilities, they nailed it!I didn't like the ending as it was sad to see the character Mina kill herself with a sharp broken glass. I was gutted honestly, I loved the movie!",10,1,3,22 August 2015
Howl's Moving Castle," A cheerful and funny movie
","I have to say, it's a really good anime film I have ever seen for a while. It's different like because in the English dub, some of the actresses in this film are born English like Emily Mortimer and Jean Simmons playing Sofia. As for Christian Bale, I didn't even know he was part of this movie until I saw the films IMDb page. His voice was unbelievable and of course all of the other actors were great at their voices too!I honestly loved the Flame guy Calcifer and he was voiced by the legend Billy Crystal! I was shocked, he didn't sound like Mike from Monsters Inc at all, he sounded like himself really. It's rather odd since I would know his voice but just not this one! I really like this movie, I would definitely show these to kids but would recommend an adult with them. I give this film 9/10!",9,0,2,12 July 2015
Walk the Line," Good but it's not the real Johnny Cash...
","Look, I think Joaquin Phoenix is a good singer but definitely doesn't sing like the legend himself! I mean if he and Reese Witherspoon used the original voices, it wouldn't make much difference, they still aren't June Carter and Johnny Cash! Reese Witherspoon was a really good singer too but again, she isn't June Carter.Anyways, I thought the story was very good and it really gave me a taste on what involved on Johnny Cash's life. I honestly didn't know he was a drug addict during his famous career and that his fashion sense was black after recovering from the drugs. That's what I loved, he was being true to himself and expressing his true colors. It's too bad that himself and June aren't with us but their legacy goes on",8,0,0,8 November 2015
The Monuments Men," It's actually a good World War II movie, couldn't believe it got bad reviews and is a rating of 6.1
","I tried seeing this movie once but I'm glad today when it was shown on Film4 this evening, I did get down to watch the whole thing. Yes I gotta admit the movie did drag a bit for a nearly 2 hour movie, but at least we got to see the full detail of each men in what they went through during that time. You'd think that they had a easy way to search all the stuff that was being stolen by the Nazi but christ, the Nazi's did plant a few boobietraps. I gotta admit viewing the whole film was pretty intense cause you just think all the men were gonna die by being caught by the Nazi's or Russians. Unfortunately 2 men from the monuments clan did die and it is pretty sad. Thankfully the others didn't die but still, it's sad to lose good soldiers!Props to Clooney, Damon, Goodman and the rest of the monuments guys who played a good few of the heroes from World War II. Such a good historical movie to make your history teacher definitely watch this with the class haha!",8,1,2,18 June 2019
Your Name.," Such a pretty anime <3
","I have to say this anime was absouletely breathtaking like the fact its set in an actual Japan town, makes this anime a whole lot nicer! I thought both Mitsuha and Taki were such interesting characters like it was bizzare that the pair of them were swapping bodies. Yet we still don't know why they were chosen and I mean thanks to Taki, he saved Mitsuhas life for being in her body and alerting everyone that the town is having a meteor attack. Although I felt sorry for him for not getting through to her self absorbed mayor of a father and then him turning off the alarms. Seriously he's a pure jack*ss in this anime lol!However the music, the relationship between Taki & Mitsuha and the specular views of the village made this anime worth watching for! I give it a 8/10!",8,3,4,2 July 2018
Captain Phillips," A heart pounding and a stressful movie that I have ever experienced!
","You gotta get ready for this folks because it'll give you a thrilling ride! I swear, the amount of sweat was pouring all over my face when the character Captain Philips was captured by the four Somali pirates who hijacked his ship. I honestly never knew this happened for real back in 2009, I always kept up with the news but never heard of this one!Tom Hanks really gave a stunning performance as the captain. You would know well its the real him but we just have to know that it's a real character he's playing as. He really made me nervous and honestly, it was pretty shocking that the Somali Pirates got away with what they needed. I honestly wish that this world was living in a better place. It just breaks my heart that those pirates are full of greed because they just poor and they just haven't got a better life for themselves.This movie does get you thinking and I couldn't sleep after watching this movie. It really gives your heart pounding and you will get a state of shock. I wouldn't recommend this to the faint hearted!",8,0,2,27 December 2015
Ali," I don't think Will Smith is the best actor to play as Ali...
","I'm not saying he's the worst actor out there but, he just didn't seem to fit the look of the real Mohammad Ali. I think he seemed to be more himself than Ali and plus, he doesn't fully look like Ali. They really should've concentrated and been more careful on the casting side while they were making this movie.Now I have to say, the boxing scenes were really well done but what puts me off was just the bad casting. Also I even didn't think Jamie Foxx should've acted as Ali's trainer, Drew Bundini Brown. He just acted too chilled just like himself but with this serious role, he just didn't seem to be prepared to be encouraging type. Thankfully I didn't watch the whole movie because honestly, it just bored me to tears. Its sad that the real Ali left us this year with Parkinson's disease. RIP Ali (The Greatest) <3",3,2,4,7 September 2016
The Longest Yard," Tough game and a good movie too!
","Aw god, why did they have to kill off Chris Rock's character?! Oh my god, he was so awesome like! I cant tell you how many times I laughed his stupid jokes, they were incredibly hilarious! I felt he didn't have enough scenes even though, yeah he was minding the team but still he didn't get enough lines man!!!! I was surprised to see Burt Reynolds as the Coach because like he played the lead role years ago and it seems he wants to see what its like to play as the Warden. He was great though.Adam Sandler was such a legend, I loved his sarcastic jokes. I wish he could be my PE teacher at school because he is just awesome and amazing as an actor! I think he really did good at kicking the guards butt. I mean I'm not a football fan but this was the best movie I have ever seen!",8,0,0,8 June 2015
Ghost," Story was a bit long for this type of movie...
","Now Demi Moore, Patrick Swayze and Whoopi Goldberg are brilliant actors but to be completely honest with you, I thought this movie was rather long as a 2 hour 7 minutes film. If it was going to be one hour and 45 minutes, it would've made the story more easier to know what's happening throughout.Although the movie had some ups, the scene where Swayze and Moore's scene with them lovingly teasing each other while shes making a clay pot. Seriously, it was very sweet and like you don't have to be a fan of romantic films to not like that scene! That's all I'm going to say, the rest is totally up to you!",6,1,3,4 February 2017
Casablanca," I wouldn't call it the worst but it ain't the best............
","Even though people think it is one of the best films out there, I just think the accents in it were terrible. The only two persons accents I could understand, was Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman as their main characters. I cant understand why I understood them better than the other characters because, the actors who did the fake thick Moroccan accents, were just so hard to listen to! I just had to skip to the ending where it was only just the characters Rick and Isla saying farewell to each other so, she was able to get away from the war. I would've liked to enjoy it but, unfortunately that wasn't the case with watching this movie. I'm disappointed that it didn't turn out to be what I expected it to be - one of the best movies in the world :(",2,6,15,26 June 2016
Chinatown," Boring for a Jack Nicholson film
","Yes this is meant to be one of the best Jack Nicholson's movie but I think I'm probably the only one in the world that doesn't approve of the movie. I didn't seem to see enough action going around and I think Jack Nicholson playing a good guy doesn't suit him. He's mostly better off playing crazy funny characters or a evil beast. I really like him a lot as an actor but I think this is one of the worst in my personal opinion that he has ever done in his film career!I also thought the movie title was a really wrong idea to advertise since it makes you think that a lot of things could happen in this film but it honestly didn't! It disappoints me, I honestly felt I wasted 40 minutes of my life watching absolutely no live happening. I didn't think this movie deserved an Oscar or be Top Rated. It should've been redone again, it was ridiculous!",1,9,31,10 December 2015
Gravity," Boring.....
","Yes you might think I'm crazy because you see Sandra Bullock and George Clooney but that's not the case. I just think it was too sickening and too confusing at the same time. The way they talked, didn't make it easier for me unless like if you were an astronaut yourself, you could easily understand on what they were saying.I didn't understand why the two main characters were hanging around space for a long period of time. Yeah their spaceship was destroyed by debris but shouldn't they have got some help from the space station like another ship maybe? It just didn't look right to me, there should've been at least back up!Since I'm one of those people who easily gets sick when you see so much of Earth in Space, it didn't make me experience looking at the movie, easy enough!I'm glad I didn't vomit but I had just watched this at around 30 minutes. Whenever it was on the characters faces, that's when I didn't feel sick. Only when you look at space made me sick! For the ones that are like me, don't watch this movie!I think this film is one of George Clooney and Sandra Bullock's worst films on my list!",1,2,5,24 December 2015
Wayne's World," Stupidest movie I've ever seen
","I have heard so many people talking about this from time to time, even my parents have seen this! So today, i decided to watch it as i felt like I needed a laugh. I did laugh at some scenes including Mike Myers and Dana Carvey's silly attitudes with playing their characters.Gee, Tia Carrere can really sing even though, i never ever heard of her before. I honestly didn't know she was in Lio and Stitch. I suppose she was quite popular during the time of the film! I didn't really laugh my ass off but I did giggle so its like yeah its funny but really its not that hilariously funny, y'know?This movie would be good to watch with a group of people but I suggest not to watch it on your own...",8,0,0,8 November 2015
Akira," Didn't feel anything from this at all, regardless if it had a high rating and good reviews!
","While trying to concentrate on watching the rest of this movie, I just couldn't keep up with it. There was too much action going on and like it made it hard for me to understand what was actually happening. Yeah I know its about a boy in a motorcycle gang who are trying to defeat a government who kidnapped their friend. However, I found that things all came at once.I don't understand why Kanye West or anyone would call this a masterpiece because its so confusing and you have to keep up with it, otherwise you would be lost as me. I've watched better anime's then this I'm afraid.........",3,6,12,25 May 2017
As Good as It Gets," Funny film but not my favorite...
","I have to admit all the actors were excellent including Jack Nicholson and Greg Kinnear. However, it just completely bored me out a bit since it was 2 hours and I found that Jack Nicholson's really gave out too much jokes that you've heard it all before! At the beginning of the film, I actually thought the part were he shoved the poor dog into the trash box was honestly hilarious. I never honestly laughed out loud in my life. I can't really think of more scene's that made me laugh but definitely that would be memorable forever!I would actually like to have seen Cuba Gooding,Jr. or the dog more often throughout the film, they would've made this film work out for me!I would recommend it to people but I would not put this as one of my top 10 movies!",7,1,2,11 October 2015
Monster," A reality of the killers eyes.........
","Y'know the title reminds me of Rihanna and Eminem's song 'Monster'. I've thought of it all through the beginning and the end of the movie. Anyways Charlize Theorn was honestly great for playing a serial killer , like the accent and the trashy looks, pretty match the real Aileen Wuornos. I love Cristina Ricci but I think she was too sweet to be in this movie. I wish they didn't call the character Selby, it would've been better off if they named the character after Aileen's real lover Â Tyria Moore. Then they could've got someone better like Melissa McCartney, it would've pushed me to give the film 10 stars really.I found the movie quite horrifying to look at when she shoots her 'clients'. Those men really made a huge mistake although I don't know about the first one to be honest. The last guy made me cry, he seemed to have been a nice poor fella but who knows though? Did the real Aileen mention him in court? We pretty much live in a sad world and there will always be unfortunately murders happening in the world!",7,0,0,24 May 2015
Underworld," It was okish!
","I have to say it was quite good but I didn't see it really much as a Werewolf vs Vampire like you would see in Twilight (btw its rubbish). I liked seeing the stunts and moves that Kate Beckinsale had done as the assassin but I think she should've been better if she did those stunts in a better movie that needs saving like Assassin's Creed movie that came out this year and ended up terrible! I am not too happy about the length of the film either, I think it would better if it was just an hour and thirty minutes because I found that some of the scenes were dragging on and like it seemed some of the scenes needed to be cut but overall it was OK. However, I am giving this 7/10 because I found it lacked a bit of the Gothic side.",7,0,1,4 March 2017
World War Z," Too Overrated and stupid
","Dude, what is the point in having CGI for the zombies to climb up the wall? Seriously that's just a stupid lazy way to put on a action/horror film! I have to tell you this, this is one of the worst movies that Brad Pitt has ever been dragged in.Thank the Lord I didn't watch the whole movie because I would be bored out of tears and seriously be going crazy. It would do your head in! Yknow nowadays with CGI, it doesn't always work out in some movies especially ones that involve with Zombies! I would rather watch Michael Jackson's music video of 'Thriller' then looking at this!I don't understand why it has a IMDb rating of 7.1 and a 63 metascore. It really didn't deserve it, it needs to be rethought again because realistically, I would be expecting bad reviews or a bad metascore from critics.....p",1,1,2,16 April 2016
Zootopia," A really interesting Disney movie
","I really enjoyed watching the movie and I honestly don't care if it's for kids. The Disney Studios did an absolute good job in the detail that's put on the CGI. The storyline was even great too. I liked how it was different and it made you wanna find out what happened next. This is like any cop shows you see on television such as CSI, Castle, Perry Mason, along with many others. I loved the fact the rabbit Judy and the fox Nick joined together to find the missing weasel. Yknow I would've thought those two were gonna become a couple at the end of the film but, since kids are watching this, maybe not.. Still, they would make a great couple like the other Disney couples! It's a really good film, it keeps you interested from scene after scene and it really lightens your day regardless of what age you are! I also like the fact that it has animals on this so any animal lovers like me would love to see this! I give this an 8/10!",8,1,4,22 July 2016
12 Monkeys," Too many twists to understand!
","I hadn't a bloody clue on what the hell was going on. All I liked actually was Brad Pitts character who was being an absolute lunatic and at the same time intelligent in trying to get Bruce Willis' character out of the Mental Institution he was mistakenly thrown in. I just don't think an asylum or Sci-Fi really mix in well together. Why? It just gets crazy in my eyes having to think for a second on what's really happening here. It would've been better if they left out all the Sci-Fi crap and get on with what's happening at the mental asylum! The actors were a perfect choice but I don't think this movie should've been created unless you were a Sci-Fi fan. I don't mind what genre a film puts in but when you add too much business, it does get out of control. I only watched this for 30 minutes before I decided that this film isn't great for me to watch!",1,7,28,31 December 2015
Mississippi Burning," Good movie but I think it was rather long!
","I'm not saying it's the worst out there but, I just think the movie needed to be shorten a little bit. I kept seeing rather boring bits so that caused me to skip much of the film.Anyways let's move onto something positive, I thought Willem Dafoe and Gene Hackman were excellent at playing the FBI agents. I loved how Dafoe's character Agent Alan Ward was a sarcastic yet let's-get-onto-the point type of guy. He really is a charmer and I began to have a little crush on him right from the beginning. I know, totally weird, right?I even loved how Hackman made his character Agent Rupert Anderson, a really humorous guy. Well he is a legend so, we can't complain,right?It is a really dark film with seeing the abuse of the African Americans during the 1960s. It does make you glad that nowadays, we all accept one another!",6,1,1,28 February 2016
Bloody Sunday," Very shocking and sad
","Now I have to admit while watching the movie, I hated the unsteadiness of the camera and the fact the whole film was skipping scenes abruptly. It made me feel uneasy seriously. It was interesting that the British army just lied about the protesters that some of them had firearms. I bet when they told the police about what happened, I say inside, they were peeing their pants. The ones who killed those unarmed citizens should be in jail for live. It was such a cowardly action to just kill whoever was on their path, the 14 people who died that faithful day, didn't deserve this. The families should've been given a apology like a year after it happened. David Cameron (Brexit Escapee) shouldn't be the one giving it 38 years later, it should've been the army. To be honest, that was wayyyy too late, it won't bring back the victims. I honestly can't imagine how stressful and upsetting it is for the families to have their loved ones being killed in a pointless act. Also the ones who miraculously survived and will remember this tragedy for the rest of their lives. May the 14 men rest in peace<3",8,1,1,20 September 2017
The Danish Girl," Captivating and sad....
","Eddie Redmayne was absolutely the best for playing drag as a male to female transgender. He didn't have to keep his voice too high or too low, he did it in the right way - his own voice. Lemme tell ya, he was so handsome regardless if he wore women's clothes or not. I bet all the women actresses wanna get at him lol.I actually thought that this movie in the beginning was boring because Eddies character kinda looked sad and dull. However in the midway, it was beginning to look interesting when we see him putting on the women's clothes! Also the storyline draws you in, I say the reason is that Lili Elbe and Gerda Wegener were real people. It was sad that they both didn't be all lovey dovey after Lili's transition but instead the marriage was annulled and Lili unfortunately died leaving Gerda penniless! That's quite shocking to hear, especially Gerda made such great money for selling her portraits of her husband when he wasn't Lili. It's also a shame that her husband and herself never had children after 6 years together. It makes me wonder, was that why Lili transitioned? I guess we'll never find that out!It's a good movie, it is really sad though! Get a box of tissues too if you decide to watch this!",8,4,12,23 December 2015
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," Humour and storyline was rubbish but songs in this were great
","Just as the title of this review says, the whole storyline and humour was stupid af like I felt there didn't need to be over the top edgy jokes in this. The storyline was just too predictable and rather meh. I did however, really enjoy the whole songs in this, especially when all the Eurovision winners gathered around at a party bursting a mix of Cher and other old skool tracks. That was pretty much it, I wouldn't call it the best tbh....",5,8,16,30 June 2020
The Irishman," Very very boring
","Yes we have the likes of big stars such as Ray Romano, Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino, Joe Pesci among others in this but 3 hours is way too long man. Anyways there wasn't much action going on and the actual history trying to surround the whole thing wasn't that straight forward as it should. I think the film needed to have more action and less time to drag in order make it really that good.Yeah it's disappointing that I wasted my time watching this film but I still think the big stars do have great potential in doing other good stuff rather than this one.......",4,11,19,22 December 2019
Batman Returns," A very good Batman film....
","I have to say,it was worth spending the two hours seeing this film then have watched the Dark Knight Rises not long ago. Seriously I think Michael Gough is the best Alfred of the 1990s like I really wished Michael Caine didn't appear as the present Alfred. Michael Hough is 10 times better and more of having a butler attitude like Caine! I honestly loved Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman, however she doesn't seem to have a good wardrobe when she's back to normal. Yes I know she was meant to be a goody two shoes nerd at the beginning but when she becomes Catwoman, she seriously needed a new wardrobe. She looked like she needed new clothes honestly. The only times she was beautiful, was at Penguins Ball and her costume. The fashion department probably needed Joan Rivers behind the set! It would've been better that way.Oh my gosh, Danny Devito was absolutely amazing at playing Penguin, although I wish his character didn't die in the the end. I wish there was a sequel for penguin so Danny could join again. It would be awesome.Michael Keaton was an alright Batman but Adam West is still on top of the list like. He seemed like a shy and quiet Batman really. We need a better superhero then that to be honest. He didn't show much enthusiasm or interest to make sure Gotham is safe from Penguin. Well at least he saved the day and did recover Gotham although it wasn't in an exciting way! That's just me!",10,2,4,3 September 2015
Blade," Loved the action but it had a cliffhanger.....
","Honestly Wesley Snipes was absolutely amazing and awesome as Blade. He definitely reminds me of legends such as Duke Nukem and Buffy The Vampire Slayer who make sure that everybody around the world is safe from the bad guys and other evil acquaintances. The storyline was very good, I liked how it showed us how and when he was born, I forgotten the date but whatever date it was, it should be an official Blade Day in my opinion! I have to admit I didn't like the blood and gore but I loved the action involved in it. It was really enjoyable!However, I didn't like in the ending where he was about to kill a Vampire, I would actually would love to have seen him kill the vampire! I think it would be better if they made that happen because I would certainly avoid the sequels, they aren't good as this! If you haven't seen this, go watch it, just don't watch the sequels!",8,1,2,17 November 2015
Brokeback Mountain," A powerful romantic film
","I swear from the day they first met, I thought this film will be just a boring old film because they didn't seem to bother talking each other. However, as the pair of cowboys got to know each other, it became interesting and enjoyable to see their relationship just going from being friends to being lovers. Heath Ledger (god rest his soul) did a very extraordinary job on playing a shy quiet guy who secretly has a big heart. Although you wouldn't think he would be the passionate type as he can be very unpredictable by the way he goes on with things. Also who would't forget the sexy Jake Gyllenhaal? I honestly loved how his character showed so such care and affectionate for Ennis that I wanted to give him a cuddle! Their kisses were just so cute and I wish the pair of them didn't get married to different people, they should've just got married secretly and have each other for the rest of their lives. Unfortunately it didn't happen. It was devastating Jack Twist died from a pair of heartless idiots bashing him to death when his tractors wheel was punctured. Seeing Ennis heartbroken by the news was so hard to watch, my eyes were near to tears.If you haven't seen this movie, please watch it. Two hours is so worth your time!",9,3,4,15 May 2015
Orphan," A really good Child Horror film!
","At the beginning of the movie,when the mother goes to labor, bleeding and people around her ignoring her cries. Add to that, the doctors telling her that she had a miscarriage! I found that scene more scarier and sadder. Although, I have to admit when Ester killed the father and her step - brother, that was also sad and frightening!This movie will probably put you off having a child or even adopting one for a while! I know this is only a fictional but at the same time, it just gives you a feeling that someone is gonna come after you when there wouldn't be! It really resembles 'The Omen' quite a lot, though it's a girl this time who might as well be the Devils daughter haha!Even though Isabelle Fuhrman is meant to look scary and horrifying, she was so beautiful as the child killer! I really liked how she used the Russian accent and her style of clothes, she looked fashionably stunning! I can't believe she's 18 now and this movie was out 7 years ago! I feel so old seriously!Anyways it's a really good horror film in a modern way and I liked how the storyline was different. If I made a change to this film, I would have it one hour instead of two. I think the story told us enough of Ester and her tricks!",8,0,0,22 January 2016
About Time," You would have a 'good time' looking at this film
","I really enjoyed watching this movie! I never knew Domhnall Gleeson could pull off a English accent, he really made us Irish proud lol!He really was very charming in this film, I bet Rachel McAdams couldn't wait to give him a big smack on the kiss since they were such a good couple on screen together! I loved the way there was a lot of time traveling going on and it makes you definitely want to go back in time yourself. I mean, I would love to fix mistakes and see great memories in the past, unfortunately I just have to go with the flow and suck it up. I say everyone would agree with me on that account lol!Bill Nighy who played the father was absolutely brilliant! I was so sad when his character died of cancer, he's like this adoring father who anyone would love to have! I even liked his voice too, he has like this David Attenborough voice that really makes you fall asleep, yknow! I was so surprised to have seen Margot Robbie, she is like the best actress out there and I knew she would be successful from me seeing her on the Australian soap 'Neighbours' to being on Hollywood! She did a killer British accent on this too! I'm glad Domhnall Gleeson's character didn't get matched with her because they wouldn't suit as a couple but anyway, luckily it didn't happen! Of course, it's heartbreaking that this was Richard Griffiths last film, an excellent actor who I looked up to during his time in Harry Potter. May he rest in peace ðŸ’ŸReally good film :)",8,2,3,16 January 2016
Spotlight," A really good film about the truth behind the Catholic Church....
","I have been interested in the pedophilia that was caused by the Catholic Church since I watched 'Philomena Lee' movie. For those who don't know who she is, she was a young woman who was sent into the Magdalene laundries in Ireland because she fell pregnant without being married and she disgust the catholic church for that reason. Unfortunately her son was giving up for adoption and they were not able to find each other until after his death. Very disgusting of the Catholic Church to be covering up situations like this especially for poor Philomena Lee. I hope they rot in the ground for what they did to her and her son!Anyways back to the film, I thought it was excellent. It actually remind me of 'The Presidents Men' movie I've seen recently and I have to say, Michael Keaton did a good job on acting as a reporter. It goes to show how there were so many cases out there of sexual abuse in the catholic church in which it involved victims like altar boys, teenage girls, young women,men,etc. There are still cases today and this does not have to be found out in 2001 because its found out every year, day, month and time. Mark Ruffalo was great too, he really did a spot on job as one of the reporters of the Spotlight team. Even though I tried not to get emotional in scenes where they interviewed the victims on these cases, however I found it good that the movie made us all aware of child sexual abuse and being careful of what creeps are out there which doesn't have to be priests! I would recommend this film to anyone who hasn't seen this! 9/10",9,0,0,26 July 2016
My Neighbor Totoro," god no........
","I have to say that this is the worst film I have ever seen like seriously why did they put whiny characters in this?? god it has had given me a headache! Also that scene where the father and the girls are in the bath. Whats more disturbing is that the little girl looked as if she sat on his genitals. I swear like you call this a child's film???? OK so I know it said that in the east that the bathroom can be shared with the family but at the same time, you think to yourself, is he a good father after all? Like you would hope he doesn't turn out to be a pedophile because those girls are quite young! Honest to god, I think this film is very bad on the eyes especially mine, I wouldn't show this to kids, god no!",1,10,49,28 September 2015
Hotel Rwanda," A heart pounding and a stressful movie that I have ever experienced!
","Seriously this movie wouldn't let you breathe for even a second, that's because you concentrate on hoping that Paul Rusesabagina and his family wouldn't get killed by the Hutu army. I have to admit, I am still shaken after watching this movie twenty minutes ago, it's such a heart stopper!I can't imagine how the real Paul Rusesabagina felt when his hotel was hijacked and outrun with refugees whose houses were burnt down by the army. The scenes were very shocking with such killings and corpses lying around, even it makes you forget that this is a movie! I was very surprised and shocked that the U.N. were complete buttheads for not bring the Africans into safety at first, this happened the year I was born. Didn't they realise what filth and ignorance did they think of leaving the blacks out of it and bring the whites instead? I was honestly angry and they said no to safety in their country. Who do they think they are? The U.N are still cowards today especially with Korea in trouble! Don Cheadle and Sophie Okonedo did such great African accents, you would think they are from Africa when they actually aren't! They were excellent and I applaud this film for not being so Hollywood. I applaud it for what we are facing in reality and I definitely should think it deserved the 3 Oscars! Excellent movie!",9,0,0,16 January 2016
Once," I like it but not a HUGE fan
","I loved the music in this film especially 'Falling Slowly'. I really didn't know that song was part of this musical because I have heard of it before on the radio years ago and now in 2015, I finally found out where it was coming from!I know the actors are really musicians but to be honest, the acting was a little uncomfortable to watch. In fact, the actors didn't show enough emotion with their roles. I honestly don't know why this film deserved an Oscar, I think it deserves another version of new actors and a little tweak on the storyline. If the characters fell for each other from the very beginning, then they should show it. The only character that stood out was the Heroin addict guy, he would really remind ya of a character that the story should be based on. He cracked me up. Good man Darren Healy for your superior acting skills in the movie, bravo!",6,0,1,6 July 2015
Moana," Gorgeous film, great actors but the songs weren't at all catchy or that good...
","Like the past Disney films I've seen, they had catchy songs in them and are simply the best. Whereas with this film, it didn't have that touch with its musical numbers,they were kinda like songs you hear and then you forget about them. Although I have to admit they were quite flat, The Rock and Auli'i Cravalho are good singers, but I do think they were just given the wrong songs to sing away to. I would definitely show this to my kids in the future but I have to say, I am little disappointed with its musical numbers. Maybe if it was like the movie 'Brave' without it being a musical, it would be a lot better. I hope when they do an another Disney princess movie, its musical numbers would be more organised,more fun and more upbeat. Thats why I have to give this movie rating a 7/10, it is fair but room for improvement.............",7,1,11,6 December 2016
Snatch," This is definitely a dumb movie!
","I'm not trying to be sexist here since I assume some girls would like this too but it's pretty rough. The comedy was funny but the storyline can drag on a bit. I liked how the characters were introduced as if they were in a superhero movie but in gangster version.Brad Pitt was alright at playing an Irish gypsy, although you can still hear his American accent which kinda makes the Irish accent not that very good to listen to. It was surprising to see an American trying to intimate a Irish traveller but it still wouldn't work. Maybe if they got one of the Love/Hate crew or any other Irish bloke, then it would work out fine.I didn't think this is a good movie to watch but at least I know that it's out there. I never heard of this until recently so since I probably was the only one in the world to not see this, I decided to watch it today. It wouldn't be my cup of tea but at least we can see Brad Pitt!",5,3,6,4 January 2016
The Book Thief," Shows the reality of World War II...
","The near last part and the last part would nearly fill you with tears. My family and myself stumbled on this by accident while flicking through the TV, and this movie suddenly appears on Channel 4. You would get a lump on your throat in the scene where the young girl searches for her Jewish friend among the crowds of Jewish men going to the concentration camps and of course, the Nazi's getting violent at her whenever she approached them. Honestly, they were such sick human beings on this earth that worshipped Hitler and his severe hatred for the Jews. Even the fact, all of the girls family lost their lives when the bombs came on top of them from the Americans (I think). Honestly, this movie is so hard to watch but Geoffrey Rush did a fantastic job as playing the father role. I give this movie a 8/10!",8,0,0,20 April 2017
Suicide Squad," I absolutely f****** love this movie man!
","I saw this yesterday with my buddy when it came out and I have been like blown away despite what the critics or the haters say!I have known Margot Robbie since the day she was Donna Freeman on the soap opera 'Neighbours' and now look at her, she is now the original real life Harley Quinn! She is just so gorgeous, I love Margot Robbie! She is just an amazing actress and she pulled such an American accent. I honestly forgot she was Margot Robbie throughout the film haha!Anyways I loved the fact they choose the right cast to be part of the Suicide Squad. Will Smith as Deadshot was brilliant, he is like the Will Smith we knew from his previous movies - well liked, funny, cheery and just downright awesome! I even liked Jared Leto too as the Joker, his character was like so unpredictable which was scary. I actually thought he was gonna be more abusive like his original self in the animated series but this time, he wanted Harley Quinn even more which was odd. Himself and Margot Robbie were a cute couple anyway like who would say no to them as a couple? Even when Enchantess was tricking everyone's mind, Robbie and Leto looked so handsome without looking gangsta seriously! Even the babies were cuties! The only disappointment in the movie was Enchantess was not part of the Suicide Squad by the way she was promoted. Apart from that, everything was 100% perfect in the film.I have been waiting so long to see this film and I'm so jumping for joy that I managed to see the first villain movie on the planet! I give this movie a 9/10 for just being awesome ;)",9,1,3,6 August 2016
Shutter Island," A fantastic film with DiCapro
","I thought this film was fantastic, i wouldn't call it scary or easily frightening, I would call it a mystery thriller masterpiece. As usual with Leonardo DiCapro, he was always excellent at playing the right roles. Gee, he had to play two characters - Ted and Andrew which could make you confused to which one is he really acting as. That must be really challenging but i say Leonardo is well able to do any role at the same time!I liked the fact this was based on a mental asylum on an island because it just gives you the curious feeling of what will happen next. You really don't to skip a minute or two to not see the full movie since you just gotta find out what really is going on. Although be warned, you will just get one jump-scare. Its the scene where Andrew shot his wife after she killed their three children and you wouldn't have expected it since it was so fast!This is a really great masterpiece of DiCapro's work, I give this movie 9/10 :)",9,10,13,29 December 2015
Capote," A very powerful film
","Who knew Mr Philip Seymour Hoffman (rip) can do such an amazing job on the high pitch voice?! It was incredible and he was unbelievable at his performance! Like wow man, he did a good job. I bet the real Truman Capote would have been proud of him and that he's remembered as a good writer.Before I saw this film, I never heard of Capote before or even read his books. I have learned so much about him like for example, it's interesting that he bounded with the killers by putting their views and why they had did the attack into his book. I honestly wonder, how did the victims families feel about all of this? I say it was very overwhelming and disturbing for them. I feel for them, it is a heartbreaking situation that'll never be forgotten! I then didn't know, he was a long time friend of 'the' Harper Lee, like such a small world we live in! I bet he was he great Craic to bound with. It was good that she was involved in the film otherwise I wouldn't have known herself and Capote were friends for long. She pretty much seemed involved with meeting the victims families with Capote. I suppose she wanted to give support as well as Capote would've done. It must not have been easy but she looked pretty calm and concentrated on what should be said on Capote's novel. I have to say this was an incredible film, I applaud Philip Seymour Hoffman and Catherine Keener to have played such wonderful History icons and for making this film happen!",9,1,1,1 June 2015
Life of Pi," Truly sad but very powerful
","As you would watch the film, you get a very tragic scene where the boy Pi's family was lost when the ship had sunk from the storm. This really reminds me so much of Titanic except it was a very different reason altogether. It really raises you a question if he ever did find his family even after all these years like!I honestly don't know why Pi named the tiger Richard Parker. It was strange but at the same time it was funny because its like hes really given him a pet name. I would really keep away from a Tiger, never mind keeping it on board a little ship haha!Seriously this film will give you chills, thrills and most of all tears. You better prepare for the roller-coaster folks because itll be such a ride for ya watching this!",8,0,2,10 August 2015
Doctor Strange," A really excellent movie!
","Oh how it's such a brilliant idea to have Cumberbatch as the 'Dr Strange'. He honestly should've been the original in the first place, he has the looks, the wittiness, the personality and the accent to be acted as the original Dr Strange. I loved the interesting effects in this like the buildings were moving on different directions.Rachel McAdams and Cumberbatch are just such a cute couple, I felt sorry for his character in the beginning like, it's not easy coming out of a car crash and trying to find the best help he gets. I also thought the cape was quite hilarious when it was bashing the bejaysus out of one of the bad guys! I so want that cape if it was real, it's just awesome to have a useful cape who would help ya along the way!I honestly thought Tilda Swinton was awesome too and boy, her stunts were absolutely incredible. She even looks good with a bald head! It's too bad her character was killed off in the end because like, she helped Dr Strange come out of his shell. That's unfortunately what Marvel movies do, kill off good characters! It was even good to see Stan Lee in the bus laughing at himself. God he really isn't tired of his work and that's one of the greatest things he's ever done, appear on all the Marvel movies that at new and old! What can I say about this movie, great acting, great visual effects, great cast and most of all, the story line was just really clever. I give this a 9/10 rating!",9,0,2,13 November 2016
Captain America: The First Avenger," Pretty good start to the Captain America films
","I have to say, it was rather entertaining to watch even if it was rather predictable. You could see that Chris Evans did do some extreme workouts to look like a badass superhero such as Captain America! Although not my favourite, the movie was quite good! 8/10",8,1,2,1 September 2018
American Hustle," What the hell are they gabbing on about?!
","I did not enjoy the film because all you can hear is mumble,mumble and more mumble! For Christ sakes, you might as well be looking at a gibberish movie and not understand a word of English outta the actors on this! You seriously wouldn't consider giving this 10 frigging Oscars, it's just beyond ridiculous!This movie would've potential if it had a better storyline and better actors. I really loved seeing Amy Adams looking stunning and the fact, the movie had the best soundtrack to boogie with. I hate how crap movies like this have a great storyline but not a great plot! This actually reminds me of 50 shades of Grey of how it's such a terribly eyesore yet, it has the best music out there!I really regret looking at it and like it was just on Channel 4 there! I just only watched 10 minutes and lacked huge interest to the movie. This film would definitely go on my worst movie list...",1,1,2,6 March 2016
10 Things I Hate About You," Silly romantic film!
","At the beginning, I thought this movie was going to be absolutely dull and incredibly stupid because the therapist really put me off haha! She really didn't give us audience a good introduction to be honest!Anyways, my god, Heath Ledger really looked like a teen in his 20's like! I mean, I wouldn't consider him the hottest but the handsomest actor that I've ever seen. I have seen Brokeback Mountain and he has really come a long way from acting in his first Hollywood movie which is this til his death. I couldn't believe he actually sung in the movie, it was really such a surprise, it's so amazing how well known actors can break their shells by showing off their singing talents in some of their films. Heath really has the voice of a rocker, he really needed to do that in his other movies. It would be awesome!I'm also surprised in this film because while you can see there are jocks in the movie, they never got the chance to hurt anyone especially the Tony guy and his gang. They probably must be the kindest people around even if they look threatening xD",8,0,1,30 October 2015
Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping," I'm sorry but this is a definite no from me!
","When I first looked at the movie, I thought it was so boring that I almost fell asleep after watching twenty minutes of it. I'm really disappointed with Lonely Island including Andy Samberg, they are just so talented and funny. However, I didn't find it funny or enjoyable, I found it just too slow for me. All they do is talk too much crap and nothing more, I like the songs but without liking the movie, it would be the worst experience for me to waste time looking at it. Why did they have to make Samberg look like a Justin Bieber type, that look doesn't suit him... He's just better to act as himself when he was on SNL ages ago. Or they could've just done a movie about Lonely Island with having a story-line, not a mockumentry..I think this isn't the best movie that Lonely Island and worse, this is the first. Bad job guys!",1,11,35,18 June 2016
Léon: The Professional," A great film with lots of action!
","Honestly I never heard of Jean Reno before and he bloody blew me away man! He just really does a great assassin, he is such a snake like! I have no words to describe him more but all I can say, he is a talented Moroccon actor out there! Natalie Portman looked so young for 11 years, I was surprised to see she did smoked in some scene. The scenes seeing her did seem light instead of hanky panky. I wouldn't have thought her character Matilda and the assassin Leon would actually make out in the movie. It would make it totally sensitive for some viewers. I personally, think it would give me a cringe and feel shocked that Hollywood would go that far. Anyways luckily it didn't happen!It was good to see Gary Oldman, he really does a bad guy so good! His role in this actually reminded me when he was in the 1992 version of Dracula. He really gave an outstanding success as a bad dude very much so. Very good actor!I'm definitely gonna put this as my favorite movie list because literally, my jaw was done to the ground the whole time watching this, and I extremely enjoyed it!I would recommend people who haven't seen this, just watch it!",9,1,1,29 November 2015
Hot Rod," Stupid I say!
","I love Bill Hader and Andy Samburg but I do not like this film! It was so unfunny and distasteful. I always think they are one of the greatest actors in the world but they just didn't seem to make a good effort on this one...I thought the storyline was too cheesy and boring because you would think this is a Saturday Night Live skit where you could get away with it. With a comedy movie, there shouldn't be any messing or stupidness involved, unfortunately they made a balls doing this film with regard to being belly up!If you want a proper laugh, this ain't the one to look at. Don't watch this peeps!",1,1,2,21 December 2015
North by Northwest," Good to see Grant in a Hitchcock Film!
","I gotta tell ya, Cary Grant was absolutely brillant in this thriller action film. It was quite enjoyable to watch an oldie like this when at that time, action was fresh and just done right! 8/10 I give it!",8,0,0,16 November 2018
The Shining," Very good, I didn't find it scary!
","I would guess a lot of people would find this movie scary, especially Jack Nicholson's character Jack Torrance turning into a complete psycho with his eyes nearly bulging out! He really did an outstanding job in appearing to be very crazy and frightening. Although I wouldn't consider it that scary, I thought it was quite odd and different in a good way like. It did grind my teeth, I have to admit!I honestly thought the little boy was just so adorable, he really was a great little actor. It was too bad he didn't pursue acting in his adulthood but I suppose he is better off living his own life without cameras in his face! Shelley Duvall always looked absolutely shook throughout the movie, I felt sorry to hear that she had nervous exhaustion which caused her hair to fall out, and having a physical illness. I would definitely be the same if I got involved with this movie, I wouldn't be able for it!It's a good film but if you get scared easily, don't watch this!",8,1,3,24 November 2015
American Beauty," Very dark film
","I think Kevin Spacey was the best pick to have gotten a role as a middle aged dad who falls in love with his daughter Jane's best friend Angela. I was so so bummed that he got killed in the end by Rickys crazy closeted religious father. Why oh why didn't he just divorce Carolyn from the beginning?! I felt like my heart just literally sank cause really, Kevin Spacey's character was really lovable in this more then the rest. Himself and Angela should've at least, ran away together! I found it creepy that Ricky just uses his video camera in order to film Jane and I swear, it gives you chills as if he's crazier like his father. I wouldn't date someone who just videos me for no reason, it wouldn't make sense to me I'm afraid lol! I would consider it a good film but it's very dark especially the ending, sex, drugs and so forth....",8,0,2,30 September 2015
In the Name of the Father," Fascinating British Police error history of what happened during that time!
","I honestly felt sick watching this movie, I really couldn't believe how stupid the British police were by not getting their facts right on who was responsible for the IRA pub bombing. Literally I just had to keep watching and gluing to this movie because even though it was years ago, you still want to see Gerry and co being released from jail and live their lives. Unfortunately, Gerry's father wasn't able to experience the freedom with his son and friends as he died in the jail. Very heartbreaking it must have been for the family and like, you just can imagine the effort they put in to try and get everyone out! I would be honestly fighting my way to save my brother from being in prison til his death! Kudos to Daniel Day-Lewis and all the actors involved in this brilliant documentary movie. I give this a solid 8/10 rating!",8,1,1,13 August 2017
Dunkirk," Pretty good, powerful and gripping but very sad
","Myself and the rest of the family decided to put this on and see what it was like. It was very tense I have to say unlike any other World War 2 films I have seen. However it was different because it was set on both land and sea, I normally see either in World War 2 films I've seen. The sounds of the airplanes from the sky, would really give you goosebumps and shriek with fear. Thank christ they aren't used anymore but you still can't forget history...Cillian Murphy, Harry Styles, Kenneth Branagh and Tom Hardy were all excellent in this!I'm giving this a 8/10!",8,0,1,20 July 2018
The Lego Movie," Not a 'brilliant' film
","I always loved Lego since I was a child and I even dreamt about going to legoland for a holiday which didn't happen lol.Anyways I didn't find the movie creative or exciting, it was just too obvious for me like I always knew what happened next in each scene. Believe me, I knew well Emmet was gonna get the girl he found on a construction site at the very end. It was badly done also. For example, like the old man Vitruvius in his ghost form, you can see his mouth wasn't moving or you can see the string that helps him to move as if he's flying! Well done Warner Brothers, that was an epic fail especially on a Lego based movie for god sakes!I didn't think Will Ferrell does a good job at playing as a bad guy, he sounded too much of a good guy. I mean he normally does a really good job at acting but he kinda disappointed me with this film to be honest.Also Batman shouldn't have dated Lucy at all, they didn't look to be a couple at the first place.",2,2,5,3 July 2015
Dallas Buyers Club," A homophobic man living the live of having AIDS
","I really thought Matthew McConaughey, Jared Leto and Jennifer Garner were very good at their performances in this film documentary. I have never seen McConaughey look super thin, even though he is normally a thin man in real life. This movie does show how AIDS and HIV were treated so poorly in the 80s and early 90s. I was so sad when Jared Leto's character died of the disease. He reminds me so much of the guy who died of aids from the musical 'Rent'. I nearly was in tears seriously, it was so emotional. After the ending of the movie, it does make you think and really, we should look after those in need of help while having HIV or aids!",8,1,2,23 January 2017
The Exorcist," Really good horror film!
","I actually wouldn't call this the most horrific film I've ever seen out there. That is because I didn't find it scary but rather mysterious and addicting to watch. You honestly would want to see what the demon in Linda Blair's body does next. It can leave you with questions in your head such as - why did the demon chose to take over that young girls body? What lead it to become more angry with people around the young girl? We won't ever know but like those statues that Father Merrin found, were not found nearby. How did the demon get from Iraq to the state's? Gosh this movie gave a lot of questions in my head than any other horror films I have seen!It was a really good film to watch, it was rather long but at the same time, I get why it was such a box office hit then and the fact, religious nutjobs were planning to kill poor Linda Blair! Christ that was shocking but you get any character's of this world! The poor child was acting, it has nothing to do with being the devil for real like! I definitely recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen it!",8,1,1,3 July 2016
Spirited Away," I actually like the film but it involved a lot of abuse!
","From the first time, I had watched this film and of course heard that it was brilliant, I honestly thought it was gonna be a pretty crappy film. It really put me off with hearing Chihiro whining and whinny over absolute nothing and pretty much trying to do my head in. I was never going to enjoy this film properly with her whining! I didn't like the other character Lin either, she was so bitchy that she should be one of the mean girls. She apologised but I would've said too late to show her how it feels! At least she settled down more as the movie went on and of course there were a few funny scene's, especially when that dirty monster absolutely made everyone feel so sick by his stinking smell! Of course, two faced was odd but seemed very greedy like he ate the whole food just to grow bigger. I have never seen such a demon like spirit eat so much food ever in films before! From what I looked in the film, I think kids over 12 should only look at this since there is a lotta name calling, blood and of course some scary scene's that appear throughout!",7,0,1,7 September 2015
Tropic Thunder," This doesn't deserve a high rating........
","Yeah you see these big stars such as Ben Stiller, Jack Black and Robert Downey Jr being the faces of this movie, however it doesn't matter about who starred in a parody movie, it just completely sucked. You are meant to have humour to watch this, a parody classic such as Spaceballs did it right. It took the p*ss out of movies right and they made it proper entertaining but definitely like this one, it goes below that. Its not funny, its rather upsetting to see they are going through a war and it didn't deserve to be nominated an Oscar. For Christ sakes, I would think the Oscars would've more sense in picking better movies than this. I can't understand why IMDb gave this movie a 7.0 rating, I honestly would give this a 4.0 rating because of the mucked up story line, the casting and the lack of entertainment. One of the worst films I have ever seen......",1,3,13,10 June 2016
Inside Out," A nice film to watch....
","I have to say this film gave me quite a lot of mixed emotions of the way the film was done out like I was laughing from the whole beginning of it. Then I was getting freaked out when the islands were going down and of course sadness came around when they couldn't get back to their headquarters & of course, Bingbong disappearing. Then of course when it was the ending, I became happy again. I'm like jaysus, I never realize that I'm full of emotions when the actual film was very much based on human emotions!You know, Disney nowadays are pretty much keeping their movies so innocent in which I'm glad they are doing this regardless. I will show this to kid but there are some scenes intense lemme tell you!",8,3,21,3 August 2015
The Commitments," Music= brilliant Movie= needed to be a lot better
","I never heard or ever seen an Irish movie like 'The Commitments' that is based on soul music and getting a band as if it were the Blues Brothers (which is way better I'm afraid). I absolutely loved the music, that was what kept me watching this movie, but I think it would been a lot better if there wasn't any involvement with the whole group bickering the whole time and then breaking up because of it. It kinda made the movie itself more distasteful in my opinion like c'mon not all of us Irish like to be snobs and on top of each other! I thought they made Andrew Strong's character a sleaze bag and like, it didn't really suit his role to be a doofus, I prefer if he was more of a chilled and hippie like person yknow. He was brilliant at the same time with singing like a legend, its too bad he didn't make a big career out of it!I'm afraid I have to give this movie a 6/10, I think the storyline and the character of Strong's characterization would need TLC here even if this was based in a novel!",6,1,3,11 June 2017
The Fault in Our Stars," It's a very sad romantic story.....
","Before I saw this movie, I had a feeling the guy Gus dies in the end. I didn't know how he died but I just knew well that this film won't have a happy ending.I thought Gus and Hazel were so cute together like they couldn't get their hands off each other! It's so sad how cancer just kills you silently and loses a loved one that you have been with for so long. I was gutted that Gus passed away and I was thinking at the end of the film that Hazel could've died too when she was looking at the stars lying on a field. This movie is really good but if you have a softie personality, then I suggest you get ten tissue boxes lol!",8,2,4,19 July 2015
Twilight," The worst movie ever!!!!!
","Honest to god, this movie made no sense whatsoever! The actors seemed to have not care on what their roles involve and the storyline was shockingly wrong! Like it would've been better if there was a story around the whole thing but it just looked dull and pointless. I know I have seen this when it came out, it just haunts me when people I know mention the movie. I decided to review this film even if there are more then 1,000 people already reviewed this. Still it wouldn't matter.I also wish they got different actors in the Twilight series, honestly Kirsten Stewart and Robert Pattinson can't seem to show interest at all.",1,4,8,31 May 2015
Wreck-It Ralph," Good for video game lovers!
","I have to admit, this movie really showed a lot of video game icons.It even brings back the time where you would only played the games in game arcades before consoles were becoming popular. I found it interesting when they show us what its like when you turn off the video game. I wish that would happen like for real! I was so excited to see Sonic throughout the movie, he should've really had more lines then being on a screen board warning the characters to not be killed outside their games (they aren't because the characters will always be in our hearts haha). Or even, he should've been included with the main cast, he would be an awesome partner regardless his sarcasm! In some scenes, I thought Sarah Slivermans character was too sweet and childish even though I know she plays a child but still, she should really have made her character have a rough personality. Just really like Jane Lynch's character! Well done Disney",8,0,1,2 July 2015
The Grand Budapest Hotel," A really rather quirky, violent and full of action film!
","I haven't seen this movie properly the first time but when it was showing on RTE 2 and I wasn't busy, I was like sure why not? Omg there was so many funny scenes on this film that I couldn't think of them properly. I know the funniest scene I won't forget was when the lobby Indian guy pushed the bad guy Serge X when he nearly killed Ralph Fienne's character by stopping his foot to the ice glacier. I know it was rather grim but seriously, it was just rather sudden!I couldn't believe but rather glad that there were so many famous stars on this like Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel, Jude Law, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Saoirse Ronan, Léa Seydoux,Tilda Swinton and Tom Wilkinson. Seriously, i say they gave each star a million bucks for being involved in this! All were brilliant anyways!I love the designs on the Budapest hotel, it was just so fascinating and very colourful! No wonder this film got 4 Oscars, it really deserved it! I give this movie a 8/10 because its really really good.",8,0,1,27 November 2016
Behind The Candelabra," The best biography film ever!
","Normally in biography films, they are not always the best in regards to actually getting to show the facts right of the person/s life. However this film just blew me away!I loved how Michael Douglas gave his absolute best on playing Liberace, he just looked like him even if he wasn't him! He didn't have to be squeaking his voice too much but what he does was really to be himself and only himself!Matt Damon really did a good job at playing Liberaces lover, from seeing this movie, he still looks so young definitely at 45! He was also himself and that's just great when actors be themselves when playing their characters. That's what really should happen in every biography film out there!",9,1,4,8 October 2015
Frozen," A very good Disney movie!
","I really liked the movie! It had a lot of surprising scene's and of course, everything animated looks surreal that you wouldn't think it was actually animated. I thought Olaf was such a cute little snowman, I just wanna cuddle him and it's obvious that he likes warm hugs haha! Elsa and Anna had such a roller coaster ride in trying to reunite each other. It can be hard to watch like if you had a wonderful sister abroad, it can be difficult to see her and for her to see you, that would hold back if you don't have enough money to travel. However, I'm glad in the end, they both lived happily ever after and Elsa becomes Queen of Adendale again. I honestly love the fashion sense of the sisters. Although I have to say, Elsa is the winner there. I loved her dress as it was so beautiful with sparkles and the see - through cape covering her sky blue dress. She is such a stunning Disney Princess. I was really shocked but i kinda knew well that Hans became a selfish b****** near the end. I honestly hate him more then the rest of the other villains since it was just totally cruel and wrong to leave Anna left for dead in the cold. Thankfully he got a smack on the face from her and shipped back to his 12 brothers in another country haha. That'll teach him to mess with the wrong woman!It's a nice movie but I think it would be better to watch this with family than on your own!",9,3,9,28 December 2015
Room," Found it too hard to watch this, it was so real!
","I just wasn't able to watch this, it just seemed so real and so upsetting. The story reminds me of a real life story of a young girl named Jaycee Dugard who was kidnapped by that sicko Philip Garrido and his wife. He raped her and she birthed two girls because of him. She was found there in 2009 and like, it is just so upsetting to think we have these evil b*stards lurking around and wanting to ruin people's lives in so many ways. The pedophile in this movie Old Nick, definitely reminds me of Philip Garrido and Ma as Jaycee Dugard except she birthed a son and not two daughters. Still, this movie was traumatizing enough, you need to be really really strong for this movie and not be feeling like you're throwing up. It is just so sad. I just cant speak more about this, just too hard to watch someone suffer regardless if it was fictional.",8,0,3,14 March 2017
The Elephant Man," This made me cry and scared for Joseph Merrick
","This movie in a while has made me so upset because of how people back then in the 1800's treated individuals with disabilities with pure stupidity and cruelty. What really was shocking was when he got kidnapped and was brought back to the circus again. Then of course, the most shocking part of the movie was when the gang with their women just tormented him by making fun of him and lying to him that they weren't gonna hurt him in which they were very much. I felt I just wanted to kick the hell out of Bytes gang and treat them on what they did to Merrick. It was deeply unfair and awful, I felt like I was going to cry because I just couldn't believe it!People back then should've realised he was human with a disability after all, not a ugly monster!",9,0,0,10 October 2015
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," Sound quality isn't the best
","I was disappointed to hear too much of background sound like, I just honestly couldn't concentrate on watching the film at all!If this wasn't an issue for me to look at the entire film, I would've probably give it 8 stars but unfortunately I just can't give it a non truthful result like really, they should really have done something about that.I've heard so much on this film of good reviews and websites that I just couldn't understand why it didn't click with me.I'm glad I just saw this for 30 minutes because I can't take no more of the background sound!",2,3,18,6 October 2015
Hidden Figures," Show em who's really boss!!!!
","Honestly Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monáe were honestly so talented at playing the women who really gave NASA a difference in regard to equality during the 1960s.You don't have to be good at maths to even be intrigued with this film, it is just well done! Definitely check it out!!!",8,1,4,29 February 2020
Lincoln," It's boring but that's only if you are interested in Lincoln
","Even though I decided to watch this since it was on telly, I honestly don't have an interest in the president whatsoever. I'm mostly interested in the other presidents such as John F. Kennedy, Bill Clinton or Barack Obama but definitely not the other ones that I didn't mention. The reason why I looked at this was because it involved Daniel Day-Lewis as the president. He did do a good performance but the movie was talking a lot about politics so it was kinda boring for me to follow since its very much old news now. I would suggest people watching this, be interested first on the President before you look at this. It would make it a better experience for you not to become bored lol!",4,1,5,2 January 2016
The Nightmare Before Christmas," A weird Disney movie but the music was good!
","So I have decided to watch this film because I seem to be the only person in the world that hasn't seen this and it's only a week til Halloween so I might as well give it a go at looking at it. I know we have a DVD of the film in the house but never got around watching it but thanks to Putlocker, I did manage to get to see the film!I found the movie very weird because of the characters not showing much emotions shown on the faces and the whole film really looks as if I'm looking at stoned people who wants to ruin Christmas. I felt that was my impression really.The only thing good about it was the music, it really gets ya to really sing along and jump around. I wouldn't show this to small kids as the movie could freak them out!",8,1,1,22 October 2015
Big Hero 6," I really liked the Bot!
","I think it would be so ideal to have a robot like Baymax to cheer us up when we are down. What made me want to see this film alone was of course the Sky Movies Christmas advert. I don't think America or outside the UK would know who are Sky Movies. Well anyway for the ones who don't recognise the ad, Sky Movies shows a little girl named Rosie who won't eat her Brussel sprouts so she decides to hide under her table. She then goes into different movies such as Cinderalla (2015) , Night of the museum, Big Hero 6 and the Hulk. She just throws the sprouts in the movies so she would be able to watch her movies. Yeah check it out because I'm not really a good storyteller lol.Back with the film, I thought it was kinda stupid that Disney just killed off the main characters brother. He really would do great with the team id he didn't have to die so early. I find that Disney loves killing off good characters in their current films nowadays. It's not really fair in my opinion but there ya go! I really liked the animation on this, it looked very well like the Frozen movie did. The soundtrack was brilliant too, I love how Fall Out Boy had a song there attached to the film. That's awesome!Even though not my favorite Disney movie, it was good!",8,1,2,28 December 2015
Grave of the Fireflies," A very sad tale of Japan in World War II
","I found this movie a very sad reality of what had happened during World War II. What really had me stoked was that Seita looked after his beloved sister Setsuko until her death. He gave up his young life just to protect her from the air raid, feed her and look after her. I found it was very depressing that she died of malnutrition at such a small age. Then poor Setsuko died from starvation at the age of 14. Unfortunately in World War II, many children had died from starvation and of course, the bomb blasts.It was too bad that the aunt wasn't any use to looking after them. I suppose she was too stressed out by the fact, her husband and her daughter were fighting in the war. But still, it wasn't the children's fault that the war has happened all so horribly. I would just love to shake that woman and tell her it wasn't their fault that food is running low!I found this film so sad but absolutely excellent!",9,0,1,5 October 2015
Brave," Good movie!
","This might not be one of my top Disney movies of all time but still, it was quite good yet different! I found it interesting that they targeted the mother to become a bear just because she was getting on Meridas nerves for rushing her into marriage. No other Disney film has ever done that before especially a family member of the main character! I honestly thought the spell was going to make the mother more positive of Meridas choices but definitely an animal was the last thing I ever thought about! I really liked Meridas looks, I say all girls would absolutely die for Meridas big red curly hair! Unfortunately I would have to face consequences in trying to wash and dry the hair. It's different so I hope I see a girl using that style, it would be class!I was disappointed that Disney didn't get Merida a love interest. She is so beautiful like any guy would love her bravery and hyperness! She definitely would show the fellas whose boss lol! Honestly though, she has a good eye for stuff and of course, getting her own way! Even though I said this movie isn't a favourite of mine but, it is really enjoyable if you are an adventure sort!",8,1,4,25 December 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy," Boring........
","Yeah a superhero dude with an annoying cgi raccoon, a dumb tree guy who always appears to be clumsy, a babe and a wrestler loudmouth. Yeah I've heard it all and seen it all before in other superhero movies....I have to say some of the jokes were funny but I felt most of them were too forced at the same time...Yeah not the best parody type of movie Ive ever seen, I send my apologies to the fans out there but sometimes movies just don't work out for me!",3,2,3,14 October 2018
The Evil Dead," Boring and cringy...
","I got down and watched this because my mother got to see it at the year it was shown in cinemas. She didn't like it at all, she really doesn't like horror movies and she was saying to me that she was dragged into seeing the film with friends, so she couldn't escape there! I like horror movies but they have to be good in order to win my satisfaction haha!Anyways, the movie wasn't that great! It was rather boring and stupid. The girls were so annoying with their screams and whining about nothing. OK when you are about to be startled and you don't know what's coming at you, that is understandable to scream. However, the people in this movie screamed and cried over nothing.Whose idea was it to create this movie?! I would rather see Army of Darkness than waste my time watching this! Horrible!",1,2,6,5 February 2016
8 Mile," Really good Eminem film!
","I have to say, I never seen Eminem be in a lead role before. He absolutely killed it! He is such a legend like I wish he acted in more films like this! I like the fact he just was himself even if he was only just acting. I'm also glad that Brittany Murphy (RIP) played his love interest. I wish they didn't make her character cheat on Eminems character. Both herself and Eminem were just an amazing couple together. You can see in the sex scenes, they just were so passionate of each other. I'm not sure if they went out in real life but you know well that they had something between them! It's too bad Murphy isn't with us anymore, she was such a great actress ;(A very good strong movie about rap culture. I give this film a rating of 8/10!",8,0,0,24 November 2016
The Piano," Really didn't understand the storyline
","OK so I know that the story goes with a woman who was muted because on her wedding day, her husband was killed by lightning and is rising her daughter as a single parent.However, It didn't make any sense to me that she had to take off her clothes for a fisherman who promises her to give her back the piano. I honestly didn't understand why the story was going all over the place when that scene happened because like why on earth did she decide to go for him and not Sam Neill's character. Also the characters really should've been played by English actors because some of the amercian actors weren't that great with their fake English accents!I didn't find this movie that great to be honest!",1,10,19,13 October 2015
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Woah a lotta fighting there!
","I never actually seen this before until a few nights ago. Kill Bill is like this action movie where there is so much fighting, that you could easily get lost in figuring out what is actually going on here! Uma Thurman was really good in this but what was the point in beeping out her name,seriously? It doesn't make any sense whatsoever, we know she is, there is no need to wipe her name out. I mean herself and the people involved with her are bad guys yeah? So again, why? I'll never understand why Tarantino would add that onto the movie! Sure he adds everything dramatic and creative so ill have to give him credit for that! I wasn't able to see half of the movie but I wouldn't consider going back to watch it again. Not because it's violent but it's just not the movie I would enjoy much regardless if it had a lot of action or a super heroine involved in it....",7,1,2,15 April 2016
From Dusk Till Dawn," A very odd twist from crime to horror
","I wouldn't call this a soft story because literally there is so many scenes where its bloody, scary,dark and rough. I didn't expect that the whole vampire scene was gonna happen at all and I mean I'm only figuring this out 17 years later like! George Clooney was absolutely outstanding and such a bad ass for playing a ruthless hero villain. He was bloody brilliant but honestly scary like I thought he was gonna kill the whole Fuller family. It was so sad that the father and the son died in the end but of course, they had to be shot because they were turning into bloodsucking and blood eating vampires.Quentin Tarantino was really good too, he played a clueless villain very well. He really should be in more films like this for a lead role because he can literally do anything even if he is a screenwriter! This movie was very disgusting but yet, the action was awesome and gripping!",8,0,0,24 September 2015
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," Loved the music but didn't understand the storyline...
","I have to say, John Cameron Mitchell looked absolutely stunning as a drag queen and boy he really has the voice! Why hasn't the guy got a record deal? God someone should hire him on!Anyways, I found the storyline really all over the place. I didn't understand on what does happen among the characters or what they are actually saying in order for me to understand. It really was frustrating to think of how I was gonna understand this but I think the whole story was just confusing me! I mean like it would've been better if they tweaked the storyline a little bit then I would've give this entire movie 10 stars!I would suggest people to watch this film but I would say, yeah but it will be hard to understand but listen for the music just!",5,0,1,26 July 2015
Hotel Transylvania," You would laugh at this movie but it wouldn't be a favorite...
","The reason I had watched this movie was because there were a lot of well known actors involved in this such as Adam Sandler, Andy Samberg,Selena Gomez,Kevin James, Steve Buscemi,Molly Shannon, David Spade, CeeLo Green, Jon Lovitz and Chris Parnell. Most of them were great at playing the characters because they really focused their hard work on getting this whole thing right even for a kiddie movie.The story had a little romantic touch with Mavis and Johnathan. Of course they had to reduce the kissy kissy stuff since it was a kids movie. I wouldn't want it extreme but they should really show it in a nice way not like avoid it.Its a good movie but its better to watch it if you have kids!",8,0,1,16 October 2015
Annie Hall," I don't see what the fuss is all about...
","This movie was my first time ever to see Woody Allen act, no kidding. Woody Allen in my opinion wasn't really a good actor in this, he could be good at any of his movies, just not this one, to be honest with you. I just think the movie dragged on a bit and I find it was getting too boring after watching 10 minutes of it. I don't understand why this is considered to be one of the greatest films in history. I seem to be the only one not agreeing that it truly isn't one of the best movies I've ever seen..I'm a little disappointed but that's the way it goes with some movies for me.....",1,10,20,30 June 2016
"Girl, Interrupted"," A strong powerful film of mental illness...
","I swear, this film would make you extremely angry, the doctors back then hadn't a clue on how they dealt with diagnosing an individual with mental illness. Not just the doctors but the parents, the priests and the therapists were all the same! They honestly were a disgrace for putting their loved ones in a Nuthouse just because they are in need of help. I mean everybody has problems, why on earth did they just stupidly diss this? It's like a lie where no one has problems but in fact 100% of us do! I'm glad all the asylums have closed up but there's still scars of the past for those poor people.Angelina Jolie, Brittany Murphy (RIP), Winona Ryder, Clea DuVall and many others involved in this film did a fantastic job on their roles! Also thanks to Susanna Kaysen even if she didn't like the film, she has really told her story beautiful for other people who has been in institutionalize for the wrong reasons.",9,0,2,29 July 2015
This Is Spinal Tap," Lacked interest right from the start.....
","Even though it's considered as the best movies out there, I just don't think it would fit into that category. I don't understand why IMDb have this movie a 8/11 rating. It's nowhere near that first of all and second, you hardly understand what the hell is going on. Yeah I know they are being interviewed by a Marty DiBergi dude who randomly interviews them. However when they start talking without the music, they really talk too quick, moan and complain a lot. That's the reason why I just don't understand what they are saying.I did try to like this movie but it just wasn't for me. The music is OK, I wouldn't get too over excited! It's disappointing that I didn't like it but I would suggest this to music fans!",2,3,12,21 May 2016
Drag Me to Hell," Not the best horror film
","This film has such bad taste that I can't even describe how chronic it is!The ending was stupid. If the curse was suppose to be lifted then it is lifted! I thought there was no point in dragging Christine to hell or even let her fall down on the train tracks. The demon didn't look scary at all, it was like seeing Blair witch all over and over again. God, they shouldve at least got a better actor seriously!I don't think this film should be called 'Drag me to hell', instead, it should be called 'I wasn't dragged into hell after all'. It's terrible!",1,0,2,21 June 2015
La La Land," Atroious film...
",Saw this today and i was absouletely bored to tears from watching it. The songs were awful as well as the acting. Yeah I think the old 20th century musicals are way better then the 21st century ones. Hollywood has no imagination anymore....,1,2,5,23 February 2019
A Clockwork Orange," This is filth and a shame!
","I would extremely love to give this a 0 because of the amount of rapes, killings, confusion and pointless kidnappings were involved. Why on earth would anyone like this? It's just filth. They shouldn't have included the well known songs 'Fair City' or 'Singin in the Rain', it makes this totally out of control and horrible. I felt sorry for poor Gene Kelly for his song being used in a messed up movie like this one! I would do the same with Malcolm McDowell if I ever saw him, I would feel absolutely hurt by how the song was used in the wrong direction. There you go with Hollywood, they always think actors can sing other people's song when they even can't! I am definitely gonna wash my eyes after seeing 20 minutes watching this, it is completely rubbish, distasteful and disgusting! Well done Stanley Kubrick!",1,3,17,20 December 2015
Woman in Gold," Brilliant tale of a woman's journey to obtaining her family portraits back to the states
","This movie was such an emotional and a fascinating watch to think a woman who was lucky enough to escape the war with her husband to America and decades later, was able to get her families paintings back from the Nazis (as well as from the Austrian government). This way, she was able to bring the paintings back with her to America and get justice.Kudos for Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds for teaming up on this historical film like it was such a rollercoaster watching it but with an inspiring happy ending!",9,0,0,25 June 2019
Some Like It Hot," Unpredicting and funny but Monroe stole the show!
","I have heard of the movie a lot since i love Marilyn Monroe but never got around in looking at this until today! I absolutely thought seeing Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon in drag was very funny. This probably was the first film to ever show men dressed up as women for cover since i haven't ever heard of an old film to do that before. Even though this was meant to be a movie with laughs, it can become rough when those gangsters killed those poor garage people. Although, i thought they were also gangs too. Either way, it was very horrifying to look at!I loved everything about this film because really, it is so worth your time to see this wonderful classic 1960's movie :)",9,1,2,22 December 2015
Les Misérables," The theatre or the Broadway versions are much better then this!
","In my local theatre back in 2012, they have put on this musical and i have to say, it was brilliant regardless if the people involved weren't professional actors/singers. Then a few years ago, I watched the 25th anniversary with Matt Lucas and Alfie Boe, I was absolutely blown away by the performance and the effort that was put into it! I wish I would've seen it in London.Then I saw this movie this morning and I was extremely disappointed! Hollywood absolutely brutalized this legendary musical for people who just can't sing the right notes! Urgh why did they have to pick actors who bloody can't sing a hymn sheet?!! Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe just sounded like crows, they were terrible! With Anne Hathaway,Sacha Baron Cohen, Helena Bonham Carter, Amanda Seyfried and Eddie Redmayne were OK singers but needed a lot of practice. I don't know how they were saying Anne Hathaway blew the audition with tears because really, I would be crying that the musical is ruined by this movie! The only one that was really good was Samantha Barks, she looked and sounded like the perfect Éponine that I would listen to all day then the rest of the cast. I'm glad she was chosen because no one could play a good Eponine like her!Anyways I'll be getting back to watching the live versions of this musical because Hollywood, you ruined this for me!",1,3,7,30 July 2015
Castle in the Sky," A really enjoyable adventure movie!
","I quite enjoyed watching the film, the graphics were beautiful and the music score was really uplifting for an 80's film!I found the movie had great action like the train scene where Sheeta and Pazu were being chased by their formal enemies which were the pirates. The film even had good humour with the pirate boys admiring Sheeta. I honestly thought she wasn't attractive but if they thought she was, I'll leave them to it haha. Although I have to admit, herself and Pazu were such a cute couple! I wish they both actually kissed instead of leaving the scene already in the end!I was surprised that Mark Hamil aka Luke Skywalker and Jim Cummings aka Dr Eggman from SatAm (Sonic the hedgehog series) were involved in this anime movie. I thought Jim Cummings sounded like John Goodman seriously?! He is so talented with his voice!I'm glad I saw the film so I'm giving it 8/10",8,1,1,18 July 2015
A Beautiful Mind," Too long...
","I think it was too long and boring. I never heard of John Nash before but when a film bases someone's life that I haven't a clue about, I wouldn't be interested. I only watched this because everybody was ranting on that it was a good movie and what not. I just didn't find it interesting, I know Russell Crowe was on this and he can be a good actor but, this isn't one of his best he has done. When he was in Les Miserables, boy it was worse in his film career too in my opinion!I wanted to give this movie another star because the soundtrack was easy listening and pretty great! Maybe if I was into maths and know who John Nash was, then I would give this a 10/10 regardless of how long the movie is! I just didn't fancy watching it further, that's all I can say!",2,1,3,30 January 2016
Die Hard," It's OK but it just doesn't flatter me for some reason!
","I know that this is Alan Rickmans first acting role as a villain and became popular as Professor Snape. However, I just never got interested in the story nor looking at Bruce Willis trying to save the world and rescue his wife. It really does sound rather boring considering that's all he ever does is action movies and nothing else like. I respect him as an actor but he wouldn't be on my favorite list to be perfectly honest with you! I honestly thought Rickmans performance was absolutely brilliant! Seriously, actors like him are just lovable right from the start! I'm so sad he died recently because he is such a great actor with a great dark British voice! He was the only one that really stood out in the movie but most of them kinda sucked to be honest! Especially Bonnie Bedelia as the wife playing in this, would not stop whining about being released by Bruce Willis. I would consider this movie to be overrated so that's why I'm giving this a 1/10 rating!",1,4,24,15 April 2016
Psycho," ehhhhhh waste of time
","I literally thought Marion was gonna be alive throughout but instead in the midway through the film, she was then killed by that weirdos mother who is a crazy old hag. I was fairly disappointed because this is meant to be the top movies out there and it just didn't satisfy me.What i would rather prefer:- Marion surviving the attack and then see her trying to get out of the hotel but couldn't as the crazy psycho mother blocks her every time she would try and escape. I even would like to have seen her and that weird son become a couple if she didn't get killed off so soon. Sure, she escaped to have a new life, why couldn't she go out with guys again? Regardless of that guy being so kiddish, himself and Marion ship would work!I don't consider this to be the best Alfred Hitchcock film to be perfectly honest with you. If Walt Disney was alive, we would share lots of reasons why this film is crap!",1,7,61,18 December 2015
Rosemary's Baby," I'm probably the only one who doesn't understand this movie at all!
","Yeah I know what the story is about, it tells of a young woman and man who moved house together and she finds out she's pregnant with Lucifers baby. However, that's not what I mean. The point I'm making here is that during the whole film, I hadn't the slightest clue of what the other characters were saying to one another especially for a 2 hour film like this one!I didn't understand why Mia Farrow had to cut her hair, is she being held prisoner in her own home by various people? It honestly didn't state to me why she had to do it. In the end, we see that people around her are saying 'Hail Satan' like why did they say that? Were they Satanists all along? Also why didn't they show the baby to the audience? I would've liked to have seen what the baby was like and not to mention, why did they inject Satan's sperm to Mia Farrows character?This is a seriously confusing film and I don't understand why they made a fuss about this? It should've been given a 5.4 IMDb rating instead of 8.0 rating. I don't think it deserved an Oscar either in my opinion. I give this a 2/10 rating. It's a bit of a disappointment really...",2,5,9,1 August 2016
12 Years a Slave," A powerful story about black slavery
","I just felt so saddened and upset by looking at this movie. Why on earth did those men who were meant to be kind just betrayed Solomon North up like that? I swear, this film makes you so darn angry by the way the whites treated the blacks, it was cruel, disgusting and shameful. What did they do to deserve the abuse? Absolutely nothing! I felt like I wanna show the abusers the pain that their victims felt whenever they decide to hurt them. It is wrong!There were a lot of scene's hard to watch for example: the rape, whip and fist beating, it just makes you feel like you wanna vomit in seconds. It was so bad but yet, the movie was excellent. I was surprised to see the movie legends Brad Pitt, Michael Fassbender and Benedict Cumberbatch appear so late in the film. Cumberbatch came first at 30 minutes into the film. Fassbender came second at 54 minutes into the film. Then Pitt decides to come way late at 1 hour and 42 minutes into the film. I was kinda wondering why they all didn't appear at the beginning? I found that quite very odd to be honest. Normally all characters come at the beginning of a movie but I suppose it's nice to be different at the same time so I'll just have to accept that it is a fact on this film! I honestly thought the movie was very emotional, overwhelming and powerful. It gives us a feeling of going back into the time where extreme ignorance of a person's color was a sin to the human race.",9,0,1,30 December 2015
Sausage Party," Should've trusted my instincts and avoided watching this movie altogether!
","I had a bad feeling of this movie and like I should've kept away from it altogether but I seen that it was uploaded on Putlocker, so I might as well look at it just to see how if I'm proved wrong that its a bad movie. Oh boy, it was a bad movie!I felt there was no story to this, the character designs looked awful especially the girls as sausages! They look like bad drawing Vageges that pretty much have bad rotation mouths, they just looked so messed up and disgusting!Also what was even more disgusting, the potatoes had more than two eyes which was all over their bodies, this is not a Sci-Fi movie, how did Seth Rogen think he is? George Lucas is a way better writer than him anyway!I regret watching this movie, however, at least I didn't watch the whole film, it would have bored me to tears!Folks, avoid this, its one of the worst films out there!",1,7,18,21 August 2016
There Will Be Blood," Yeah its not great...
",I got down and dirty to watching this film because it was suggested by a classmate of mine that it was enjoyable to watch. I didn't think it was brilliant and I only watched it for around twenty minutes and I felt like nothing really is exciting about it. I felt very empty and bored out of mind while I was watching this film. It just didn't appeal to me nor it made me realise 'ok I think I like this' but it didn't work for me to be honest!Daniel Day-Lewis would be better off if he continued to play a hero instead of playing a oil man. I think it would be better off if it wasn't existed because it gives me nothing but grief...,3,3,9,10 December 2015
Joker," This really tells a great story of a mentally deranged person

One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Second best of Jack Nicholson!
","I absolutely loved Jack Nicholson's character Murphy, he really was such a gem for a criminal who you wouldn't think is really an actual criminal! I loved at the beginning, he was kissing on one of the guards cheek because it looked as if he was free to go from the asylum but he really wasn't. This movie made us give attention of history, Mental Institutions were cruel and horrifying places for those individuals with disabilities. I thought Murphy absolutely loved spending time with the patients, he deeply cared about them regardless of name-calling or language he used. It really did get me thinking while I was watching the movie. I was astonished that Danny De Vito was Martini, he looked so different and I know well what he looks like! I thought he was just a person who was just involved in the movie. Well there you go, you just find out these things out of the blue! Christopher Lloyd was brilliant too, he looks so very much different from a crazy nut of a doctor to a mentally disturbed patient. I thought the ending was really upsetting, I honestly was heartbroken that Murphy was lobotomized and the Indian guy smothered him because he didn't want to suffer. I suppose he was right to have escaped to go to Canada but it really breaks your heart that Murphy and Billy were no more ♡",9,1,2,10 December 2015
Pitch Perfect 2," This will not be remembered as the first movie will...
","To be perfectly honest with you, I think this film has missed a few things I would consider in changing.Rebel Wilson's character: I love Rebel Wilson but this time, her ongoing jokes were getting way too boring as we have heard it all in the first Pitch Perfect movie. I felt it was always the same and didn't add her character more personality. However I really thought her singing was good though!Emily and Benji's kiss: I think it was a little too fast for both characters to kiss in the middle of the movie. The reason is because I would've rather left it at the near end and of course, since Benji fell for her first, he should be the one to have given her that moment! The ending: Why on earth were they electing Emily as the new member of the Bellas already? I mean, that scene should've really have been at the very beginning when she first met the group at the house. For god sakes like, she already joined the Bellas since the very beginning. Whoever organised the scenes should've done a better job then that like it's not well done really!The first Pitch Perfect was better than this!",3,13,44,29 May 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," This is effing hilarious and good!
","Its so funny how Leonardio De Caprio's character is just so high and that its just so hilarious as hes meant to be a corrupt businessman who defrauds investors and takes drugs with Jonah Hill.Man, Margot Robbie is such a hot chick in this! The scenes where herself and DiCapro are in the bedroom flirting and about to have to sex were absolutely brilliant. I do wonder if she did have panties or just nude ones that look as if she is half naked? Who knows anyways? She was drop dead gorgeous anyhow!It does go to show that you cant trust a businessman with investors as you really do need to have a close eye on them. Its like the anglo Irish banks here in Ireland where there were plenty of corrupt businessmen who have nearly destroyed the country! Honestly if you need a good laugh and history in between, watch this, it is really a great movie!",8,1,4,5 March 2017
Army of Darkness," Wayyyyyyy better than the Evil Dead movies!
","I have to give it a hands down because it really really made me laugh out loud and that's when I would give credit to Bruce Campbell ' s character Ash. I love how he is just your typical guy who doesn't give a damn about anything or anyone but wants to try in saving the world. I began to watch this film last night as I saw that the quote in the movie 'Hail to the King baby' was copied into the Duke Nukem games. Heck I even thought Duke Nukem from my childhood originally said that with his own words but, unfortunately he copied other quotes from different movies. Ah well, who wouldn't like him, he's awesome!I liked how this movie was set out including a different era altogether. You would never think it was part of the Evil Dead movies, except Bruce Campbell and the cabin that appeared a little at the beginning of the movie! I'm glad that this movie wasn't named as 'Evil Dead: Army of Darkness' because I would miss it out as I extremely hate the Evil Dead films. I definitely recommend people who haven't seen this before, should watch it! It'll make your night!",9,1,1,6 February 2016
"Hail, Caesar!"," Really good!
","It does tell you a lot of what Hollywood did back then, like regards with covering up famous people's personal mistakes. It does tell how Hollywood is corrupt like always, you'd think that every little mistake was such a big deal and just throw it away because it's not important. Well let me tell you, it made things feel very awkward and closeted for the stars involved. I know movies back then were all lovely but, it would've been better just to stand up for who you are as a person good or bad! Anyways I'm babbling on like I do in my usual reviews! I really liked the movie! Channing Tatum wasn't that bad of a singer actually and as usual, he was always a great dancer! At least this is something different for him as he normally does hip hop dancing but it's nice to do another type of dance for a change! I was really shocked actually that he was a Soviet army dude all along, I honestly wouldn't have thought of him as anything but a Communist throughout!George Clooney was absolutely brilliant, he really knows how to play a pretty chilled out guy. Yknow when he was kidnapped by the Communists, I really thought they were gonna kill him because his character was like this 'huge' star but thankfully, no one died in this film so happy out! I was surprised to know that this film is the only movie to not have people dead. Possibly the Coen brothers wanted everyone to live this time so that's why this movie was straight forward to watch. It's a rather odd movie but I was glad to have chosen to watch this in the cinema with my mother. I very much enjoyed it, really good!",8,1,2,12 March 2016
Ray," A fun and extraordinary film to dance along with!
","Jamie Foxx really did an outstanding performance of playing Ray Charles. Yes he didn't look like him or sound like him, he took the risks and did what he had to do in order to be recognized as Ray Charles. I found the storyline pretty interesting because I never heard of the guy before until I saw the Blues Brothers movie like a few years ago. Its not easy being a blind person and touring around the world without knowing what's going on visually. But hey if Stevie Wonder can do it then Ray Charles or any other blind artists can do it also! :) As long as you are talented, hard working and a good decent advocate, you have got the job buddy! Man,the music was so uplifting in this film,I just danced and sang the songs out loud (lucky enough no one was at home). I mean if the man himself was alive today and came to my country to play a concert, heck I will be the first in the queue haha! Seriously though, Ray Charles is a legend!!",9,0,1,16 May 2015
The Big Short," A pretty well done biography film before the 2008 crash
","I gotta say kudos to Brad Pitt, Christian Bale, Steve Carrell and Ryan Gosling for being in this full of tension film. It really shows what happened in the business world before 2008 and how it was involving a lot of corruption. It's very similar to Ireland with regards to the Celtic Tiger and our head bankers/our government being such crooks without justice being served.Very educational and scarily real, I give this movie a 8/10!",8,0,0,16 December 2018
The Water Diviner," Really well done film that Russell Crowe ever did!
","Jesus this movie was so tense like Russell Crowes character was always been chased around by the armies. Like seriously, your heart is beating so fast every time he is always been chased lol. At least his character got out alive as well as the eldest son who was unfortunately the last surviving one out of his 2 poor brothers who lost their lives in the war. The sound of cries would really depress you because you would feel helpless as a viewer for not helping the wounded. I mean this really happened folks at the time when soldiers were badly injured and didn't get the help they needed. It's very traumatizing and heartbreaking that many lives were lost during that time.May the victims who lost their lives during the war never be forgotten <3",8,0,1,8 July 2019
Carrie," A movie full of hate, bullying, religion and murder.....
","This movie is like 'If you mess with Carrie, she will definitely mess with you!'. I really feel bad for the girl because she just has no friends and of course, having a extremely crazy ballistic of a mother! God I honestly couldn't believe she stabbed Carrie, she must had a really bad mental illness like a killer! I think Carries bullying, loneliness and the fact that her mother made her mood plus powers become more triggered by it all!I really think this is the best horror movie of all regardless how old or how sad it was, it was really good!Well done Stephen King but really why can't they leave this movie and not add other adaptations that aren't as good as this honestly!",9,2,3,30 August 2015
The Silence of the Lambs," One word: boooooooooring
","Why on earth has this film got five Oscars? It honestly didn't deserve it with a lack of enthusiasm and action! Josie Foster and Anthony Hopkins were alright but I don't see much happening between them to be honest. All they ever do is talk talk talk during the film which honestly bores me out!I really wouldn't call this a scary film but I would say this, I yawned for about 27 minutes of it and tapped the 'X' sign on my tablet to stop watching it, I was completely fed up to be honest!I wouldn't recommend anyone watching this since I found it quite unenjoyable and not amusing!",1,11,40,31 August 2015
Fifty Shades of Grey," 50 shades of puke!
","I cant tell you how horrible and pointless this movie is! OK so a girl falls in love with a guy but the guy doesn't love her back.Then he takes advantage of her by asking her to be his slave and she accepts in order for him to change his mind about her in involving a romantic relationship together. Like for the love of god, why couldn't she just leave him and get on with her own life for a better man who would love her back like an normal person would?! I don't know why EL James wrote this, I know its meant to be different but the plot is just complete rubbish really. I'm glad I haven't read the books otherwise I wouldn't have the patience to get them done. People say the movie is rather different then the book. However I think its the exact same really by the way the story is involving. I thought 2 hours for this movie was too much, they should've just cut it short. It just made the whole thing like a snail race seriously! I'm happy to say, I won't be watching the sequels because really it will be the same as the first one!",1,2,5,2 May 2015
The Dark Knight Rises," Worst batman film I have ever seen!
","Seriously why the hell did they have to make Batman a friggin weakling at the beginning of the film? Gee, this film is meant to be based on a superhero not a laid back. Yes injuries and stab wounds are sore but a superhero like Batman never gives up to save the world!Also why the hell did they make Michael Caine's version of Alfred the butler so whiny? He is meant to be a straight up person to Batman, not a cry baby. Honestly what kind of superhero movie would show this? So stupid like, I swear they should've had a better cast and a better storyline to draw people in. However it didn't draw me in, it made me disappointed and bored even wasting my two hours at looking at this movie. Thank god it's Christian Bales last film as Batman and I really hope Michael Caine is gone from it too. They are great actors but this kind of film wasn't their best choice to be involved in.Well done DC",1,8,12,9 August 2015
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," It wasn't that bad actually...
","At the beginning of the movie, I thought I would be wasting money by watching a reboot of superheroes fighting each other. Actually it was not that bad! I thought Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck were good as playing Batman and Superman.Even though you would miss the 'original' Superman who is known as Christopher Reeves but Cavill did his best too. I was bummed that Superman got killed off in this, why couldn't they just left that part alone and continue with trying to save the world?! I wish the movie didn't have a cliff hanger so we would know that Superman isn't actually dead but alive like! They really should just stick with this movie and never mind the sequels that will happen later on, it does cheese you off a bit!Gal Gadot did a good job playing as Wonderwoman. However, you would miss her original colors on her costume which were:- red, blue and yellow. I suppose Lynda Carter really does miss being Wonderwoman. Who could blame her? She was awesome as Wonderwoman! I kinda feel the same with reboots but Gadot was class too!I do like Jeremy Irons as Alfred even though he doesn't have the original look in which, I would wish he had. He's much better then Michael Caine because he was such a whinger that you would think he wasn't acting as the Alfred we know at all! Ben Affleck is likable too even though, I think he acts a bit older than Christian Bale but at the same time, he's better. Not because he is a popular actor but because he got good skills baby! With Batman, he does have the enthusiasm of saving the world and that's what we want from a superhero!Didn't anyone think Jesse Eisenberg looked cute with his long hair? I did! He really does make a perfect DC villain, he could've been the Joker, he would definitely fit the role in his best nerdy ways! Seriously, I'm glad they got him to be Lex Luthor, DC would definitely find it beneficial to get great stars in starring their superhero movies! It's definitely a good idea for them to be involved with the film industries about this type of stuff to put out there!Its a good film I have to say, glad I watched it regardless if it was too long!",8,3,8,26 March 2016
Space Jam," Brilliant as usual, even as an adult now!
","I remember watching this when I was a kid and thinking this was the best Looney Tunes film back in the day. I don't remember what year I've first seen this. I've watched this a couple of times anyway and today in 2016, I got to watch after so many years. It does bring back such good memories during my childhood. I honestly still enjoyed it, you might think you have grown out of Looney Tunes. S'cuse me? They are still legends that we know of today man! I love Bugs Bunny with his sarcastic sexy voice and Daffy Duck with his 'thinks he knows everything' attitude. C'mon who wouldn't enjoy them like they are hilarious like the other Looney Tunes characters we have known from childhood!I even loved Lola Bunny, she is such a babe. Definitely herself and Bugs are adorable together. Best of all, Kath Soucie voiced her. She is like known for her role as Dexters mum in 'Dexters Laboratory' and Princess Sally in 'Sonic the hedgehog ' series. I was really chuffed because she is my favorite voice actress out there so I decided to watch her again by replaying the movie today!All I can say about this film is, it's still one of the best movies out there. Especially if you had Looney Tunes in your childhood or not!",10,1,1,30 April 2016
Before Sunrise," Boring,sappy and depressing
","So I began watching this movie because, I mostly like romantic films and I just want to give this a go. As soon as I started watching it, it felt like there was too many love dovey scenes and I thought to myself, why the hell would a french girl have a romantic relationship already with an American whom she doesn't know? Like when the film was about to end, I was thinking that he could be a kidnapper rather then the man of her dreams. I know I sound over the top but, the film was just ridiculous!I wouldn't really call this the best movie ever because, as I said as my summary heading - boring, sappy and depressing!",1,1,6,9 February 2016
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Not a good Woody Allen movie im afraid....
","I have to admit Penelope Cruz, Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson looked all beautiful, and of course, Javier Bardem looked handsome as well, it just ain't a good movie that I have ever seen. It gave me this vibe that it was pushed to be too sexy, yes it's meant to be about a painter being all romantic and lonely after his messed up marriage. It just seemed too much like, it would've been better if he was a quiet person then a show off. Although Javier Bardem played a James Bond villain, I think in my opinion that he is normally better to play shy sexy men, then he is definitely on the right track. I was surprised to think Woody Allen wrote this, he should've done a better job with the storyline. He used too much of everything in this film...",2,1,1,30 November 2015
Saving Mr. Banks," A very good film of the background of developing Mary Poppins
","I use to watch Mary Poppins when i was quite young and it was such a darling movie. Although it does have a meaning that poor PL Travers died of alcohol and when her family were in trouble, they got a nanny. It was so sad to think PL Travers childhood was unstable but of course, it was understandable that she didn't want Walt Disney to take Mary Poppins away from her. I was astonished that it took 20 years for Mary Poppins to be developed, I mean, PL Travers probably needed time to go through it but it made things difficult for her when Disney pushed her to make Mary Poppins a film. Although she did state clearly that she didn't want animation in the film but since Disney is the lovable businessman we know, he did it anyway. It was unfair really like, she had the rights as the writer to not have animation on her adaption. Maybe it would've been better off if she went to Universal Studios rather than Disney, she could get away with not having animation or songs in her film.Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks were absolutely brilliant as Walt Disney and PL Travers. Honestly, the pair of them looked so similar to the real Walt Disney and PL Travers. Great job John Lee Hancock and the rest of the film crew to remember an inspiring icon who was behind in creating the flying nanny we all know today!",8,3,3,3 December 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Welcome back Star Wars
","It was so amazing, I am just so happy that Star Wars came back to our screens. I loved the new characters, they are honestly easy to fall in love because like any other Star Wars film, all the characters would never let you down. I quite like Rey, she reminds me so much of Princess Amidala or Princess Leia in her younger years especially fashion wise. I really am looking forward to see what the new characters have in store in the next 8th film. It will be amazing as usual!I was extremely upset that Harrison Ford was killed by Adam Driver, it's like we just welcomed him back after decades and he leaves just like that! Even though I love Star Wars but I hate how they kill off much lovable characters quite suddenly and surprisingly! The Skywalker family seem to have quite messed up members of their family tree, it's always never a happy ending with them haha!I know some people may prefer the prequels but honestly in my opinion, the Star Wars films will always be the same to me regardless if they have different stories or not, they are still honestly the best out there. I think I find this unique in my weird way lol. I am so looking forward to episode 8, roll onto 2017!",10,5,30,19 December 2015
Flight," Now whoever is a pilot, don't take illegal drugs!
","In the beginning, i thought this movie was really going to be boring and depressing, because all we are seeing is, a man taking drugs with a lot of women. However, the scene where the plane was going down and everyone was panicking, my eyes were glued to finding out what happened next. I was pretty shocked that a man who took bad drugs, was able to land a plane safely without killing everybody on board, except for the six victims who were unfortunately killed. This movie really reminded me of the dramatizations shown on Air Crash Investigation. I was so convinced, Denzel Washington's character was gonna tell his guilt to the court in the end of his drug taking. This movie really shows how pilots can be easily lead on taking drugs which can be dangerous for their health on harming themselves or others. If you are reading my review of this movie, please make sure to watch what you take and don't bloody fly the plane!",8,1,2,8 June 2016
A Night at the Roxbury," Changes I would make to the film.......
","Don't get me wrong, the playlist songs of the 1990's were so awesome in which I'm really glad whoever added them into this movie. But I just think the movie would've been better if they made Molly Shannon's character dress more disco then actually dressing up as a brunette Polly Pocket doll. It just doesn't suit her as an actress to play a girly girl in my opinion.With Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan, the only times they were hilarious enough was when they were dancing like goof-balls and trying to impress the ladies with their moves. However, I think their jokes weren't so funny really, it was like trying to think the joke then laughing at the joke straight away. I suppose this was before Will Ferrell became famous during his time in SNL.If you feel like dancing and don't bother with the comedy, I say just go for this!",5,0,3,19 April 2015
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Not my cup of tea....
","When i say it wasn't my cup of tea, i meant it wasn't a good film to look at. What really put me off was when Johnny Depps character got killed from Freddy Krueger, his death scene was absolutely stupid and ridiculous. The bed bloodbath scene just looked like a tornado of strawberry slushie in my opinion. Then what was even more lazy was that the character Glen didn't appear at all after the scene because it was stupidly cut and it made it too unrealistic. I know this isn't meant to be a realistic film but they should've added better quality and better props for this scene, it just looked wrong!As we skip to the ending, it shouldve been a better ending. I don't know why they had to destroy the ending of the film, it wasn't a twist, it was just dumb and revolting. They really needed to have the character Nancy just to go into the graves of her friends and leave it at that. Thanks a lot Robert Shaye for ruining that scene and I couldn't agree more with Wes Craven!Now for me after watching this film, I actually watched this at midnight and I honestly shouldn't have since it was so physiological that i honestly thought i felt scratches on my arm but really, it was just goosebumps haha! I honestly wouldn't consider this was the best movie i have seen because at the end of the day, it didn't give me that real feeling of horror in which i would like to have!",3,3,6,21 November 2015
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Very good and enjoyable!
","I have to tell ya, you would happen to unexpectedly like Bill & Ted regardless of their fake cool accents. They both actually reminded me of Shaggy in Scooby Doo. They just have the attitude, the behavior and the way they talk about absolute nonsense. The pair of them are funny. I'm also happy for them that they got their English chicks, it was rather unexpected but I'm delighted for them!I think the phone box was definitely copied from Doctor Who or Back to the future,it has like the same detail and idea of an actual time machine. It's really cool though.If you feel like you wanna be entertained, get down to watching this, it'll blow you away!",7,0,0,12 November 2015
Shall We Dance," cool movie!
",I found the movie really good. I have seen 'Arbitrage' recently with Gere and Sarandon so since this was their first time together in a movie. This movie is actually more cheesier than Abitrage because that movie was more realistic and very dark. Jennifer Lopez looked really gorgeous as usual and i seriously thought she was going to become a love interest for Gere. It gave me a feeling that they would be together in the end but ìt gave a twist that himself and Sarandon lived happily ever after! I was disappointed but Sarandon and Gere are a good movie couple anyways so I can't complain!Good movie I have to say!,8,0,0,23 July 2016
Deadpool," Brutal and fantastic at the same time!
","So i went to see this with my brother and his girlfriend tonight, i was extremely impressed! I was honestly looking forward to seeing this for months! I never had heard of Deadpool before in until it was announced that Ryan Reynolds will play as Deadpool. However i found out last night, he was playing as Deadpool in a X-Men movie way before the character was the main lead in his own movie! He also played the Green Lantern (who i don't really have interest in) so hes right to back away from getting a third role as another superhero figure!I really loved the humour, it was so cheesy, yet it can be pretty rough at the same time! I think Deadpool in my opinion, would be the best role model for people with cancer because, he is super confident and would make you laugh. It proves all the individuals who have the disease, are superheros and fight it like legends they really are!:)Hands down, this is the best marvel movie that i have seen in a long time!",10,7,18,12 February 2016
Click," Wish I could have the remote!
","I liked how in the movie gives you a feeling like if only you are able to control with no problems! Man, it would be bloody brilliant if I could be able to do that with my boring life! This is quite a good idea for a film but I wouldn't consider this the best I've seen of Adam Sandler's. It was good seeing Christopher Walken being the angel of death and making silly jokes. Well he is a legend after all!I wouldn't consider this film to be awarded an Oscar because again while it gives us a good of our lives, it just doesn't click with you even if the title says it all!",7,1,2,13 December 2015
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," The best gory vampire film ever!
","I have to say, this was the best collaboration with three great actors who are mostly the legends - Kirsten Dunst, Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise. Honestly I thought their acting skills were spot on even if they were just new from the spotlight. No wonder all three of them are so successful today! This movie came out days before I was born and lemme tell ya, they came a long long way!The movie was quite intense and sad because there was a lot of blood and killing but this is a real vampire movie folks. Although I have to add, Dracula was quite intense too! Anyways, I hated how Kirsten Dunsts character and the other actress who played her mother, were killed off by a light shinning whilst they were imprisoned. Seriously I cried at the scene, it felt so real!You have to see this film even if it's a horrific gory story!",8,1,1,22 July 2015
Aladdin," A wonderful movie 24 years later...
","I really couldn't understand why I never seen this movie properly before until tonight!, I mean, I honestly did grew up with the other well-known Disney ones like Cinderalla, The Little Mermaid, Mulan, Sleeping Beauty, Pochantas, etc but never Aladdin. I just didn't get around it at the time!Ah man,it's so depressing to think Robin Williams is not here with us now, it really made me sad by hearing his voice as the Genie. I loved how he impersonates celebrities including Jack Nicholson, Rodney Dangerfield, Carol Channing, and among the rest. He was such a brilliant actor and always be hailed as one of my childhood heroes out there!The artwork is beautiful, especially seeing the Castle at night, it looks so realistic! I loved Jasmine and Aladdin's relationship, they totally deserved each other right from the star! They are such an adorable couple like any other Disney couple out there in the world of Disney! The way they cuddled together and when they finally kissed, it made your heart pumping like mad! Wouldn't that be lovely if we all got that chance with love?! Why on earth did they give this sequels?! It would've been great if they left this alone! God, Hollywood is pure daft in ruining originals! Like all films, I'm sticking to this one, fair in square! Anyways, I can't wait to show this to my kids if I have any in the future. They would be totally happy to have seen this, it's enjoyable and magnificent!",10,2,4,30 January 2016
Me Before You," A very good sad romantic film!
","This was my first time ever to have seen Emila Clarke in a film. I still have to see Game of Thrones because she is such a brilliant actress! Also it was good to have seen Janet McTeer (Watched the Songcatcher recently), Matthew Lewis (Harry Potter) and Jenna Coleman (Doctor Who). You wouldn't suspect such a underrated cast like them would be appearing in this but, it was a great to know it actually happened! Anyways onto the movie, it was very good and no, I didn't cry as I thought I would.I liked Clarke's and Sam Claflin's chemistry throughout the movie. Although, I would've rather if they made Clarke's character more sympathetic when Claflins character announced he wants to die legally to Switzerland as he doesn't want to spend the rest of his life being sick, and handicapped. I felt they gave Clarke's character too over the top, she should've been acting more caller. It's not Emila Clarke's fault but the way the character was developed, was a little bit ridiculous to be honest...That's just only my criticism to this movie but other than that, it is really flattering to watch and even though it's sad, it gives you that feeling of hoping for the best with your own loved ones! Thats how I've seen it but other people may have a different opinion when they do get a chance to look at it! I give this movie a 8/10 because of its good actors, story line, the settings and of course, giving you a great amount of emotions!",8,2,3,5 July 2016
The Breakfast Club," Weird, unexpected, depressing and romantic!
","I just can't think of the words properly to describe this movie. Firstly, they all didn't get along by saying nasty things to each other and John Bender being such a complete dope to them all especially that teacher who was supervising them. Then the five of them were getting high and dancing all over the place with 80's songs playing in the background like lunatics! Finally at the end, they get all lovey dovey with this order emo girl/jock and prep girl/bad boy. Good mix but it was very unexpected from a teenage film like this! I wouldn't call this film 'The Breakfast Club', I would call it the 'Bad Teen Club'. I'm serious, the name sounds cheesy but I suppose interesting at the same time. I did enjoy it but I felt a lot of mixed vibes while watching this movie!",8,7,10,23 November 2015
Donnie Darko," A very interesting horror film..
","Jake Gyllenhaal's character Danny Darko was the most interesting character I've seen ever on any movie I think. You don't know what he will do next and you can honestly feel your heart pounding because it is meant to be frightening but it's so bloody good!It was funny how Jake Gyllenhaal and Maggie Gyllenhaal teamed up as actual siblings for real to bring this team-ship into this film. I say they loved telling how they couldn't stand each other and just fight like what normal siblings would do! I'm sure they got on fine really since it is part of the job like!So thanks to this film, I wouldn't have heard of Watership down even though it is a very sad film like this. I'm guessing they added that film in was because it influences Frank so much. I suppose you can say that alright! I honestly loved Jake Gyllenhaal as Danny Darko, he was always awesome at playing compassionate roles throughout the film industry. No wonder he's likable! Very good job he has done!",9,0,2,10 September 2015
The Great Gatsby," A good colourful film with Leonardo DiCaprio!
","I swear, this movie was just really colourful and at the same time, it was rather sad. The saddest parts I experienced the most while watching this were Gatby's lover is already married to somebody else and the fact, in the end, we see him being killed by the husband of the woman who got runned down by Gatsby's lover and him killing himself after killing Gatsby! I swear, Gatsby's lover was such a coward for not saying it was her, its like she didn't want to be arsed in getting involved. I mean she might as well blamed Gatsby for this instead of her. I couldn't even believe that she didn't even say a proper goodbye to him at his funeral, that was pure cold and mean! Seriously, Gatsby was wasting his time with her, it pretty much was too late that Tom got there first to marrying her! I absouletely love the acting, the colours, the scenes and the storyline even if it was sad! I give this a 8/10!",8,1,2,5 March 2017
Warm Bodies," Good with Nicholas Hoult in this!
","I thought this film with Nicholas Hoult in this was really good. Jaysus he really can do a killer American accent that no other British actor can do perfectly!! I felt like the zombies in this really do represent the ones that you see on action video games or action movies. However, there's not much blood or gore in this like yeah its suppose to be a romantic horror movie but there is very little. All you can see is Hoult's character eating his love interest's boyfriends brain but that's pretty much it like!Its a pretty good movie, not my favorite or would consider it the best, but its grand to watch when you have time to kill! Happy Halloween folks!",8,0,1,31 October 2016
The Birds," I'll never look at birds the same way again!
","I swear, this movie can put you off owning a bird or even seeing one. Although I knew well that birds are harmless, well some of the bird family like the swan for example, can attack or hiss at you if you ever come across their path. They are still beautiful creatures though, I love Swans! Anyways let's talk about the movie, I thought Tippi Hedren was such a great actress in this! It was astonishing to think her granddaughter is Dakota Johnson and the mother of Melanie Griffith. I honestly never knew that but to be fair, I think Tippi Hedren is more prettier than her daughter and her granddaughter in my opinion! The movie was pretty scary, you are absolutely cringing when they look at their characters like they are food and when they start attack them, you instantly get a jump scare every time and thinking everyone's gonna die. I gotta admit when the neighbor got killed and you can unfortunately see that his eyes were gone. Jaysus, I thought that was the most horrifying scene that I've ever saw in any horror movie! Also when the school children had to run away from them, I nearly was gonna get a heart attack. Thank Christ this ain't real but it seemed surreal to me!It's too bad that we can't find out why the birds stopped harming them or even see Melanie been treated with care and telling her story! Hitchcock should've left the scene where they were trying to get away from the birds by driving onto the Golden Bridge! That's just only my complaint about the film, the rest was brilliant.This is one of Hitchocks best films yet! I give this a 8/10!",8,0,1,19 June 2016
Sully," Tom Hanks did a good job at playing Sully!
","I remember that time when it was on the news in 2009 and at aged 15, I wasn't slightly a bit interested in the fiasco.Even if you haven't a clue on airplane terms that pilots would normally use, this movie still makes ya feel interested on what really happened on that day. I'm sure the city of New York was absolutely relieved that there wasn't another terrorist attack 8 years later and that 155 passengers including the pilots and crew, were all alive and well!Lads watch this film, its a pretty well done biopic film that you don't wanna miss out on!",8,0,0,24 April 2019
Princess Mononoke," Brutal but a very good film...
","Honestly, I have never seen an anime film with so much blood,gore and killing in my life. It was very brutal to see heads chopped off and of course more then one killing happening! I say this must've been the most violent cartoon that ever came on screens in 1997! The storyline was pretty good and of course, the graphics were too. I was very surprised to have found out the film was inspired by the Zelda series because of some scenes that honestly looked like it came from the video game! I suppose especially the Legend of Zelda also! The music felt very much like you were there and it pretty much draws you in cause it feels so good!I honestly thought Son and Ashitaka were just an adorable couple, why didn't they kiss at the end?! Seriously he saved her life and she just wanted to go back to the forest. C'mon!Anyways a very good film but I wouldn't show this to kids due to the scary and gory scene's!",9,2,3,6 September 2015
Beetlejuice," Funny Halloween movie!
","You wouldn't think Michael Keaton was himself as Beetlejuice because of the daft behavior and the things he says are like so inappropriate! Maybe Batman does have a dirty mind after all haha! No seriously he was great like you still wouldn't think it's him as Beetle juice! It was pretty enjoyable and funny, I didn't find it that scary but kids could possibly be freaked out with the couple trying to scare the family away in order to get back to their own house! Winona Ryder looked really beautiful with her Gothic looks, it reminds me of her being Mina Murray in Dracula (1992). Even the red dress looked beautiful on her! If you haven't seen this, watch it on Halloween, it'll make you laugh then scream!",8,0,0,25 October 2015
All the President's Men," It glues you in regardless if you weren't there when the Watergate Scandal happened!
","I was recommended from a classmate that I should watch it since I've never seen it nor heard of it before. A few days ago, i got to finally watch it. My god, Dustin Hoffman looked so different with his long boyish hair. I'm more use to him having short hair in his later years. Himself and Robert Redford were absolutely brilliant together. They really should've done more movies with each other, it would make more sense!In relation to this movie, it really opens your eyes of how Richard Nixon was such a crook. Sure every poliction you meet is a greedy crook anyway so he ain't the only one in that sense! The case really interests you as in how everything went bellyup and out of control. The real Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward didn't have an easy life in their careers. They pretty much had like a rough time to get the information that needed from Nixons people to be on the Washington Post. At the same time, they are well capable men and they knew well what to do in order to get Nixon and his crooners down. Seriously, even if its a long movie, you would enjoy watching it if you were in a politic mood!",8,2,2,6 May 2016
The Martian," Really good movie but long enough!
","The reason why I got to watch this movie was because my family really wanted to see it badly so I decided to join them! I usually don't watch Astronaut movies since the disappointment of unfortunately watching the film 'Gravity' with George Clooney and Sandra Bullock. Even I rarely watch movies with Matt Damon in them so this has to be the proper movie I've entirely began concentrating on. It was interesting to see how Damon's character to have survived in a planet with thin air. Like Christ, thank god I'm not an astronaut because I wouldn't want to go explore space in case anything could happen. Omg the scene where the first rocket trying to rescue Mark was blown up and it honestly terrified me. I don't know how these people would be so brave, I'm more afraid of getting killed then worrying about space! I'm glad NASA managed to rescue Mark from Mars and that everything was happily ever after! What a nice ending for a very intense story. Although the only disappointment was that the movie was long enough. Some bits bored me but the whole movie would keep you interested to find out what happens yknow! I definitely would consider this as Damon's best film projects hes ever done. I give this movie 8/10!",8,2,4,27 August 2016
Evil Dead II," Another waste of time movie.....
","So as you might have seen my review on the first Evil Dead movie, I have wasted yet my time on the sequel. Why the hell would they make another one of this?! It is just so stupid and embarrassing to look at!It's the same story, demons trying to kill the humans from the cabin they are staying in and suddenly, the characters get killed off one by one. Seriously the storyline like the first movie, is the worst description of a horror movie! I wish the Evil Dead movies didn't exist because, some people I know really liked the films so you kinda have to put with them in saying how great it is. It's not actually!I did however, liked Army of Darkness! It is way funnier, sexier and brilliant than this! Check out my review on that too!",1,1,7,6 February 2016
The Godfather," It's great but would've been 10 times better if it wasn't so long!
","I have to admit, this is a pretty great movie but, it's way too long for a great movie like this. I absolutely would love if this was only two hours and not three, I think it gave enough detail on what's happening of the dynasty. Marlon Brando was very much excellent at playing as the Godfather. I loved his quote 'I'll make an offer that you can't refuse', it sounds class and like a boss. He's such a serious legend like, he actually does look pretty young to play as the Godfather, especially all the make - up and other stuff that had to be put on his face. I say it was very oily on the skin lol! I think this movie deserved 3 Oscars but I wouldn't consider it to be that serious since the length of the film was way too long! At least I finally got to see it, 43 years later!",7,0,1,16 January 2016
