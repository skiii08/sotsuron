Conquest 1453," Shame!
","It's not quiet a great movie, regarding the history facts. This movie was made only for Turkish community. I was fine till I saw how brave the sultan was illustrated by a XI century director, and that made me angry and I stopped watching. My people had to pay tribute, yearly, in gold and first born male children for almost 400 years to those criminals, and I cannot pass this fact that easy. It's like I was a native American watching the courageous acts of 'the almighty US nation', shown in Hollywood movies. This is not worth watching for some nation that had to suffer from that fake fame and glory. I thought Turkish state of mind was changed, but I was so wrong.",3,34,63,11 September 2012
