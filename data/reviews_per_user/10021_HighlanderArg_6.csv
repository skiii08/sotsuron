Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Perhaps it's me
","Perhaps has SPOILERS!!!!!I don't know. Perhaps it's me and this movie is awesome, but honestly, I found it weak. I won't bash Tarantino because this is the first (I count both KB1 & 2 as a sole film) film I've seen of him and that would not be fair.First of all, why in hell I find most of the performances thoroughly forced? I don't believe Uma at all. Carradine... his lines were well, but please don't even dare making another 'fight' scene like that (come on, you were better even in 'Future Force'!). On the other hand, both Michael Madsen and specially Daryl Hannah (thank you dear, you looked and performed much better than in 'The Job') rob this film. Straight into what the film is, the first volume was excessively violent, somewhat bizarre, and I called it (in my 'The Job' comment) a 'fun crap'. this second one explores the inner side of The Bride, and all comes to an end in a long, dull, and boring way. To sum up, it's the proof of what happens when an American director tries to make a martial arts film like the Asian ones. Any Jet Li or Bruce Lee film can run rings around it.4/10",4,3,6,13 October 2004
Blade II," Mmmm... I think The Law Of The Sequels apply here...
","There's an unwritten Law Of The Sequels that goes (more or less) like this : 'Seldom shall a sequel be as good, let alone better, as the first film.' This has its exceptions ('Batman', 'Superman), and tons of examples, such as 'Highlander', 'Mortal Kombat'... and 'Blade'.The movie takes up two years after the first film. It turns out that Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) did not die when he shot himself, and Blade goes out to the rescue, in order to bring him back to humanity. However, the good old man is only a bait for some vampires to propose a truce to Blade. Why? they need him to bring down an evolved way of vampires that feeds on both humans and vampires.I never actually read a single comic book of 'Blade'. Perhaps the movie goes strictly as the comic and I'm b******tting it, but not doing it consciously, I will continue. I like watching vampire movies, and the concept of an evolved vampire is interesting, but when the creature looks like the son of Nosferatu (the original 1929 film) and Predator, I'm disappointed. Even more when I see Blade uttering things like 'Oooh, how exciting', or having a romantic interest.The movie also features lots of martial arts, some done by Wesley Snipes, other by CGI, and other by a stunt surely. A good thing is the cameo Donnie Yen plays. Unfortunately, it's too short and he only kicks butts once. The rest of the cast has Ron Perlman ('Hellboy'), the above mentioned Kristofferson and Yen , and large load of people I don't know.In short, it has martial arts, action, but the story (and some performances) is weak. To put it otherwise, reminds me of 'Van Helsing'. You watch it to have fun, vampire fan or not.5/10",5,3,7,6 April 2005
Pitch Black," I think I am going to puke....
","'Pitch Black' was on TV. Cool, I will have a sample of what the newest Riddick film is about. After seeing this, definitely, I am not renting it.The story is basically like this: a ship carrying a top-security prisoner (guess who?) somehow falls on a deserted planet, and soon is cornered by creatures who live in the dark and like to eat flesh. Oh, how scary! The movie in itself is FX. The rest is a ripoff of 'Red Planet' (but without Carrie Anne Moss walking out of the shower), 'Star Wars' and 'Men In Black' (the creatures...), and some dreadful b-sci-fi movies.Diesel pulls out some sort of Dom (the guy he played in 'Fast & FUrious'), while the rest of the cast spend their time trying to justify their being in this film.I never thought a movie would deserve a 1. There's something always worth remarking. Well, it's not enough with FX, and the movie is too sorely bad. COnclussion: 1/10",1,4,11,25 January 2005
Van Helsing," High-budget 'Beowulf'
","SPOILERS MARKED BELOW!The movie is not that bad in itself. We have an amnesic VAn Helsing (not Abraham, this one's called Gabriel) who goes after Dracula, to protect a gypsy girl from the Lord of the Night. We have fun, the scenery is slightly impressive, KAte Beckinsale is hoooooot, but... somewhat lacks originality.Right from the start, we have VH hunting Mr.Hyde in France. First ripoff here: 'The League of xtraordinary gentlemen'. Unfortunately, the writer of this also forgot to read Stevenson's book. Hyde is small and grunty, not a hulk. But of course, VH is also hunted, by the local police (I recall... 'The Punisher').Back to his quarters (in the Vatican), he is sent after Dracula. Suddenly, he is faced by the Italian 1800-ish version of Q (James Bond's weapon provider). But the worst is... not only it took stuff from such films, 'Van Helsing' also has a character who walks around crammed with weapons... like 'Beowulf' (yes, the highly criticised Christopher Lambert's version). It's too similar a film to that one, except that there's no 'Mortal Kombat' feeling, and the FX are way better.In short, something fun to waste a bit more than 2 hours of your life.5/10NOW COMES THE SPOILER! (You were warned!)Another creepy copy is the final battle... 'Mortal Kombat Annihilation' with good CGI!",5,1,2,23 November 2004
Dark City," Another one that makes the MAtrix fade...
","'Dark City' is a weird movie. Strange. It's some sort of sci-fi. The cast is headed by RUfus Sewell, and features Kiefer 'Jack Bauer' Sutherland, Jenniffer Connelly, and William Hurt. It is specially the two men aforementioned that I was surprised of seeing in a movie like this.The director is Alex Proyas, a guy who gave us 'I, Robot' and 'The Crow 3'. As in the last one, the ambient of the movie is dark. There is no sun, and some strange human-like creatures (I don't recall the name!) control people at will. Sewell sorts of escapes their control and is alone against everyone.This movie has just joined 'Nirvana' in the group of 'better-than-the-Matrix' films, providing an original script, and not a 'Terminator V' would-be. THe FX are a whole different thing. Visually impressive, this movie kicks ass, and tarnishes even more the supposed originality of 'THe Matrix'.9/10",9,1,4,25 January 2005
Reservoir Dogs," Disappointed
","I had heard tons of good reviews of this movie so I said 'Why not?'. I was thoroughly disappointed at this. I had said not very good things about 'Kill Bill' but compared to this, that's a great film!By what it seemed to me, i should give it an 0/10. However there are two reasons why I give it a 2. One point is thanks to the first scene, a conversation about the connotation of 'Like a virgin'. The other is the scene where Michael Madsen (Mr. Blonde?) is torturing a guy. He makes it very funnily.For the rest, I have no desire now to watch 'Pulp Fiction', or 'Jackie Brown' and when needing action, I'll just pick a John Woo film, or simply watch 'Mean Guns' again (years go by, and it's still my favourite American action film)2/10",2,7,17,3 December 2004
