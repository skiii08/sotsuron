Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," One laugh - All through the movie
","I must begin by saying this is the funniest movie made this year. Especially the first 30 minutes of the movie was hilarious, I just couldn't stop laughing. Of course I had great expectations on this movie since you had heard so much about it, but this movie was also excellent. It didn't get better the further it got but although you laughed through the whole movie. The problem with a movie like this is of course that it's basically made for people aged 25 or below. And that's why I got surprised when I saw it's in the 160th place of the top rated movies. And it's a new movie which means that it will gain positions in that list. I highly recommend this movie for all people below 25... for the rest of you: Don't see it so we don't have to read that you thought this was a disaster, because we know it wasn't!!",10,1,18,14 November 2006
The Butterfly Effect," Kutcher is great!!
","What makes a great movie great?? Most often it's the different idea that the director has come up with combined with great acting that makes movies great.This movie is not a common Hollywood story, written to make money. This is a deep story that the director has spent some time with. Kutcher is astonishingly great in this movie where he plays Evan Treborn, a little kid who every now and then get blackouts (most often when something exciting happens). To remember as much as possible he writes diary. Evan grows up and one day when he's on his room at college, he finds his old diaries under his bed. When he starts reading them he realizes that he travels back in time to the place that he's reading about. To get to know more about these strange memories he look up his best childhood friend, kayleigh. Kayleigh's life is ruined since her daddy terrorized her in her childhood. When Evan comes and reminds her of all the things she has tried to forget she commits suicide. Evan realizes that he has to travel back in time so he can make Kayleigh live again, but what he doesn't know is that everything he does affects all the other people that he knows too. What should he do? According to me, this is absolutely a top-10 of the best movies ever made. It's extremely different from many other good movies and the great acting by Ashton Kutcher and Amy Smart doesn't make the movie worse. It's of course 10 out of 10 for Kutcher's best movie ever.",10,0,1,31 August 2006
Life Is Beautiful," Asstonishingly acting!!
","I had no expectations at all when I saw this movie the first time, I mean foreign movies from southern europe tend to be mostly crap according to me. But what I first realized was that the acting of Roberto Bengini was outstanding. He seemed so real and at the same time he was incredibly funny. The movie is about him meeting the love of his life, Dora, and they get married and get a child Giosu√©. It's then the late 30's and since Guido is Jewish he and his son is transported to a concentration camp. Since his wife doesn't want to leave him she goes there too. Guido doesn't want to frighten his son and says that it's a competition where the winner will get a tank. Now he has to act like it's fine and that nothing's wrong. This is the best foreign movie I've ever seen and it's at least top-10 of all the movies I've seen. As I said Bengini's acting is outstanding and that he's the writer and the producer of the movie just makes the success of the movie more amazing. If you haven't seen this movie, I can assure you that you've missed something great. This is a masterpiece!!",10,1,4,16 August 2006
