The Avengers," The new team of Avengers are assembled in order to defeat the villain Loki so he does not destroy the planet.
","Marvels The Avengers, or commonly known as The Avengers is an action packed film based on a combination of a series of superhero movies that were all produced by Marvels. The Avengers are an assembly of heroes including Ironman played by Robert Downey Jr., Thor played by Chris Hemsworth, The Incredible Hulk played by Mark Ruffalo, and Captain America played by Chris Evans. After an unexpected enemy begins to threaten the security of the world, Nick Fury, played by Samuel L. Jackson, and his partner, played by Scarlett Johansson, gathers these heroes in order to try to provide peace from the enemy and save the world from crumbling. Though this movie was slow to develop and seemed to drag on at parts through the introduction, the action picks up as the movie proceeds with a well-developed cohesion of parts by the conclusion of the film.The introduction to this movie developed at a seemingly never ending pace. I did not agree with how it seemed to drag out but I sympathize with the director. This had to be done though in order to portray the plot of uniting these heroes and showing the initial skirmishes of the heroes as they met each other. As the heroes began to get along and unite as a team, the development of the film began to become more tightly knit. The characters grew together, starting as people who barely knew each other to fighting side by side against their enemy. With the combination of all the well-known actors in this movie, no one seemed to steal the show or become power hungry for the leading role in the movie. As the film developed, all of the actors sunk into their roles and adapted to their part and the other parts around them gracefully. The cohesion of the film was as well-developed and original as it could be. The Ironman series, Captain America, Hulk, and Thor have already been produced as films by Marvel and in comic books in previous years. This led to a unique and different production by taking all those different films and seamlessly integrated them into one piece. This made for an action based film with the right amount of humor to make it amusing and appealing to the audience.The cinematography and the setting in the film also added to the cohesion of the piece as a whole. The setting was based out of Cleveland but was made to represent New York, with Stark's tower set up to be in the center of the New York City skyline. The real credit should be given to the cinematography of the film which made the film come alive. We as the audience feel like we are right there fighting side by side with the heroes, helping to take down the enemy at hand. In its entirety this piece really captured my attention and left me waiting for more after every scene. Although this film seemed to drag on at the beginning, it ended up being well developed and action packed which kept me wanting more. Along with the cohesion of this piece came a quite original development as the director meshed the different parts and characters together. This allowed them to fight alongside each other to try to save the world from destruction. You will have to watch to find out what happens as the fate of the world is left up to the new team of Avengers.",7,0,1,17 February 2014
