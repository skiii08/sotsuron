The Blair Witch Project," You'll love it or hate it.
","Two types will see this film. The type who can suspend disbelief and become a part of the film, and those who buy into the hype and expect to see the scariest movie ever made. The entire premise of this film is played to the hilt. The director's gave us a complicated yet simple film that forces the viewer to participate to make it real. Let me say that it is very easy to sit down and watch this film without feeling a single emotion (other than boredom). But let me also point out that watching this film in the right attitude can lead to one of the most heart pounding rides of the last twenty years. If you're anticipating the thrill ride, you may be disappointed. If you're expecting a yawner, you may be shocked. Blair Witch Project will be one of those films, like David Lynch's 'Eraserhead', that you either love or you hate. Go see it once to find out how you feel, it's only $8.00. (And it may be the scariest movie you've ever seen!!)",Null,1,2,17 August 1999
