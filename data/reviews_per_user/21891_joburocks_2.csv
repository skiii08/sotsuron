The New World," Wow what a piece of,,,
","Not going to even spend the time on words. The movie lacked in everything but cinematography, and even that was ruined by the dodgy editing.Looks like my review needs to be longer. OK lets talk about the extreme close ups on random faces wtf? The awkwardness of bad actors or extras from the look of it in random places clearly with no direction of any kind on what to do in the shots. It was like the person in the forefront of the scene was supposed to be focused on but being there was no content to what they were doing, you start to focus on whats going on in the background and no one has a clue.That should be the 10 lines I needed to say don't watch this.",3,0,2,17 January 2011
Hero," Winner! Masterpiece!
","First off Quentin Tarantino only presents the movie and did not have anything to do with directing, writing or filming! Now that that is clear I give this a 10/10 rating. Brilliant. If you like cinematography this is incredible. Every shot must have been beautifully planned and painted out before they put a camera to it. The storyline is timed well. God, I needed a good movie like this, its been such a long time. It has a story and action scenes similar to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon with the feeling of 'What Dreams May Come' starring Robin Williams. Anyhow if you haven't seen it yet go get a copy and if you cant find one steal one from a friend...its good stuff!",10,2,3,21 January 2005
