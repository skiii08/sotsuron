Requiem for a Dream," excellent, if exaggerated, look at addiction
","'Requiem for a Dream' is quite a powerful message film.  It tells the story of four major characters all with some form of an addiction; whether it be to heroin, cocaine or diet pills.  It builds up and glamorizes the stories of the characters, making you care for them, and then proceeds to flush their lives down the toilet.  Arnofsky's sophomore effort is overstylized and snazzy, but it's good to see that he has talent in his style.  The faults?  The script is rather unsensational, the acting is good enough but never as good as it could have been.  And the stories sometimes seem too exaggerated (Mrs. Goldfarb comes to mind) in order to make a point.  Often attempts at subjectivity seem overblown.  But other than that, the film is excellent and sometimes exceptional.  I don't think that I've ever seen such a harrowing, disturbing film.  Even when you think you can't stand to watch, you are always compelled to.  Arnofsky's style is awesome: original and effective in creating the tone for the film.  Another big plus--the score is fabulous and evocative, especially in the final montage of the characters' fates.  I don't think that the film is deserving of the NC-17 rating (or the adults only policy being enforced) like some other films which deserve it, since a powerful lesson is to be learned from 'Requiem'.  I don't see how anyone could want to use cocaine or heroin or anything like that after viewing this film. By the way, as powerful and excellent as 'Requiem for a Dream' is, I have no plans to see it again; that would be somewhat masochistic.  It's so depressing and disturbing, I could never subject myself to it again.  Very very powerful, and incredibly worth seeing...once.9/10",Null,0,0,15 December 2000
Unbreakable," quite a film
","Shyamalan's 'Unbreakable', from what I've seen, has people divided on their opinions.  You'll either love it or hate it.  Well, as subjectively as possible -- I recognize the major flaws that lie within the film -- but I couldn't help but be entranced by its hypnotic powers.  I loved it.  Hell, the film is a knock-off of Shyamalan's previous 'The Sixth Sense'.  And it's cold and unconvincing at its core.  It's also really slow and plodding, and perhaps too subtle and understated for most.  But it doesn't matter to me. I loved its subtleties, its slow pace.  It really lingers in your head for days after you see it.  There are some seriously classic scenes within that were soooo well done and soooo effective.  The end may seem like a quick shock, a cheap trick to some -- I loved it.  I hope they don't make sequels to it like I've heard -- it ended on a perfect note.  I could go on and on...but bottom line, I really loved it's subtle power and tone.I gave it an 8/10",8,1,1,25 November 2000
12 Monkeys," Good Film, Great Ending
","The most important act in any movie is the third act.  It leaves the audience with their final impressions of the film, and it ties everything together that the film has been building up to.  There are many decent thrillers that have awful third acts; hence the whole movie is tainted and the audience leaves with a bad view of the film.  '12 Monkeys' is not one of those films.  The beginning and middle of '12 Monkeys' are satisfactory, but not great.  It is in the last 20 or 30 minutes that the film picks up pace and begins to tie everything together.  The script is very sparse with details -- which leaves many in a state of confusion during most of the movie.  But in the end, when you begin to piece everything together, the film becomes amazingly good.  I would have to say the last five to ten minutes of the film contains the best ending/payoff that I have ever witnessed (much better than that other Bruce Willis film, 'The Sixth Sense').  The concept behind the scene at the end that ties everything together is completely trippy, and very original and thought-provoking. Without the incredible third act, I probably wouldn't have liked this film as much as I did. Highly Recommended.",Null,0,0,27 April 2000
Dead Poets Society," one of the most overrated films ever made (spoiler warning)...
","Yep, you heard me right.Sorry to burst the bubble of the Academy and the viewing public, but 'Dead Poets Society' is not a good film.  At all.Everything about it is wrong.  WRONG.  Williams is supposed to instill a love for poetry in his students.  All I saw instilled was a love for him. The dead poets society, as it is called, prances around in the middle of the night like fools, reciting poetry and acting all around weird.  I didn't feel any meaning in this, other than a director's weak attempt to portray students who love poetry without having any idea how to do so. 
The story is about as syrupy and unsensational as it gets.  The screenplay won an Academy Award??? Further proof that awards don't make films good.  I remember multiple scenes which made me cringe out of disgust. 
A boy kills himself because his father won't let him pursue his acting dreams?  Give me a break!  If I buy that one, you guys must have some bridges to sell me...Ivy League students stand on their desks, reciting Whitman, when their beloved teacher is fired.  I've got a Yorkshire Terrier here that could devise a slightly less ridiculous and pretentious ending for you.Inspiring?  'Dead Poets Society' is a film with no understanding of itself or its meaning, yet it dares to hide behind the veil of inspiration. 
It's like a house built on a landfill--bearable, perhaps interesting at first, but once you begin to dig, all there is to find is garbage.2/10but hey, that's just my $.02",Null,1,4,2 February 2001
Forrest Gump," (spoiler warning) Forrest and Forrest Jr. should get a blood test...
","...because when you have unprotected sex with an HIV positive woman, and that woman has a child, you run a sort of, well, 'high risk' of receiving HIV (especially Forrest Jr).  I guess 'Jennay' forgot to tell that to Forrest before she died.  GET TESTED, FORREST, and RUN!I don't mean to be abrasive, but after a second viewing of 'Forrest Gump,' I noticed this glaring omission.  Yes, it is the 1980s, so much less was known about the disease, but the filmmakers should have included something to let the audience know whether the Gump family would share the same fate as Jenny.  To me, this is a giant hole in the film, and one that needed to be addressed.And regarding the film itself...Personally, I'm in the middle; I don't love or hate 'Forrest Gump.'  The fact that it is overrated drove many to an extreme dislike for the film, yet some feel it is a masterwork.  To me, it is neither terrible or great.  It is a pretty good movie--enjoyable and humorous, but it is sometimes sappy, sentimental and contrived.  Some portions are great and some are poor.  In the end, the good outweighed the bad slightly, and I came away satisfied but not totally pleased.  Zemeckis has made better films (try 'Back to the Future,' 'Contact,' and even 'Cast Away'), and so has Hanks.I recommend 'Forrest Gump' marginally because it has a good heart and a good, interesting story...but it also has its fair share of flaws.  'Pulp Fiction' and especially 'The Shawshank Redemption' deserved the Academy Awards, but oh well...don't complain over something so trivial...awards don't mean THAT much.'Forrest Gump' can have a 7/10 from me.",Null,4,8,4 April 2001
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," My favorite action film...
","Sure, you may consider it to be science fiction, but it's not.  'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' is an action film in every sense of the word, for it delivers on the one promise that most action films don't: ACTION. 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' has the most intense and audacious action sequences ever filmed.  Character development and plot exists too, although it is in a rather raw form.  The characters and plot are there only to give support to the action, and for that sense, the support is strong.  The film actually spends a large amount of time on it's characters and plot, but whenever there is too much, another jaw-dropping action scene comes along to save the day.  Note the helicopter and tanker chases on the freeways: if there has ever been a more stunning pursuit sequence ever filmed, please let me know.  Whoever thinks that violence cannot be beautiful has not seen this film.  The T1000, the villain, is superb--strong and intimidating--every film of this genre needs a good villain, for a good villain makes a good hero.  Ah-nuld, this time the hero, has never been cooler.  This was his peak, and he will never come close to making a film of this caliber ever again.Enough already: just sit down, ignore the paradoxes, immerse yourself in the action, and enjoy the most stunning 2 and 1/2 hour waste of $100 million bucks you'll ever see.9.5/10btw, the DVD version is the medium this film needs to be seen on.",Null,1,1,30 December 2000
The Nightmare Before Christmas," WOW!
","'The Nightmare Before Christmas,' for me, is one of those films that is beyond any criticism whatsoever.  To me, it is art in the truest sense of the word.  It is the best modern musical I've seen, the best animated film I've ever seen, and one of the best films I've ever seen.  Tim Burton, the postmodern German expressionist, has carved a devilishly beautiful film out of his twisted little head.  He didn't direct or write the script, unlike everyone thinks, so just as much credit is due to those who did.  Every frame in this film is a painting.  It's a shame that this film isn't on the Top 250 list (let alone the top 10)--if any film deserves to be, this is it. The art (perhaps a modern manifesto of German expressionism), the direction, Danny Elfman's musical numbers (notice the throwback to 'Singin' in the Rain' when Jack jumps on the bench in the snowy graveyard) are all sooo well done.  It is as close to a perfect entertainment as any film can come and can be watched over and over and over again.  I cannot recommend it highly enough.  If you haven't seen it, it is a must.9.5/10 (my highest rating, I don't believe in 'tens.'  Don't ask.)",Null,1,2,30 December 2000
The Mummy Returns," $70 Million?! (minor, minor spoilers)
","Wow, THE MUMMY RETURNS now holds the record for best non-holiday opening whatever weekend ever!Is this an example of what is wrong with movies today?  I'll leave that for you to decide.But now that the film is in theaters, let's make it known to the masses that the script is aimless, the action is exhausting and relentless, and the dialogue, well...Nevermind.  Who cares, right?  It doesn't matter that the film lacks substance, because we are just going to see the special effects anyway!So let's talk about the special effects.Well, they stink, frankly.  The FINAL FANTASY reject lobster referred to as the Scorpion King is really quite pathetic.  But no, wait, we are also treated to these little Pygmy-mummies that move at a dizzyingly fast speed, a speed that prevents us from really focusing on them.  After a while, I honestly had to look away--the creations are so terribly rendered, I just couldn't take it.  Wait!  One more, I must.  In the middle, an evil mummy summons the Nile to rise up and chase after our heroes in their dirgible. Cool idea, but the 'water effect' is laughable.If those three examples aren't enough, rest assured that there are a hundred others where they came from.  I just don't have time or space to mention them all.Dammit, if there are 100 million or so dollars spent on effects, I sure as hell would like to see that money on-screen.  Otherwise, save the money!My friends tell me that I'm too critical.  'You've gotta leave your brain at the door, sit back and just watch it.'  And so I did.  I've 'forgotten' that the dialogue is terrible and the pace is a mess. I've 'forgotten' it all.If this is a movie about special effects...well the special effects are arguably the worst part.  So there.I really want studios to reexamine their priorities in effects films.  This whole CG overkill that has come about with TITANIC and THE PHANTOM MENACE and GLADIATOR has gotten way out of hand.  It's NOT REAL!  And it's NOT EVEN BELIEVABLE!  Bring back ANIMATRONICS!  Bring back some form of suspension of disbelief to the cinema.  CG is just not the same.  Make me, if only for a second, believe that I'm watching ancient armies collide in the desert. Make me try to believe that there is a giant Man-Scorpion standing in front of me.  Please pretend that there is some form of intelligence in the audience.  I'm not saying to get rid of CG (it's a great and sometimes necessary invention), but just remember, when you're filming those giant battles: nothing beats the real thing.Oh well, that's a whole other story.But it's really the least they should have done with this 100 million dollar goose egg.",3,0,0,8 May 2001
