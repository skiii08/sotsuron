10 Cloverfield Lane," So not worth the score of 8 (Tip for not familiar with Cloverfield audience: Don't watch it)
","So I was pretty excited to watch this as I was really a fan for movies with minimal budget and cast, playing in a secret locked room or something. They could always surprise you with the narrative and acting. What can I say? This movie successfully 'achieved' both of that. I didn't watch the first Cloverfield movie, which turned out to be a huge mistake. So here, my review, is also a tip for anyone who didn't know any of Cloverfield story style. I was not planning to write any spoilers because I was a fan of thrillers and hated to be ruined by spoilers. But I was too mad to write anything if I didn't mention the plot. So here you are.This movie was so clever (like a roller coaster, you never get bored, quoted from other reviews) right before Howard killed Emmett. The opening was quite special and unusual which was a good thing. The sound was good, I literally got scared when the car accident happened. The acting was amazing, even include the miserable lady from outside, really dragged me into this situation. I kept wondering if Howard had some daughter-issue (so he 'kept' Michelle like a pet or something?) And actually Emmett was with Howard to help convince Michelle that outside world was a mess. When the killing happened, I was like, oh okay, so Emmett was not a bad guy, there must be some explanations for it, fair enough. I mean, seriously, how RARE to see a clever leading female character in such movies instead of ruining everything or blaming innocent!! But everything just went so wrong. Here came the consequences where I didn't search what the first Cloverfield movies was about. Suddenly there was a real, literally, real monster, should be aliens, came from nowhere. And such a huge special effect work, was being destroyed by Michelle, with a wine bottle, and a few matches.Seriously? So you spent almost 2 hours to deal with Howard, and now you took down the alien army in 5 minutes? Why you guys who gave an 8 out of 10 could stand that???I was still holding some nonsense hope.First when Michelle's skin was exposed to the air, I was thinking like, oh she couldn't breathe, and next shot would be she woke up in a hospital bed, being told it was just she believed Howard's lie deeply in her mind, and with everything explained. OK of course it didn't happen. And secondly, when she got the radio working after she drove away a little bit, I was wondering, could it all be her illusion? She just got into some infinite circle, like a typical highway mystery? No, nothing! It's just a real alien attack. So why Howard was lying about the daughter thing? Why everything he said just so ambiguous and suspicious? Being an audience who was not familiar with Cloverfield's monster/alien thing, but really into movies like Mulholland Drive, Triangle, Identity, and even Buried, The Night Chronicles, this movie was just so not worth an 8/10 (for now on IMDb). Why you have the budget to make such huge alien army, but not even trying to give a few more location settings or actors?",4,1,4,18 March 2016
