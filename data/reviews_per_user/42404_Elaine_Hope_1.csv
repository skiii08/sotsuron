The Lobster," Like-it-or-hate-it
","This is a like-it-or-hate-it kind of movie. As for me, I loved it.This is not a movie for those who are looking for fastpaced story-throwing that bombard the senses. The deliberate delays and slow storytelling coupled with awkwardness is darkly funny yet at the same time intensely thought-provoking. This is one of the true dystopian films and important movie to watch.",10,0,1,30 January 2019
