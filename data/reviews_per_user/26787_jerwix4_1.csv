The Blair Witch Project," Imagination
","The problem with people who didn't like it is that they need to use their imagination to see this movie. The movie makes it out for you as a movie watcher to figure out who is doing it, what is going on, and what happened to those three. I will admit it scared the hell out of me. I have been in the woods, alone, at night and I have heard things (i.e. children laughing) and it isn't fun. If this movie was out 50 years ago, it would have made more because today's society is waiting for the 'jump' like horror movies and that isn't what this movie was. It's up to you to figure it out, so if you don't want to use your imagination and put yourself in their shoes, don't watch it.10/10",10,2,3,18 June 2004
