The Blair Witch Project," Boy that was an awful movie. (read. not worth you time)
",Hated it. The ending was one of the worst thought out endings I have ever seen. The movie has some ok spooks. But nothing that you haven't seen before. This hole movie was a big marketing trick. At least I didn't pay a cent to see it because I saw it at a friends house on DVD.Go see The Gift instead.,1,1,3,14 July 2001
