Hereditary," I couldn't even get past the first 30 minutes..
",Sooooooo boring!! I love horror movies and maybe today was just the wrong day to try to watch this but I was just sooooo bored with watching this movie. Perhaps I'll try to come back and watch this movie another day and update my review and rating but as of now It stays a 1/10.,1,4,9,3 July 2019
Toy Story 4," 'Trash???' -forky
",Cartoons are my guilty pleasure so I am not ashamed to admit I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was hilarious! I was laughing the whole movie (my precious forky)! I went into this movie with the expectation for It to be this fourth installment that no one wanted. But I was pleasantly surprised. No sad parts and I was pleased with the ending. It's not where I thought the movie would end but I am okay with It nonetheless. Overall a decent feel-good comedy animation. With a few good messages in there. Definitely worth the money to go see It.,9,9,19,30 June 2019
A Quiet Place," Decent movie... nothing to rave about
","This movie had some amazing actors and actresses that made this movie so entertaining to watch. They did the best they possibly could with this movie which is why I feel soo many people have liked It. However It doesn't change the fact that there was glaringly large plot holes and things that didn't quite make sense. Like:
1. Why in God's green earth did the teen or whatever age she was supposed to be give her little brother a toy that mom and dad said no to?? After you literally dived to catch It after he almost got y'all killed once?
2. On the walk back home why was he in the back of the line anyways???? He was the youngest.... why would he be at the end of the line #disdontmakesense
3. Why did he think It was okay to play with the toy in the first place??? He was already told no. And he obviously knew better bc he grabbed the batteries to put back in said toy. Come on now. (Y'all not scared to disobey your parents cause I know at those ages I was.)
And this just the first 10 minutes guys!!
4. Then this lady decides getting pregnant with a noise gremlin at the MOST inconvenient time like it is a good idea. Obviously the stores y'all were in probably had some condoms or even birth control you could've used. Absolutely ridiculous.
And I could rant about the multiple plot holes in this movie all day but honestly I'm tired of typing this review now. Plot holes aside the movie was entertaining to watch purely bc of the cast being the great actors they are. Buttt that's about It. If you can shut your brain off to watch purely for entertainment then go for It. Otherwise the plot holes will kill you.",4,0,2,1 July 2019
Murder on the Orient Express," Some books made into movies go great....
","This one did not go great. At all. Point blank period. First off this movie was extremely boring... maybe I get bored easily but this mess was boring. Secondly it was long asf. I felt like I took a five hour nap (yes I'm exaggerating) woke up and this movie was still on and still had not reached a climax. Finally, I tbh don't remember a thing from this movie. I don't remember if they solved the mystery or what happened at all. Honestly It feels like a fever dream now. Yikes all around for me. But got a two bc there is some half decent acting from the portions that have not completely been cleansed from my memory.",2,2,3,9 July 2019
