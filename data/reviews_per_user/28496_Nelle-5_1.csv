The Blair Witch Project," My stupid generation might ruin it for you.
","I hate my generation.  I am a 16-year-old girl who is a big fan of the Classics:  The ORIGINAL Haunting, The Shining, The Exorcist, etc.  Also read: I just don't get those slasher films.  They just ain't too scary. Suspense and good-timing make the film, in my eyes.  So I can definitely agree with the critics on this one; it was great.  Wait, scratch that, it was UNFORGETTABLE.  I researched this movie for 2 months before it came out, so I pretty much know everything about the production.  But I avoided spoilers, of course (a GREAT idea).  I was spellbound by this film, just as I had hoped I would be.  But my showing was FILLED with teenage-idiots.  I anxiously awaited the ending, after which, I had heard, the audience goes dead quiet and you are just CHILLED.  Well, as soon as the credits started to roll, some jerk sitting behind me, I think he was 18 or 19, stood up and started rudely mimicking Heather's dramatic confession sequence.  Loudly.  I was ready to turn around and kick him, but no, I am a nice little girl and wouldn't sink to his level.  It's SO rude to stand up and announce what you thought of a film in front of other people.  I agree with the others on this page who said that this film was wasted on the general public.  So maybe it wasn't as scary as the hype promises.  The storyline is FABULOUS, the 'acting' BLEW ME AWAY, and the ending was something that will have you leaving the lights on while you sleep.  Most kids my age don't understand that a movie can freak you out even if it doesn't have excessive uses of gore and cheap 'throw-the-howling-kitty-cat-into-the-frame' shots that 'scare people'.  Yes those shots are scary.  To 10-year-olds.  This is not your average horror flick of today.  Thank God.  So PLEASE, go see this at a matinee; you won't have to deal with the losers who just don't understand (or recognize) good cinema when they see it.",Null,0,1,5 August 1999
