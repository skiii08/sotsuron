Catch Me If You Can," :) Remake of Mr. K. Balachander's 'Naan Avanillai' :)
","In 1974, Tamil Nadu's famed movie director K.Balachander offered Tamil film enthusiasts yet another inspired creation - 'Naan Avanillai' ('I am not he') starring Gemini Ganesan in the title role. It was one of the most entertaining, progressive  and thought provoking movies of that time - especially in an era where most Indian films still dealt with formula musicals with romantic themes or stories dealing with identical twins separated at birth - (one grows up to be a police officer and the other a dacoit pursued by the unwitting twin, the police officer, the movies usually culminating in tne 'revelation' by the widowed mother who identifies her long lost son by the melanotic mole on his back and brings about a family reunion of sorts...and so on and so forth). Mr. K. Balachander generally avoided such stereotypic tripe and made movies that stood out from the rest of the crop. Naan Avanillai was one of those. Enough said. The Tamil movie may be available on VHS. For those interested it would be worthwhile checking it out.",Null,0,0,28 December 2002
Saving Private Ryan," Effective but ultimately another exploitative piece from Spielberg
","Seems like the Spielberg who gave us Sugarland Express, Duel, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Raiders of the Lost Ark and E.T. has departed our company and has been replaced by a clone who is intent on exploiting human suffering in the name of art and the Oscar. Schindler's List was perhaps the worst example of this trend... followed closely by Saving Private Ryan. Both films were undoubtedly critical and commercial successes. But somewhere, something called a soul may be MIA amidst all the hoopla. Personally, I'd rather watch A Bridge Too Far (again), The Longest Day (again), Apocalypse Now (again), Full Metal Jacket (again), The Deer Hunter (again), and Paths of Glory (again) if I have to remember how horrible war is.",4,3,6,9 November 2002
Vanilla Sky," One of the best movies in recent release - trusts the viewer's intelligence
",I was pleasantly surprised by the premise and meticulous execution of this gem (although the sound track was a tad too distracting). The plot reminded me of sci-fi great Philip K. Dick's story I Hope I Shall Arrive Soon. To dissect this movie would be to give too much away. I had to watch the movie over again to get the nuances and it was well worth the effort. Hope more intelligent movies such as this one get made.,9,0,0,28 May 2002
Signs," $$$$$$igns : But neither unbreakable nor sixth (sus)sense(ful).
","MAY CONTAIN MINOR SPOILERS: A big problem with this film, as I see it, is that we have come to expect M. N. Shyamalan to continue to deliver projects as superbly crafted as The Sixth Sense. But with success, especially in Hollywood,  comes the commercial demands to capitalize on such phenomena by expecting subsequent projects to be conceived of and completed under increasingly tighter deadlines. This often results in watered down versions of the writer or director's potential vision. All SIGNS suggest that this may be the case in this latest offering from Shyamalan. This tale of reaffirmation of faith could have been improved tremendously if attention had been paid to some distracting plot devices such as the aliens' aversion to water. Why then, did they choose to land on a planet whose surface was two thirds water? Or is that why they had to invest in those cheap wet suits? Again, what was the purpose behind repeating flashbacks of the wife's death? I was expecting something more profound like the scene of the injured airman in Catch-22. Also, it made it a little difficult to sympathize with a family that was so apparently callous about the welfare of not one, but two of their animals. One can go on, but then again, every one's a critic. All in all, the film's biggest weakness may lie in the fact that we understand the character's conflicts in a cerebral way but don't 'connect' emotionally with any of the characters - i.e. we need to care about what happens to them. That is why Sixth Sense was such a critical success. And, that is why, although SIGNS will make a lot of $$$$$igns at the box office, it will ultimately remain an unsatisfying film to watch. I sincerely hope Shyamalan will live up to his awesome talents in his next project.",Null,1,1,11 August 2002
The Deer Hunter," A profound and personal view of the effects of war and survival
","**May contain spoilers** I first saw this movie more than twenty years ago, and wasn't terribly impressed. I have seen this movie many more times over the years and my impressions of this film are quite different now - having evolved with each viewing. It has to be seen from Michael's perspective. His attitude and reaction to life, death and survival (physical and emotional) form the crux of this movie. Perhaps he sees himself reflected in the eyes of the deer before it is slain - perhaps he sees Nicky reflected in those eyes too. The wanton killing associated with the war symbolized by the brutally graphic Russian Roulette scenes underscore the fact that war makes humans numb - every one is a pawn in another's scheme. The Pennsylvania family is symbolic of any country that may be at war and the family symbolizes its citizens. The story forces us to view the effects of war in a personal way - not as something that happens to faceless, nameless strangers far away but as something that could happen to us and the ones we care about and its impact on our day to day lives.",Null,0,0,26 August 2002
