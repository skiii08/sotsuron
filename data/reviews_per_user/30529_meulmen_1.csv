Ford v Ferrari," Absolute trash.
",Truly awful. A more appropriate title would be Ford: the meaningless death of Ken Miles. Nothing is done to make any characters meaningful or interesting. Ferrari is absent from the film almost entirely and Italians in general are portrayed as foolish caricatures. Ford management is made to look so dumb it is a wonder the racing program even existed. This movie is not fun or entertaining. Cinematically it is also a dud. I have never been so bored looking at a GT40. The driving sequences are nonsensical and without consequence. Save yourself the embarrassment and watch James May's Grand Tour GT40 film instead.,1,58,158,17 November 2019
