The Rock," silly - a waste of talent!!
",the rock was a boring movie - the makers must be tried in court for such a criminal waste of talent. connery & cage are wasted. ed harris comes up with a competent performance.there's nothing different about the movie - just an overload of testosterone and some weird special effects towards the end. go stare at a wall - you might be better entertained.a meager 5,5,1,3,25 September 2001
The Devil's Advocate," visually stunning, but falls short of being brilliant
","a movie with style, a little substance and some stunniongly cunning screenplay. al pacino as the devil is brilliant, oozes cunning rather than evil. but to me the standout performance was charlize theron as the little girl who wants to make it big but not quite tough enough in the lonely empty new world.the movie is visually alluring and has many stunning scenes, a lot of the scenes though are pure humbug and get pretty grating, however the overall style is snappy. devil's advocate is a challenging movie and though a little preachy is a smart movie nevertheless.keanu reeves proves once again that he cant act for nuts. otherwise, the movie has a good score and many smart dialogs, a good fun movie that could have been really good. and i really like the ending ...

Raiders of the Lost Ark," amazing adventure, but fails to stand the test of time
","steven spielberg and george lucas combine to give the super-hero adventurer indiana jones. harrison ford is dashing in the role and brings a lot of charisma and punch, not unlike james bond, except ofcourse indiana jones isnt much of a ladies man. despite this flaw in his character, he brings a lot of fun to the role. the movie is incredibly smart and an amazing thrill ride. however, the movie fails to stand up on its own merit in the year 2002. 2 decades after its release. i am sure i enjoyed it without any reservations when i first saw it in my a few years back in my mid-teens. but its not so much fun now.the movie really puts your suspension of disbelief to the test. after a while the superhero thing has been carried a little too far. although, im ure kids even today will absolutely love this adventure. maybe its just not meant for the 'grown-ups'. whatever. i still enjoyed it, but not as much as i did earlier.an adventurous 8!!",8,0,0,10 January 2002
Casablanca," What can i say about this marvel?
","Casablanca. The Best Movie Ever? Close. I've seen this movie over 15 times and it fills me with wonder everytime. i am gripped and enthralled, as if i were seeing it for the first time.Theres not a single flaw in this movie. absolute perfection. after close to sixty years, its still fresh and remarkable what more can one say? the acting is out of this world. ingrid bergman is at her most devastating beauty in this movie. that half-smile makes me go a big wobbly in the knees.The dialogs are the best ever. extremely sharp, witty, touching & cryptic - all at once :)Words cannot express the brilliance of this movie. just writing this review makes me want to see the movie again. am gonna go see it now. so what are you waiting for?A Perfect 10",10,1,1,2 October 2001
Chinatown," thrilling, exciting masterpiece
","roman polanski's chinatown is a thrilling masterpiece, meticulously building up the terror and jack nicholson plays a typical noir detective to perfection, with his dry humour and the lines are great for any fan of raymond chandler.chinatown starts off with what seems to be an open and shut case for the private eye, but the complicated web keeps getting darker and thicker as the suspense mounts. what makes this movie better than most is the complicated relationships between the many lead characters especially jack nicholson, faye dunaway, her husband and her father. this quartet form the basis of this thrilling plot, well there is someone else to the plot as well, but you will just have to see the movie to find out about that.what this outstanding dark movie. why cant they make movies like this anymore? well polanski did in the 90s with his death and the maiden, which sadly bombed at the box office .... so ...an exciting, thrilling 9!",9,1,3,5 May 2002
Erin Brockovich," chutzpah!!
","Erin brockovich is a brilliantly told true story, the main critque ive heard against the mvoie is that julia roberts is too arrogant, rude & nasty - but reading about the real erin gives terrific insights into the character of a capable person who never gets the opportunity to shine and how she holds that grudge against society at large, especially the 'haves'.julia roberts is simply brilliant, the story is very true for the most part, and if anything, erin's role has been made less heroic than it actually is. another person whose actual contribution is not given due justice is the lawyer ed masry. albert finney is terrific in the role.the overt sexuality of julia roberts is reflective of the pizzazz of the real erin. julia roberts shines in a plucky role. the movie is well scripted and sorderberg gives a tight storyline. although the movie is very commercial, that cannot be held against it, it still is a solid entertainer.the dialogs are stunning, shocking and raw, much like the real erin. it makes the movie a delightful watch. a must see for fans of julia and all who enjoy a spicy drama. full of raw energy.a terrific 8!!",8,0,0,10 October 2001
Fight Club," a modern classic
","fight club, from the director of Se7en is an absolute classic for the thinking audience. a movie that operates on many different levels will appeal to all viewers primarily because of the 'twist' at the end. however, the brilliant dialogues in the movie, especially between the narrator and tyler are cutting!! this movie never meanders and stands up to repeated viewing, (i must know, for i have seen it 23 times fully & countless times in parts).brad pitt & edward norton give off impeccable performances - but in terms of sheer acting quality helena bonham carter steals the show. a movie that fills me with life & vigour everytime i see it. u might not enjoy it as much - but definitely dont miss it. a perfect 10.",9,0,1,23 September 2001
As Good as It Gets," As good as it gets! really!!
","among the best 3 movies of 1997, along with good will hunting & l.a.confidential. this movie has 3 top artistes giving off their best. the story is simple, and yet so complex. the characters are out-of-the-world and yet so real. as good as it gets revels in this paradox.
touching at the raw chords, a story of a man who cannot (or rather does not want to) reveal his emotions. helen hunt plays the woman that turns him around, the one person who makes him 'want to be a better man'. greg kinear plays a brilliant role as the gay friend. he would have bagged the oscars in most years, his tough luck that he ran into robin williams giving his career best performance in good will hunting.as good as it gets is funny, endearing, touching, dark, sad, cathartic, confusing and enlightening all at once. one of the modern masterpieces. the casting director deserves a special award for this casting coup. watch the movie for the brilliant performances, the arresting chemistry between these superstars, the heart-rending moments between them. this is one of the best movies of the 90s.A deserving 9.",9,0,0,24 September 2001
Memento," Extraordinarily smart and unique ....
","a truly unique movie experience, quite unlike any experienced before. memento is a triumph in daring cinema, going by its incredibly high rank at imdb. memento is definitely one of the best movies of the 90s. the storytelling is so incredible that the viewer is enthralled and engaged right through. there is no let up and the amazing reverse time-line technique is simply brilliant, thus recreating the plot in a whole new way ... as some parts get explained while others get more intriguing as the movie goes on.
its one of those incredible movies where the power of the screenplay is so massive that everything else gets side-tracked. the acting was competent, the dialogs too but the wonderment caused by the terrific plot overshadows everything else. guy pearce as the man who has no short-term memory is adequate, the director makes the character so utterly believable. i think the entire credit should go to the director christofer nolan, despite being his first full-length feature, he shows tremendous conviction and understanding of the medium and its techniques, he seems to know exactly what to do to keep the audience on the edge of the seat always wondering .. what next? (or what before? haha) the one most striking aspect was the use of black and white to depict scenes in the distant past so as to lend clarity, without this smart move, the movie would have become totally incomprehensible. but as it is, its a terrific movie and worthy of all the high praise it has been receiving.however, on an aside, i find that new movies tend to get rather very high scores which might not be justified in the overall scheme of things, i honestly am not too sure how well these movies will stand up after 2-3 decades. only time will tell.but for now, lets just enjoy in the sheer thrill of mementoan extraordinary 10!!",10,0,1,14 November 2001
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," cliched movie with poor acting
","i am amzed at how many people think the acing in this movie was good. nicolas cage has one expression & tone throughout the movie and penelope cruz has none.the story in many parts was very predictable and stale. the saving graces in the movie were the excellent locales, beautiful cinematography & the lilting music. i dont much care for the 'historical inaccuracies' - i mean after all this is cinema for god's sake. so no complaints there.the worst thing was the total lack of ingenuity in the plot. apparently its a great book, i havent read it. the movie is a bit of a pot-boiler with a little bit of everything thrown in for good measure.having said all this, the movie is comfortable to watch and lightly handled, no melodrama here. well not  much anyway. the best scenes are with john hurt as the elderly Dr. & father. the standout scene is when he explains what love is to his daughter, was a very moving & touching scene. especially, when he points out the difference between love & being in love. a whole new perspective and a really memorable scene. however, scenes of such caliber are in short supply.an average 6",6,2,3,7 October 2001
12 Monkeys," incredibly tight, fast paced and different
","twelve monkeys was an incredibly unique movie and a highly demanding one. the audience needs to pay a lot of attention to catch the plot that goes see-saw and up and down. all with a purpose. the plot unravels brilliantly as more and more things fall in place gradually.bruce willis is once again brilliant in a tough role as is madeleine stowe, but the standout performance is brad pitt as the mad kid living in the shadow of his genius father.this movie has many brilliant shots, the soundtrack and cinematography were just excellent. technical brilliance apart, the terrific story telling and acting carry through what would otherwise have been a difficult movie to watch.the movie is slickly made and tight. the only flaws being the slight exaggeration of coles presence at various points of time and the cole-railly romance, which i thought was a little overdone.in all, an excellent 9!",9,0,0,24 December 2001
The English Patient," whats with love in the deserts that ....
","... makes it so magical & mystical & tragic??!!let me start of by saying that i did not hold much hope for the english patient - i mean the movie had won 9 oscars - just how bad could it be?? (i dont much trust the academy when it handles out loads of oscars, the debacles of titanic & gladiator spring to mind). i expected a pompous over-blown epic with little feel. how wrong, how wrong i was!!the english patient is one of the most beautiful movies ive seen in a long time. the story unravels beautifully in layers, admittedly it is a bit slow, but the director has built up the atmosphere wonderfully. each and every character is well etched and totally totally believable. what a pleasant surprise in todays plastic hollywood!!the acting is simply terrific, if i had to pick one person for an oscar from the movie, i would have chosen kirsten scott thomas, who ofcourse did not win it - frances mcdromand did for fargo - touch and go ... i would have gone with kirsten.having said that, theres nothing to be taken away from any of the magnificient actors here - ralph fiennes, juliette binoche & naveen andrews & willem dafoe are all terrific. theres enough about the story in the other reviews, so i wont go into it.the movie is truly magnificent, splendorous and worthy of the many oscars it won, especialy considering its competition. a grand romantic epic, in the lines of casablanca - a memorable movie whose only fault is its lengtha splendid 9!!",9,0,2,22 October 2001
The Others," beautifully haunting
","Amenabar's The Others is a visual beauty. the atmosphere of the movie is dark and chilling.It is inevitable that the movie is compared to the sixth sense. there is a similar touch and feel to that classic movie. however, the plot is significantly different. ive read other viewers claim that the plot is unoriginal, actually they may be right. a haunted house, an ending that HAS been used in the past, a ghost story ... well .. nothing original right? wrong.the director lets the plot build itself, keeping the audience always on the edge, expecting a sudden scare - but the plot just thickens and thickens ... slowly unravelling ... the movie is enthralling even in its nothingness.the performances are brilliant. nicole kidman has earned herself at least a nomination, if not the oscars itself. alakina mann as the daughter is also stunning. kudos to the casting crew. and the director.you might not like the movie much or end up loving it like i did (and the many others it seems - top 250!!!). but do not miss it. its different.a haunting 9",9,0,0,29 September 2001
Dead Poets Society," touching and inspiring ...
","dead poets society is a movie ive been wanting to watch for a long time. finally made it and was pleasantly thrilled. the movie is wonderfully touching, with deft sensitive handling and an inspiring storyline.the first half of the movie is wonderfully inspiring and elevating, though the latter half breaks down slightly and does get  a little trite and cliched. though the magic of the movie is strong and effective. its beautifully scripted and the performances are very real and believable. robin williams as the teacher who impels his students to 'seize the day' is excellent. the movie is a must-watch for all dreamers and lovers of the arts - it is wonderfully heart-warming. and it has a lot of curiosity value as well, especially seeing ethan hawke from way back!!all i can say is 'seize the day'. watch the moviean inspiring 8!",8,1,2,11 March 2002
Chicken Run," funny and engaging but nothing original
","chicken run was yet another funny and engaging little animated movie in a long series of such movies ever since pixar's toy story became a runaway hit. chicken run though fails to come up with an original and gripping plot. despite an interesting premise of a prison escape from the point of view of chickens, the plot fails to hold one's interest for long. having said that, the rest of the movie is engaging and very funny. forget the cliches relax, dont expect anything original and you will love this cute comedy.chicken run has terrific production values and is extremely slick and smartly made. the script is fast and funny, naturally mel gibson does a capable job but so does julia sawalha as ginger and the 2 rats are hilarious too :)watch the movie with kids, or just by yourself too ... not as good as the toy story series, but pretty good in itself.a cute and funny 7!",7,0,1,5 May 2002
X-Men," a big surprise from the maker of 'the usual suspects'
","X-Men was a pleasant surprise. first things - i do not usually like action movies, definitely not ones on comic book heroes. however X-Men was slickly made, tight and best of all short. a lot of style, singer doesnt let the weak story get in the way.nothing great on the acting front or even the special effects. its just that the little bits all add upto one slick flick. the dialogues are short and snappy, like they should be in all good action movies, esp. considering their target audience.all the big hooplah towards the climax is pretty grating, but i guess u'll live through them. again - short!!. singer knows his audience well. a top-rate action movie.a spicy 8",7,1,2,23 September 2001
Taxi Driver," a sometimes painfully slow movie
","first things first - THIS is probably robert de niro's finest performance. the movie though did not win a single oscar, whch is a bit strange, esp. considering the kind of cult following it has AND the critical acclaim it has received.i for one found the movie to be too slow nd meandering and very soft. i think the plot deserved a more hard-hitting script ... which shows the mental troubles of robert de niro in starker light. the movie failed to evoke much feeling in me, the characters felt too distant, i did not feel any pain or pleasure for any of the characters.the dialogs in the movie though are outstanding and memorable. the movie is still definitely worth watching, just for the way it shows the decadent lonely mind at work, in its destructive frame. robert de niro showcases this mind in its stark naked self. however, one just wishes that the movie had a little more punch to it.a moderate 7",8,1,3,29 September 2001
Full Metal Jacket," good one, but intensity tapers off ...
","the movie begins in typical kubrick style with a bang and jolts you. it shocks the audience into an all new state, making one experience boot camp.kubrick's powrful imagery is at work and stuns the viewer, depicting the dehumanising process of preparing to go to war. the latter half of the movie when joker actually is in battle, although as a correspondent is nowhere near as intense and like many others have pointed out seems to taper off and fails to continually intrigue the audience.the dialogs are quite stunning, witty, brutal, sublime and evoking at the same time. kubrick is vry much the star of the movie again invoking some astounding images. the movie is a brilliant war movie, however, personally for me, it is not as intense as apocalypse now. an intriguing 8!",8,0,0,18 December 2001
Forrest Gump," smart quips and anecdotes .. but nothing great!
","Forrest gump is an overrated movie that has just a lot of smart ideas going for it. by no stretch of the imagination is this movie a classic, and most definitely did not deserve the oscars that year. i hate to say it again, but i think its the academy's fascination with americanism that makes it chose movies like this one, saving private ryan & american beauty over other outstanding movies from those years.the series of anecdotes that link up gump's simple life to world-changing historical events are quite cute and makes u smile a bit, but really thats all the movies has going for it - that and tom hanks' captivating performance. but again, as has been said before by many others - a slightly over-rated movie.a charming 7",6,1,4,25 September 2001
Léon: The Professional," a bit of a let-down ...
","leon is one very smart and chic movie. the movie though lacks a certain genuinity. a lot of scenes seemed forced to me.

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," the magic of the book is impossible to capture
","peter jackson has done an outstanding job in interpreting lotr for the big screen. by itself, the movie is probably a 9 pointer. but having read the book there is nothing new, and nothing can compare to the freedom of ones own imagination. despite this, lotr is a wonderfully crafted movie and the casting is brilliant.i had a lot of dificulty with the way many complex characterisations could not be captured on the big-screen. but the best thing about the movie is that it will drive many people to go ahead and maybe read the book and experience the magical worl created by tolkien. this is as good as mythology gets.as far as the movie is concerned, it was wonderfully crafted. conveying the complex history of the ring and its many bearers. my favorite performance was from cate blanchett as galadriel, she truly seemed to understand the character and her voice was simply perfect. just the way i imagined galadriel would sound. another pleasant surprise was the beautiful cinematography, the locales were outstanding and a visual treat. i just wish that gollum had a speaking character, guess we will just have to wait for 'he two towers'. i just am crazy about gollum's way of speaking. its very captivating :)on the whole a terrific movie. there is absolutely no scope for complaint, save the fact that the characterisation is just not as intricate as in the book. for instance gimli is a much more sincere and nice dwarf, than what the movie shows him to be. oh! and legolas was really well cast too.
if you havent read the book it would be great. but for me having read the book, it just doesnt match up.a 7 is all it will get",7,0,0,15 May 2002

Apocalypse Now," Extraordinary Movie - among the best war movies of alltime
","Francis Ford Coppola'a Apocalypse Now is one of the best war movies ive ever seen. the movie is extremely long (in fact i saw the original version, the redux version is longer!!) - but there is not one moment when it gets boring. the movie is an excellent voyage voyage into the minds of people in war.martin sheen as captain willard is simply brilliant. Marlon Brando is no great shakes - hes hardly there in the movie. this is a martin sheen movie all the way and he carries it off tremendously aided by the brilliant cinematography and directorial style of the inimitable coppola, who knows how to shock the viewer with his terrific exploration of the shades of grey. one thing that amazes me about coppola's movies - be it godfather, apocalypse now or even dracula - is the way that it portrays neither good nor evil. the chief characters have a bit of both in them.Apocalypse now is a  masterpiece in showing the mental trauma of war. there are many scenes in the movie that will be etched in your memory forever. the chracters are tremendously believable and original. each scene is honest.The other standout features in the movie are its chilling dialogs and the terrific soundtrack to the movie - coppola uses popular classic rock songs from the sixties to terrific effect, the songs highlight the scenes and add a tremendous aural backdrop to the visual scenes. the songs usually take over during the pauses for the audience to think. the dialogs of course are the ones that make you think anyway, especially the narration.its hard to discuss the movie without taking away its impact, suffice it to say that this is a movie that will stay with you for a long time. one of the greatest movies of alltime.a chilling 10!",10,3,3,4 October 2001

john malkovich is totally mindblowing, when he plays craig schwartz, you see john cusack and not malkovich. truly brilliant. catherine keener has the most attractive role and she does full justice, cameron diaz in a deglamorized role shines.apart from the acting, the quirky movie is radiant with brilliant humor that makes one laugh out loud. the weirdness of the situations get more and more complex and are very well handled by the director spike jonze. this movie has a terry gilliam feel to it, without going totally overboard. the plot gets quite absurd, but honestly, i didnt care. it was a fun movie. weird, yes, but wonderful.a quirky 8!",8,3,5,30 May 2002

","Its my opinion that this movie suffers from a typical american disease, the over-praise for movies that glorify the u.s.of a.no doubt this was a very good movie that showcases spielberg's brilliant technical mastery. but his story-telling is awfully amiss here. for the average non-american this movie might seem rather ordinary.
having said that this is by no means a solid output from steven spielberg. as usual he brings out excellent performancs from everyone. manages a tight screenplay, a great score, brilliant effects. a quality film, that just lacks in one aspect - for some reason, it comes across as being short on the emotional aspect. the movie fails to capture the horrors of war. for a truly brilliant anti-war movie watch terrence mallick's outstanding 'the thin red line'. sadly overlooked at the oscars.a high 7",6,0,1,23 September 2001

JP2 has nothing new to offer to the viewer.theres a great deal of good thrills in the movie, but it offers nothing to the viewer who has already been fascinated by JP1. a mere rehash of the same old ideas, a lot sillier if anything - there are lots of smart scenes - but again, not enough to offer the audience something different.a rather boring movie at the end.a consolation 6.",6,0,1,24 September 2001

","Schindlers list is the master at his best. its a pity that his next war movie saving private ryan was not a patch on this one. this movie, unlike SPR has the human element in it. The movies is an outstanding truelife story of one man's realisation of the horrors of war. i wish the world leaders of today, who are eager to pull the trigger to avenge the injustice done to them, will take time off and watch this long but touching movie. spielberg uses excellent cinematic techniques to showcase the horrors of war. though the movie is quite often disturbing, that is the intention. the use of black and white throughout the movie is even more striking, especially in contrast with the only colour used in two scenes. Schindlers list is a powerful war movie and is rather long, but it is well worth a patient watch, there will be no dry eyes at the end of this classic movie.probably spielberg's best and one of the alltime greatest moviesa perfect 10.",8,9,14,25 September 2001
The Game," too good for its own good.
","the game is terrifying, its chilling, the tension in the movie is relentless and its scary. there is no relief and the tension keeps piling on and on, till you reach a point when you say 'i dont care, anymore'. thats when the audience looses touch with the character and plot. i had once heard a critic have a similar complaints against fincher's 'se7en', i didnt agree with that - but i do with this movie. another fault in the movie is the ending, a little too smart and complicated for its own good.having said all that, the movie is still brilliantly made, and in-fact for the above same reasons is a stand-out in the otherwise boring hollywood action-thriller genre. david fincher took the lessons from this movie one step further to make the truly brilliant 'fight club'.i am not much of a fan of michael douglas, he tends to get pretty grating, johnny depp is wasted in the movie. the best thing about the movie is the script and of course finchers deft direction.a chilling 8!",8,0,1,10 October 2001

Kelly's Heroes," warm and funny movie, would have been better with a little less firework
","kelly's heroes is a smart and extremely funny movie, the highlight being the anachronistic hippy oddball. (*** spoilers ahead ***) the movie about pvt. kelly rounding up men to go hunt for gold behind the enemy lines is hilariously told, each character has his own quirks and they are well brought out, and the only tedious part is when the focus is on the war itself. having said that the climax with the attack on the german held town is quite well made and oddball's scene after their tank breaks down is out of the world.on the whole a well told mildly funny movie that would have been better with a little less violence. smartly told movie, quite funny. wonderful for a change.a funny 7!",7,3,5,22 December 2001
Black Hawk Down," Brutal, Hard-Hitting and sincere
","Black hawk Down is not for everyone. I have seen practically every great war movie made and this one has to be the most hard hitting and brutal of them all. the war scenes are more realistic and shocking than in any other movie. technically this one is easily the best made along with spielberg's saving private ryan.apart from the technical brilliance of the movie, the visuals are heart stopping and the brutality of war and the bravery, fear, misgivings, doubts and courage of ordinary men are well highlighted. ridley scott does a terrific job in showcasing the horrors of war especially an ill conceived and attempt as this operation was. the movie fails in one aspect, namely characterisation. this is the movie's biggest flaw, i could not differentiate one character from another and not one person stood out, despite the laboured first 30 minutes of character building, nobody stands out and it is hard to feel for any character or identify with them either. apart from this, or should i say, despite this, the movie is touching and well made. one of the best crafted war movies ever. stands next only to apocalypse now, thin red line & full metal jacket.however, i will reiterate that the movie was brutal in its encapsulation of the horrors of war, do not see i unless you are ready for a lot of bloodshed and gory mutilations.oh! and yes - it was fully deserving of the oscars it won for technical brilliancea stunning & brutal 9!!",9,2,4,14 April 2002

"Girl, Interrupted"," tender and intelligent
","I have not read the book, but the movie, I'm sure does justice to Susanne Kaysen, whose story it is. The movie is crafted intelligently and tenderly not being judgemental at any stage. The movie does not take sides, does not judge insanity or 'borderline personality disorder'. The movie is just a beautiful account of what's happening to a girl, interrupted.I haven't lived in the sixties either, but somehow the movie seems to tell me  the exact confusion of a young adult at that stage. A person who does not want to grow up. Refusing to accept reality. The troubles in Susanna Kaysen's mind are highlighted excellently by the talented and beautiful Winona Ryder.The dialogs in this movie are, in my mind, some of the best ever. The dialogs express beautifully Susanna Kayson's thoughts .. I wonder how much of it is from the autobiographical book.Speaking of dialogs one cannot ignore the oscar winner Angelina Jolie, she shines through the movie and is one of my favorite actresses now. A deadly combination of raw sexuality & impeccable caliber - one of the best scenes in the move is at the ice-cream parlor, Jolie : 'Some advice, okay? Just don't point your f*&$in' finger at crazy people!'Angelina Jolie and Winona Ryder are two good resons to watch this brilliant movie over and over again.

A Clockwork Orange," scary, depraved, extreme and beautiful
","i dont care what anybody else says, this has to be one of the most visually beautiful movies ever. i know. i know. its shocking. its disturbing. its scary. but stanley kubrick shows it in such visual beauty, that its hard to resist. one of the most disturbing aspects about the movie is that you actually sympathise with the protagonist, and this is why it is so disturbing. the audience feels guilty about sympathising with that loony, ultra-violent youth.Nevertheless, the movie is compelling in its free-will theory. the story is disturbing in the same way that george orwell's 1984 is. what happens when 'free will' is taken away. its an interesting premise and clockwork orange focusses on one extreme. the movie does not tread a middle path, which is another reason why so many people are horrified by the movie.
but stanley kubrick intends to make a hard-hitting movie and succeeds like nobody else. malclm mcdowell is brilliant as alex in the movie. an interesting piece of trivia is that malcolm is mortally scared of snakes, which is why kubrick actually introduced his pet in the movie - there is no pet in the book.the dialogs are very hard to follow - especially in the beginning, but as we go along, they become clerer and we soon see ourselves talking the language. pretty scary.anyway - a most disturbing movie, and alongwith apocalypse now, remain the most hard-hitting movies of alltime in my opinion.A shocking 10.",10,0,0,2 October 2001

The Matrix Reloaded," what a royal rip-off!!!
","Matrix - The Movie, ended where it did. The makers realising the enormous potential of the huge hit decided there was more money to be made and worked out some ill-conceived plot, offcourse nobody knows what it is, you have to watch The Matrix Revolutions to find out, which goes by the name of The Matrix Reloaded. Offcourse every Matrix fan is going to go back to the theatres to see the second helping of Matrix (just like i did) and because this movie leaves you in limbo you have to go back and see the Matrix Revolutions to see what it is all about anyway.It might well turn out that the second part of Matrix (which has been split into 2 movies as reloaded & revolutions) has a tight plot and great fun, but frankly i am quite dismayed at the fruitlessness of this movie. extremely disappointing and disingenious way of ripping off the hard-earned bucks off the matrix fans.shame on you guys!the movie in itself offers a glimpse of a plot which hopefully will be 'unraveled' in revolutions. the action scenes were boring and repetitive, honestly i was quite tired of the multiple agent smith stunt scenes. pointless. monica bellucci is the real payoff, she looks devastatingly beautiful. and offcourse we are going to believe that hte episode with her was there for a real reason, whether it is true or not we will know come december. the highway stunt scene was the only bit of excitement in the movie. stil the movie had enough going for it, just wish that reloaded n revolutions was put together in one movie so i wasnt getting ripped off.a disgraceful 5!",5,0,0,6 August 2003

","the movie offers nothing new in terms of druglords - just what we have seen before in scarface & the likes. however, the movie is well scripted, not too slow and progresses at a steady pace. johnny depp is very good as george jung.the interesting thing about the movie is that it does not focus too much on the drug dealing or the narcs industry, but instead focusses on george jung - the man. why he did what he did, his aspiraations, his tribulations, his successes. his personal problems - the movie gives a terrific insight into the minds of this 'evil' druglord.however, a lot of it is rather unbelievable and am personally not too sure how much of this is true. anyway, in the end the same old 'love for the family' succeeds, but there is no happy ending.the movie is an attemp to show the human side of the druglord, does succeed quite well, but seems rather pointless. for some reason, there never really is much pity for the character. this, despite exaggerated portrayal of his various relationships, wheteher with his father or his first love, barbara or his daughter kristin sunshine.in all, an average movie that tries to be different from other such movie, but doesnt quite make it.an above average 7",7,0,0,22 October 2001

","'Any Given Sunday, you can win or you can lose - but can you lose like a man?' - Oliver Stone didnt exactly win with this one, but in my mind, its a solid movie. most of the complaints against this movie are that it is too long (partially true) and that it has NO plot (totally untrue).the movie is about team-play, ambition, ego-struggles and competition in general. Oliver Stone has penned a brilliant script and woven a tight and subtle story here for the discerning audience. the viewer will have to carefully observe the subtle interplay between various people to really appreciate what is going on in their minds and how each person changes as the movie progresses. this is what the whole plot is about and since its not exactly very obvious, the movie is lost on many.however, the acting is still brilliant (even cameron diaz). the editing is just top-rate, the quick cuts and sharp angles to capture the excitement on the field is just terrific, but it might be a bit of an eye-sore for people who prefer the safe soft, long & slow shots. another outstanding highlight is the music, very very apt and and adding to the mood in each scene.On the whole, a top class movie.an exciting 8!",8,0,0,7 October 2001

Throughout the movie every character is just a good guy or the bad guy. Black or white. Where are the shades of grey? those mysterious characters that elevate drama to the next stage.I would call this an average movie that has been over-rated because of the mediocrity that it surrounded itself with.

","donnie darko is one of those rare movies. a movie that makes you think and feel at the same time. most horror movies, or scary movies with fantasy themes are steeped in one ingredient intended to scare you. donnie darko doesnt. so those of you looking for a good scare, skip this.
donnie darko is about a clumsy, troubled teenager, growing up in a welcoming environment, but still unable to come to terms with life. its a classic case of a coming of age movie. the darkness before the dawn. forget the philosophising though, for a while. even at a very simple script level, it is highly engaging and the audience is made to think. think like never before, there is so much happening in the movie, it operates on so many different platforms nd there are so many subtle messages that it is simply mind-boggling. this on the other hnd is the exact reason why the movie esp. towards the end is a bit tedious, u tend to lose track a bit.but anyway i immediately saw the movie again. to figure out some of the loose ends and it all fitted in brilliantly. i had a long conversation with a friend discussing the movie to understand it better. donnie darko is that kind of a movie. it demands attention, but it is all well worth it. huge kudos to debut director richard kelly for coming up with such a daring movie.a must see in my books, just a little too demanding maybe, but well worth the effort.a brilliant 9!!",8,1,2,6 January 2002
Jurassic Park," say what you will, this was brilliant back then!!
","In 1993, nothing - and i mean nothing, was bigger than Jurassic Park. Justly too. what a thrill this was. not a single flaw and all the grandeur & wonder that you can ask for. a scientific fantasy epic that only one man could have delivered - Steven Spielberg.Jurassic Park ofcourse was later tarnished as being a cheap bag of thrills. well - woe unto thee who ill-talk this wonderful bag of ... oh!! well - thrills!!Many complain that the movie never did justice to the tremendous detail in the book. but then thats only to be expected. what would have remained an imaginary world was brought to visual delight by the magic of spielberg. a visual delight for the family. with lots of thrills. boy!! do i love them or do i love them??the sense of awe that first filed me when my eyes set on those magnificent dinosaurs was extraordinary (remember i was 14 then). Jurassic park is a movie for the kids and in a typical spielberg fashion, a special delight fo the adults that accompany them. im sure id love to watch the movie again now. as much as JP2 & JP3 have disappointed me, nothing can take away the special fondness for JP1.a stunning 9",9,4,5,25 September 2001
High Fidelity," Excellent comedy, true to the book
","this is a delightful movie that has many extremely funny moments, and a few touching ones too. a romantic comedy which is very different from the regular run of the mill ones. this is because its based on a brilliant book by Nick hornby, having already read the book, the movie at times tended to be a bit stale bacause almost every line in the movie is from the book.this is a touching, witty & funny story about a record shop owner, how he gets dumped by his girlfriend and how he discovers himself and finally at 30something grows up.the movie in itself is quite enjoyable an entertaining, the book though is simply extraordinary and id recommend it ahead of the book. after u've enjoyed the book, you could watch the movie anyway. the movie fails in not capturing some of the things going through the protagonists head - come to think of it, it is difficult capture all of the complexities anyway and the movie has done a good job of capturing the core of the movie.
a delightful 8!",8,0,0,6 October 2001
