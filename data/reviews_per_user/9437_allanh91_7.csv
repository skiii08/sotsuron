The Incredible Hulk," www.thefilmbuffs.tumblr.com - SPOILERS
","'Don't make me hungry you wouldn't like me when I'm hungry' – Bruce Banner (in mispronounced Portuguese)Summer 2008 gave birth to one of the greatest films of all time based on a comic book character named Bruce, and arguably one of the greatest films of all time, period. Unfortunately for Banner, it was Wayne who took the plaudits. Nonetheless, The Incredible Hulk is an important cog in the mechanics of Joss Whedon's Avengers Assemble, and is a throwback to the original superhero cinema venture, something which films like The Dark Knight have tried to veer away from in recent years.Bruce Banner's back-story is hurriedly introduced before we catch up with the fugitive in a Brazilian favela, working at bottling factory. Mistakenly contaminating a luminous green drinks bottle with his radioactive blood, Banner is placed on the US government's radar, and after a brief encounter with the 'big guy', veteran soldier Emil Blonsky (Roth) decides he will be the man to tame the beast, and will do whatever it takes to succeed. Compromised Banner travels back to the USA and reunites with his former lover, Betty Ross (Tyler), in search of a cure for his condition.Folks, grab some popcorn, a few bottles of beer/ glasses of wine, dim the lights and put your feet up after a hard day's work. The Incredible Hulk is not out there to challenge your original conceptions about the superhero genre, or blow you into submission by introducing a vast array of characters and settings. What it is going to do is treat you to a quarter-pounder of carnage and relentless action, with a side-salad of romance, which serves the purpose of garnishing this meaty venture of action with a softer side, the Bruce Banner side, if you will. Don't get me wrong, there isn't much depth at all to the film, and it doesn't reach many high points, but doesn't suffer many lows either.Edward Norton is excellent as Banner. I'm always compelled by his performances, and hold him in high regard as an actor. He works great with Liv Tyler, who also gives an above par performance. It's just a shame that there isn't much substance to the film, as I think these two could have tackled a more gourmet superhero venture. Tim Roth's Emil Blonsky challenges the Hulk physically, whilst William Hurt's General Ross is there to defeat Banner mentally, and stop his movements across the US. The antagonists of the film don't really stand out at all, and are just there to provide a little fat between the bones that are the action scenes; Hurt does have some good scenes with Liv Tyler though.Visually, The Incredible Hulk is presented much like a comic book, everything from the over-the-top, explosion drenched action scenes, to the rainy, melodramatic romance scenes between Banner and Ross has a pseudo-animated feel to it. The score is also very strong, particularly where Banner is involved, and especially in the foreign settings of the film (The Lonely Man song even makes an appearance as a leitmotif on Bruce's travels).The Incredible Hulk is the most basic entry of Marvel: Phase One, though it's also the only 'does exactly what it says on the tin' film of the bunch. And, although it was never going to win any awards for best screenplay, actors, cinematography or what have you, it isn't a terrible film. Most importantly, it doesn't try to fool you into thinking it's any more than a standard action film with some well known faces to brighten things up. Throw in a brief appearance from Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man at the conclusion, and you can turn of the DVD player with a sense of satisfaction, without having to chew over any leftovers.The Incredible Hulk (2008)Allan's Score: 6/10",6,0,0,30 September 2013
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," www.thefilmbuffs.tumblr.com - SPOILERS
","It was universally accepted after the X-men trilogy that Hugh Jackman is Wolverine, much like Robert Downey Jr. is Iron Man. His performance was a standout of the saga, and it would be foolish for Fox not to exploit that to make serious cash. Whilst Wolverine's origins were flirted with in 'X-men', and their surfaces scratched in 'X2', the story was never fully explored. Gavin Hood was the man chosen, even over Bryan Singer and Brett Ratner, to bring Wolverine's tale to the big screen, and finish off what was started in 2000.After watching Wolverine discover his bony, partially see-through claws as a young boy and running away with his brother Victor, we are treated to an impressive segment with some artistic VFX and camera work showing Logan and Victor fighting through the wars of time. The two are then placed in front of a firing squad for dissent, which they survive, only to be enlisted in the special program of a certain William Stryker, along with other powerful mutants including Wade Williams (Ryan Reynolds). Their actions are eventually too distressing for Logan, who retires to pursue a quiet life with a beautiful woman, working as a lumber jack. However, Logan's peace and solitude is shattered when his past life catches up to him, and he must seek revenge against his brother for destroying his world.Before you watch 'Origins', you have to disregard the political and social undertones from the X-men series. This is not a film about mutants, humans and morals. This is a revenge action thriller based around one mutant's rage against those who seek to destroy his livelihood. Jackman lives up to the premise of the film. His aggression has evolved into something quite terrifying, if a little melodramatic at times (not helped by some very poor directing) and his physical performance and appearance is quite incredible. Performing most of his own stunts and extensively working out/ gaining weight further solidifies the dedication Jackman has for the role. Liev Schreiber (Sabretooth) fits nicely opposite Jackson for scenes of conflict, but I never felt the relationship they had as brothers was believable. Their co-operative fight against weapon XI at the conclusion was well scripted and choreographed, but the dialogue in the rest of the film never expressed the hurt a person would feel when his ideals clash against their brother strongly. In other words, the conflict was ignored on an emotional level.The rest of the film follows a similar tone as the brothers' relationship, if you treat it exactly as it is, you'll enjoy the action and some of the special effects, but you'll miss out on any substance. I say some special effects because some are also quite horrendous: Wade Williams sword scene in Lagos, Wolverine walking away from the exploding helicopter (ruined what was a brilliant action scene) and several shots of Wolverine's claws were all pretty poor. There is also no chemistry between any of the cast worth shouting about. The story which gives Logan the idea for his alias is actually quite comically scripted (it's meant to be romantic) and acted, while the rest of the cast give Schreiber and Jackman nothing to play off of in terms of acting quality. Really, the other mutants in Stryker's team are written in purely for name dropping and thickening a very thin plot after their original involvement. Gambit's portrayal was embarrassing; after the cries of many fans to have him introduced, the result was short lived and fairly pointless (he was essentially just a personal skivvy for Wolverine who knew some card tricks and was a nuisance in a fight between Wolverine and Sabretooth). However, contrary to most, I actually enjoyed Reynolds portrayal as Wade Williams; he was annoying and not overtly comical, yet had a playful innocence which gave character to Stryker's otherwise scowling, 'high- protein diet' team.Storywise, Origins was thin, and could really have been wrapped up in about an hour if it wasn't for the seemingly last minute throw in of as many names as possible (the film was about Wolverine's origins, I'd personally have liked to have seen Cyclops and Emma Frost get separate films, thank you very much). The twist wasn't predictable and gave the end of the film a much needed shot in the arm, but was farcically conceived. Logan's lover 'dies' brutally and bloodily at the hands of a savage mutant with claws for fingernails, yet doesn't have a single injury? Surely something else could have been arranged as this was just borderline silly, as any sane person would have made such a connection and smelled foul play on the lover's part. There have been complaints about how Logan loses his memory via Stryker's adamantium bullet, however I think it was a reasonable explanation that the bullet would have caused non-fatal trauma severe enough to cause Logan's memory to be affected. Although, such a bullet would have appeared in the x-ray process in 'X-men (2000)', so there's maybe a continuity case if we're being picky.In the music department, 'Origins' is a marked improvement from the original trilogy. Stand out scenes include the Lagos theme for Stryker's crew and the close of the film after Wolverine regains consciousness.In all, if you like explosions, rippling muscles, well choreographed action scenes and borderline cheesy romance, all with a dash of the supernatural, but you're not a big fan of substance, writing or depth, then 'Origins' will be a welcome addition to your DVD collection. If you were a fan of the subplot of the previous X-Men films, detailing the social struggles for mutants to be accepted, and the struggles of humans to accept them, then you'll watch the film but probably won't enjoy it on a level beyond admiring Hugh Jackman's performance as the Wolverine.",4,0,1,30 September 2013
X-Men," www.thefilmbuffs.tumblr.com
","'We are the future Charles, not them. They no longer matter.' – MagnetoBryan Singer's X-men plagued me with a wealth of interest based on my academic involvement in evolutionary science. It also deals with modern social struggles, superiority complexes among intelligent super-minds, quick-witted one liners and some downright incredible haircuts. This is a fond throwback to one of the key comic book films of all time, which I would argue gave faith to film companies to stick with the genre after some poor efforts in the late 90s.The story is very simple: the antagonist, Magneto, has built a machine that can force mutations within human beings, at great cost to the operator's strength. By using the machine, powered by young Marie/Rogue (infused with Magneto's metal controlling abilities), Magneto will transform several world leaders and dignitaries, who are gathered on Ellis Island NYC for a peace summit, into mutants. Wolverine, Cyclops, Storm and Jean Grey must stop him, as his device is not only deemed immoral by the X-Men, but they have witnessed the potential for it to kill humans who's cells aren't equipped to deal with forced mutation. It is however, the sub-plot of mutant alienation and criminalisation/ victimisation, and how the mutant characters deal with the shackles placed on them by society, which makes X-Men a complex, original Superhero film, and indeed series.X-men takes real life issues, such as homosexuality and disability, and places them in a surreal world, where mutants are feared by mankind because they are deemed unnatural by key figures in society. Senator Kelly (Bruce Davison) is that divisive figure in this film. Seeking to instill a sense of fear of the unknown in the American populous, he suggests that mutants could be dangerous, and are national security liabilities unless they can be registered. This causes a reaction within one particular mutant named Magneto, who is ready to initiate war against humans under the Darwinian theory that a species must adapt, or be replaced by a stronger, fitter one. Rather than forcing an entity of pure evil upon us in Magneto, Singer opens the film by showing the torment and evil that has befallen him under mankind; as a young boy he is separated from his parents in a concentration camp, triggering a dormant powerful mutation within him, along with a burning hatred for human beings. McKellen is the perfect Magneto. A man who has lived a life as a member of an outcast community understood the role perfectly, and was even able to offer help to Singer and his crew, understanding the more subtle social issues behind mutants. Equally convincing is his role as an ego-maniacal would-be-dictator.Unfortunately, Magneto's crew fall far short of the mark in representing what he stands for. Sabretooth doesn't have any dialogue, but offers nothing in the way of body language or facial expression to compensate. Toad makes an excellent, resilient fighter, and brings some comic relief to the Brotherhood, but his character just lacks the seriousness needed to fill the gap for the mute Sabretooth and the quiet Mystique. Mystique's make up is astounding, and her character is sleek and deadly in and out of combat. Although later X-men films focus on her a great deal more, she just doesn't get enough screen time or dialogue in the original film to have any real impact in the way that the 'lesser' X-men do.The X-Men, under the calm, yet powerful guidance of Professor X. (expertly portrayed by Patrick Stewart against McKellen's Magneto), seek to prevent all out conflict between Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants and man, with a goal to help the two understand one another and live harmoniously. The X-men are portrayed faithfully, but just seem a little diluted, which is a shame as some sparks of on screen chemistry are quite visible, particularly between Wolverine and Cyclops. Hugh Jackman really is the perfect candidate for Wolverine, forgiving him a 12 inch height difference. His accent, facial expressions delivery of both snappy one liners ('What d' they call you? Wheels?'), and confrontational snarls are all in perfect character. Call it teething problems, but his later performances are more naturally aggressive and cantankerous than in this film, but he's easily forgiven, as Wolverine is probably the strongest character alongside Xavier and Magneto.Cyclops and Jean Grey are both competent on screen, but seem to rely (much like the entire franchise at times) on Jackman's Wolverine to help character development. This also holds true for Storm; her moral deliberation with Wolverine in Xavier's mansion is her most prominent non-battle scene moment in the film.Rogue is the final main X-man, though she doesn't become fully fledged in this film. Her character is portrayed as an innocent, misunderstood teenager who has a mutation which leaves her feeling isolated from others of both human and mutant kind. Again, her character clings to Wolverine, but far more closely than any of the others. Several poignant scenes are shared between Paquin and Jackman's characters; indeed, Wolverine is the only one who can soothe Rogue's troubled mind when she is most vulnerable, though she did inadvertently almost kill him twice. She, along with Magneto, embodies the ideologies behind the film: isolation, suffering, and alienation from normality.X-men was a very good film for a time when mainstream audiences were disenchanted with the Superhero genre. The expertise of actors such as Jackman, Stewart and McKellen, an inventive plot dealing with issues beyond just fighting bad guys and personal feuds, and, flaws aside, a passable gallery of superheros and villains immersed in a world where regular humans are an active component in the battlefield gave Hollywood something new, and arguably gave birth to the 21st century comic book film explosion.X-men (2000)Allan's Score: 6.5/10",6,0,1,30 September 2013
Captain America: The First Avenger," www.thefilmbuffs.tumblr.com - SPOILERS
","'I don't want to kill anyone. I don't like bullies; I don't care where they're from' – Steve RogersCaptain America: The First Avenger was the last big summer blockbuster from Marvel before Avengers Assemble (in fact, the typical post-credit Easter egg is a teaser trailer for the Avengers' then upcoming film). Captain America is arguably the most important figure in the Avengers, and giving him a strong footing in the run up was essential to getting the final product right. This was some task for Joe Johnston, whose biggest accomplishments to date were Jumanji and Jurassic Park III (which, let's face it, was a let down). Adding to the pressure of creating the perfect leader in Captain America, my guesses are that Johnston would have been reminded by Marvel of how big a media monster Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man had become, and that Cap' would have to match, or better this monster. In short, he didn't. But Johnston did create an acceptable film, with compelling imagery and a unique tone. It just didn't reach any highs, and descended into normality after a strong start.Steve Rogers is a would-be superhero whose background I can relate to. A young man with confidence in his morals and ethical code, but without any kind of physical stature, often bullied for his meek disposition. He wants nothing other than to stand up against the oppressive Nazi regime and fight for his country, and would give anything to be on the front line. When given the opportunity by an experimental scientist Dr. Erskine (Stanley Tucci) to become the next step in engineered warfare, Rogers immediately accepts. Emerging intelligence discovers that the real enemy to the allied forces (and the entire planet) is Johann Schmidt (Weaving), an experiment gone wrong who has found the Tesseract: an object that can be used as a sustainable energy resource, or a catastrophic weapon. Rogers proves himself to be the only man who can stand against Schmidt, and save planet Earth from his grasp.The first hour of Captain America shapes up to be a very strong piece of cinema. Rogers' story is sympathetically presented, complimented by a sincere, resolute Evans who has come a long way from his performance as the Human Torch in the Fantastic Four films. Evans is supported well by Stanley Tucci and Tommy Lee Jones, and Hayley Atwell's Peggy Sue stamps down a marker as a strong female character, independent and liberated in her position. Unfortunately, cliché takes over in the second hour, and Peggy Sue falls for the hunky Captain America. I felt the strength of her character depleted the more Cap' achieved, his manliness forcing her into romantic submission. Things also became a bit boring, at several points I found my attention drifting elsewhere, but never really missed anything in the way of plot points or of my understanding of what was going on.The brilliant imagery of the World War II setting also faded as the film progressed; Schmidt's futuristic factories and technology looked out of place and too pristine for the time. Alas, had he harnessed the power of the Tesseract with the weaponry of the age, it might not have appeared silly.Schmidt himself was acceptably portrayed by the seasoned Hugo Weaving. His character's story and representation falls far short of other villains of the time (Ledger's Joker, Hiddlestone's Loki and both of Iron Man's antagonists) however, and he never really gets any reaction from you. The 'Heil Hydra' nonsense was just laughable, and was one of a couple of cringe-worthy things within the film (the other being the embarrassment of Roger's and Carter's flirtation).As mentioned, the imagery of Captain America and the visual effects were both strong points. A murky grey-brown colour palette created scenes reminiscent of the first colour war movies, breaking only for Cap's blue uniform, and for the red in Red Skull's make up and Agent Carter's dress. The camera work is great, especially for the slow-motion action segments, which were really cool to watch, and were unique within Marvel: Phase One. The score complimented the feel of old war films, however nothing was very inspiring, or very original for that matter. Silvestri definitely improved between Captain America and Avengers Assemble.Captain America never really got the film he needed to spearhead him towards his role in the Avengers. Despite some decent performances and a unique presentation, Captain America: The First Avenger suffers from some 'cringey' scenes that are out of placed in a more serious film, the lack of a commanding villain, and also from at times feeling like an old war film, with the exception of lasers and a costumed hero. Most disappointing however, was the sliding of what was a very promising start into predictability and mediocrity.Captain America: The First Avenger (2011)Allan's Score: 5.5/10",6,0,1,30 September 2013
Thor," www.thefilmbuffs.tumblr.com - SPOILERS
","'I never wanted the throne, I only ever wanted to be your equal!' – LokiMarvel: Phase One is hurtling along the Bifrost (Norse Rainbow Road) at break-neck speed towards the eagerly awaited Avengers Assemble. Hold on a second though, as we're still missing a character: the God of Thunder, Thor son of Odin. With Iron Man, Captain America and the Hulk's backgrounds already covered, Thor was the final major Avenger to appear on screen, and, similar to Black Widow's incorporation into Iron Man 2, we are introduced to the complete Avengers line-up by the end of Thor, as Clint Barton (Hawkeye) features in a small role as an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Onto the small task of giving Thor a strong foothold then; Kenneth Branagh was arguably given the most arduous pre-Avenger movie to direct, having to create a story spanning across several worlds. Whilst it doesn't stand up to Iron Man and Iron Man 2, Thor is a decent enough film in its own right, greatly helped along the way by a strong cast.Having disobeyed his father, King Odin (Hopkins), Thor (Hemsworth) is banished to Earth from his home realm of Asgard on war-mongering treason counts. Little brother Loki (Hiddlestone) becomes the de-facto heir to the throne. Whilst Thor tries to adjust to his human body and lifestyle, he meets an enchanting young scientist, Jane Foster (Portman), and gradually learns to quell his rash judgemental character. However, Loki has been secretly spinning a web to ensnare his extremely gullible blonde-haired brother, hatching a plot to wreak chaos wherever he possibly can.Positives first: Kenneth Branagh did a very good job directing this film. He successfully got the best he could out of his actors. Hemsworth is commanding, loud, and has a perfect grasp of the term 'fool-hardy'. He shares a workable chemistry with Portman (some awkward moments, but nothing drastic), and plays extremely well off of the brilliant Hiddlestone. The two on screen brothers have an essence of polar opposition; one a devious, sincere and resolute thinker with patience in abundance, the other a foolish, brutalising warrior with a thirst for blood and glory. I'd like to have seen more of their relationship explored though, especially with their father. The supporting cast are also largely accomplished, Skarsgard, Hopkins and Elba in particular. Unfortunately I have to harshly critique both the character of Darcy and her portrayer, Kat Dennings. Pointless. She should never have been written into the film in the first place and genuinely ruined every scene she was in by being generally annoying and interrupting of any positivity taking place. Thor's crew were also fairly weak, and were merely there to serve a purpose of providing him an ally, nothing more, nothing less.Storywise, Thor started very strongly; the mythical Lord of the Rings feel to the opening, and the exploration of Asgardian culture was all excellent, the visuals are mind-boggling to boot. The tone suggested at this point that Thor would be a sincere epic, detached from the general quirky Marvel superhero film feel. Enter Earth, and things change drastically. A let down at first, Thor's experiences on Earth are rife with comic relief, less in-your-face than Iron Man, but also less natural to the script. However, as the story develops, you begin to appreciate the change in tone between the two worlds as a representation of cultural differences. Branagh handles directing this complicated matter competently, but the story jumps around a bit too much to allow you to do the same (something I would suggest had something to do with the large number of writers). Along with a few questionable plot points (Loki knowing what Earthlings wear when he manifests himself onto the planet, Thor's regaining his powers from his comatose father's tear), the ending was fairly weak. Loki was beaten far too easily, and his story wasn't concluded properly, undeserving after a strong performance. The whole thing also felt a little rushed, possibly because the premise was to introduce Thor's background and set up his place in Avengers Assemble.Thor is a mixed bag with regard to music. Asgard is littered with grandiose and majestic passages of music that would grace much more artistic films, and are befitting of the fantastic CGI scenery they are accompanying. However, Patrick Doyle is forced to work with the jagged tone of the film, and had to sacrifice building on the epic Asgardian themes for something more fitting with a general superhero score on planet Earth: piano for the romantic moments, standard percussion heavy action music for combat scenes, and so on.Overall, Thor is an enjoyable film. You're not going to watch it if you're looking for something you have to immerse yourself within. It plays out exactly as a standard popcorn movie does: good guy versus bad guy, pretty, independent girl who suddenly is overcome by burly protagonist's masculinity etc. Where Thor excels beyond mediocrity is through its strong cast (Hiddlestone in particular), unbelievably stunning visuals (Asgard just blew me away) and a lack of reliance on action scenes to fill out the running time. It does, however, suffer from distinct changes in tone and disjointed plot elements, and a feeling of being three quarters finished due to the big rush towards Avengers Assemble.",7,2,4,30 September 2013
X-Men: First Class," www.thefilmbuffs.tumblr.com - SPOILERS
","'Let's just say I'm Frankenstein's monster and I'm looking for my creator' – Erik LehnsherrAfter the weak finale to the original trilogy and the shambles that was Wolverine's origins story, fans of the X-men universe would be more than entitled to feel apprehensive, perhaps even disinterested when plans to bring Professor X. and Magneto's back-stories to the big screen were announced. However, Bryan Singer was back on board as a writer and producer, and Matthew Vaughn was directing after enjoying success from critics for his work on 'Kick-Ass'. The result was astounding; a refreshing take on a series which had become littered with bit-part, pointless name-droppers, increasingly poor attempts at bad-ass one liners, and a worn out Wolverine who was carrying the series upon his beefy shoulders far too often. Everything from casting to score just worked in this film, not without its flaws/ weak points, but it must certainly go down as one of the greatest comic book films made to date, especially in the Marvel universe.In a familiar opening scene, a young Erik Lehnsherr's traumatic experience at the hands of the Nazis is revisited, this time introducing the icy, concise, ultimately powerful mutant, Sebastian Shaw. Erik awakens to his metal bending powers when Shaw murders his mother in front of him, showing that rage acts as medium through which his powers can be channelled. Elsewhere we see the juxtaposed, light-hearted story of the brilliant young Charles Xavier, and his childhood friend, Raven. An adult Lehnsherr's lifelong quest is to pursue and exact his revenge on Shaw, and when Xavier aligns with the US government to track Shaw (who is planting seeds to start a world war), the two young men meet and become fast friends. From here on out, the mutants become embroiled in the Western effort to prevent nuclear war during the 1960's Cold War era, whilst Shaw and his team use their abilities to force both sides hands into destroying humanity; then the world can belong to mutant- kind.Whilst the story of First Class remains largely unoriginal (evil mutant intent on ridding the world of humans), its presentation is what sets it apart from previous X-men films. Where we had dilution of the story and the principle actors in previous efforts from secondary characters (Storm, Sabretooth etc.), the 'sidekicks' in First Class have a genuine part to play in moving things along, and keep the film running at an appropriate pace, rather than slowing things down. At times, the young mutants-in-training detract from the darker tone of the film, which is slightly off putting, but bring colour and vibrance to other areas. The training scenes at Xavier's mansion in particular are artistically stylish, with each mutant's character being developed both physically and mentally in preparation for the films enthralling conclusion. A special mention goes out to Jennifer Lawrence, who, along with a much deeper script dragged Mystique from an underused piece of VFX eye candy into a commanding and dominant character, her chemistry with the rest of the cast is excellent, particularly Nicholas Hoult's Beast. On the side of the villains, January Jones also brings more substance behind Bacon's Shaw as indestructible telepath Emma Frost, which was something largely missing from Magneto's Brotherhood in the original trilogy.However, the genius of this film lies in the casting of Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy as the films protagonists. The chemistry between the pair is on par with Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, amplified by a far more mature and darker script, rife with room for emotional expression between the two. It's not often that the Superhero genre is graced with acting of such quality and profundity, and these two deliver in abundance. For reference, the scene where Xavier connects with Erik's mind at the mansion is one of the most powerful scenes I've seen on film, graced by a beautiful score from Henry Jackman.Kevin Bacon also performs ably as a villain, something that few could have predicted, however his scenes in the early stages of the film are much stronger, particularly those involving young Erik Lehnsherr (maybe it's the German language scenes). He gets a little lost in the exploration of Xavier and Erik's struggles late on, and is a little over-shadowed by their prominence at the conclusion, which was probably necessary for the story, but was ultimately a shame.A stand out factor in First Class is its score. In previous X-men titles, this has either been non-existent or larger than life and a little silly in places. Henry Jackman aligned his music with the darker tone of the film however, bringing elegant strings and upper register piano to poignant moments, and merging brass lead lines with dubstep/ electronic elements for action scenes. Like the score from 'Inception', Jackman also brings the electric guitar into a classical score in a style that just seems to work for creating a crisp edge whilst retaining majesty.X-men: First Class probably lacks the depth of plot and a better element of finality for its primary villain (though arguably the show is meant to be stolen from Shaw by the real villain in the X-men universe) to be considered a classic film, before even addressing the fact that it is a comic book adaptation. However, a darker tone which in places draws from 'Batman Begins', a refreshing setting complete with cold war espionage tactics and stylish news segments, a fantastic score and genius casting/ acting makes First Class, for me, one of the greatest comic book film adaptations ever.",9,0,2,30 September 2013
X2: X-Men United," www.thefilmbuffs.tumblr.com
","'It is a historical fact: sharing the world has never been humanity's defining attribute' – Charles XavierThe follow up to Bryan Singer's X-men is a true sequel in every sense of the word. Where other comic book films seek to introduce a clean slate for a new plot and major reshuffling of characters (mainly villains), X2 seamlessly snuggles into place from where its predecessor left off. My review for X-men dealt with the issues of a lack of character development and on screen chemistry. This was mainly an issue due to the heavy focus on the background for Singer's X-men world, detailing the mutant/human divide and the morals and intentions of the three factions of the series. X2 provided the emotional depth which the original film lacked, wrapped up within a multi-level, thicker plot leaving you wondering who 'the real bad guy' was.After an assassination attempt on the US president by an unknown mutant, the country is in a state of panic over the 'mutant problem'. William Stryker, a war veteran turned experimental scientist who holds a deep disdain for anything mutant, is intent on starting a war in retaliation, and has extracted information on the Cerebro device by torturing an imprisoned Magneto. Xavier is imprisoned in Stryker's secret base, and his school is assaulted by Stryker's soldiers, so it's up to the X-men , including new addition Nightcrawler, three novice students (Pyro, Iceman and Rogue), and Magneto to save the professor and stop Stryker from manipulating Xavier's psychic powers to destroy mutant-kind. Throughout the main storyline, Wolverine is also trying to find clues to unlock his past, and finds out that Stryker is the key to doing so. Rogue and Iceman experience their own troubles of a mutant relationship, showing that superpowers aren't always a good thing to possess.X2 is long. It clocks in at over two hours, half an hour longer than the original. The level of character development is such that it really needs to be (initially), everything up until the final showdown at the secret Alkali Lake base deals with building upon the foundations of personas created three years previously.Wolverine, again the central figure of the film, has become the animalistic loose cannon he is known for thanks to good script writing and choreography in action scenes. The scene where he disposes of a squad of soldiers sent to attack Xavier's mansion is an incredible action scene with some fantastic stunts and brutal claw-work. Jackman brings much more angst to the role, perhaps because of Wolverine's frustration over his forgotten past, yet also becomes a rock for vulnerable, younger characters. Whether it's physically protecting the students or being a confidant to Bobby or Marie, Jackman excels and stamps his authority on this film as the lead actor.A disappointing factor for Wolverine is that his story is diluted with the main storyline to this film, however, his relationship with Jean Grey blossoms beyond just flirtation from X-men; unfortunately Cyclops largely isn't a part of this story, which is disappointing due to proved on-screen chemistry between Marsden and Jackman. We do see some well acted scenes between the pair at the films conclusion, however. Marsden's performance at this stage poses the question as to why he didn't play as big a role in the film's lengthier mid-section, alas the story did not require his presence.Famke Janssen also steps up greatly, and isn't just a damsel in emotional distress caught between two big strong men. Storm's character develops to an extent. Berry plays well off of new member to the team, Nightcrawler, who brings a sense of freshness to the X-men line-up. Although Storm has a bit more to say and do in this film, she really isn't one of the stronger characters, ironic that she and Cyclops are generally considered to be Xavier's second and third in line.As for the two old adversaries, Stewart and McKellen can't be scrutinised at all for their roles as Professor X and Magneto. Magneto slightly deviates from the role of a crazed dictator bent on world domination, breaking character to add some catty dialogue when he reluctantly aligns with the X-men to tackle the common enemy that is Stryker. However, this enhances the idea behind this film and its predecessor that the 'bad guy' always has a redeeming portion to their persona; no one is completely unlikable or has no reason for their character flaws.Storywise, X2 has the right amount of complexity for it to be considered a great improvement on X-men. Devious tactics, double-crossing and a touch of politics gives the right amount of depth to colour the basic plot of mutants teaming up to stop the evil human. Thankfully, the score also got a much needed revamp this time around. John Ottoman brings a larger than life, dramatic feel to the film with his music; where it may be a bit over the top in some places, in comparison to the dark, emotion-tugging Batman trilogy's score, it certainly was a big step in the right direction from what was musical non-existence in X-men.My one major criticism is over length; even though it's all action for the film's final thirty minutes or so, time seems to drag on. There are some needless scenes involving Rogue, Pyro and Iceman (why couldn't they have been part of the action?) in the X-Jet, and Wolverine's story intertwining with that of the rest of the cast gets a little confusing on top of all the action taking place. That said, the entertainment value of the film makes it quite enthralling, easily the most engrossing of the original trilogy.X2 (2003)Allan's Score: 7/10",7,0,1,30 September 2013
