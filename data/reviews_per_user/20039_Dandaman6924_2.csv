The Rock," Classic Action Movie
","This movie is all a man could hope for in a movie these days. Action packed, but followed with a meaningful story that relates to today. The harsh reality is, what takes place within the movie is not too far off from what could happen in reality. I feel that if anyone fears domestic terrorism as well as foreign terrorism, this movie is a must see, while it bends the facts a tad for action and interest sake, its central story is compelling and thought-provoking.The best quote of this movie: 'This isn't about terrorism, this about justice. It's about reminding you people of something you find politically convenient to forget.'-General Hummel",10,117,155,5 November 2004
The Village," Decent movie but a total rip off of a book
","While the movie was a little short of my expectations, it was overall a very solid movie. I don't like that people are ripping the director. His first film, The Sixth Sense, was by far his best, but his other movies are still very solid. If it hadn't been for his first, people would be singing his praises even more.However, I thought this movie was a total rip off of a book a read a long time ago called, 'Running Out of Time.' Toward the end of the movie, I really starting thinking of the correlations between the two, and in the end, realized I was right.I still think it was a solid movie and recommend it to people, if not in the theatre, definitely when it comes out to video and DVD.7/10",7,0,0,26 August 2004
