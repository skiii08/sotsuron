The Devil's Advocate," For Whom was this Movie Made?
","Coming near the end of the 1990s, 'The Devil's Advocate' might well have been a parable about that decade's unmitigated greed and selfishness. However, it seems unlikely that anyone in Hollywood thinks greed and selfishness are negative things, especially the latter.  In a day when even mainline Christians and Jews downplay the devil or even subscribe to the theory that 'he' is a convenient allegory of evil (some, unfamiliar with the Talmud, even maintain that this figure isn't even a part of orthodox Judaism).That a serious movie was made about the evil one was made at all is an achievement.  Although few movies, fortunately, fall for the gnostic gnonsense that the devil is an anti-God, the archetypical figure of evil is more often played for laughs ('Bedazzled', 'Poor Devil') or as a misunderstood fellow who's not so bad but fell in with a bad crowd.It's hardly a spoiler to mention that Al Pacino plays the devil in this film.  After all, though the film begins slowly and gradually works to that revelation, the title and all the advertisements even at the time of the film's release hardly kept it a secret.Pacino makes a good devil.  Over the top, yes, but he's playing a figure who, once an angel, rebelled against God, fosters the evil within humans, and who, knowing he's ultimately defeated, wishes to destroy as many humans as he can, either bodily or spiritually.  'The twentieth century was entirely mine,' he says, and, mulling over twelve million killed in Nazi Germany (including six million of God's chosen people);  ten times that killed in the Soviet Union;  God only knows how many under Mao or the Khmer Rouge . . . and not just the deaths, but incredible selfishness, greed, vanity, pride . . . one wonders about the truth of that.However, with so few people in the know about who the devil really is, out of touch with the theology, relying on imbecile notions of a figure in horns and a pointy tail, or vague ideas of a lingering Manichaean dualism, they can't understand that the devil is a liar;  and with no unarbitrary ideas of right and wrong, and little sense of an actual metaphysical world beyond their senses, a modern audience may wonder why a little success should be considered evil.And why a lawyer?  In the 1990s lawyers, already disliked intensely, made themselves even more disliked.  James Stewart in 'Anatomy of a Murder', Gregory Peck in 'To Kill a Mockingbird', Raymond Burr's Perry Mason -- people with callings, trying to uncover the truth and fight evil even at the cost of their careers -- are quaint figures of the past.  The country is divided over whether O.J. is guilty or innocent, but rather closer in disdain for his 'dream team';  a slick lawyer president slips out of a perjury rap everyone knows he committed by questioning the definition of 'is';  tobacco companies send out lawyers in battalions to keep America safe for emphysema.  The old joke tells how the devil appeared to a lawyer, promising him success in court, a great political career, and even the presidency, if only he will give the devil his soul;  the lawyer thinks a moment and says, 'What's the catch?'  Perhaps a diabolical take on 'The Fountainhead', making the devil's prey an architect deferring to evil through pride . . .  But Keanu is a lawyer, and we're stuck with it, and we're supposed to have some sympathy for him.  Talk about suspension of disbelief!A serious movie about a subject materialistic people can't take seriously seems to be a work in vain.  And people who believe in the devil, even those who are less theologically sound no the subject, probably won't enjoy this movie.The writers seems uncertain about the Pacino character.  Though he gives an interesting speech about God, and though the one thing people do know about the devil is that he's a liar, he's never confronted in any way about his lack of truthfulness (in fact, most books and movies about the devil show him as being truthful in a lawyerish way, giving what people want but always finding legitimate loopholes to make their lives miserable).  And they didn't spend enough time on the idea of a parable.  Perhaps they were in a hurry, or confused parable with allegory, which -- to some extent correctly -- has fallen out of favor these days and looked on askance.Of course, the production values are nice.  Only the best for Satan.  And there are nice touches.  John Milton's (Pacino) offer to Lomax (Reeves) is made on a Manhattan rooftop, similar to the temptation of Christ -- only Lomax accepts.  But a lot of the effects and some of the horror is pointless, done seemingly for the sake of slipping it in. The non-horror parts are the best.  Judith Ivey's religious mother, whose dialogue starts out sounding wacky but make's more and more sense, is the best.  Pacino brings out the heavy artillery.  Keanu is not particularly good, but he isn't expected to do much other than look cold, and react to Pacino.  That he doesn't sound 'southern' at all is no problem -- by the 1990s the south is so homogenized accents are almost extinct;  and besides, they should only be done by the British, like Kenneth Branagh, whose accent in 'The Gingerbread Man' is the best southern accent on film (some British accents are close kin to the old southern accent).All in all, 'The Devil's Advocate' is a noble failure, probably worthy of being seen once by open-minded viewers, and having its watered-down points and limp attempts at meaning discussed at least for a few minutes at Starbuck's afterward, and perhaps some consideration to what the unseen John Miltons are encouraging in our own lives that may be hurting others.  But a better movie could have, and should have, been made (has anyone ever thought of having priests and rabbis in to give a considered view of the evil one?)",Null,1,2,3 April 2001
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Future Will Be More Generous
","The most anticipated film of all time, if it was a cross between THE GODFATHER, GONE WITH THE WIND and CASABLANCA it could not have lived up to exectations.  The peculiar plot, based not on someone taking over the Galaxy but over some trade difficulties (that came to the attention of the GTO, the Galaxy Trade Organization, I presume) that might've come out of Kissenger's DIPLOMACY. Unfamiliar characters, in the main, except for R2D2, Yoda and Palpatine (other familiar characters we know appear, but in such different incarnations that they're unfamiliar), make the movie a little less accessible than the last two 'Star Wars' movies.The film contains many weaknesses.  The most glaring and often indicated is the Rastafarian Jar-Jar, perhaps the most annoying character in movie history.  Yet the kiddies loved him, so perhaps Lucas knew what he was doing (making money-wise, and that's what movies are all about).  The pod race is also annoying -- not the race so much as 1) the announcer, who sounds like he couldn't make it in NASCAR, and 2) the fact that we know who's going to win.  Darth Vader's origins were too suspiciously and needlessly Messianic (I suspect Palpatine, or someone like him, met Darth's mother in a bar and played the ol' Jedi mind trick on her).  And the origins of C-3PO are unbelievable (though they may explain a few of his personality quirks). The promising Liam Neeson remained unengaging and talked more egregious mystical blather than anyone in the film so far (at least Alec Guinness, who hated 'Star Wars' and thought the 'force' talk was unadulterated foolishness, nevertheless was so professional that he gave it unparalleled sincerity) But we have to remember, keeping the faults in mind, that Lucas is preparing a solid base to support the rest of his vision.  The film had, of necessity, to be slower and with more loose ends, and he shows the descent of Palpatine and Vader.Strengths are Lucas' realizations of new worlds, especially, whatever we think of the inhabitants, his under-sea civilization.  The Senate Chamber was a masterful (and vertigo-inducing) stroke.  The Jedi Council, though underused in this film, gave us hope for the movies yet to come.  Mace Windu, merely making a bow in PHANTOM MENACE, lifted the production significantly.  And Ewan McGregor's Alec Guinness impersonation was pretty good.The greatest problem with the film, perhaps inspiring much of its dislike, is that it caused a paradigm shift that will forever change our view of the series.  If Lucas had been able to give us the final trilogy (which now Lucas says he never intended), the shift might've been mitigated.  THE GODFATHER SAGA may be seen as stories of Don Corleone and Michael.  STAR WARS cannot now be the story of Darth Vader/Luke Skywalker.  Luke has been relegated to a supporting role, and Han Solo's stock has declined even farther.  Whether we even realize it or not, the hero of the 'Star Wars' saga is no longer Luke Skywalker.  All the movies, from now on, will be just episodes in the life of Darth Vader.Yet future generations, who did come come in watching the series backwards, but who can see all six films in a boxed set of whatever replaces DVDs, will see a very solid series of six good films whose stories get better as they roll along (I like ewoks).  And, like it or not, this is George Lucas' vision.  If we want our vision on the screen we'd better come up with a couple of hundred million simoleans and have good blarney to persuade some cynical producer that however much you spend on production, you'll be able to make a hundred times in action figure sales.",Null,0,1,18 July 2001
Spartacus," Overkill
","'Spartacus' is an overrated spectacle whose parts (and there are many good ones) are better than its whole.It starts out well with Douglas becoming a gladiator and learning the ins and outs of the business.  But after the revolt, all the slave scenes become unbearably tedious.The Romans steal the movie.  The politics, the backstabbing, the jockeying. The Romans also are better actors, and their scenes are done with a wry humor.  In one scene with Peter Ustinov's and Charles Laughton's characters are sharing a meal, and each of the actors desperately trying to outact each other -- and better acting you're rarely likely to see as the old ham and the up and coming ham both try to steal the scene.Olivier's Crassus is also notable.  In fact, some of the slave scenes are so cloying and tiresome one winds up rooting for the Romans.  The slaves scenes are enlivened occasionally by the arrival of Herbert Lom (Inspector Dreyfus).  So, many good scenes (especially the climactic battle), many good performances, some fine writing here and there, but ultimately boring with the people who should be most interesting and sympathetic, the revolting slaves who are willing to die for the cause of freedom.",Null,16,28,12 December 2003
Shakespeare in Love," A Fun Little Movie, with Reservations
","This is an fun little movie, and a fine companion piece to 'Rosencrantz' by Stoppard.  It's full of humor and romance and all the acting is first-rate. Lots of little 'in' jokes please those of us who love Shakespeare, and there are lots of insane little touches (an Elizabethan psychologist, for instance) give it levels of meaning.  One quibble:  there's too much graphic sex, most of it thrown in as a cheap laugh.  This makes it quite unsuitable for children, who would probably be well served by this movie if they could see it, as an introduction to Shakespeare as the equally unrealistic (and exquisite) 'Amadeus' was to the music of Mozart.  It should've gotten an NC-17 rating for these absolutely unnecessary shenanigans.  Sex in movies is always funnier, and also more romantic and even sexier, when it's implied rather than shown (and here I don't refer to the scenes between Shakespeare and Viola, but we see more of Gwyneth Paltrow than is absolutely necessary. Other than that, it's a fine movie for adults, and if they are literate and not snobbish (a rather slim number, but we're out there) it is an enjoyable sex romp.",10,0,1,23 July 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," The Makers of this Film Need Your Money More than You Do
","The cleverest -- and, curiously enough, the most offensive -- thing about the 'South Park' movie was in tacking on a mendacious 'message' about free speech:  a cheap gimmick for sanctimonious self-justification, letting the writers masquerade their shortcomings as virtues (they can't come up with anything better than to repeat words they think are 'naughty';  and they probably giggled the whole time they wrote it, not only at their childish 'naughtiness' but at those who would get suckered in and throw their -- or their parents' -- hard-earned money at it).  Fans of this movie should save their $$$ and create their own fun by making milk squirt out their nose, or by kicking the crutches out from under a cripple, or 'experimenting' on a puppy, or taking a mirror to their outhouses to watch themselves defecate. If you think the Constitution needs protecting, defend Constitutional amendments legitimately in danger, like the Second and the Tenth;  if, on the other hand, you just want to go laugh at stupid noisomeness, fine -- but don't weary the rest of us with the pretense that a movie with no redeeming social value, pandering to people whose sense of humor has never graduated second grade and who have no self-respect, is somehow defending fundamental freedoms.  'South Park' has its share of laughs, depending on what group you hate enough to laugh at;  but when it makes its mawkish preachments it only induces nausea.",1,2,23,6 July 1999
Chicken Run," Pretty Good
","As a big Wallace and Grommit fan, I eagerly awaited this chick flick.  And the technique is exquisite.  It starts off very well and ends in a burst of excitement.  The only problem is that it may sag a little too much in the middle for young children (or old people like me).  While the running time may be a little long (it would be worth paying full ticket price if it had been only an hour in length), causing it to drag at times, it nevertheless is a remarkable achievement whose pluses will invariably outweigh its piddling minuses.A word about some of the namby-pamby reviewers.  We coddle our children too much.  We're afraid they'll have nightmares.  We shelter them from the idea that there's pain in the world.  How many people remember the horror of Disney's 'Snow White'?  I was scared to death, seeing it as a kid, yet I'm perfectly normal.  Sure, there's a chicken beheading, but it's necessary to make the threat of the Tweedys clear. Otherwise the obsession with escape doesn't make a lot of sense to the modern liberal mind, where sitting around, being fed by the owners (or government), even without freedom, is the goal.  After all, the hens, for the most part, didn't know they weren't free;  only one dreamer (Ginger) suspected there was more to life than what she'd always known.  The same people who object to even the hint that one of the hens died a violent death probably don't object to exposing their kids to bad language and sexual stuff, blatant or innuendo.  The execution is what makes the movie works, and children of all ages should see it. Besides, it happens early on and they'll get over it.  So get over it.",Null,0,0,5 September 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Rubbish
","The 'Star Wars' saga always had its faults, with wooden acting, clichÃ©d plots, eye rolling moments, cheap puns, etc. But 'Star Wars' and its immediate successors also had characters, and one had an emotional investment with those characters. The early effects looked bad (seeing the movie when it first came out in the '70s one thought the Cantina scene looked like a bad Friday night Halloween party). But they had real people moving through real space, often on obvious sets (you can't make an orbiting death star look like anything but a set, so let's cut them some slack). 'Phantom Menace' and 'Clones' suffered from the same faults as listed in the first sentence, but 'PM' had the more egregious faults of the stupid pod-race and the annoying kid. 'Clones' had so many digital effects it stopped looking like real people inhabiting real spaces, but a cartoon with live-action, like the Toonville of Roger Rabbit. Lucas does effects better than anyone and there are wonderful moments of digital technology in this movie, but creating whole worlds and digital characters makes it look too cartoony, especially when real people leap off buildings or when characters get stuck on some sort of Rube Goldberg conveyor belt. Perhaps it's because 'Clones' stuck in the middle of a Trilogy, but the storyline went nowhere. And does anyone really give a hang for Anakin or Padme? They're supposed to be the heart of the movie and they feel more like pinballs in George Lucas' great arcade.",1,3,8,25 May 2005
Doctor Zhivago," SPOILERS AHEAD
","WARNING:  SPOILERSDavid Lean was so brilliant a film maker one doesn't so much watch as live his movies.  This was true on 'The Bridge on the River Kwai', and 'Lawrence of Arabia'.  Those two Oscar-winning movies were produced by Sam Spiegel, who kept a close eye on expenses and on Lean's excesses.  If the deserts look slightly different from the first half of 'Lawrence' to the last, it's because Spiegel found shooting in Arabia too expensive and moved the production to Spain.'Doctor Zhivago' was produced by Carlo Ponti.  After finding out Lean didn't want Ponti's wife, Sophia Loren, for Lara, he gave Lean a free hand and stayed out of the process (if my wife was the 1960s Sophia Loren I'd not be bothered with such trivialities myself).The unrestrained Lean shows signs of the descent that would result in 'Ryan's Daughter', a misunderstood but nevertheless overblown film.  But Lean does extremely well with 'Zhivago', considering what he had to work with as a source.For it's the story that's really the film's only problem.  The novel DOCTOR ZHIVAGO was banned in the Soviet Union for too realistic a look at the 1917 Revolution and its aftermath.  In a country like the USA it's difficult to understand this sort of repression (read Solzhenitsyn's THE OAK AND THE CALF and THE GULAG ARCHIPELAGO for more examples).  Author Boris Pasterak won a Nobel Prize for literature for his literary courage, a prize the USSR refused to let him accept, without exile.   But courageous as the book was, perhaps due to the vicissitudes of writing a book one fears may send one to a slave labor camp if it's found, the novel has a miserable structure.  It takes place over a long period of time, with quantum leaps from one place, time, and character to another.  Like many Russian novels, it's brimming with colorful but otherwise poorly-limned characters.  The first major challenge was finding a structure and themes and then whittling the book down to a manageable size for a film of three hours.  Robert Bolt did a masterful job and won a well-deserved Oscar.  One of the (few) joys in reading the novel these days is finding what tidbits he borrowed from various characters in order to build the memorable figures who somehow emerge from Lean's broadly-knitted tapestry of a movie and stand out as real people.  Robert Bolt's script was a masterpiece, though it's hard to appreciate without a familiarity with the poorly-structured novel.
The cast is a exceptional.  When you have capable actors like Guinness, Courtenay, Richardson, and Steiger in support, it hardly matters whom you have as leads.  Both Sharif and Christie, as Zhivago and Lara, are beautiful and sultry;  both have a powerful screen presence that compensates for their inexperience as actors.SPOILER SECTION (LAST WARNING):  Like the novel, the movie focuses on a small group of characters who weave in and out of each other's lives. They may disappear for long stretches, only to reappear in coincidences worthy of Dickens.  Alec Guinness, mostly relegated to the job as narrator of flashbacks, pops into the movie only occasionally, but always with wonderful panache (watch that bit he does with the flower during the parade).  Rod Steiger vanishes before the end of the first hour, but bobs back up with a memorable few moments at the end that make the movie.  Tom Courtenay disappears slightly after the first hour, reappears in a brief scene about forty minutes later, then is gone forever, though he's mentioned a few times.  This is where the biggest mistake was made in the movie. Courtenay's character commits suicide near the end, as is related by Rod Steiger's character, who takes obvious relish in the details. Robert Bolt thought Courtenay's character should actually reappear at the last house where Zhivago and Lara are shacked up;  read Zhivago's poems;   see all the Revolutionary blather he's spouted about the end of 'the personal life in Russia' for the nonsense it is;  and then shoot himself.  Lean preferred to do it the way he presents in the finished film, with Courtenay's suicide being known through hearsay and unconnected to the central love story. According to Bolt's account, Lean later admitted he was wrong. This was a crucial mistake that almost wrecks the picture, and Lean should've listened to Robert Bolt.  The fact is, the ending isn't as dreary as people think because of the winding down of the love story, but because at the end, until Rod Steiger pops in again like a jack in the box to add a little life to the movie, the film is carried at the end section by Sharif and Christie, who, pretty though they are, seem to miss their magnificent supporting players. Courtenay's reappearance at this juncture, as was Steiger's, would've been a breath of fresh air in a slowly stifling ending, and it would've wound up the Strelnikov character far more satisfactorily (I wouldn't second-guess Lean had I not read Bolt's account of Lean second-guessing himself).Things to watch for:  the cavalry charge on the lake (actually filmed in the summer);  the dragoon assault on the marchers led by Tom Courtenay, looking like I want to remember him always;  a remarkably subtle performance by Geraldine Chaplin as Zhivago's wife;  and the lay of the land.  David Lean's epic vision includes all the earth and its beauties, and Freddie Young's cinematography is at its peak (Young won five well deserved Oscars, for 'Lawrence', 'Zhivago', 'Ryan's Daughter', 'Nicholas and Alexandra' and 'Ivanhoe').  Without Young, Lean couldn't have been Lean.  Nobody can film a daffodil, or footsteps across an ice field, or a train approaching from the distance, quite as well as David Lean.  If possible, GET THE WIDESCREEN VERSION OF ALL HIS EPICS, otherwise you lose as much as two-thirds of what Lean had to share with us.It's absurd to judge movies in comparison with other movies, but as far as Lean's epics go, 'Zhivago' lacks the cohesion in 'Bridge on the River Kwai' and 'Lawrence of Arabia', the former with its tension between Saito and Nicholson;  and the latter with its focus on the title character.  But as a soap-operaish love story, nothing beats 'Doctor Zhivago', which does for t he Russian Revolution what 'Gone with the Wind' did for the Civil War (i.e., relegate it to the background for its sweeping tale of a woman loved by many men -- only this time a nice one).",Null,2,4,22 February 2002
Saving Private Ryan," SS steals from 'Blair Witch'
","The first several minutes (after an introductory scene) show a vivid description of D-Day on one of the beaches invaded by American forces. Anyone who has read Cornelius Ryan's _The Longest Day_ already has images like those in his head (read the book, it's one of the best histories ever written).  It starts the problem.  There's too much of a jerky-camera effect.  It's acceptable in the battle scene, but hardly in the rest of the movie, rendering it unwatchable for people like me.What I did see was a pretty fair fictional story based on a true story.  Of course, a director like SS is hardly going to tell just a story, but has an agenda he's working behind the scenes, manipulating us into some snare or other where we have to accept his worldview on things.  After all, we just *saw* it -- so it must be that way, right?Unfortunately, I couldn't see enough of it because of the camera work to try to decipher his hidden agenda.  I don't even know how the movie came out, and frankly I don't care.  Cloying as SS is in all his movies, this film is curiously unengaging, and the characters show little advance (Nazi, American GI) from the 'Indiana Jones' films, which are still his best achievements.",1,10,24,12 November 2001
Amadeus," Great Movie Despite Silly Premise
","The window-dressing (halls, clothing, lighting, etc.) lend 'Amadeus' an appearance that is scrumptious, and looks extremely accurate. All the scenic design is icing on a delicious cake half-baked on a silly premise, that Mozart(presented almost like an idiot savant, with emphasis on the first word) is -- and here's the spoiler, if there's a person on the planet who doesn't know -- 'murdered' by fellow composer Antonio Salieri. That 'Amadeus' isn't like a hollow Faberge egg with a dumb morality tale rattling around inside it is a tribute to the artists behind this wonderful movie.Antonio Salieri is the pop sensation of his day. He has the approval of the emperor, the friendship of the court, the adulation of the masses. He lives in palaces, moves with the 'in' crowd, and the fame and adulation keep rolling in. He has a burning ambition to be the best -- and for everyone to know it. He has everything . . . except talent.He hears distantly of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, boy prodigy, and he hopes one day to meet this musical marvel and strike up a friendship with a fellow artiste. When the fabled Mozart finally crosses his path, Salieri is appalled by the young man's vulgarity and his lack of appreciation for the finer things.Yet when Salieri hears Mozart's music, he desperately desires the one thing Mozart has that he himself lacks: musical genius. This comes through powerfully later in the film when Salieri tricks Mozart's wife into bringing him Mozart's 'originals' -- page after page of rough draft music that was written out finished, and beautiful, and better than anything Salieri himself could even do (this is the most famous scene in the movie and may have been instrumental in winning for Abraham his deserved Oscar). And when Salieri learns Mozart had been fiddling around with his girl, he earnestly hates Mozart with an earnest detestation.Though he refers to Mozart as a 'creature' he envies him. Mozart has proved that everything in his life is superficial, and that he has never, and probably will never, produce anything of lasting value. Just as everything in his life has been outward show, he easily abandons his superficial religious faith. Instead of disbelieving in a Deity who could dispense His gifts to such a man as Mozart, Salieri's envy and hate sets him on a course to 'punish' God by ridding the earth of the creature that makes such pretty noises. And he will gain public admiration forever by authoring a requiem for his 'friend' -- though, in his wry sense of irony, Salieri will make W.A. Mozart actually write the thing before he kills him off.Salieri performs several little cruelties on his way to the ultimate cruelty. The restored DVD version gives a scene where Salieri savagely humiliates Mozart's wife, Constanze.It is not clear if Salieri the anti-God actually killed Mozart or if it was the natural order of things, but Salieri gets his comeuppance, his own 'Confutatis maledictis' that is helped along by the more savvy Constanze, who knows what sort of man Salieri really is. The scene where Salieri and Mozart hammer out the Mass is one of the most exciting scenes of cinema in the '80s -- with one man sitting at a desk and the other lying in a bed! In real life, Antonio Salieri was an accomplished musician, many of whose works remain in print. His stuff fell out of favor -- but Vivaldi predated Mozart and Salieri, and his music was barely heard after his death until the 20th century! Musical tastes change -- how many discotheques are open in the 21st century? Not as many as in the 1970s, I warrant. And there are ample implications in the historical record that Salieri and Mozart got along quite well. So the story inside the beautiful decor is a libelous fiction -- in fact, it's a lot of hooey. But when have novels or films cared for historical fact over a cracking good story? And it's probably more correct to call it a parable.Mozart and Salieri aren't really meant to be embodiments of their real-life counterparts. Salieri is an archetype. And if Mozart was this much of a bozo in real life he deserved all he got.All the performances are wonderful, especially in the Emperor's court. Charles Kay is superb, Jonathan Moore is the epitome of sincerity, and Jeffrey Jones expresses more by his extreme underplaying than many more notable actors do in several movies of bluster. Sometimes you wonder if someone ought to take Jones' pulse, but you're always aware of what the emperor is thinking.The two majors are amazing. Tom Hulce's pixilated Mozart and F. Murray Abraham's envious Salieri are so good they could've carried the movie if it had been a two-man show, a 'My Dinner with Wolfie'",10,3,6,25 April 2006
Chariots of Fire," Wonderful Evocation of the Era of Sportsmanship
","Understated as it is, 'Chariots of Fire' may not be to every taste.  For instance, one has to be a devotee of Gilbert and Sullivan to understand some of the nuances.  The acting is uniformly superb.  Old veterans (Ian Holm, John Gielgud, Patrick Magee, Nigel Davenport) lend support to rising new faces (Ben Cross, Ian Charleson, Nicholas Farrell, Nigel Havers) as young runners preparing for the 1924 Paris Olympics.  The era of true sportsmanship is evoked, when the Olympics meant more than it does today.  The trainer of Harold Abrahams, Sam Mussabini (Ian Holm in a delightfully crafted supporting role) is not even allowed in the Olympic stadium in Paris because he is a professional.The two main runners, Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross) and Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson) wrestle not only with their extensive training, but with principle.  Abrahams is a Jew striving to overcome his society's anti-Semitism by out-running them -- as well as his inner demons. Liddell, training as a Christian missionary (he would later die in a Chinese prison camp after the second World War), runs for God but is confronted by a matter of principle that tests whether his devotion is to his God or his sport (and his country).The changes the script made from history, necessary for telling a story and building dramatic tension, are pointed out in this movie more than they are for other films that build their stories on history, such as 'Braveheart' or 'Becket' (Thomas Becket wasn't Saxon, for instance).  It's well-known that Abrahamson wasn't as pestered by anti-Semitism as the movie portrays, and Liddell knew about his Sunday race well ahead of time.  Good story-telling necessitates such changes.  The film should not be viewed as strictly biographical but as a study of dedication, both to sport and to faith, and how two very different, but equally devoted, young men deal with the dilemmas of their devotion.The acting is uniformly excellent.  The famous (twenty years ago, ubiquitous) Vangelis score, at first distracting, becomes inseparable from the visual images on repeated viewings.  The movie has a deliberate pace and makes no concession to the modern 'summer movie' audience.  There are no explosions, no one is killed, and there's also no 'villain' in the conventional sense as Abrahams and Liddell struggle to confront and overcome their sublimated challenges to achieve  personal victories.The film is well shot.  The opening visual, of the young Olympians running along the shore, has become iconic.  The races are all shot differently. Since the runners are sprinters and their races are over quickly, slo-mo is used extensively.  Nevertheless, every race has a distinct look and they never seem redundant.  Vangelis is also a great help setting each race differently.One caveat:  the movie begins with and unnecessary framing device and two (or is it three?) flashbacks, the first from a memorial service to the run on the beach and the horns that announce Vangelis' theme;  and the second after the opening credits.  After these false starts, the movie settles into a leisurely pace as it carefully unrolls the intertwined stories of Abrahams and Liddell and their struggles trying to buck the rigid conformity of their society (for though nominally Christian, Liddell fights against the system every inch as much as Abrahams, finding as he does that the opprobrious term 'fanatic' was applied to those who actually try to live out what they say they believe when the intangibles of faith comes into conflict with the reality of society's norms.)A feel-good movie for anyone who enjoys true competition, and well worthy of the accolades heaped upon it after its release.",10,5,8,19 July 2004
The Godfather: Part III," Not as Bad as You've Heard
","Though no fan of gangster movies, I find the Corleones keep pulling me back in.  The Godfather, of course, is the best free-standing movie of Coppola's series, and no sequels were necessary in Puzo's and Coppola's extremely well done near-parody, where a gangster story is raised to the levels of Shakespearean tragedy.  Once Part 2 was made, Part 3 was an eventual necessity, as a coda.  Taken together, the series raises the gangster story to Homeric proportions and makes all other mob flicks glitter like glass compared to Coppola's diamond.Welcome in this movie were the Byzantine Vatican intrigues -- and the portrayal of at least one true man of faith (perhaps the last ever to appear in a mainstream movie).  Eli Wallach made a fine addition to the series. The cinematography, as always, was  gorgeous. Less than welcome:  the fact that Robert Duvall turned it down (it would've been nice for him to have a respectable death scene), and the fact that, good though the film is, the typical bloodbath at the end is confusing.  The very very very end scene is cheapened the movie and the series. 
The major problem is focus.  There are simply too many loose strands in this yarn, and it was understandably difficult to tie the ragged ends together. Then, this movie is simply too dependent on what came before, which gives it nary a chance to stand on its own.",Null,1,2,6 March 2000
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Not What the Title Implies
","One of the great novels of the English speaking world is Bram Stoker's DRACULA.  Although filmed too many times to count, and burdened by the trappings of too many bad films that almost make it camp, there is a richness and quality to the book that has never been captured.  Although Coppola makes a good stab here, restoring characters like Arthur, and trying to go by the book (the Bela Lugosi version was based on a play, as was the Frank Langella version), the script strays too far.  The biggest problem is an attempt to compromise with evil.  We forget how up-to-date the novel was because it was written 100 years ago.  But Mina used a typewriter;  Dr. Seward kept his journal on phonograph records;  Jonathan Harker referred in the novel to the modern 19th century.  Characters thought themselves as modern and up to date and civilized as we do today.  Dracula is a power figure, slowing showing himself as vastly evil, and he is transported from the rustic mountains of his homeland to (what was to the book's first readers) a modern, non-superstitious, workaday metropolis in England.  It's probably impossible to recapture that spirit in a movie because of moviegoers' preconceptions.  Nevertheless, the backstory (ridiculous whether there's a grain of truth to it or not;  you cannot really draw dots to connect Vald the Impaler with the Stoker's powerful Count) and the threads from it running through the story arc, detracts from the story.  In the book Dracula starts out an avuncular figure who evolves into a fearsome vampire, with a mixed crew of thoroughly modern people -- including a psychiatrist, a solicitor, a secretary, and several upper-class party-people -- reluctantly finding themselves as the ones with the burden to rid the world of the evil. Coppola compromises with evil.  Yet a vampire is, by nature, a soulless body that subsists by drinking the blood of the living, and multiplying its kind.  Dracula is one of the most powerful figures in all literature, and the evil he represents transcends merely individual bloodsucking.  That Coppola chooses to give us a kinder, gentler Dracula, and chooses to make compromises with evil (he may be a bloodsucking monster, but he has feelings!) in a way that may be indicative of society as a whole, but which perverts Stoker's entire point and inverts his characters, making Dracula 'misunderstood' and those out to destroy them as self-righteous prigs.The movie's cast is varied.  Anthony Hopkins is extremely over the top as van Helsing, but gives a good performance for all his fireworks (I suppose one who spends his nights hunting vampires is entitled to be a little looney).  Tom Waits was a brilliant casting choice.  Keanu is the only actor who seems totally lost at sea, and weighted down by his phoney English accent.The cinematography is the only part of the movie that works.  Although Coppola's camera-tricks become a bit tiresome the fifth or sixth time you've seen them, 'Dracula' is a beautifully photographed movie. 
One despairs of ever seeing a version of 'Dracula' that truly does present Stoker's story.  The Louis Jourdan version, half-videotaped, is far superior to this, and Jourdan doesn't appear as the kindly old host at the beginning, and the character of Arthur is, as usual, lost.  Judi Bowker, however, is a far superior Mina than the pouting Winona Ryder.",Null,0,1,21 October 1999
Signs," A Masterpiece (MASSIVE SPOILERS)
","(Warning:  There are SPOILERS ahead)'Signs' underscores the blatant hypocrisy of critics of summer movies. They complain that summer blockbusters use noise and explosions in lieu of plot and are rarely thoughtful.  'Signs' is an extremely thoughtful summer blockbuster, and one that relies on mood and indirection, the way Spielberg built 'Jaws', or they way Hitchcock constructed his suspense movies.  The problem?  Well, the thoughtfulness of 'Signs' takes a different direction than critics like.Father Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) is having a crisis of faith after the accidental death of his wife.  He's living on a farm in Pennsylvania with his children, as if hiding from the world and the eye of God.  He's angry at God, and won't even allow prayer in his house.  A set-up shot shows a spot on the wall where a cross or crucifix once hung.  Because of his crisis he's run away from his congregation and hidden himself away from humanity, with whom he either feels or wants to feel no connection.  His brother (Joaquin Phoenix) also lives with him.Bizarre things begin happening on the Hess farm.  Crop circles.  The family dog attacks the children.  Odd persons are seen indistinctly in the darkness outside.  At first he thinks he's the victim of hoaxers and vandals. Slowly, and with some hair-raising scenes, Father Hess grows aware of the possibility of an alien invasion of earth -- and one of the signs seems to be in his own cornfield.  But are the aliens (if there are aliens) vegetarians come to be friends;  or have they come to destroy, and enslave humanity?  The movie takes the latter course, and after one of the best gradual set-ups in movie history (or at least since the death of Hitchcock) the Hess family finds themselves locked in a cellar with really mean aliens running through the house and trying to get in to do them some harm. These aren't your wussy Spielberg phone-homers.  These are the the sort who are probably kin to the aliens that burst out of John Hurt's chest.Despite the excellence of the movie's unfolding, many viewers have fundamental misunderstandings of the way the movie works.  The movie is the story of a man's crisis of faith set during the time of an alien invasion of the earth.  Most critics (professional and amateur) seem to think Father Graham Hess has _lost_ his faith.  In fact, he hasn't.  This is clarified later, when his son seems ready to die of an asthmatic seizure.  It's clear at that point that Father Hess has never lost his belief in God's existence, but he has lost his sense that God is beneficent, and he certainly doesn't like the way God sometime works (all believers have this problem, quick to ask God where God was in bad times but rarely acknowledging his presence during fat times).  All believers in any religious, philosophical, social or political doctrine) should at some point reconsider the very foundations of their belief:  do they hold a social, scientific, political, or religious hypothesis because that's how they were broght up?  Have they let others (parents, peers, teachers) impose beliefs on them?  Did they have individual enlightenment?  Do they really understand what they believe in any of the above contexts?Father Graham was having a crisis of faith, which every believer in anything should have if he's a healthy thinker;  he hasn't lost a belief in God, but he has had the foundations of what he thought God was undermined.  This is a healthy thing in Christianity or Judaism, since in these traditions one accepts God for what God is, rather than attempting to impose one's own personality on the Creator.As for the vapid criticisms that a man's faith in 'traditional' faiths should be undermined by extraterrestrials, the argument is extraordinarily shallow and shows a lack of understanding, certainly of Bible based faith, Jewish or Christian, and not only in their theology but their history.  In fact, there has been long and fascinating debate a long time about the possibility of extraterrestrial life.  There are many strands of Christian thought dating even from the middle ages (and no, no one ever was burned for suggesting such a thing, it's not a heresy).  The strand of thought most intriguing to me suggests that God alone is unique and Satan is not; therefore the drama of fall and redemption happens throughout the universe. If one reads the Bible it says, 'In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth . . .'  That humble sentence covers hundreds of thousands of years in the age of the universe.  But the Bible is a book about God's realtionship to intelligent carbon-based life forms on the planet Earth, and the second sentence focuses on the Earth.  There are suggestions through Scripture that there are other worlds, but until the time of Canon Copernicus it was little understood what forms these worlds might take.  But it was never a part of Christian doctrine that man was unique -- or alone -- in the universe (though he may yet prove to be).The ending is invariably misunderstood, and is set up by an earlier scene involving Father Hess' brother.It's not clear what happened to the alien invaders at the end.  Did they have a strategic withdrawal?  Will they be back?  Possibly.  This is the purpose of the last scene:  Just as in an earlier scene Father Hess' brother went into an army recruiting station, probably toying with the idea of enlisting in case the earth was under attack, so Father Hess has enlisted to fight the invaders the best way he knows how.  Some people go into war to fight to defend their country (or planet) but others have to clean up: medics, preachers and priests, and people just to carry stretchers or wash up.  Father Hess has re-enlisted in God's service to give spiritual aid and comfort while his brother may enlist in the armed forces to fight the earth's enemy physically.  Even if the aliens don't return, it is clear there is much misery, death, and broken-heartedness among the survivors, and Father Hess, having been through his own crisis, is well equipped to help people understand their own loss;  he's as much a healer, at the end, as a doctor, and as much a fighter as his brother may be as a soldier.  Others will be better for his suffering and doubt.Anyone hoping for a trick ending is disappointed (as Father Hess tried to impose himself on God, so too many critics and viewers have tried to impose themselves on the movie, refusing to accept it as it was and therefore rejecting it out of hand), but anyone who has given the movie thought will understand why the ending is perfect, and why the movie is therefore a masterpiece:  Father Hess has not out of the blue regained lost faith; he's come to better understand a God he never doubted, and because of the uncertainty of the alien situation, he has to serve both God and his fellow men the best way he knows how.  He's lost the love of his life (his wife) but he has too much love to give, both for God and mankind, to hide himself in a cornfield when people need him.  It's a courageous ending, a thoughtful ending, well set up, and most professional critics hate it because they hate Christianity and the fact that it is portrayed in a not unpleasant light. But anti-Christians can take heart:  there is only one scene of unmitigated theological discussion, and it undercuts the idea of comfort in religion alone.  If you're hiding in your own 'cornfield' from the possibilty of a God, so much that you can't even bear the mention of one in a pluralistic society but must see them silenced, you won't be offended.  The movie is anything but preachy:  I don't recall the name of Christ actually mentioned, though it may have been;  and it certainly has no such heavy preachy theological mumbo-jumbo as we get in George Lucas' movies about 'The Force'.Ultimately, the movie does consider free will vs predestination.  Which gets the upper hand?  Both.  While the movie is full of unexplained and unexplainable little oddities that gradually converge, Father Hess himself must tie the (seeming) coincidences together.  God gives 'signs', but Hess must pick up on them.  And this, too, is sound theology.  It's not the signs themselves, though, that ultimately lead to Father Hess' conversion to God (he reminds me of John Wesley, who was a fairly poor preacher for many years before he actually had a conversion and a sense of the reality of the Redemptive power of Jesus Christ).The movie, while thoughtful and largely quiet (not full of explosions), contains many scenes of suspese that will become classic:  the Hesses climbing up on the family car to pick up 'alien' signals on a baby monitor, for instance;  nd the momentarily glimpse of a green leg disappearing in the corn (and it ain't the jolly green giant).  The suspense is relieved by moments of comedy, most involving Phoenix but also in the David Lynchean parade of local townspeople.",10,0,4,28 August 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Boring
","'The Lord of the Rings' is not three features but one film broken into three parts.  The first two parts, 'Fellowship of the Rings' and 'The Two Towers' were impressive and interesting.  In 'The Return of the King', just as with Hobbiton, Moria, Rivendell, Lothlorien, Rohan and Helm's Deep, the new sites like Minas Tirith and Dunharrow were impressive (and Minas Tirith got a 'Wow' from me).  However, as with the other films, the characters are unengaging and, while the battle scenes are moderately more decipherable than the first two installments of the film (in this one, you can at least tell who is killing whom), there's odd variations from the book (where is the Scouring of the Shire?  What on middle-earth was that unnecessary spectacle of the death of Denethor?) and movie cliches that seem to be derivative of such sources as 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail'.  Taken as a movie to itself, the whole was unengaging and while it's pretty to look at so that it wasn't altogether tedious, it was three and a half hours of (mitigated) boredom.  Perhaps when the DVD -- with extra footage that may explain such things as the inexplicable disappearance of Saruman, and when the three parts are seen in some sort of continuity -- maybe then the film of the greatest (fictional) story ever told will be engaging.  Otherwise, 'The Return of the King' had all the wonderful and antiseptic spectacle of a freshly scrubbed art museum.",10,1,2,5 January 2004
Thirteen Days," Felt like a Fortnight
","See 'The Missles of October'.  The older movie, with William Devane, is pretty crude and the acting is variable (veterans like Ralph Bellamy, Howard da Silva and John Dehner are excellent;  whereas Martin Sheen,playing Robert F. Kennedy, the Attorney General who authorized wiretaps on Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., gives a performance good mainly for laughs).Though not so egregiously antihistorical as Oliver Stone's fictions (JFK, Nixon), 'Thirteen Days' is nevertheless misleading.  The bad guys seem to be members of the U.S. military complex, defending American freedom, rather than members of the 'evil empire' who were setting up missiles deliberately and stealthily to threaten democracy.Since the Soviet Union is dead and its revealed documents have shownthat everything we feared from them in the Cold War was true, isn't it ok to let them be the threats to democracy and civilization that they were, rather than U.S. 'hawks'?",Null,0,1,7 February 2001
