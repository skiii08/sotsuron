The Ring," one of the better horror movies
","when i saw this film i really hoped that you would be scared, and even if you didnt get scared so many times during this film, i really liked the way it was made. i loved that it was this evil that no one really could explain, which also left a few questions till the ending of the movie. the actors in this movie didnt to so much of a work, but i forgot the bad acting when i sat down and enjoyed the film. so for those who likes horror movies, i think this is one of the films in the 2000´s that is a great horror film.",8,1,1,31 March 2003
Resident Evil," another videogame that goes online ;)
","first when i read about the resident evil movie in 1996 i thought it would be a really scary film, like the videogames...then a few years later I saw a clip from the film and after that clip i changed my mind and after seeing the trailer from the completed film i changed my mind one more time this time i thought that it would be a good movie. but after have seeing it i completely changed my mind. comparing to the game, in the movies all zombies movies fast like h*ll and thereÂ´s no sudden zombie attack from lockers etc. and i have no idea why the had that computer graphics about that girl etc and hard rock music which i think never wolud have fit in in the actual video game.so i think that if they would have done the film after the videogame, with a simular mansion and camera angels as they have in the film...so now i just hope that someone will do a good tv-game movie, maybe 'house of the dead' film will be a bigget hit, let us hope so",3,0,0,17 September 2002
28 Days Later...," Good, but could have been better
","when i first saw the trailer for the film, i was looking forward to see it. it was the kind of movie i have been waiting for. 'A virus that infected most of the population and only a few survivors trying to stay alive'. the good parts was that it was pretty gory and the infected ones had become more like apes, then the ordnairy zombie, which made then faster and more dangerous. the only sad thing was that it was too few scenes where the showed infected ones getting 'along' with humans, which had been replaced people talking to each other.",7,0,0,27 May 2003
Signs," the arrivals have come but are they friendly ?
",I really liked the movie because when you think of it it was not like the others movies about aliens. by this i mean that often those movies spend most of the times by trying to do these things when you really get a close look at the aliens etc. I really liked when the director created such a great movie by just having so few actors and have most of the scenes taken in the house.,9,0,1,31 August 2002
