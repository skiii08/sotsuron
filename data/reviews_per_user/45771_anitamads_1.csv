Hereditary," Why do people hate on this movie?
","Ok, so I'll admit, it's kind of slowburn and you don't see a lot of gore (until the end). Still the atmosphere is creepy in a way that gets to my nerve. There are moments in the movie you understand what is about to happen, that doesn't ruin it though, it makes it more heart wrenching! I like both Toni Collette and Gabriel Byrne, but in all honesty, it was the roles of the children that made it so great. Superb casting. I thought this movie had a somewhat unique take on the subgenre, which I love. Definately worth a watch if you are up for a somewhat slowburn piece of art.",8,0,1,28 August 2018
