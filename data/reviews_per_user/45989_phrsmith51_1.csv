Ford v Ferrari," Tears, Laughter, Excetment, Anger and 2 ledgends of motor sport can't beat it
","If you love cars you know who Carroll Shelby is but not so many will know who Ken Mills is. Ken Mills deserves a movie of just him he was an extra ordinary driver in his early races (not part of movie) he would be so far infront when come in for a pit stop he would have a cup of tea as well. His love of a good cup of tea is part of the movie.
I never expected this movie to make me laugh so much, cry so much and want to punch someone in the face so much it was a real roller coast of emotions.
The acting, the script and the racing scenes where second to none 2 of my all time hero's were done proud",10,1,2,1 February 2020
