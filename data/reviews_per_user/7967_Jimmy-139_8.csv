The Rock," A Suprisingly Humane Action Movie
","While 'The Rock' is not a flawless film, it is very well made and suprisingly humane. The are a lot of character elements in this movie that makes this movie above average. Director Michael Bay always gives the audience too much to digest at once like in 'Armageddon' but here he gives the audience just enough. The car chase through the streets of San Francisco is one of all time best car chases it is amazing. This film also features strong performances from an A-list cast including Sean Connery, Nicolas Cage, and Ed Harris. This film shows it's humane side in the characters actions. The characters realize what they are doing and the feel remorse. The chemistry between Connery and Cage also makes this movie good.",10,1,1,3 May 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A More Than Worthy Addition To The Legendary Series
","I think both critics and the public underappreciated 'Star Wars: Episode 1'. True it is not as good as the other movies in the series (Though I did like it better than 'Return of the Jedi') but for all of its weaknesses it has some strengths that the other movies in the series don't have: some of the visuals in this movie are absolutely breathtaking, including the scene where the Queen and the Senator are talking to the senate. Also there is more action in this movie than in the others combined. The lightsaber duel at the end of the movie is exhilarating. In fact the last 40 minutes of this movie is a non-stop action spectacle. I highly recommend this movie, even to non 'Star Wars' fans.",10,1,2,25 April 2000
Armageddon," A Ridiculous Piece Of Trash***Spoiler Alert***
",When I first saw 'Armageddon' I thought it was a good movie but upon a second viewing I changed my opinion. I have never seen a film that insults the viewer's intelligence like this movie did example: Toward's the end of the movie when they have to decide who stays behind they draw straws!! I mean come on!! drawing straws in outer space?!?. Another example: when they can't get the engine fixed they pick up a wrench and hit the engine with it and it starts!! Plus the sound and editing in this movie made me nauseous. Avoid this one.,2,0,1,2 May 2000
Aliens," A Movie That Builds And Maintains An Unbelieveable Amount Of Tension
","I have never seen a movie that builds and maintains tension the way that 'Aliens' does. It becomes almost unbearably intense at one point. This is an expertly crafted film that pulls the viewer in to the movie. By the end of the movie you are tired and wrung out from the experience of it. This is one of the definitve Sci-Fi Action movies of the 80s' and of all time, don't miss this movie.",10,0,0,2 May 2000
There's Something About Mary," A Funny Film, But Overrated
","I enjoyed 'There's Something About Mary', it had some funny moments, but it was not as good as I expected. I had heard so many great things about this movie so I was expecting a screamingly funny movie, and though the movie had some very good moments, it was not what I expected.",7,0,0,2 May 2000
Titanic," An Epic Cinematic Masterpiece
","'Titanic' is an epic cinematic masterpiece, this is the type of movie that 50 years from now will be considered one of the all time best. 'Titanic' is an epic in every sense of the word, watching the great ship sail and then sink is one of the great technical triumphs of film in the 1990's. The talented cast turns in solid performances and the direction from James Cameron is top notch. I can't really say much more about this film that hasn't already been said so sit back and enjoy.",10,0,2,2 May 2000
Platoon," A Powerful And Unforgettable Film
","'Platoon' is a very powerful and unforgettable film. I saw this movie for the first time about four years ago, I watched it again recently and I was suprised at how well the film holds up. It doesn't even seem dated. There are moments in this film that are absolutely unforgettable, I'm not going to go into them here, you need to see them yourself. I am amazed that this film is ranked at #148 on the Top 250 list, personally I think it should be higher.",10,1,1,1 May 2000
Speed," A Fast Paced, Non Stop Action Thriller
","Every year some critic will call some action movie 'The Thrill Ride Of The Year!', 'Speed' is a film that actually lives up to that title and then some. This is one of the most inventive, fast paced thrillers ever churned out of hollywood. The plot is ingenius: A mad man has rigged a city bus with a bomb  that will detonate if the bus goes under 50 miles per hour, this sets the stage for clever, thrilling, and just plain great action. For action fans there is no other choice but 'Speed'.",10,0,0,2 May 2000
