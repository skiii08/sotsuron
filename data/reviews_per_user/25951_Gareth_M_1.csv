Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It DID live up to expectations, don't mind those vultures.
","I have seen Episode 1 a few times and was totally blown away by it. I am fed up with people critizing this movie. This movie is a childrens movie and WAS MADE FOR CHILDREN, so to those that say it was too infantile, wake up. Those who say that they were dissapointed, I mean what were they expecting, the meaning of life or something? It's only a movie and an excellent one at that. People don't seem to appreciate the work that goes into making such a movie. Audiences just take movies of this magnitude for granted nowadays.If you want to see a good movie this Summer, see Star Wars.",Null,0,0,25 July 1999
