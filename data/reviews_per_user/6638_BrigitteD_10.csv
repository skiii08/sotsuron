Walk the Line," A walk between success and failure.
","James Mangold has proved himself as a diverse director, tackling crime and corruption within the police force (Copland), angst and suicidal tendencies amongst a group of female patients of a mental institution (Girl, Interrupted), and a horror whodunit mystery located at an isolated motel (Identity). Now, Mangold offers up the biopic genre which has recently been showcased as a guaranteed Academy highlight.The line which has been traversed by Johnny J.R. Cash (Joaquin Phoenix), hasn't always been a straight one. Beginning in childhood with the endless days working in his Kansas home's cotton fields, the tragic death of his brother, and the strained relationship with his father (Robert Patrick), Cash emerges from the ruins of his personal life by pursuing an entirely new persona.From the moment he purchases his first guitar and walks into a recording studio to sell his first song, down to his infamous performance for a crowd of inmates at Folsom prison, Cash's rags-to-riches journey is rife with highs and lows. He encounters initial rejections of his material, begins neglecting dull family obligations alongside his wife Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin), and his children, in favor of extensive concert tours, and ultimately descends into a spiral of addiction, all of this happening, just as he begins to get recognized, and collaborating with newly-introduced legends such as Elvis Prestley, Roy Orbison, and Jerry Lee Lewis.Along the way, he finds his salvation, lifelong performer June Carter (Reese Witherspoon). Carter is sweet as pie, which heavily contrasts with Cash's rough edges, but they nonetheless make a connection, both as a professional and romantic duo, as they embark on a ten-year road together before they can actually be reunited. Carter's strong will and emotional investment towards Cash's condition, soon begin serving as the anchor that kept him from sinking even lower.Both Phoenix and Witherspoon are an electrifying presence on stage, Carter's spunk serving to complement Cash's brooding demeanor, and their chemistry is highly palpable. It also becomes quite obvious that the only time Cash is ever really in control of his life is when he has his guitar in hand, using it as an outer expression of his inner feelings, commanding full attention from his audience, a feat that will no doubt be repeated with movie audiences, as well.",8,0,0,3 July 2006
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Save yourself for 'The 40 Year Old Virgin'.
","The rites of passage from boyhood to manhood have often been a cinematic staple, in such memorable titles as 'Animal House', 'Porky's' and 'Revenge Of The Nerds', to the more recent 'American Pie' films. Adding to that, are most of the Farrelly Brothers productions which have further tested the boundaries of sexual humor.While the majority of these examples depict a high school or college demographic, the latest trend seems to focus more on grown men who have not quite reached that one specific level of maturity in their juvenile pursuit of sexual gratification.Following the breakout success of the similarly raunchy comedy, 'The Wedding Crashers', comes this film, which has also managed to defy the curse of the sanitized PG-13 rating that has plagued and minimized so many potentially good films.Steve Carell whom we have previously seen in television sketch shows and in supporting roles opposite comedy kings Jim Carrey and Will Ferrell, co-wrote alongside director Judd Apatow, and stars in his first leading vehicle.Andy Stitzer is socially challenged, living his life with childish innocence. An electronics store employee, he also boasts a vast collection of vintage action figures, plays video games, entertains himself with solo karaoke sessions, as well as watches reality shows with his elderly neighbors. Also, his method of transportation is a bicycle.During a poker game with his coworkers (Paul Rudd, Romano Malco, Seth Rogan), it is revealed that Andy has never engaged in sexual intercourse. Of course, he's had plenty of opportunities which always failed to meet his expectations, so he eventually just stopped trying.From that point on, his friends, who are also all dealing with relationship issues of their own, become determined to initiate Andy to the world of dating and eventual mating, leading him through both his physical and psychological transformation, introducing him to nightclub outings, a body-waxing appointment, and a various assortment of pornography material.Eventually, Andy meets Beth (Elizabeth Banks), a bookstore clerk, and furthermore, Trish (Catherine Keener), a single mother who runs an independent business selling merchandise to Ebay. Andy begins developing feelings for Trish, but has to struggle with posing restrictions in his relationship with her, and not revealing his state of prolonged 'celibacy'.Had this film starred Tom Green or Rob Schneider, for example, the result would have undoubtedly been less effective. Carell offers refreshing insight into a overused plot subject, presenting Andy's situation with sincerity, sensibility and endearing awkwardness rather than turning his performance into one of chauvinistic exploitation.Like 'Wedding Crashers', this film turns its third act into a showcase of moral sentimentality, and despite all its strong attributes, the material unfortunately begins wearing thin before it finally reaches its satisfying climax (No pun intended).",5,4,8,17 September 2005
Saw II," Second 'Saw' not as sharp.
","It seems that it is written in the Hollywood textbooks that every successful film will eventually spawn a sequel, or even an entire series.Such is the case for the latest horror franchise best known as 'Saw', a small, low-budget film which quickly became a highly bankable hit, and inevitably produced a sequel that was promptly released in just a year's time.Whereas many lamented the amateurish style and performances of the first installment, it nonetheless presented a creative, gritty and tense premise, elements that were sorely lacking from the recent teen-friendly offerings.Unfortunately, this sequel follows the same ideas, but with slightly different implications, and a lot less originality.This time around, the same villain, the 'Jigsaw' killer returns, but his victims have grown in numbers, from two people to a group of eight. Cancer-stricken Jigsaw, continues his mission to teach ungrateful people about the meaning of life, and ultimately, about the lack thereof.The setup for Jigsaw's latest challenge is an abandoned house where his group of 'players' are held captive. They are an assembly of seemingly random strangers who all have an unknown connection to each other. Meanwhile, air ducts throughout the house, are releasing a lethal nerve toxin, whose effects can be reversed by means of an antidote, an antidote that can be found, but not without first having to explore some elaborate and potentially deadly traps.Investigating the Jigsaw case, is Detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg), who soon learns that his wayward son, Daniel, is part of the group of young victims, which throughout, are being guided by Amanda (Shawnee Smith), who managed to survive Jigsaw's first orchestrated reign of terror.Tobin Bell who portrays Jigsaw, is a lot more prominent this time around, and becomes an identifiable character, rather than just an invisible threat. Yet, the psychological head-games found in the first film, are substituted here, with predictable by-the-numbers carnage and basic horror movie clich√©s. The film also plays out like a television reality show, where contestants confined in the same living space, must compete against time, and against each other, to claim the final prize, in this case, their own lives.Despite its shortcomings, the film offers up plenty of cutting edge material that is sure to satisfy the hardcore fans of the genre, which is a good thing, since it looks like Jigsaw's legacy will live on for a long time to come.",5,2,3,10 June 2006
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," A Match Made In Heaven.
","John and Jane Smith have a mediocre and bland marriage. They attend relationship therapy sessions together, and the only noteworthy changes to occur are when Jane adds an extra side dish to the evening meal, or when she purchases new home decor. They have poor communication skills, made apparent by both of their lack of knowledge regarding everything from past experiences, down to their current occupations.They head out to work each day and conveniently return home at promptly the same time every evening for dinner, during which they exchange small talk concerning their 'office jobs'.This charade continues until a routine assignment reveals their true professional identity and motives, a development which soon forces them to stay one step ahead of each other, as well as to evade their respective agencies.Tabloid darlings and rumored lovers Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie prove to be an attractive box office draw, unlike the recent cinematic joint efforts of the defunct Ben & J-Lo duo. This much-speculated about couple exudes chemistry throughout, whether they're bickering, shooting at each other, or ultimately 'making out'. Vince Vaughn also delivers a brief, albeit effective cameo appearance as a tough-talking, yet insecure mama's boy who still lives at home.Overall, this film offers an engaging medley of witty humor, explosive action and sizzling passion, which is sure to appeal to every member of the adrenaline-seeking summer audiences.",8,1,4,20 June 2005
War of the Worlds," Conflicting War Of Thoughts.
","The summer season, more specifically the July 4th holiday, always seems a prime occasion to release alien invasion movies. 'Independence Day' and 'Men In Black' have both added some extra fireworks to the patriotic festivities, and now, 'War Of The Worlds' is the latest movie to offer up American soil as a stomping ground for unearthly inhabitants.While the first two titles approached the subject with a certain degree of humor, 'War Of The Worlds' makes it its goal to remain serious throughout, but at some point in its efforts, only succeeds in becoming unintentionally funny.Steven Spielberg delivers, yet again, an insight into the long-debated possibility of other lifeforms, and how it would affect our planet should our existences collide. In the past, Spielberg has always presented these imaginary visions with a sense of mystery and childlike wonder. But now, gone are the lovable aliens who befriend young boys, watch cartoons with their little sisters, and develop a liking for candy and geraniums. Here, the creatures only have destruction of the human race in mind, and they do not go subtly about making their intentions known.Tom Cruise plays Ray, a deadbeat parent who is strapped with the care of his two estranged children for the weekend, while their mother goes to Boston on a family visit. Robbie is a sullen and bitter teen who can't stand being around his father. Ten year old Rachel is more tolerant in regards to her dad, but it's clear that in their relationship, she is the one who acts more like the adult.Just enough time has passed for Ray to take a nap, Rachel to order takeout, and for Robbie to sneak out in his dad's car, before eerie lightning storms begin striking down, unleashing the emergence of underground tripods.From that point on, Ray and his children become the focal point as they attempt to escape the carnage, with the ensuing destruction becoming the backdrop behind them.The special effects are on a grand scale, but it's nothing we've never seen before in most other cinematic disaster depictions. However, it does an effective job in capturing apocalyptic levels reminiscent of the 9/11 attacks. With its scenes of collapsing structures, scattered debris and masses of panicked, confused crowds, it conveys the news headline reality of more sinister and ever-present enemies. It's also a study of how violently-driven people can become in their instinct to survive.Initially, the movie does a good job setting things up, but it gradually loses steam and plausibility along the way towards its conclusive and abrupt halt.The movie is rife with inconsistencies. First off, how could such imposing machinery not be discovered after all these years, especially when you consider subterranean maintenance and transit systems? Secondly, if all electrical utilities ceased in their functionality, how could camera equipment still work? And even more so, how could the minivan that Ray hijacked still manage to run when all other vehicles were at a standstill? How could the son possibly survive after disappearing into the explosive crossfire of the battling tripods and the military artillery? How could the aliens succumb so easily to human bacteria if they spent years studying our planet? And last but not least, how could one street in Boston remain conveniently unscathed, if not for the sole purpose of accommodating a happy homecoming? Did the residents of that street shield themselves inside a protective, impenetrable bubble? The ending does nothing but present Ray as a heroic figure, while leaving too many unexplained loose ends dangling from its neatly tied ribbon.",5,0,0,20 July 2005
Wedding Crashers," Say 'I Do' to seeing 'Wedding Crashers'.
","Long-time friends and business partners, John and Jeremy, are divorce mediators. Although it's rather ironic that these two specialize in giving out marital advice when you consider their own personal outlook and approach to relationships, or more appropriately, their lack thereof. In their spare time, John and Jeremy are seen anticipating their favorite time of the year, the busy wedding season, during which they infiltrate various marriage ceremonies posing as distant relatives, in order to snag any available female guest or bridesmaid in attendance, if for nothing more than the purpose of indulging in a brief bedroom romp.The latest wedding that the swinging bachelors set their sights on, is a highly publicized event, since it is to take place within a family of remarkable status which is headed by the treasury secretary. To the outside observer, the Cleary family is a portrait of wealth and social prominence, but on the inside, it turns out to be quite a dysfunctional clan. There's the needy, sexually-frustrated wife, the artistic outcast son who displays homosexual tendencies, the sweet-looking, but vulgar and gun-brandishing grandmother. Then, there's sisters Claire and Gloria. John soon finds himself falling for Claire, who is obviously trapped within the confines of a potentially controlling relationship. Meanwhile, Jeremy finds himself wanting to escape the clutches of Gloria, a spoiled airhead who becomes possessive and begins latching on to him. Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn have been in many previous collaborations together without actually being at the helm as a team, and I'm hoping to see a continuation of this duo in possible future projects. They are two parts of a perfectly comedic structure which is further built to greater heights with the participation of all the other supporting cast members involved, with noteworthy praise for sugary-sweet rising star Rachel McAdams and sexy bombshell Isla Fisher who portray Claire and Gloria respectively.There's also an amusing cameo appearance by Will Ferrell, who seems to be in just about every other movie these days, as a man who crashes another type of traditional congregation in an attempt to meet vulnerable women. 'Wedding Crashers' is obviously intended for mature audiences since it abounds with nudity and sexual references, and it manages to be explicit without having to rely on the obligatory bodily function sight gags. But beneath all of the liberal exploits, there lies a more subtle undercurrent of romance that the female demographic will be able to appreciate as well.",9,1,6,23 July 2005
Lord of War," Right on target!
","In a society of escalating war, terrorism and youth violence, comes 'Lord Of War', a film which studies the alarmingly accessible weapons market and its universal impact.From its opening shots, the film almost feels like a documentary, with our reluctant hero Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage), looking like a weary reporter standing amidst a carpet of bullet shell casings and a backdrop of destruction.His narration begins as an introduction to the subject at hand before launching into his own life and the profession he has grown to question over the span of his twenty-year experiences.Yuri is a Ukrainian immigrant who now resides in New York's Little Odessa district. Having grown up in a neighborhood where death was a daily occurrence, he realizes that there's a highly profitable demand for ammunition.Uninterested in working for his family-owned restaurant, he decides to become an arms dealer, and brings his younger brother Vitaly (Jared Leto) along on the venture, until Vitaly begins a downward spiral into drug addiction and must be left behind at a rehabilitation facility.Yuri carries on a remarkable salesman pitch, presenting his merchandise as casually as someone who might be promoting household appliances. Soon, he sees his client√®le evolve from civilian buyers to prominent world leaders in battle-torn countries which benefit greatly from Yuri's contributions. He even forms a lucrative, and somewhat risky alliance with a ruthless African dictator (Eamonn Walker).Meanwhile, Yuri sets his sights on supermodel Ava Fontaine (Bridget Moynahan), his longtime boyhood crush whom he manages to charm and eventually marries. For the most part, Ava remains unsuspecting of Yuri's job, but soon begins to wonder about her husband's lengthy business trips, especially when an Interpol agent, Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke), who has been tracking Yuri, comes knocking on her door asking a lot of questions.At the center of all the exterior conflict, lies Yuri's inner battle between his conscience and the lure of wealth. As much as he tries to justify his role and all the implications, he can't help but feel remorseful, especially when his indirect involvement eventually becomes all too personal.'Lord Of War' hits all of its targets by demonstrating its ensemble of strong performances, as well as by being more than just an action movie, but one that carries a political and moral message which never falls under the weight of heavy-handed preachings.",7,1,3,29 September 2005
Fantastic Four," Not fantastic.
","These days, movie releases always seem to fall into three categories; sequels, remakes or comic book adaptations. The latter has been a tried and true Hollywood fixture since the first time we saw 'Superman' don his cape and tights.Thus continues the tradition of the Marvel Comics series in the form of 'Fantastic Four', which reportedly underwent years of delay due to production and casting issues.Some might say the payoff was well worth the wait, but perhaps I'm in the wrong position to judge since I've never possessed any degree of adept knowledge of the originating illustrated works, nor of its real-life counterparts.After seeing such offerings as 'X-Men', both 'Spiderman' installments, 'Daredevil' and its inferior spin off 'Elektra', I've nonetheless gathered enough insight to determine that all these movies basically follow the same premise.They are all accounts of average Joe's, whom because of extraordinary circumstances, become plagued, or blessed, depending on one's personal perception, by unusual abilities.'Fantastic Four' gathers an ensemble of medical scientists, Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), Sue Storm (Jessica Alba), Johnny Storm (Chris Evans), and Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), who are sent on a space mission, and soon become exposed to radioactivity emanating from a cosmic outburst.Shortly thereafter, the group begins developing unusual symptoms, due to the altering of their DNA properties.The eventual transformations presented here are ones of invisibility, flexible elasticity, spontaneous combustion and turning into a stone formation.From then on, the group must learn to adapt to their powers, as well as to their new found public attention and resulting celebrity status. And somewhere amidst all the action, there is also an underlying social message about being different and being accepted for who you are.As is expected from all these types of movies, there is the obligatory nemesis, presented to us, and to its adversaries, as Dr. Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon). The cast of heroes is quite likable, and it's easy to get involved in their camaraderie and the laughter-inducing bantering they exchange when they are not out trying to save the world.Considering the movie's closing scenes, as well as its progressive box-office clout, a franchise of many sequels will inevitably be made, but it's doubtful it's something that I'll be anticipating.",3,1,2,21 July 2005
Cinderella Man," A Nice Fairy Tale.
","Fresh on the heels of the recent release and Academy Award victory of Clint Eastwood's 'Million Dollar Baby', comes yet another boxing movie, which like the latter title, more than just showcases the dynamics of the sport, but also takes a jab at the human elements of hardship, sacrifice, determination and ambition. The physical action taking place within the ring, almost serves as a metaphor to the inner battles confronted by the title character.Directed by Ron Howard, the film depicts the true-life story of boxer Jim Braddock as he fought his way out from a depression-torn existence, which not only impacted himself but the entire nation as well, as he became both a role model and savior to everyone who followed his plight.Russell Crowe stars as Jim, a successful contender and loyal family man who becomes disqualified from the boxing ring due to a hand injury. This can't come at a worst time as the city of New York is gripped by overwhelming unemployment and poverty. With a wife and three children to provide for, he is forced to move from a cozy home to a ramshackle 'hole in the wall'. Jim heads out to the docks everyday, in the hopes of putting in a day's labor which would ensure continuing income and food on the table. But job positions are sparse, and Jim's family sinks even deeper into financial ruins.One of the most effective and stirring scenes occurs when Jim, setting aside his pride and dignity, wanders into a room and tearfully pleads for a handout, so that his family can survive that much longer. The ensuing reception he receives is both unexpected and heartwarming.Becoming increasingly more despondent, Jim asks his manager (Paul Giamatti) for a second chance to return to the ring, and reluctantly, he is offered a deal. From there, we see him evolve from low-paying fights, until he finally reaches the prize winning title, a title that comes at too high a cost. It turns out that Jim must compete against Max Baer (Craig Bierko), an arrogant womanizer, who has become infamous for having already killed two men in the ring. Despite many people's warnings and misgivings, Jim still remains determined to risk it all.Renee Zellweger turns in a solid performance as Mae, Jim's reluctant yet supportive wife. Her anguish and worry over her husband's safety is very apparent, and you truly find yourself relating to her turmoil and anxiety during the course of the final fight.The children are good without having to rely on overacting or being too cutesy, and it was a good choice to cast relative 'unknowns' rather than resorting to more conventional, Hollywood-manufactured child stars.I admit to never being much of a fan of Russell Crowe, nor have I ever bothered to see any of his previous films, perhaps due to his oft reported personal disposition, or simply due to ignorant prejudice on my part. Whatever the reasons may be, I must praise his performance in this instance. He masterfully embodied the essence of Jim Braddock. His gentleness and soft-spoken manner blended perfectly with his strong reserve and physical strength, combining together to create a perfect display of loyalty and perseverance.Overall, this is an uplifting film which gets its audience involved throughout each the physical and emotional sequences, with a mixture of both cheers and tears.",8,0,0,6 June 2005
The Island," 'The Island' is an action-packed oasis.
","When you think about the wide spectrum of both past and present directors, you can easily associate a particular genre to each one, and Michael Bay is no exception, so it's pretty safe to assume that a person will know what to expect from this director's films.Mr. Bay has always delivered high-octane action summer extravaganzas, with the resulting products either being praised or criticized by the press and moviegoers alike. While his films aren't without its faults, they should be appreciated for what they are, fun and mindless entertainment.As mindless as they often are, his latest effort entitled 'The Island', offers a surprisingly intellectual side to accompany the ever-present technical dynamics, lending the film a more thought-provoking foundation.Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johanssen star as Lincoln Six Echo and Jordan Two Delta, two subjects from a group of genetically-altered 'humans' who are being monitored and ultimately utilized for the purposes of physical restoration, curing illnesses, and to aid in the pursuit of eternal youth.The participants all reside within a facility which is at once a representation of impeccable sanitation and order. Everyone goes about their tasks and general daily routine, believing that they are the last remaining survivors of an outside world which has succumbed to the damaging effects of contamination.Most have been sheltered there for many years, and it is the wish of many to be given freedom which can seemingly be attained through a rigged lottery draw that promises the winner a trip to an undisclosed and unaffected piece of land.Unbeknownst to everyone involved, are the ulterior motives of the facility's masterminds. That is, to everyone except Lincoln and Jordan, who manage to escape the confines of their claustrophobic environment, only to be met by an unfamiliar external reality.With absolutely no knowledge of their surroundings, they must become a part of civilization in their attempt to uncover a conspiracy, while also attempting to survive and outrun their pursuers.'The Island' is, in many respects, two films in one. It begins as a futuristic sci-fi exploration which gleams with cold, sterile surfaces and meticulous organization, but soon, it descends onto a more pedestrian platform and transforms itself into Mr. Bay's signature showcase of fiery chaos. Nevertheless, both parts seamlessly compliment each other to offer the viewer, if not a tropical adventure, then at least, a cinematic one.",7,7,12,3 August 2005
