Casablanca," Can love really make it out of ultimate corruption?
","This film was extremely well done. The actors were great, you really could get into the plot as they shaped their characters. The sound effects were very good when it came to the airplanes and gun shots. The dialogue was loud enough to understand what they were saying which is a plus in this time period. The love story really sucked you into their relationship and past and makes you feel the hardships of corruption and economic struggles. The lighting was absolutely excellent. It really made the scenes bright and happy but could get really serious and dark with great face contouring and shadows. The camera did a lot of good shots involving Ilsa and Rick when they would argue, the fight scenes, and the plane taking off. It really emphasized the scenes.",5,1,2,23 October 2015
Chinatown," A woman hires a man to stalk her cheating husband.
","This was an interesting film. I loved the coloring in it, it was vibrant but it wasn't too obnoxious. It made the movie seem more dramatic. The acting wasn't all that great, I feel like the actual plot is what they were trying to portray more than the characters. It was a pretty socially risky plot, too. It wasn't unheard of having a male commit fidelity but a woman was another story. On top of that, she hired someone to watch him which a woman would have never done in that time period. I felt like the meaning behind it was that it takes two to make mistakes in marriages and commit infidelity. It also showed that sometimes when you dig too deep into something you end up finding things that you didn't want to.",5,0,8,17 December 2015
Annie Hall," A guy and girl have an awkward encounter and end up dating. Their love story unfolds
","This was a weird movie. It was funny, there was a lot of unstaged comedy in it. I wasn't a big fan of it because it didn't really show the full progression of their relationship and there would be text on the screen to represent their thoughts which took away from being sucked into the plot. The way it was edited also was unappealing. I didn't like that it started from the end and spoiled the movie. It also set the scene to make you feel upset that they had ended before you even started watching it. The quality of the camera wasn't that great either, I felt like the screen was pixelated for the whole movie. It wasn't awful to watch but I felt as though there were better movies you could see instead.",4,1,6,17 December 2015
The Graduate," A boy trapped in his parents shadow looking for an escape with his parents hot friend.
","The film was very good. There were a lot of great qualities to the movie. First off, the acting was fantastic. The main two characters, Benjamin and Mrs. Robinson, really played their roles well and made you either have empathy for them or hate them at times. The editing had an impact on the film, making it stand out. There are a couple scenes where they are dissolving and jarred to represent his point of view. The yellow coloring of the film made the feel of it more old school and as though him and his family live in this perfect little world. Aside from Cinematography, the meaning behind the Graduate was very important. It really showed that breaking out of your shell is harder than it seems. Not only that, but it shows that the stereotypical prep boys don't actually have it all. They actually are trapped in a world following their parents footsteps and can't act outside how they're expected to behave. Overall, a great film with a break through in film making and social rebellion and love.",9,1,2,17 December 2015
Singin' in the Rain," A 'couple' trying to make a break in movie history but turns into a love triangle.
","For a musical, the film was actually pretty good. The colors were excellent, they were bright and really set the mood for each scene. There was a lot of different types of songs and feel in each music scene. It wasn't just one type of, say, a sad musical song. There were funny ones, romantic ones, and sad ones. The sound effects were great, too, they really gave the scenes more humor and drama. The acting was pretty good, too. They all did a fantastic job with showing the different personalities of the characters. Lastly, the camera. This was this movie's flaw. There were long random scenes that were boring and irrelevant. Not only that but there were a lot of shots that were either too close up or too far back. Over the film was well done with just a few flaws that could be fixed.",6,0,2,8 November 2015
Psycho," A woman tries to attain money but ends up in a bad situation.
","For a black and white film, this was extremely well done. The lighting and contrast was perfect and really set the mood for a good film. It wasn't too bright or too dark and it outlined characters faces and the blood during the 'violent' scenes. The camera was great when shooting at different angles. Especially in dramatic scenes, the camera would focus in and out of the scenes to add more flare to the subject and take long shots. I felt like the meaning behind the movie wasn't that strong because it was just a 'horror' film. Behind it, though, there was definitely a hint of mistrust and deceit. It kind of showed that psychos are everywhere , no matter where you go and that you should be very careful in going to new places and with strangers because they could not be who they say they are. Acting was okay and some scenes you could tell were really fake but a good film overall.",6,1,3,17 December 2015
