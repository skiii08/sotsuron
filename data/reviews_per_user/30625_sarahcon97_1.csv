The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," A shocking surprise! Best Hunger Games yet!
","Coming into this film, I had no idea what to expect. I had not read the book or even seen a trailer, now that I think of it. I did indeed read the other 2 books in the series and see the movies. However, I did not have the slightest idea of the ride that was waiting for me!It may start out a bit slow, but Jennifer Lawrence's acting does not disappoint (again!). One thing I can say about this film is that not only is the action thrilling, but the acting is superb and scarily believable. Although Josh Hutcherson did not have the most screen time in this one, his acting is astounding. Without spoiling anything, his last 2 scenes will leave you scarred in the best way possible and his scenes before that will have you tearing up. Also, Liam Hemsworth stepped up his game from the last 2 films. Previously, Hemsworth played the lovesick boy-next-door who was also surprisingly hot. In this film he pulls through as a warrior and shows a step up in his emotional depth as Gale. However, I still believe that the true gem of this franchise is Josh Hutcherson. Although all eyes are constantly on the stunning, Oscar-winning JLaw, Hutcherson never fails to absolutely kill his performance and touch the audience. The show- stealing performers like Hutcherson, Woody Harrelson as the drunk...yet understanding Haymitch Abernathy, and Elizabeth Banks as the charismatic Effie Trinket that compliment Lawrence's performance and help to make the Hunger Games the international phenomenon it is.The film's directing, writing, special effects, and (much to my surprise) score were very well done. The combination of those four aspects made for an excellent movie experience. There were moments during this film in which I was completely engulfed in what was happening. And to me, that is a true film success.",8,0,11,1 January 2015
