The King's Speech," Truly an incredible masterpiece in the film industry.
","A stellar performance from an all star cast, with the likes of Colin Firth as king George, Helena Bonhan-Carter as Queen Elizabeth and Geoffrey Rush as the eccentric speech therapist Lionel Logue with many others. A beautiful portrayal of the budding friendship between two individuals that could have turned out to be opposing forces, yet given the sparkling chemistry that Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush obtained throughout this film...I doubt the two could've ever had any friction what so ever. Truly an incredible masterpiece in the film industry. Tom Hooper delivers once again and through this production brought a dramatically wonderful screenplay to the big screen.",9,0,0,23 February 2015
Furious 7," An Incredible Achievement, Intensely emotional and Action-Packed.
","Amongst the hype of the death of the incredible Paul Walker, James Wan and his crew managed to pull off the brilliance that was the seventh installment of the Fast and Furious Franchise (Styled as Furious Seven.) On a whole, the franchise started out as a small-time, home-bound film regarding street racing and yet as it progressed, the franchise developed into an international action genre, that worked in favor for the films. For this one in particular, (Furious Seven) it was an excellent action-packed film peaked with fury and yet well-rounded off with a touching tribute in honor of a fallen comrade. And I guess that because these films taught the significance of family and substance in loyalty it was absolutely shattering as the movie came to end, signifying that so did the life and career of Paul Walker, and the legacy he left behind in the character of Brian O' Conner. On the other hand, in terms of screenplay and layout of the film, the special effects and action sequences were very much over the top bringing vast entertainment and a unique feel to the highly grossing and thrilling ride viewers take along with the cast. Rest In Peace Paul Walker.",8,70,87,25 April 2015
