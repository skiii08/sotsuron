Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Sherlock Holmes??? Didn't seem like Sherlock to me.
","This Hollywood movie is a disgrace to the intelligent, wise, intuitive detective 'Sherlock Holmes' character. Instead of being focused on his detective skills, it focuses on special effects and violence so much that his character and the shallow plot are minimized. Therefore, if you enjoy Hollywood movies with special effects and violence more than plot, then I recommend it. However, if that is what you want, then why see 'Sherlock Holmes'? There are hundreds of movies with that emphasis, and with even better special effects. If you enjoy a good Sherlock Holmes detective film with an engaging, suspenseful plot, then you will be tremendously disappointed!",1,41,85,19 February 2012
