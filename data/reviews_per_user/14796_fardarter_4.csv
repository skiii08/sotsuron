Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Much Ado ...
","Spurred by the outcry of outrage and controversy, I walked into the theater with high expectations. Laughter overcame me in several hilarious moments, especially with a joke involving a cheese ritual (can't spoil it, sorry). Overall, I was underwhelmed. Had the theater been more crowded I might perhaps have laughed more by going with the flow, but I confess I was a bit bored. The controversy grew old very quickly, as did the ethnic/religious jokes. Born and raised in Europe, I find many US-based stereotypes about non-Western cultures tragically un-funny, therefore US born and raised viewers should not trust my impressions. Most of my US friends (prevalently white Caucasians) laughed a lot. Most of my non-US friends left the theater wondering what was there to laugh so hard about. I laughed much harder for Young Frankenstein. My vote of 4/10 is generous and takes into account my admiration for the courageous enterprise. Had I seen a shorter feature of Borat on TV, I would have enjoyed it more.",4,3,7,17 December 2006
Source Code," Too long
","The merit of this movie is the idea - quite brilliant. Acting is fine, mostly because the actors are all reasonably good-looking. My low score is perhaps due to my low tolerance for explosions, crashes, and unnecessary noise. In this particular movie, the same crash happens over and over again in all the sauces. There was a time when special effects and conflagrations impressed audiences very easily. In the 21st century, however, we have the technology to produce our own explosions on our own laptops, that is, if we really care to live with images of things blowing up on a regular basis. The repetition of the explosion in this movie is essential to the story, but the dialog is completely unnecessary at times. The main protagonist's anxiety about his mission is crucial to our appreciation of the film, but the whole business could have been compressed in about 25 minutes. I cannot spare you the trite feeling: who is going to give me these couple hours back?",3,1,4,31 December 2011
Milk," Good for people younger than those who actually had to live through the 70s
","All people younger than 45 need to watch this movie and remember Harvey Milk and especially his boyfriend Scott Smith, who died of HIV complications in 1995. Too bad that people do not remember Smith as well as Milk. In the US we have a very short historical memory, and most do not even remember Milk. Sean Penn and James Franco look much more attractive than the two men they embody, and that is a good thing, because the movie is sad. Hard to take for those like myself, who had to live through the late 70s as gay youngsters and then through the 80s with friends dying of strange diseases. Had this historical piece been less than 2 hours long, I would have given it a 10. But the thing went on for almost two and half hours and it was sad, very sad. Do something fun and lighthearted after watching this great film. But go see it. It's a must.",8,1,6,22 December 2008
Quantum of Solace," Bond sensitive?
","I always enjoy a good Bond movie and this one was no exception. Craig is a fine James Bond and we shall all miss him when he retires from the 007 role, just like we miss Sean Connery. The best Bond movies are action packed and embellished with the elegance of the characters, their clothes, the locations in which the scenes are shot, and the various eye-candy perks - Craig's posterior in tight chinos makes me want to go to the gym more and get tight chinos for myself. This modern Bond is more sensitive to the humanity of his 'girls', and yet his macho nature remains untainted. The overindulgence of the character is due to Le CarrÃ©, who used to be Her majesty's spy -- or was he a spy under his majesty? Can't recall. In any case, I LOVE M, Dame Dench is superb in the role - let's hope she stays. And perhaps fewer crashes and more dialog in the next Bond?",7,1,7,30 December 2008
