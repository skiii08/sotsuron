Requiem for a Dream," what a title
","It has been a while since I have seen such a beautiful movie. I know that maybe I can not comment it like a professional but I can say couple thinks. What impressed me was, as I usually think is the case for great films, the truth of the ideas shown and the great manner in witch was presented. When you see such a movie you say: when we going to learn to ... and here you can put a lot of stuff: simple to live life and not to be greedy or not to desire too much. Some tragic situation that if you think about it you can discover around you that happens to many people on and on. In this movie I think you can see that this is it, maybe this is the human nature, bad luck .. What can be done? Who knows?The characters are very strong and by that I mean you cannot simple not to care about them, not to have a strong opinion about everybody, even about that god dam doctor. I will not give any opinion about every actor; you will find that for sure in other comments.Anyway, I strongly recommend the movie, even only for what Greeks said that can be he effect of a tragedy: catharsis.",10,0,1,26 June 2002
Hero," Beautiful legend - nice fights.
","This movie is really great, with very nice pictures and colors; the atmosphere is very cool, asian philosophy very well put into action. The strong logic of honor and those ideas is to be admired. Honor and love.The story that is repeating is every time more interesting and with different meaning. When you see the drama in such a dÃ©cor. Broken sword and his death over and over. And the fight after that, his servant with the beautiful ex-lover (with yellow leafs and all - when she dies everything becomes red). Today in real life and movies people are people but in this one they have moral axioms long disappeared from society.So besides very nice filming there are fighting scenes that you have to admire, then some nice special effects and visual ones (the waves of arrows for example with that sound), and of course the ideas in the movie makes me thing is more than just another martial arts exhibition. It was an very pleasant surprise.",Null,0,0,2 April 2004
