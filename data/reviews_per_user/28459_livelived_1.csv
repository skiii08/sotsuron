The Devil's Advocate," Perfect story with brilliant acting
",In my opinion this is a very good movie. The acting is very good and the one - liners keep flowing from the screen. Reeves did his best performance ever and can even stand against the (as usual) perfect play of Pacino. The story is brilliant told and I have never seen such a cool devil in human form in my live. Defenitally worth checking this. From beginning till the end the psychologic tale stands as a rock.,10,1,1,28 March 2003
