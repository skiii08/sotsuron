The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Feel Good Teen Flick
","Socially troubled, Shy Charlie joins the high school as freshmen and befriends with seniors Patrick and Sam and they really changes his life. Haunted by the past, Charlie falls in love with Sam eventually. And the story goes on with an unexpected twist. A well made teen flick and i was very happy to recall my memories of my yesteryear mainly the late 90s where the friends chats each other (not through mobile phones), compile the songs through Audio Tapes, writing letters, reading books. wow.. that was really a call from the past. Emma Watson, she was the main attraction.. She was really cute and mesmerizing. Logan Lerman who portrayed the central character was absolute delight, he totally acted out as a good, troubled teenager who thinks that he can never mingle with the society especially the school. But he was not a kisser :P Patrick played by Ezra Miller (googled to find the name) also did his part in a good way. All the other supporting characters portrayed by the famous actors like Paul Rudd, Mae Whitman, etc was adequate. The slow mellowed background score was nice with some good soothing songs here and there also added the garnish. Well Narrated and nicely executed of the adapted epistolary of the same name by the author 'Stephen Chbosky'. Well, if you are looking for something fresh and feel good one This one is a nice pick.. Go for it 8.3 on 10",8,0,2,20 June 2016
This Is the End," A Different Stoner
","When I Saw the trailer, i was certain to watch this movie.. My expectations didn't let me down. Since, this is kinda no brain stoner comedy. All the actors are appearing as themselves and the world facing an apocalypse, and the survival of the fittest all blended in one movie. I liked Seth & Franco combo after the stoner comedy Pineapple Express, and they were really too good.. The story is fantasized, even though the dir combo displayed in a well manner. I don't think, everyone likes this movie coz of the explicit content and the portrayal of apocalypse theme in a more funny way. I enjoyed the whole movie.Sountracks were really impressive and Backstreet Boys (one of my favorite bands) were surprising.All in whole, its a good comedy..7.5 on 10",7,2,7,19 September 2013
Green Room," Good and Nice Attempt
","Jeremy Saulnier who directed the brilliant revenge drama 'Blue Ruins' comes up with a new slasher movie named Green Room. The story revolves around a punk band who traps in a green room after witnessing a murder in pub located in a remote area. It focuses how they escapes from the room. Patrick Stewart who is well known for his portrayal of Professor X in Xmen appears in a new avatar 'a cold blooded villain'. Anton Yellchin & Imogen Poots are the other well know celebrities in the movie. Rest of the crew were also played satisfactorily. Starts in a slow note and then accelerates to the perfect neat fast and dark thriller which can satisfy almost all audiences. It has gore action, so many blood, sometimes keep you to the edge of the seat. The background score was neat. Camera-work was satisfactory. Overall, a much more watchable thriller 6.8 on 10",7,0,3,3 February 2017
Spotlight," Well Executed Spotlight
","Movie Marathon V.3 # 070Spotlight is well made movie based on the true incidents happened / happening all over the world within the Christian Community. This picks a daring story of sexual molestation on Kids which involves the priests from lower ranks to the higher ones. Excellent Screenplay and dialogues Executed in a much different way. You don't even get bored in this investigative thriller even for one second. The amazing performances by the lead actors especially Michael Keaton (WoW, he is too good), Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams and Brian. Liev Schrieber and other actors did wonderful jobs as the supporting actors.The camera-work was pretty much good reprising the 90s. The major ups of this movie as i earlier said was the story and performances which made this movie so lively and interesting to watch. I couldn't see any actors in this movie and all i saw was some reporters investigating on some meaty news.If you are interested in a well executed thriller with more good moments. Don't even hesitate to watch this.. This will fill your mind for sure.My rating 8.5 on 10",8,0,1,6 May 2016
No Strings Attached," NOT a BORING movie
","Movie Marathon V.3 # 120The only factor that made me to watch this movie is the gorgeous 'NATALIE PORTMAN'. Synopsis A typical romance drama revolves around Emma and Adam who opts sex over relationship but when time flies by they realizes that their relationship grew to something more intimate.No Strings Attached & Friends with Benefits shares the same story in which No Strings Attached were released some 5 months earlier to the latter. But i have watched the latter earlier. Even though i didn't felt bore watching this movie, thanks to the screen presence of Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher and also pretty good direction by Ivan Reitman. The story could have been better and some of the scenes mainly during their break-up was not even convincing and more lot of scenes were not convincing, felt like they made those scenes just to increase time..Natalie delivered overall good performance, she was pretty good in her romantic expressions and also in emotional scenes. Ashton Kutcher was also good but was overshadowed by Natalie. Kevin Kline who played Ashton's Father who is a womanizer was very funny. The background score and especially the songs were also good.Wholly, the movie is not a messy one, but not a masterpiece / great film. but is a time pass watch for NPMy rating 6.0 on 10",6,0,1,4 July 2016
Avengers: Endgame," MASTERPIECE
","AND THE WAIT IS OVERInfinity War which gave the world rumbling because of the wrath of Thanos. And here it elevates the emotions of every MCU fans that too right from the stone.I always wanted to brag/say about Endgame but that will end up with too many spoilers. So the plot remains unrevealed.The movie has an ensemble cast feat. all the ones you've known and with the outnumbered super heroes teams up to defeat Thanos, one of the most powerful villain of MCU. He stands out tall in this one too. All superheroes has their own spaces, imprinting themselves in everyone's mind. Endgame portrays the emotions and personal stories of the superheroes and was really touching.Even though Endgame is Visual Masterpiece but rides through the emotions whole throughout but also will make you laugh. Thor, Antman, Hulk and Rocket leads the laughter squad. Captain America was not my fav. hero, but after this he has a special spot in my heart. Iron Man, he was brilliant. All the superheroes will grab a special place in your heart for sure.Russo brothers did a wonderful job in terms of writing and in directing. Endgame is visual treat to the eyes and the finale battle was also well convincing. Technical aspects were outstanding in terms of Camera, Score, CGI, Editing, Art, etc.It's a long 181 minutes movie but you will not take your eyes even for one second.A must watch in Theaters especially in IMAX. a MASTERPIECEI will go out with 10 on 10",10,3,6,25 April 2019
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," A Complete Entertainer of 2011
","The fourth installment of Mission Impossible has hit the right spot. Tom Cruise & Brad Bird delivers the best with highly adrenaline pumped edge of the seat thriller with amazing stunt sequences & excellent cinematography.The Burj Khalifa sequence were awesome. I watched the movie in IMAX, most of the audiences were screaming at that time (especially ladies). Wow!!! what an amazing treat!!!! Jeremy Renner delivered some good performances, but Cruise topped with great performances. I would say, introducing Jeremy renner instead of Jonathan Rhys Meyers to the film was totally a good idea. Coz, Jeremy has got the screen presence apart from JRM. A perfect choice for the Fall movie.. Majority of stunt sequences are interesting, appealing and thrilling.This is one of the top movie of Tom Cruise. And i will give 9 out of 10",10,5,10,17 December 2011
Uri: The Surgical Strike," How is the Josh?? Best Ever War Movie From India
","Debutante Writer-Director Aditya Dhar's Uri is a perfect tribute to Indian Army. The movie is based on the surgical strike operated by India in September 2016.The film mainly revolves around Major Vihaan Singh Shergill, head of the special formes in the Indian Army and he is very famous in organizing and executing fool proof strategies. After the successful mission in East India, he is back in Delhi upon his special request to look after his mother, an Alzheimers Patient. But things fall apart, when four armed militants made an attack on a armybase in Uri which led to 19 unarmed Indian Army soldiers including his brother were killed. India organizes a surgical strike which was headed by Vihaan.Even though, the plot is known to every Indian but never loses its steam whole throughout the movie. The first half of the movie basically caters the lives of Indian Soldiers but have plenty of action scenes. Dhar's Screenplay, dialogues, direction were top notch even though it follows Katheryn Biegalow's war movies. The thrill builds especially in the second half will give you goosebumps whole throughout. Absolutely brilliant Background Score by Shashwat Sachdev, Stunning Cinematography by Mitesh Mirchandani and Lighting, Brilliant Action Choreography and the blood pumping dialogues by Aditya Dhar are the major plus points.Bulky Vicky Kaushal is another big reason to watch. He performs at ease displaying all the emotions of a war hero. His screenpresence was noteworthy. Paresh Rawal performance was also good. I felt like Yami Gautam & Kriti Kulhari were wasted.How is the Josh??
High, Sir.One of the best war movie made in India, made by India and made for IndiaDon't miss this",10,1,3,20 January 2019
Edge of Tomorrow," One of the best Actioner in Summer
","I was planning for the fdfs of Edge of Tomorrow, but due to my tight schedule, i've got that chance to watch it yesterday. Believe me, this is one of the most thrilling and spine chilling movie of the year. Tom Cruise looked young, and vibrant. His action moves were satisfying and engaging. But the main protagonist of the movie is the story and the screenplay. Stunning graphics, Explosive sound effects and chilling action made this movie to my favorite movie list.Story sounds little bit similar with Groundhog day even though, it wont make you bored because of the crisp editing and the narration. The graphics and sound effects helped the story to a large extent to make it Emily Blunt, she was amazing and looked beautiful in the movie. Doug Liman did a wonderful job. The movieA perfect 10 on 10",10,0,2,18 June 2014
Taken 2," Failed My Expectations
","I was looking for this movie for a long time, when the sequel was announced. But it failed me miserably.. As usual Liam Neeson did justice to his role, but the movie is not a Edge-Of-Your-Seat Action Thriller. Really really disappointing. The movie starts on a slow note and then tries to progress with car chase,then abduction, finding the trails.. All was just like a normal one.. Nothing new....! It was really a disappointment. All i liked about this movie, is Bryan (Liam Neeson)'s instructions to his daughter to find their hideouts was lil bit OK.. But rest of all, the movie is an utter disappointing. Background score was inapt. MY verdict 5.5 / 10 {i gave Taken 9 on 10)",6,3,5,9 October 2012
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," DC fails once again
","Well, there was an era when Bolly Wood movies and Malayalam movies (BOTH FROM India) shares the story of two brothers who was separated in the childhood and they fights each other. And the villain always makes them fight for his personal gain and before the climax they will come to know that they are brothers because of a small clue or a common factor and fights together against villain. And happy ending. I think the writers David S. Goyer (batman begins, the dark knight,fury, Da Vinci's demons) and Chris Terrio (Argo) was inspired by the above said Bolly wood and Malayalam movies. The story is messy and the screenplay is ridiculous. Zack Snyder is back with another messy movie just like his previous Man of Steel. I don't know how the producers and DC comics vouched their precious millions on this stupid thing.Ben Affleck as Batman,he looked very massive whole throughout the movie and Henry Cavill was well-build. Ben Affleck was totally awesome in the new version / avatar of BATMAN. The furious, heart filled with vengeance, aggressive Batman. Henry Cavill's Superman looked handsome but was not up to the mark in terms of performance and till end his facial expressions were the same. Wonder woman, another superwoman just to add spice but was totally wasted. Jeremy Irons as Alfred was a letdown (we really miss Michael Caine here). Jesse Eisenberg who played the baddie reminded me of Indian actor SRK.. The style, dialogue delivery was same as Shah Rukh Khans gestures. The casting, i would say it was overcrowded. Some characters were not even justified a single moment. Just wasted. The acting of almost all the actors were boring. Numerous scenes in the movie had some moments. Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL who carried out the music department was total let down. It was loud and not arranged in a good manner also created a negative impact.DC ONCE AGAIN FAILS BIG TIME.My clear rating is 5.5 on 10 An avoidable one.",5,6,12,24 March 2016
Deadpool," Funny, Gore & Naughty Deadpool
","I went for this movie with high expectations after watching the trailers and the mini trailers plus the trust in Ryan Reynolds Well the movie opened with title credits which is very new to me and was very much impressive. Then continues with an amazing stunt which was totally good. Well, then i thought, WoW Marvel is not going to follow their typical chick flick superhuman movies. Story revolves around a navy returned wade Wilson who works as a mercenary in New York city. He founds his love interest from a bar and started to live peacefully. But fate struck him in the form of cancer. An agent approaches him to recruit for his secret organization that will give mutant abilities and he accepts the offer. But during the process he was disfigured and he calls himself as dead pool and takes the revenge on the organization forms the crux of the story. Dialogues, action sequences, comedy, one liner punches, scenes, background score, Ryan Reynolds of course with an ensemble cast are the positives of the movie. A wonderful entertainer which is not to be missed in theater without much negatives. All in whole a wonderful movie and i will go out with 9 on 10",9,8,22,24 March 2016
The Hangover Part III," Worst jokes of the year
","OMG!!! What a disappointment.!!!! The last installment from the Hangover Franchise is one of the biggest disappointment of the year. The comedy is really boring. The movie lacks the plot and the screenplay is really embarrassing. I didn't expect this kind of treat from Todd Philips (Hangover & Due Date were excellent, Hangover 2 was OK). But this was terrible. Zach's comedy was also irritating and nothing new in this movie. And in fact, the one of the worst movie of the year.. I don't know, why Todd Philips produced this kind of stupid movie.I will give 4.5 on 10",4,0,1,3 October 2013
John Wick: Chapter 2," Blood, Blood And More Blood
","I was planned to watch the FDFS from the day they announced the sequel coz i was totally addicted to the Introduction movie of John Wick. I went to the movie with sky high expectations. This time the story revolves around John Wick, who wanted to clear his debt from the past ending that to become a fugitive in the underworld. He had to survive at any cost where the whole assassins are looking for him to claim the bounty.The movie is bloody, gore, violent and absolute treat for the action loving cinema-goers. The story was pretty good, filled with adrenaline pumped action sequences but most of the moves are repeating and was tiring for me. But couple of action scenes were top notch and you can see the brilliance of action choreo turned director Chad Stahelski. The background score added the toppings. The dialogues were good. The camera-work was exceptional and convincing. The VFX did a good part in the action scenes especially with the car chase and action in the beginning. But movie has got the lag in between which will ruin your appetite. Some of the action scenes were illogical, making the hero as immortal and fatigue free.. Keanu Reeves was totally amazing in the movie with his ice cold mannerisms, dialogue delivery and of course, action. Lawrence Fishburne did a cameo and am expecting him in a full role for the next installment. Rest of the crew including the cast from the First installment were there and did a good job.From my point of view, this didn't meet my expectations and falls just behind the first installment. For Me, JW 1 is better than this.I would go out with 7.2 on 10",8,8,16,9 February 2017
