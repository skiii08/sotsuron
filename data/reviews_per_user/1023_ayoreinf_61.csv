The Avengers," Real good fun movie, the way fun movie should be
","The Avengers is a fun movie, fun to watch with no feeling of shame for liking it. The plot itself might not be a masterpiece, but the characters are all very well written, some even better than in the movies that originally presented them, and good actors can do wonders with well written characters. The special effects are as good as we recently came to expect them and the pace is just perfect for the film, which is much to say for an action film that lasts more than two hours. I especially liked the performance of Robert Downey Jr. and Scarlett Johansson, and Tom Hiddleston is also very impressive as the very evil Loki, but almost every one on screen does a good professional job, which has a lot to do with the way the roles were written. - I know I said it already, I simply think it deserves repeating. And just one last remark on whoever complains that the plot doesn't make any sense. If you accept super heroes, the rest comes with the territory, it's not less likely than any other comic based film I've seen. The only problem begins when the characters come out too 'cartoonish' the acting doesn't have much to cling to, and the whole thing falls apart. It doesn't happen here.",8,2,6,13 May 2012
Blade Runner 2049," Nothing could compare with the original, but this is a decent attempt
","Blade Runner is my favorite film ever, and as close to perfection as any movie has come. I deliberately didn't say the best film ever. 'the best film ever' is an over used phrase that means nothing. I can think of at least 10 other movies which are as good as Blade Runner, even though I personally like Blade Runner more. No wonder Ridley Scott didn't dare touching his greatest masterpiece again as a director and limited himself to the role of producer this time.So I must admit, there was very little chance that the sequel will come close to the perfection of the previous film, and I think I can state this almost objectively. This blend of a brilliant original idea (Philip K. Dick is really without an equal on this department), a perfect script, great visuals, wonderful acting and just the right amount of Christian and Celtic symbolism to give the entire thing some extra depth. The choice of the very same script writer - Hampton Fancher, is certainly a must, and it does look and even feels like a straight forward next episode in the story we started following on 1982. Which is a big plus to begin with. And the story does make sense, it's definitely taking place in the same universe of its predecessor. The acting is still great, and the very same basic questions are still echoing all over the movie: What is it that makes us human? Will it make our creation human too? and what does it mean morally to create other humans, even if only manufactured ones?For me, all of the above are a very worthy list, which makes Blade Runner 2049 a great movie, even if it doesn't soar as high as the original.One last point has to do with the use of 3D. It's being used for one purpose, to make the world we see more real. Not for cinematic fireworks or any other form of directorial showing off, and I for one, liked it.",8,2,9,16 October 2017
The Equalizer," A cinematic marvel spoilt by a simplistic story line
","It seems that all the world's problems with crime could've been solved if only we had Robert McCall on the other end of the line. This unstoppable force of nature could bring in world peace in no time, and if we gave him some more leeway I'm sure he'd solve world hunger and global warming too. Which is plainly speaking just a shame, the film as is is superbly shot and acted, it uses the cinematic image like very few others in the industry do, and previous encounters with Antoine Fuqua, proves that he simply has this great understanding of the visual aspects of movie making, The Replacement Killers and King Arthur are just two obvious examples. The original series, was superb because in its Edward Woodward version McCall's limitation were always part of the story, he was super because he never tried to overcome a roomful of armed gangsters, he strategized his way around such circumstances. And never tried to solve the entire American problem with the Mob. What's the point of translating TV masterpieces of the past to the big screen if you miss its core point.",8,2,7,28 September 2014
Source Code," No intentional spoiler inside
","Let me start by saying, I didn't mean to see 'Source Code'. It was one of those films I red about and thought I might see them one day, but it was sheer accident I ended up seeing it. And despite some plot holes I enjoyed it. The acting is first class, Gyllenhaal is repeating his Prince of Persia role, so much so I could call the earlier movie a spoiler for this one, but that's all I'm going to say on the subject. Problem is this film is almost impossible to speak about without adding spoilers. I can say the pacing was perfect, I can say it's an action sci-fi (many scientist will debate this) in which most of the action is psychological. I could add a special commendation for Vera Farmiga whose role is much harder than most of the others on the film and she still performs superbly, but truth is that's all I can say without adding a spoiler.So here is the bottom line, despite the mentioned plot holes, the movie works and that's what matters.",8,3,5,6 April 2011
Skyfall," Not the best Bond ever, but easily the best Bond of Daniel Craig
","I don't like reviewing a movie that was reviewed hundreds of times, though I do make an exception every now and again. Well here's one, and the main reason I do write it is because I saw too many claiming it's the best Bond ever - I could never pick a single one but It's one of the top ten which is quite an achievement considering the two previous ones which I rank at the bottom of the list. I hated the reboot, I think it was done for all the wrong reasons and in the worst possible way, and I think Quantum of Solace kept a bad thing going in the wrong direction. This one does go back to the older style, which in my book is the only reason for Bond to exist. If Bond tries to be another Jason Bourne, it takes an original and makes a copycat out of him, and it's plain shame. This one feels like Daniel Craig was eventually allowed to give his own version to Bond, and it's a good one. The whole cast is stellar, Javier Bardem is as superb as everyone has said, Albert Finney gets five minutes on screen and as the old pro that he is, uses them to steal the show, and all the would be new regulars of the series are doing a great job. Sam Mendes, does show a great flare that does suit the film well. All together it's a great fun film, but I personally can't compare it to any of the other great Bonds of the past simply because they are all so very different and dependent on the personality of the actor in the role (or lack of it - at least in one case).",9,3,8,18 November 2012
Iron Man 3," It's the acting stupid
","I Liked all the Iron Man movies so far. This one is the best of the three. And no, it's not the special effects, not the fire works, not even the plot twists. They're all in, but they were there beforehand, the special bit about this third Iron Man movie is the combination of a very well written character whose weakness in a manner of speaking is also his strength. Who shows more humanity with all its frailness, as he faces his greatest adversary. It's not exactly the Mandarin we're familiar with from the Marvel comic, but Iron Man himself is not exactly the comic book Iron Man, so it makes sense. But it all works, as I said because the well written character is met with a tour de force of acting by a certain Robert Downey Jr.who's simply superb. It's one of the best performances I've seen from an actor in a long while. And it makes this super hero movie just this extra little bit better than most. It makes it real, even if you're not a fun of the genre, which I have to admit, I am. I think this one will move even some comic skeptics, if they give it a try.",9,0,4,8 May 2013
John Wick," twice compared, and coming out rather well
","I stated more than once over here that though I don't like comparing movies, sometimes a comparison is unavoidable. This is doubly so for John Wick. First is the almost automatic comparison with The Equalizer. Another retired professional killer forced out of retirement into an all out collision with the Russian mob, (boy, are they once again the popular bad guys in town). Well, despite some obvious casting advantages the earlier release has over John Wick, mainly as far as the leading role is concerned, The final result is working in favor of John Wick. It's plot is much more believable than The Equalizer's, it's fight scenes are way more real, look less like a choreographed ballet and more like a fight to the death, in which both sides are drawing blood.The second comparison I feel that I must make goes a bit further back, all the way to Eastwood's masterpiece Unforgiven. Another man with a bad past coming back to avenge a seemingly minor crime, this time not hired but much more driven and there a few other similar plot twists which I can't discuss without adding a spoiler. Once again we have a film debating the nature of evil, and when is evil not really evil, and John Wick doesn't do too badly in this comparison as well. I must refer to Keanu Reeves shortcomings as an actor. His range is well known as limited but he usually has a flare for choosing the right roles for his abilities, he does exceptionally well here, despite some early wooden moments at the very beginning of the film. The rest of the cast is superlative, apart from Michael Nyqvist, who's delivery in English leaves a lot to be desired. Yes the language should sound foreign in his mouth, but the emotions should still be there, and they often felt forced too me. The rest is very well done, the pace, the cinematography, all were right on the spot for the film. A proof that action flicks can be thoughtful and emotionally true.",9,6,18,27 October 2014
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Still not sci-fi, and still a great movie
","I hardly ever write reviews for movies with more than 200 reviewers, and this one has more than 800 at the moment. But since I have two major points to make, and since so many around, including some experienced reviewers, (not to say professional ones) complain about the predictability of the plot - hey that's a prequel, it has to be predictable, because we all already know how it ends. The room for surprising plot twists is almost non existent. The movie must aim for something different and it does. It carries further the exploration of good and evil, sometimes a bit superficially some times with surprising depth. But that's what comics is all about, especially a sci-fi comics - it explores the nature of people and the choices they make when finding themselves in hypothetical fictional situations, that test their moral core. The good ones do it with more depth than one may realize, as the story itself often seems simplistic. This one has some extra depth to it as it also explores the nature of Hope, what it does to people and how it can drive them with surprising and unexpected force.All this is done very cleverly, using some real great characters, we don't get to see how they all evolved into the people we see on screen, but all those we do see on screen for more than a few seconds are fully developed characters, and most of the actors do them justice. The leading three: Felicity Jones, Diego Luna and Alan Tudyk are super, best of the three is Tudyk who does incredible job as the opinionated sarcastic robot, an impossible role which he performs with surprising credibility.All this doesn't really matter you're all going to rip this review to shreds because I dare say that this is not really a science fiction, since science is not the issue here, and doesn't drive the plot. The issue here is the nature of power, the relations power has to being good or evil and as I also pointed out - the power generated by Hope. If you want to discuss this with me, my IMDb account is open to massages, I promise to answer whoever will write. I already know you probably won't write, just hit the not useful button. Have it your way, I'll keep writing what I think.",9,0,6,1 January 2017
Captain Marvel," So much hate goes on around this movie it becomes a budge of honor
","This is a good movie. It has good story, good actors, all around, with the leading couple realy shining through. Namely Samuel L. Jackson and Brie Larson both build wonderful roles, have great chemistry together, and make us believe them and care for them. You can't ask for more from any actor or actress. There are a few faults in the basic premise, that is, since Captain Marvel is set to be the saviour of the univers, she's made way too powerful, they even make her do a Superman style stunt, which I won't speak about since I don't do spoilers. But that's a fault I already discussed when I wrote my review for the last Avengers installment. As far as I'm concerned the fault was made then, and now they have to live with it. But everything else works just fine here.And still, there's pouring hate against it. So many people say it's a bad movie, it's bland, boring and I could mention worse names stuck to this movie. And I just saw it, with many others and none complained, in fact they all seemed to have fun. So I was wondering where does all this hate come from, and I can't avoid the conclusion that too many people here feel like they have to fight against the onslaught of raging faminism. As far as I'm concerned, this is so silly I think of all the hate my review is bound to get here as my personal budge of honor.Botom line: It's a good movie, a good introduction of a superhroine that suffers from a problematic starting point, due to no fault of the creative team of this movie. In fact I'm much more worried thinking how will Avengers Endgame team handle this impossible starting point. But in this case they did all they can, and they came up with a real fun movie.",8,1,7,10 March 2019
Passengers," A perfect blend of Sci-Fi and romance
","Seeing this movie now is a great fit for me, a week after Rogue One, a movie I also liked, but I find its classification as Sci Fi to be mistaken, for the simple reason that science as is, doesn't really play a role in the story, it's just being used for gadgets and weapons for a story about Good v Evil about corrupting Power against the power of Hope.While Passengers is driven by the science fiction idea of colonizing space and even more by the idea of people traveling in a fully automated ship hibernating all the way through their voyage. Without these two elements there's no story here. That's the reason this movie is first and foremost sci-fi. This sci-fi story drives a romantic adventure, or in other words, a love story about how two people can be an entire world among themselves if they do love each other. It's much deeper than the cliché itself, because the story is well written. The characters are superbly written, and the actors are next to flawless, only four roles but each one performed as close to perfection as I've seen in a long while, and three of these four roles called for the highest quality of acting. One last remark and a dual one regarding some comments I've read here. Regarding some scientific goofs in the script - these are plain nonsense. It doesn't matter at what real speed the meteor storm would look like, cinematically it made sense to show them at slow motion. It doesn't matter if the artificial gravity would malfunction under such conditions, this is one of the best visual ways of demonstrating that a space ship is falling apart. Another claim I feel I must refer to is that this is a rom-com. The fact that humor is used during the story telling doesn't make it a romantic comedy, there are funny moments because that's the way good relationship develop, but there's no comedy here. Just a very good sci-fi romance worth seeing.",9,1,3,8 January 2017
Zootopia," The best in the TTT era of Disney
","Long ago, that is long ago in movie making calendars, in the year 2007, they made a lovely witty film in the Disney Studios. It was called Enchanted, and it had a brand new concept at its base. It had the normal Disney conventions turned upside-down. It was fresh and charming and it gave the entire Disney universe a brand new attitude. I really loved it, I still find Enchanted to be one of the best ever made by the studios. But than, somebody important fell in love with this novel approach to the world, they also realized they could now remake every film they ever made with this new attitude, that meant a whole lot of new scripts written with the same twist in the plot and the TTT era was born. TTT - namely Turned Tables Trend. Thus came into the world The Princess and the Frog, Frozen, Tangled, Alice in Wonderland and many more. Many of these were real nice movies, but they all have the idea of retelling the story in a new, more modern way. Where, neither good nor evil will be exactly what we thought it would be. Like all ideas, it wasn't good or bad as is, it was a new idea - for the Disney Studios, it meant, in a manner of speaking that they did arrive into our modern world. But sometimes it became all consuming. That's how bad movies such as Maleficent and Into the Woods were born, when the idea of twisting the plot became everything and nothing else was important.Now all that was mostly about the history of recent cinema, but I'm both a history buff and a cinema buff, so I do apologize for the digression. All I wanted to say, that for me, this is the best movie made by Disney since that trend took over. It's the best because while this concept is still there, it doesn't control the movie - the story does. It does mean that the end is not so very unpredictable, but I don't mind that all that much. It's a very good story, great voice acting, wonderful jokes. I just love it. But please Disney - try something new, every now and again, how about something old fashion just for the novelty of the idea.",9,7,13,8 April 2016
Knives Out," Some personal points I have to make
","Starting with the title, a painful issue here in Israel. Since the title is determined by the distributers of the movie, not by the translators, we here end up repeatedly with travesties such as this. How does one make Knives Out, which is not a precise idiom in Hebrew, but does have a close enough meaning as is, into A Well Written Murder. I'm sorry, but the answer here is beyond me and I suspect there's none. I suppose I should be used to this problem with movies titles, but I never am.As for the movie itself. It's a good dark comedy, with a stellar cast that justifies its casting. They all perform superbly, most of all Chris Evans and Ana de Armas. But one must also mention Daniel Craig who gets to play a cartoon character, and still manages to come out OK. Every time he spoke, I kept remembering Tony Curtis in Some Like it Hot, when he lampooned Cary Grant, pretending to be a made up oil billioner and Jack Lemmon reacted 'Nobody speaks like that'. Nobody speaks the way Craig spoke in this movie, it was just one more aspect of making him a cartoon, a cardboard cut out for the excentric detectives the Agatha Christie school of detective literature loves so much. Unlike all other characters here, which are cartoons of real people, Craig is a cartoon of literary tradition implanted in the movie. Considering this, he does his job as well as could be expected.One last point - the political aspect. Yes, one can't understand it without the contemporary beckground, and I think it's a mistake, limiting the movie. But I can also see the point the movie's creators were trying to make - xenophobia and bigotry arn't limited to red necks and to the lower tiers of society. In fact they are much more insidious when practiced by the upper echelons of society. I can see this point, I may even agree with this opinion, but it didn't have to take such a significant role in the movie. Taking the detective literture and satirizing it, may call for barbs directed toward the aristocracy, it doesn't mean it has to sound so much like a current affairs debate on TV. As far as I'm concerned, this was the only fault of this lovely movie, I'd rate it even higher without it.",9,1,7,9 December 2019
Oldboy," Pushing all the boundaries
","It's not the sort of film I normally go for in a cinema festival. As a regular visitor of the Jerusalem film festival, I decided to make an exception and have a look at Ojdeuboi (Old Boy), a two hours tale of vengeance of epic proportions. It's a masterpiece if I ever saw one. The acting is never short of amazing, even though the story line pushes its protagonists from one extreme to the other, they always remain true. The photography is superb, the editing and pacing keep the viewers glued to their sits for the entire 120 minutes. And the plot itself, is an unequaled wonder. It's a Greek tragedy (or a Shakespearian tragedy if you will) set in our modern world, and yet it always looks real, much of it is due to the breathtaking performance of the cast, but they could never do it if the plot wasn't there to carry them through. Any lesser director and cast would've ended with a mediocre soap opera, as is this is an instant classic about human frailty and strength, a must see for every true lover of cinema who's up to the task.",9,1,7,13 July 2014
Deadpool 2," Clever script turns the breaking of the fourth wall into a story
","Lets go back to the 1st Deadpool. What we had there was lots of fun, lots of wit, but actually very little story development. I still liked it a lot, but it felt like the script writers were given a new toy - lets imagin the famous 4th wall is broken to smithereens and see what happens. And they loved this broken 4th wall toy so much all else became insignificant. But since Ryan Reynolds has tons of charisma, and Morena Baccarin isn't short on the stuff too, it worked.We could say this is mostly true of the sequel, but it's done in a much more deliberate manner. It's as if the kids learned how to play with this toy. So despite of the fact that we rarely come across any real character in this movie. That is, we do see many cartoons passing by on the screen, most of them don't really matter, at least not in Deadpool's mind, and since the entire story is being told through his eyes we only see them as cartoons, even if Colossus gets a fair amount of screen time, he never grows into a fully developed character, others don't even get that much, passing as another short gag in the script. In fact only the talent of Josh Brolin and Zazie Beetz creates a character where very little character is really written for them. And still it works. And it works better than it did in the original installment. Because it's done thoughtfully, it shows what one can do with complete creative freedom if one keeps his sense of boundries and limitations, and understands the nature of the media.I only wish the writers of Avengers Infinity War had half the sense of Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick who wrote this with Ryan Reynolds. It would've made it into a much better movie too.",9,3,6,22 May 2018
Midnight in Paris," The best Woody has done in a long while
","Truth be told, after following his career diligently through to the end of the 80s - 1990 is in fact the end of the 80s and Alice was the last I've seen of Woody's work without missing a single one. There were still some very good movies in the 90s but in recent years he seemed to be making a film a year because that's what he does. The last two I've seen though technically flawless lost the special soul and personality that was his trademark. Whatever Works of two years ago was nice and had a great Allen feel to it (it was an old script after all) but the plot was forced at many moments and never more so than at the end which gave the whole experience a bad after taste.Well I've heard this one was different, and after great deliberation decided to give Woody another shot. I wasn't disappointed, it is as the title said the best I've seen of him for a very long while. In fact the only flaw I did find in the movie was Owen Wilson whom I do like in many of his roles but I must say -despite looking almost like Woody without the glasses it felt like he was busy doing a Woody imitation and not playing the struggling writer he should have been. Every one else was perfect. The plot flowed seamlessly the cinematography was amazing and all the other actors were super. Even Carla Bruni played her tiny role perfectly (which wasn't as small as I thought it would be) thing is her real role is another Woody trick to make sure we always remember this is a movie. Just like Rembrandt made sure we could see his brush strokes, Woody makes sure we'd never forget none of it is real - it's all his movie and his vision. Altogether it's a real nice clever movie to watch, not a masterpiece but not a waste of time or a disappointment by any stretch.",8,2,4,31 July 2011
Ready Player One," I wish Spielberg will keep doing this sort of films, few are equal to him when fantasy is running wild
","Must admit, I stopped watching Spielberg's 'based on a true story' movies long ago, shortly after Empire of the Sun, which I found so melodramatic I could hardly stand it. On the other hand, though I didn't see all his fantasy movies, I usually love'em, even when many don't (I just love Hook to pieces, despite some minor faults).
 
But lets stick to the movie at hand. It's a visually stunning story taking place mostly in a virtual universe, that is - in a movie - since that's what a well made movie really is. So in a way it's a movie about movies, filled with many inside jokes for movie buffs, or if you want to call it as they do in the movie - filled with easter eggs. The story is told superbly, this was always Spielberg's strong suit. The pace is just perfect, the movie runs for more than 2 hours without a single dull moment. Roles are well written, performed very professionally by all, though I must single out Ben Mendelsohn who really shines as the lead villain of the movie. As a rule the movie adheres to the laws of the universe in which it takes place, so it makes sense inside the virtual world we're watching on screen. And as far as I'm concerned this is one of the best fantasy movies I've seen in a long while, and I did see most of the recent ones. I'll rank it in my top three or four of the last two years, but don't hold me to a strict time limit, it could well be one of the the top five of the last five years or so. If you have the opportunity go see it, it's one of those you'll need to see so you know what's everybody is speaking about in coming years.",9,7,14,10 April 2018
Moana," A Disney production for better and worse
","No real surprises, Moana is a Disney production. You don't get any real surprises on a Disney production. Even throughout the last decade, that is from Enchanted onward, the age of the twist at the end of the story, even then, no real surprise, once we got the idea of the twist configured into the general scheme of things. But we do get loads of professionally made fun. That's why we keep on going to the cinema again and again.We get well written characters, performed superbly. We get a character for anyone on screen, even for those getting split seconds of screen time, (that's something that Pixar learned well). We also get national myth twisted into Hollywood pattern. I don't know the Polynezian myths but that's the Disney way, that's the way it worked with the Greek myths, with the Chinese, the Jewish, or the Arabian nights stories. In fact, it also happened with literary masterpieces such as Mary Poppins or Peter Pan. That's the way it'll work in future productions too, it takes no power of prophecy to say so, that's simply evident. And as long as it's fun, I'll always be willing to join the ride.",8,4,15,12 December 2016
Suicide Squad," Taking cartoon villains and making them flesh and blood one can root for
","It's about 8.5 worth of a movie in my book, for some real good acting and well written roles. That is, some well written roles, had it been true with all the characters in this movie, this would've been a real masterpiece, but all too often it did fall short of the quality performance of Will Smith, Margot Robbie and Joel Kinnaman. there are a few other solid performances which didn't get their characters developed enough to shine like these three, especially Viola Davis who's very good as the perfect government agent that sees nothing but getting their job done, but truth is her role is too one dimensional, and there was room for real depth here. Same is true with Jai Courtney and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje. Jared Leto, isn't bad in his role, but it's hardly a role to speak about, and he was hyped from here to forever, so it was a letdown. But the roles that were properly written were really superb and the three actors I mentioned did them great justice. This together with a reasonable plot and solid technical aspects of this production, make it a worth your while movie. But once again this could've been a lot better, and the fact it's not is plain shame.",8,8,12,7 August 2016
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," A good balance of characters and plot
","In recent years it seemed to me all too often that action movies directors and script writers felt like they had to choose between characters development and a coherent plot, this one strike the balance as close to perfection as I've seen in a very long while. It does help the actors (as I've said more than once - good actors can work wonders when they have properly written characters to work with), and even more important as far as I'm concerned, it helps in examining the moral core of the whole sci-fi comics concept. The inherent fascist undercurrents of the entire super hero idea. This concept has been dealt with by all the real good comics adaptations, both on screen and on print.Bottom line, it's a fun ride with added value to boot, if you like sci-fi comics adaptations, this one is a must see.",9,5,9,8 April 2014
Doctor Strange," Deeper than I expected
","I stated just a short while ago that one doesn't go to see movies in order to learn deep philosophical truth. I still think its true, but that doesn't mean that a good movie, every now and again, can't say something deep and meaningful. You just have to be there watch and listen, it doesn't even have to spoil the fun.And this movie is fun. It's a visual spectacle, with CG pushed to its limits. With fine acting from the entire cast, having great characters written down for them, and I said more than once - you give good actors well written characters and they can do wonders with it. And here we got Benedict Cumberbatch excelling as the egotistical Dr. Strange, because he was given the best tools to do it. Same is true of Chiwetel Ejiofor who was given in one short film more depth than I ever saw in the comics book, though I must admit I'm not very well versed with this specific comics - I read only two or three Dr Strange issues and most of what I know of the sorcerer supreme stems from his many team ups and from the Defenders. I still appreciate the subtle way in which the script gave depth to all the leading characters.But most of all I enjoyed the fact that beyond the platitudes that come with the territory of every eastern mystical tale, there was some real depth here, and it was delivered with subtlety, the way it should be delivered. Namely, always remember that most of the time its not about you. Or me for all that matter.",9,1,4,7 November 2016
Ant-Man," Such a finely balanced film is hard to come by
","For me, this one is first and foremost a scriptwriter's triumph. The story is so superbly balanced, touching upon all the right issues of the super heroes universe, adding just the right amount of melodrama and always countering it with a well placed joke when it's about to become too sappy or too preachy. The acting is brilliant - It's the second time ever that I liked a role played by Michael Douglas (Falling Down was the 1st). Paul Rudd is just perfect for his role, and as he participated in the script writing, he must be responsible for some of his own jokes (and they do seem his own). And everybody else is a perfect fit, so kudos to the casting director. And when everything is working together so well, the director himself must have a hand in and he does. I know very little of Peyton Reed, but I'll be paying attention from now on.",9,6,14,13 August 2015
Justice League," DC keeps improving, this one is way better than the previous ones
","No, it's not a masterpiece like The Dark Knight or Logan, but it's one of the best DC has come up with in a long while. I don't count Wonder Woman in this list because it took place in a completely different setting, an entire century ago. It was more of a period piece comic than any of the other failures. And it used the period piece attitude to its advantage.This was the very first DC comics production set in our times that used humor properly, it might have something to do with Joss Whedon's role in the production, but it's not important 'who's to blame', the fact that the jokes work is what matters. Bigger than life characters can either be able to laugh at themselves or they come out pompous. A pompous super hero is unattractive, and very hard to take in a film that goes for about two hours.Another big point in favour of this movie, is the acting. This one is an ensemble piece in the best way. Each part of the cast gives its share to the final outcome. Even Ben Afleck's stone face are made to work, when Batman is written to suit his limitations. Ezra Miller is wonderful as the Flash, showing the promise we all felt when we saw him in Fantastic Beasts is coming to fruition. Gal Gadot is improving as I predicted she would. She simply makes the role her own, and is much better than she was in Wonder Woman, where she was all right, and did show signs of the talent she has. Thing is, every one is giving his/hers share. Even the small roles are well written.There's is only one major fault I find with this movie - its villain. Steppenwolf, is one of the most one dimensional villains you could come up with. He'll do all right in a group of super villains. He can't carry the whole antagonist part of the movie by himself. Yes he does look strong and even scary, but that's not enough. There's nothing more there, and the potential did exist. He did fail to conquer earth once before, it's hardly mentioned. the special hatred that should be felt is neglected by the script. Steppenwolf simply hates everything, and shows very little emotion at all. I believe that with more attention to his character the movie would've been a better one.",8,2,6,16 November 2017
Hugo," What 3D is supposed to be like
","Just saw the film - and it's as good as everybody says it is but not only for the reasons specified. I mean it is a love song to old cinema and its sources. It's superbly acted by all the actors involved, and it does carry the signature of Scorsese's genius with every frame. But the aspect I want to speak about is his magnificent use of the 3D technique.- Every picture is multi-layered, both visually and thematically, which means that the visual aspect of the film always reflects its intentions, its ideas - the way that truly good films are supposed to be. I've seen the 3D technique wasted in so many films of the last three years or so. Used for one or two scenes in a film with the real purpose of charging extra at the box office, not this time. Ever since Cameron revived the technique it was mostly misused go and see Hugo in 3D, and you'll see what it's supposed to look like. And also see how it serves the movie and not the producers wish to cash in. All else has already been said but for me this aspect of the film brilliance can never be stressed enough.",10,3,6,11 March 2012
Ender's Game," Asa Butterfield, is the movie, the rest doesn't get in his way
","I liked Asa Butterfield in Hugo, but there he played a child, a special child, true, but still a child. He was acting and reacting to things that exist in our world, some more fantastic than others but at the base they were all things that one can find in the world. Ender Wiggin is nothing like anyone he could encounter. A kid, a genius, a master of strategy, an intellectual grownup trapped in the body of a child with compassion and understanding far surpassing his tender age. And he pulls this one off superbly. As he's now Asa Butterfield is one of the finest actors around. The rest of the film is not important, it is a shallowing down of the book, but it does keep the core plot intact. It does some stupid Hollywood changes like hinting a budding romance between Ender and Petra, and since the child employment laws force the age of the actors a few years above the age of the characters in the story, it almost makes sense to shift the prepubescent friendships of the book with a post pubescent budding romance. Luckily they didn't lay to much story lines on this change, and didn't push it too far. I guess the Orson Scott Card masterpiece is such a classic by now that even Hollywood scriptwriters didn't dare tinkering with it too much. Visually the film is of a very high class, despite not using the 3D trick that could be easily justified in this case they still made me feel slightly disorientated more than once when entering the weightless battle room. The bottom line is a long one in this case, it's not the masterpiece the book is, but it treats the story with due respect; it eliminates some of the brightest aspect of the book like forecasting the internet and social networks as early as 1985 and understanding their implications before they were there to see. And still the lead character of Ender is so strong and its portrayal by Asa Butterfield is so amazing that everything else pales into insignificance, which makes this movie worth seeing even as a prelude to reading the book itself.",9,3,8,3 November 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Should have been a perfect 10
","I know, I'm nit-picking, I did love the film as is, I don't rate films I don't like 9. But it's the X Men, which I love so much, and this one is one of the corner stones of their comics books mythology. So the minute details that didn't really stop it from being a very enjoyable movie, still made me sorry that it's not as perfect as I wanted it to be. The acting is superb by all involved, and as I once stated the roles are the best roles ever written for comics characters. 3D roles that don't actually need the special effects to look real. The pacing is great, the CG is top notch (one can almost add obviously), and the time travel is well constructed, which is not always so easily done. So what did annoy me enough to get this film rated as mere 9. Very simply the platitudes that are getting into the story line, it's hard to explain without any spoiler added, but I'll try. People and plot directions are getting changed in a split second, because somebody says something, when something like this happens in real life it should be a real life altering moment, I remember only one such moment in the film that really qualified, all other fell short. And when a film that I believe should be a real deep story about the basic human fear of the extraordinary and the different, falls into simplistic slogans, if only at certain moments, I can't help but get annoyed. But the bottom line is still a great film for all X Men fans, and for whoever likes the sci-fi comics combo at its best.",9,1,2,1 June 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Another would be 10, in which the missing bits become the heart of the issue
","Once again I have a very good movie, which I loved, and I find myself being annoyed by the little bits that went wrong. OK, maybe not so very little, but still, most of the movie is superbly done. The acting, the pacing, all the technical aspects - every thing is first class. Even what I think is the core of all good comics adaptation - the moral debate around which the entire story revolves. What do you do when you can do almost everything, or in other words what do you do when almost none can stop you. To this very important discussion that many fail to notice because they pay too much attention to the magnificent action scenes and all the fireworks and the CGI. Another layer of moral debate is added, about the nature of all consuming revenge. And again it's done with full respect to matters discussed, not just superficially as an excuse for all the twists and turns of the plot. But then we arrive at the but, the unfortunate annoying but.Here goes: with all the scheming and superb planning, the ending works only if we get these very specific three characters locked together, like they obviously end up. But there's no way anyone could forecast that they will be the three arriving there, that they will be the only three arriving. I can't elaborate without adding spoilers and I won't but this means the stitches holding the plot together are all too evident - this film deserved better. When everything else is so perfect, the plot should be up to par and not the weakest link, and the plot is going all through the film, not in bits. Every time I think about it, I get angry again, and I did like the movie a lot. That's just plain shame.",9,1,5,18 May 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Where and how I found Fantastic Beasts
","I must admit at the very beginning, I'm one of those adults who bought the small booklet, and even enjoyed it. I always appreciate when an author creates an entire world in which his/her story takes place, very few compare with the totality of the world created by JK Rowling. So no wonder that the full story of Newt Scamander has already existed in her mind, when she wrote his textbook for the Hogwarts' students and all the rest of us. But this was written from the very start as a movie, and in my mind is the fruit of the creative partnership she had formed with David Yates, who directed the final three installments (4 actually) of the Harry Potter saga.The result is both a visual marvel, a heartwarming story, and a tale of fantasy, action and suspense. Another part of Rowling's magic is the amazing characters she creates. She created here four wonderful leads, that gave room to some wonderful acting performances: Eddie Redmayne, Katherine Waterston, Alison Sudol, and the most surprising of all Dan Fogler, with whom I was already familiar as a voice actor (Mars Needs Moms) and he proves, that a good voice actor, is a good actor. One more special mention must go for Ezra Miller, who's so superb as Credence, that he almost spoils the surprise at the end of the film. Bottom line, not really a prequel, but a wonderful independent story that happens to fit into the same universe where Harry Potter exists. Don't worry, there's room there for much more.",9,45,90,17 November 2016
Enchanted," I expected charming and witty I got clever as a bonus
","I got more than I expected. I went to see a charming fantasy with some promising cast members and one or two nice trailers. It started slow, witty from the start but very little emotional involvement, I was impressed with how nicely Amy Adams was portraying a cartoon but how emotionally involved can you get with a cartoon character. I was even more impress with her transition into flesh and blood and the growth of character she was showing during a rather short movie. All the cast was doing well not everybody had such a demanding role and Susan Sarandon can complain about lack of screen time even though she gets a blast from her part and it showed. But I most enjoyed the way this movie was commenting about the relations between cinema, fairy tales and real life. I can't demonstrate how well it was done without adding spoilers so you'll simply have to take my word on the subject. You may take a look at the trivia section of this internet page but all those may seem like plain movie buff jokes unless you really go and see how it all makes sense as a statement about cinema as the modern Brothers Grimm. And the movie does it without being openly philosophical, it's all done in a subtle manner in the subtext. It was more than I expected but I'm always ready to get such 'disappointments'.",8,0,1,8 December 2007
Inside Out," Well, Sadness is a necessary emotion, did I just spend 94 minutes to learn that?
","I know' this review will be torn to shreds by most of you other reviewers and readers, as this has long turned into a highest praise competition. A competition I can't join, since personally I was sourly disappointed. This movie, is not as original as most of the viewers claim if you really think so go and check out an early 90s series called Herman's Head, in which we saw the story develops inside Herman's head where four characters controlled his behaviour, basically sensitivity, lust, fear and intellect. A much better division than the five almost randomly picked emotions chosen here.But originality is not the issue here, I said more than once that I don't rate originality as is so very highly, and if this was a good story I wouldn't mind a second hand idea and a random choice of emotions. This is not a good story, I find it hard to explain why without adding a spoiler, but I'm willing to explain my point in details to whomever will challenge me to do so by mail or via the IMDb message box. I promise to answer each and every one no matter how many there will be. All I can say here that we do get high drama, with some very inventive ideas and some very high quality performances, especially so Richard Kind and Phyllis Smith, but almost everyone here does the job to the highest standards. And still it all ends with a whimper, without any real resolution taking place on screen. Yes life goes on is a true statement, but it's not the reason we all came to see this movie. Not with all the hype that preceded. And I still think Up and Wall-E were true masterpieces, not just as animation but as movies by any standard. This one isn't. It's an extended pilot to a new TV series where the idea that life goes on would feel right, but then we won't need all this extra drama and meandering plot line.",7,3,24,21 June 2015
Avengers: Endgame," How far would you go in order to surprise your audience
","Once again I debated with myself, whether I should write a review here. I know most of you won't like what I want to say. I also know with over 4500 reviews already here, most of those who may agree with me, won't even get to see it. It will simply get lost in the sea of fake reviews (paid or otherwise) flooding most of internet sites dedicated to such things. But eventually I decided that keeping what I want to say, in my belly will hurt more. So - here goes:It's a great film based on a few false premises, some of which I already discussed here more than once. See on my review page what I've written about Infinity War, or Captain Marvel. In my personal book, every time a comics superhero dies, somebody made a mistake he (or she), didn't know how to fix. The control directors and script writers have over this sort of material is un limited. So if people don't like the character, and I mean real people not review writers that have a personal grudge against superheroines, because the actress is Israeli or because she was made too strong. If real people don't like the character, you wrote it wrong. Let's agree, it didn't happen here. People love the MCU characters, they were all beautifully written, and each actor performing them did wonders. They became as real as fictional characters can. So I knew what happened in this movie had to happen. I even wrote so in my review for infinity war. I must admit, I didn't guess the way they'll go about it, but I knew the many franchises, stemming from the MCU couldn't end. It wasn't a secrete, they kept on working on some sequells while working on this movie. And still, they did surprise me (and everybody else too). But, this sort of a surprise, dosn't cut it for me. Let's carry on with the toy box imagery, that the Russo brothers spoke about in their own IMDb interview. Think about going to play with your friend, he/she shows you a boxful of amazing toys, 'I love them to pieces' they say, and the very next thing they take out a hummer and break some of them to smithereens. Surprise you? didn't I' yes, you sure did, but you're an idiot. And the fact, the entire movie prooves you're not, is making it even worse.There's no reason in the world to drive the franchise this way, apart from the ego of the people having all the toys, their stupid wish to surprise us and to proove they really can do whatever they want.I may have high esteem for their abilities. I have to agree, it was a great movie - I really didn't like it. And all the reasons for the ending we got, that I can think of, are making it even worse.",8,1,5,29 April 2019
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," A very good movie, slightly reminiscent of the Hobbit
","Peter Jackson's ego that was held at bay all through the previous installment breaks free in this one. The lighthearted atmosphere from the book, that shone so brightly over the 1st part of the his version of the Hobbit, is no longer here, the strange story lines that were added to tie every thing together so no loose end is left and everyone watching the film knows that Peter Jackson did tell us all there was to know. An exact opposite of Tolkien's original who kept always saying (or implying) that middle earth has much more to it than he could ever cover with his stories. It's a difference in egos that doesn't always work for Jackson. Even though he did create a magnificent fantasy epic. Much darker than the first part, much more action packed very high quality of acting performances by all involved. The sins against the original book aren't as grave as those he committed with his LoTR trilogy, mainly because the Hobbit as I already said is a simpler story that doesn't allow for miss representations of the author's intentions. Jackson simply had to invent all these from scratch.I'm all for re-imagining a story, but if you do so at least be honest and tell us that's what you did, like Tim Burton did when he made his version of Alice. Jackson never said any such thing, if he did it was kept a secret from most of the viewers, which is plain shame as far as I'm concern. I know everyone is going to hate this review to pieces, so many 'Jacksoners' are following every bit of film he creates trampling in their wake over all those who dare oppose him. But I personally think that had he kept himself closer to the original, he would've ended with a better movie. It was so with the first part, but I feel like his ego couldn't share the credit with the original author anymore, so that's what we got. It's fun to watch - it's just a different story we're watching than the one we were promised.",8,5,8,16 December 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Peter Jackson makes amends
","Let me start by saying, I'm a huge fan of LoTR, I've red the book about a dozen of times starting from 1979 until a few years ago, and I didn't like Jackson's treatment of the story. I have two main bones of contention with his approach, the first, while Tolkien keeps telling us all through his stories 'there's much more to middle earth than I'll ever be able to tell you' Jackson chose an opposite approach of I'm telling you all there is in the story and weeded out everything that could've hinted differently. He also committed an even worse sin of translating what Tolkien referred to as sensations, feelings and suspicions into actual screen events. And to top it all he made some specifically bad changes to the original story. So I came in to the movie practically ready to hate The Hobbit. As you may see from the rating I gave this movie, I didn't hate it at all. In fact I was positively surprised. Jackson's technical mastery is still there, but that was never in doubt. His all inclusive approach is also present here, but it doesn't hurt the story, it moves ahead along the lines Tolkien has laid so perfectly even if the story has a lot added some from other Tolkien stories, some from the imagination of Jackson and his crew. But as long as it remains true to the spirit of the original story and characters I think Jacson is entitled to do so. It does make a small story that was supposed to be the gate into Middle Earth for children into an epic, but it does maintain some levity at many moments and since the prequel to the LoTR became a sequel anyhow, and like it or not we're all familiar with the epic conclusion it's another transgression I'm willing to forgive this time. Truth is, I think the simpler attitude Tolkien used all through this story helps Jackson a lot - since the story is simple and straight forward, there were a lot less traps for him to fall into, and he also got a better feel for Tolkien's creation by now, so he stays the course without failing this time, which makes it all a real visual feast. Read the book, and go and enjoy the ride with Jackson and his version - it's worth the time and the money.",9,4,9,17 January 2013
The Favourite," Theatrical in the most cinematic way
","This historical so called 'comedy drama', which I consider a non term (at best I'd call it a drama with comic moments, but I actually consider this a historical satire about the politics and machinations of the British court). I don't care how exact are the historical details, I did check, and the basic historical drama depicted here did take place, and for me that's the only importent question - historically.Cinematically we get a story presented in a very theatrical style, pointing to the theatrics of politics, and of royal politics. But this theater is a very cinematic theater, we get a very nuanced performance of the three leads, nuances that would often be lost on the stage of theater. And we do get three leading roles here. All three are superb, and the fact that Olivia Colman is written down as the lead is arbitrary in my book. She might have a little more screen time than the other two, (one would have to check it with a stop watch to be certain), but plot wise, both Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone, are her equals, and Olivia Colman herself has acknowledged it more than once. And as I said , they're all amazing. And actually, this trio makes the movie. I mean, every aspect of movie making is done here at the highest level: cinematography, editing, soundtrack, lighting, - it's all here, but without this trio none of it would matter, they make this story come to life, and they make us care.One final point, I rated this movie 8 (bordering on 9), it could have been higher, if the point it was making was a bit less subtle. I feel that the final scene did make a point, but it was only half made, almost muted. And in my humble opinion it should have been a bit more forceful. Maybe thats the British understated way, but the rest of the story was fairly blunt, with the acting cast, and most of all the leading trio keeping it British. So I think, such a blunt story demands less subtlety at the finish line.",8,8,17,11 February 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," An epic failure at script writing, kills a would be great film
","Let me start by saying that no superhero movie is supposed to be realistic. We all know that. Still, script writers, and comic books writers too struggle, to make the story feel as if it was real, otherwise, none would relate to the story. In order to get this real feeling, the emotional base of the story is crucial, the character development must be first class, if these two work, we've got a film we can emphathize with, we might even forget the entire premise is unreal. But very often the writers don't trust their own ability. Sometimes they feel the whole story is so farfetched they have to go an extra mile to make it more real. That's when things start going wrong. That's where it went wrong for this movie. I never expected a real life drama, if that was what I wanted I wouldn't be watching this movie to begin with. It's very hard to explain my point precisely without spoilers, and I don't do spoilers. So what can I say. I can say that by the movie's end we're left with two choices, both steming from a desire to make the story feel more real, maybe to surprise us more than we usually get surprised in movies we came to know so well. Any which way, the two options we're left with are either, the entire movie will be reversed in the next installment. Which means that the whole Infinity War was a teaser for the next MCU installment. Or the entire MCU is getting a reboot. I hate both options. And it's a great shame, because otherwise we had a perfectly good installment in the MCU. With the great sense of humor we all know and love. With great acting performances (Josh Brolin is really superb, making Thanos one of the greatest villains we ever saw), wonderful cinematography and CGI and everything else we come to expect of the MCU. If everybody loves it so much, why do we need to reboot it, when it's still going so very well. Or else why would you waste an entire installment as a teaser for the next one. We already know all the installments are connected to each other, we all wait for the post credits scenes, no matter how long we have to sit in the dark. So why did we need this silly concoction. It didn't make it feel more real, it made me feel frustrated and even angry because whatever option will come into being in the future I'll still think this one was a waste of my time and everybody else's.",7,2,10,2 May 2018
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Not remade, but well made
","The main reason I went to see this film was my love for the first Secret Life of Walter Mitty. I already knew from all the teasers and previews that this was going to be something completely different, but I had to see what happened to Walter in this incarnation. I can say that in my opinion though the mutual literary source is evident, this one is really a completely different movie, with no intention of being a remake. Which is probably the best decision they could've made. Ben Stiller, is no Danny Kaye, and had he tried to be, I can only imagine the catastrophe it would've been. As is, he strike a perfect balance between the real dreary life and almost dreary character into which Walter's life has turned him. And the ragged adventurer hidden inside him. He manages to show the would be 'loser', the fantastic day dreamer and the 'adernalin junkie', and show them as one real person never making him heroic or super when the adventure is real, and even managing an ending that wouldn't be a typical Hollywood one, in the best way. The supporting cast is very good, the cinematography is practically superb. The inter-film jokes work nicely, and a sharp barb or two are being sent at the modern success driven internet age and the society we live in - making me all the happier. My actual rating is 8.5, but the stars system won't allow me to grade it thusly so I had to say it here.In a single line - it's a real life fantastic comedy - go see it and you'll understand what I'm speaking about.",8,4,7,1 January 2014
Hidden Figures," Based on a true story that does ring true
","My past experience with movies based on a true story, is such that I usually stay away from the lot. Hollywood's approach to the truth is all too possessive and commercial, at least as far as I'm concerned. But this story made me curious so I checked its page on IMDb, and found here the horrible goof of making the Mercury spacecraft too spacious, I went in deeper, and found a very long list of even less significant facts, I was actually expecting to find that the color of the NASA employees shoelaces was all wrong, I really developed a distaste to the goofs section of this site. But I kept on reading, moving into the trivia section of the page where I learned that colors were used to set the mood of the film, using cold neon colors for the NASA spaces and warm colors for the personal office of Al Harrison and the ladies' houses. That really caught me by surprise. Next thing they'll tell me night scenes were set in darkness while daytime scenes used actual daylight. As a rule this section is more illuminating than the goofs section but, by now I was convinced that when IMDb dwells on such details the movie might be truer than most.So here goes: this film does have a truthful feeling to it, the actors and actresses justify the ensemble award they got from SAG, they are all super. The leading three ladies do get more opportunities to shine, especially so Taraji P. Henson and Octavia Spencer, who get most of the screen time, but this is definitely an entire cast working together. Apart from this fact, the movie uses a lean approach that suits movies based on a true story - No fancy CGI or camera angles just plain good old story telling. No fireworks are needed when your basic story works so well. I do agree with the reviewers stating that this is a feelgood movie, it is. But it's also a good movie and the two together work just fine.",8,4,12,19 March 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Deep, inteligent, thought provoking, no wonder so many don't like it
","Once again, I go against my own rule and write a review for a movie with over 1000 reviews as of now (over 2000 says the number oa the bottom). I'm writing it because I've got a bone to pick with many Star Wars funs, and I already know this review will be disliked from here to eternity by most of you, but I believe in speaking my own opinion as is. I believe in explaining my own opinion to the best of my ability and that's what I'll do.So here goes: as my title says this movie, which none can blame of repeating a previous plot line, is deep, inteligent and thought provoking. There's very little I would ask from a movie that isn't here already. The acting is first rate, by each and every member of the cast. I almost feel that singling out some members of this cast would be wrong but I have to mention Kelly Marie Tran and Oscar Isaac, not because they're better than the others but because they're given the first real opportunity to shine and they make the most of this opportunity. I won't dwell on any other technical aspect of movie making. It's all of the highest class there is. But I will go into the big argument I have with most of Star Wars funs, which is, basically, what is this film all about.The entire franchise in my mind is a long discussion about the nature of power; the difference between good and evil; about the nature of hope, anger, and most of all about what's being human is all about. Not all the episodes dealt with these issues with the same success, but these issues are always there. There's nothing scientific about it, hence it's not science fiction. It's in fact science fiction comics, of the highest quality. What's the difference, the difference is that in sci-fi comics, the scientific elements are external. Simply a tool to extend the range of options before the writer. There's so much more you can do when you can jump from one planet to another, use weapons that none ever heard of before and so on. They simply serve the point of comics - a never ending story. All that doesn't mean that comics have to be superficial, as proven by masterpieces such as The Dark Knight, Logan, and the recent revival of the Star Wars franchise.",9,1,4,18 December 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," A real joy ride of a movie
","I have a soft spot for movies that take themselves with tons of levity and still do it properly. That is, while not regarding themselves with undue seriousness, still make the movie with the required amount of professional approach. Guardians of the Galaxy are topping the list on these accounts. The pace is relentless, the characters are 'out of this world' (and you can take it as literally as you want). Acting is first class the plot is not as important (hence the 8 rating) but just like it worked in the R.E.D. movies, it works here. Nobody cares how much sense there's to the development of the narrative when watching it is so much fun. And as a native of the previous century - the inter movie jokes are super - written and delivered perfectly. This one may be an 8 rated movie but it feels like a 10. After watching a few great movies last month that for all intents and purposes felt like a medicine against feeling too happy, I sure liked the change.",8,2,4,1 August 2014
Logan," A tour de force of acting with a great story to boot
","This one is a 9.5 or a 9.8 rather than 9, but let's not split any hairs on trivial details. It's one of the best sci-fi/action/comics, I've seen in a very long while. I've said more than once that the X Men have the best characters written down in comics history. They also have some of the best story lines, even though this one is not part of their long illustrious mythology, it's still rings true to their comic based characters, and since the comics itself had already presented us with so many alternate realities, none can complain if it doesn't follow a precise story from the comic books.Hugh Jackman, presents what I consider to be his best movie performance, Patrick Stewart is coming close to his very best, (I simply didn't see enough of his movies to pass a definite judgment). Dafne Keen shows great promise, as the young wild, and sensitive X23. The rest of the cast are faultless to the very last minute role. And the story flows naturally from the very start, it's as if it simply writes itself, and as far as I'm concerned it's one of the best complements one can give a story or a script. A real masterpiece and a great signoff for a wonderful character. All fans of the X Men, and of Wolverin especially, this one is a real must see.",9,1,5,5 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," A good mix of original plot lines from the comics with Whedon's version of the Avengers
","There's only one minor fault stopping this one from being a real perfect 10. I think it's once again stemming from the need to push on the franchise in sequels to come, but there're way too many small guest appearances of secondary roles that have nothing to do in this action packed film. Yes the Avengers in the comic book tend to change teams' make up, that doesn't mean you have to remind us all the new guys before they take a bigger role in the coming sequel, there's enough plot lines in this film as is, without silly cameos of say War machine. All other aspects of this movie work like magic. It's another perfect combination of well written characters, good acting - Scarlett Johansson, tops my list, but almost everybody here is superb. The story line once again, like all good comics, dwells also on moral issues, which are part of the raison d'etre of sci-fi comics. Editing, CGI, and all other technical aspects of this production are as perfect as we come to expect them. So bottom line - one more good comics adaptation - Whedon does understand the source material so well he knows what he can borrow from the original plot lines to make it just close enough to the comics we all love.",9,5,13,26 April 2015
Avatar," with a little more humor and better sidekicks it could be a real masterpiece
","I won't waste your time repeating what everyone is saying about the technical aspects of this film. It's a huge technical leap for the industry and for the art of cinema too. But that's not all, it does have added value, and I disagree with most of the charges about the unoriginal story. I think it borrows from other films/stories so the viewers can get it's point using the analogies. I can't elaborate without adding spoilers, so you'll simply have to trust me. If you saw the film and you think I'm wrong I'm willing to carry the argument further using the available channels. But I have two complaints: a)not enough humor (some minor scenes with some visual gags don't count). And more importent, b) most of the characters lack character, I understand that the two major 'baddies' are cartoons in nature but there's no excuse for the complete absence of personality of most of the 'good' humans in the film. It's a real shame because the film came real close to perfection and a little more attention could've brought it all the way there.",9,1,3,25 January 2010
The Artist," Sometimes the script is not all that important
","There's a problem with the rating system, I'm not saying I can offer a better one, but still. Here is a film with a script that's not worthy of all its other merits. I don't mind the lack of originality too much, but I find some holes in the plot annoying, mainly because this such a great film it deserved better. There's no need to excuse the black and white, or the lack of speech in the film, not only because it makes cinematic sense, it practically works for the film and improves it. The cinematography is super, the acting is superb, with the two leads excelling beyond everyone else, mostly because they do have great characters written for them, but obviously also because they're up for the task.Go see this film, and try not to dwell too much on what's missing in the story, what we do get to see is so well done it makes up for it.",9,2,3,19 January 2012
Beauty and the Beast," It's not bad, it's well done, but it's Disney
","Not long ago while reviewing Moana, I wrote that, love them or hate them, Disney studios will always be Disney. Professional to the very last detail, but very shallow, and putting each and every story they treat through their well oiled machine. I don't agree with those saying the CGI are below par, or simply creepy. I think they were expecting the old hand painted Disney magic, and when seeing their old characters in CGI were shocked by the outcome. I also think the acting was first class all the way through. I didn't even mind the songs too much. They always get in the way of the story, they're always way over the top, but I guess I got used to them. On the other hand I do have an issue with the story itself. It does follow the old Disney version almost to the letter. That's because Disney studios believe that their version should be the only one. It's not such a big problem when the source material is well known and available to all those interested, like the stories of the bible or the Greek myths, I'm also willing to forgive these liberties with lesser known myths, but when they do it to literary masterpieces I'm not so understanding. I think the original Mary Poppins novel is so much better than what they made it, it's plain shame. I didn't like what they did with Peter Pan and Winnie the Pooh, but at least they did come close to the intended spirit of the original. They failed badly here, because they insisted on following their own footsteps. Have a look at the 1946 French B&W version and you'll understand what a story you're missing in this version.So they had the opportunity to remake it as a real masterpiece, they chose to stick to their own old version instead. It's just plain shame even if it's not a real surprise.",8,1,4,9 April 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," It's still a joyride, even if it doesn't take us by surprise anymore
","Guardians of the Galaxy vol.1 was a big surprise, a fun movie that didn't take itself too seriously but was still very well done. Cosmic, and still very human, and there were super heroes too. Well all this is true about vol. 2 as well, but it's no longer a surprise. So what. Good movies that don't take themselves too seriously don't get made so very often. With good acting all around, delivering that unspoken stuff so very perfectly, with the right amount of emotional involvement, stopping short at exactly the right time before it all goes sappy. And still presenting us with a group of very unconventional heroes that do work together well.I don't know about you, as far as I'm concerned, that's all I want from a movie I go to see on the big screen. Great CGI, are part of the territory, same is true of the editing and the pacing of the movie. It's just great well made fun movie.",8,2,5,4 May 2017
Thor," An intelligent teaser for the Avengers
","It's a well done movie with proper acting (and even better by some) though I can honestly say that Rene Russo is being wasted here. It doesn't really need 3D apart from the Asgard Scenes. And it corresponds nicely with the Marvel original including some nice Donald Blake jokes. But I kept on feeling it was stoping short of its full potential, as if all it was here for is setting the ground for the big Avengers movie - and the movie had its fair share of hints aimed at that specific future production. It was nice but could have been so much better that eventually I'm a bit disappointed. So much more room for dramatic development that was left untapped it's simply a shame.",8,0,2,23 May 2011
The Shape of Water," Once upon a time, in the mythical days of prince JFK
","This is a brilliant movie, a clever fable positioned by Guillermo del Toro in the early 60s, when a fair prince rulled the country, and every thing seemed simpler and more straight forward. And this is precisely what the fable telling us - it never was simple and straight forward. The biggest patriot could be a monster in disguise, the traitor could hide a kind soul inside and a mute, may speak out the clearest of all when calling us all to be more human.I'll be repeating everyone else saying how beautiful it is. The set design, the CGI, the editing, the cinemtography. Every minute detail combines to create a fairytale setting in early 60s Baltimore, and it's so perfectly done that one feels that both parts of the reality presented in the movie are indeed real. The acting is part of the truthful feel of the film Michael Shannon, Richard Jenkins, Michael Stuhlbarg, Octavia Spencer and everybody else in this magnificient cast, Topped by Sally Hawkins, who deserves an Oscar, which I fear she won't get, because some consider her being a mute in the film a less complete performance. In my book it's a perfect 10. I haven't seen such level of perfection in acting since Hugh Jackman in Logan, and he never got nominated.I have my reasons for ranking this masterpiece just 9 (should've been a 9.5+) but I don't think these are important. The movie is so close to perfection the tiny faults it does have, become insignificant. Just go see it if you get a chance.",9,51,97,4 March 2018
Edge of Tomorrow," No, it's not a military version of Groundhog Day
","That was my next to reflex reaction when reading the basic plot summery. So with some trepidations I decided to give it a shot and despite the fact that I think the ending is too Hollywoodian, I still find the film to be of a very high quality. It starts by presenting the leading character as a complete jerk (not to use stronger language), and I was really thinking, here goes another Groundhog Day, well I was wrong. It has a surprisingly solid plot, with solid movie reasoning, nothing is in the story without a purpose, and every minute on screen makes sense. This fact by itself, elevates the movie by a notch or two. The acting is superb, and Tom Cruise does deserves better recognition for his talents. Emily Blunt is even better, and both Brendan Gleeson and Bill Paxton are perfect in their roles. But the entire film simply leaves no plot holes I can think about, and for me that's a real refreshing change. When everything else is keeping up with the plot - that is, the characters, the acting the pacing the CG, well I thought it almost deserved another ending and I would've given it a perfect 10. But as it is, 9 will have to do.",9,0,2,18 June 2014
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Kudos for tying all the loose ends nicely, even those that shouldn't have been there
","Let me be clear - this is not a whole hearted 9, it's more of 8.5 at times and 8.8 at others. But 9 is the closest the rating system gets to my personal rating. It's obvious that the closing installment of this Jackson made trilogy is much better than the middle one, mostly because it does return in a manner of speaking to most of the original themes of the book. Even the subplots that were added to the original story and gave it its bloated trilogy form, didn't get in the way too much. Can't explain exactly how and why without spoilers, but if you did read the books and saw the films, I'm sure you'll see my point. Thing is, some of these additions are still out of place, but since the whole thing does return to the tone and nature of the original, I'm once again more forgiving. I'll accept the Azog story line - it's a Jackson invention, but it goes along with the characters in the book. I'm also seeing the point of the Dol Goldur fight, though I like it less as it pushes the boundaries further than the Azog sub-plot. The Bard sub plot is also within the boundaries of the original story, other sub-plots are really too far-fetched, and I won't even mention them.On the other hand I can't ignore the superb job most of the actors do. Especially Martin Freeman and Richard Armitage, but I also want to mention the performance of Lee Pace and Luke Evans. The other aspects of movie making are of the highest quality, the cinematography, the special effects (in which Jackson always shines)the editing that keeps the battle going and going without losing the audience. But these were never the issue when discussing the Hobbit's trilogy, or when discussing Jackson's work.",9,1,2,28 December 2014
Wonder Woman," Best delivery of superficial slogans ever, with the right amount of pathos
","It's a good film, firstly because it has an abundance of humanity and human feeling to it. It's something often forgotten in the DC comics, because unlike marvel, it centers on the heroic part. That's the reason, DC characters, are so much better in TV series than they are in their drawn version or in their cinematic version. In the extended TV versions, there's no choice but to develop the personal life - the human part of the super heroes. Yes I know it's an over simplified generalization, but as a rule that's the main difference between Marvel's superheroes, and the DC ones, except Batman, where the line between the hero and the human is all but nonexistent. And that's why Batman movies did work better than any other DC movies we know about. Yes, there's another short lived exception to this rule that is the first two movies of Christopher Reeve's Superman, where they managed to counter the pomposity with the right amount of campiness. It was a very fine balance, and a very hard one to maintain. It took some very fine acting and a very careful script, and they half lost it by the 3rd one, not to mention the 4th.So here we have a first human DC superhero, in a long while. And it's a combined effort. Gal Gadot is mostly great, but she's still a rookie, and does have two or three off moments, during the film, so here comes the director and the editing, not to mention the other stellar cast, they all cover for her, making sure the movie stays true. Making sure that all the melodrama, is balanced, some jokes at the right moment also help, but the truth is that the humor is very limited. Compare it with most of Marvel's productions and you'll see I'm right. It's simply more humorous than recent DC movies, but that's easy. It's once again a fine balance kept by a combined effort of the entire production.And here I return to my title. Why do I say Gal Gadot is great despite her few off moments during the film. Because she delivers the most superficial pompous slogans with such conviction, you don't really feel how banal they were, until you rethink the whole thing. Not many veterans of the trade can get away with it, she does. All she still has to do is polish her act a bit more and she'll be one of the best",8,4,10,4 June 2017
X-Men: First Class," it's the X men can't help but love'em
","The X-Men are my favorite comic. The closest sci-fi comics ever got to real science fiction. Un like most comics its characters are far from cartoons, they're 3D characters - so no wonder they didn't need to add the special effect. The movie was true to these aspects of the comic, it even kept some of the original story, I wish it was even closer, but understand the wish to tell the story differently so I'm pleased with the fact that the concept remained the same. Using a real historic event as the backdrop to the story is also a good addition. And above all the actors all give their share to the final outcome. Kevin Bacon is superb, Michael Fassbender also excels. But as I said they all do well, and once you believe the characters and the story is good, what else is there to ask.To sum it all: keeping the tradition of good X-man renditions in-fact it's better than the last of the original trio (didn't see Wolverine yet). So if you like the comic - go see it, if you like good thought provoking sci-fi go see it too, if you're none of the above you probably won't be reading this at all so that's it.",9,8,12,14 June 2011
Monsters University," Good fun, but the original magic isn't there
","Let's start with the fact that in the original there's a line implying that Mike and Sully know each other from elementary school (regarding their fourth grade teacher). But by itself this fact has nothing to do with the fun one has watching this fun film. And make no mistakes, it's a fun film. The acting is as good as anyone could find in any animation film, they're all simply perfect. The story telling is smooth for most of the film, the only real fault with the script is the last five to seven minutes of the film which are not only anti-climatic but in fact a simple let down and beside the point. The film ends about five minutes before the script does but we're being kept there waiting for the script to end too, which is a real shame. The other major problem with this cute prequel is the fact that the original was so good and, well, original, while this new one lacks the freshness and the magic offered by the first movie. It does have some great jokes and it will make almost everyone laugh, but the wow factor is not there. Don't wait for it to arrive it'll just ruin the film for you, simply enjoy what you get. Good characters performed by great actors are more than you'll get in many other films and if the jokes do work, it should suffice.",8,0,0,28 June 2013
Saving Mr. Banks," So it's not the whole truth, but who cares
","There's one flow in the logic of this masterful film that makes you realize you don't see the whole truth of the story behind the struggle between P.L.Travers, and Walt Disney over the rights for Mary Poppins. I mean there're so many things she opposed with passion, and we still know the film was almost exactly as first presented to P.L.Travers, something more should have happened for her not only to give the rights for the story to Disney the way it was finally made. Thing is, I just saw the film, I realized this flaw was in the script and I still didn't care. It was all made so superbly that even the tear-jerker minutes abundant in this movie are forgiven. Emma Thompson is simply superb, as the bitter angry woman, forced to sell her only bankable treasure. As it was already mentioned in one of the previous reviews here, making this bitter misanthropic character likable, is a task only one of the very best could master. Tom Hanks, is as superb as her, I still remember Walt Disney presenting his TV hour, only problem is I'm not sure if I remember him doing it or Tom Hanks, with very little apparent makeup, Hanks simply is Disney, at least the way that Disney's company want us to remember him, but as Hanks plays him - that's the way we also want to remember him. The rest of the cast is as stellar as the two leads - not a single false note in the symphony. The story flows superbly cutting between P.L. Travers memories of her childhood, her lonely life at the time of the main story, and the Disney studio glimpses of the would be film offered to the unrelenting author. Most of the jokes are very gentle ones almost Britishly understated, and it works for the film.Bottom line, it may not be exact history, but it's definitely a good story told as engagingly as possible in my book, and I liked it for this very reason.",9,0,1,19 January 2014
Thor: The Dark World," Improving the characters, not putting that much effort on the plot
","It becomes a regular issue with recent films, especially when we're speaking about films that highly depend on CG and super fast action scenes. It's not a necessity but it's been proved repeatedly that building proper characters is getting a lot more attention than constructing real good plot. I can understand the reasoning behind it, when the characters are appealing, the actors find it easier to relate and do their work better. And almost everybody here excels though Tom Hiddleton as Loki deserves special notice. But the story could definitely be built better. And I'm not speaking about the plausibility of the basic premise, as I said more than once the entire idea of a living super hero calls for some suspension of judgment, but if this super hero operates inside our own world, some other laws of logic must apply, and many of those are ignored here. Which I find to be regrettable since everything else is of a very high quality. And yes once again - no real need for 3D, in fact even less so than in the original Thor movie. Bottom line - good fun that could've been much better.",8,1,3,12 November 2013
Lucy," Maybe, if Besson could be limited to directing
","I've seen a few of Luc Besson's movies beforehand, mainly those where his obsession with the idea of the reluctant super heroine operating in a male dominated world is clearest. I liked Nikita, though I had some issues with the plot holes that in my mind come to signify Besson's writing. It was even more of a problem with the 5th Element, where pseudo philosophic babbling was added to the mix not to mention tons of pretentiousness. The truck on which Besson's obsession carries him is moving forward always advancing, unfortunately it doesn't advance into good movie making, it's simply gets more pretentious and more dependent on his pseudo philosophic babble. Besson has all the making of a good director. He has a very good visual perception, which he always translate well to the screen. He has a good eye for actors and even more so for actresses Anne Parillaud, Milla Jovovich and Natalie Portman owe him a lot, the last two launched their cinema career on his films. And all his talent as director is getting him into poorer and poorer results, because he insists on writing his own scripts. Many directors do it with remarkable outcome Luc Besson doesn't. He must have someone else beside him to tell him that things don't make sense, someone with an influence. It seems to me that he simply doesn't care about plot logic he might even think his 'philosophic' bits are deep and meaningful - sorry it's not the case. It rings hollow and pretentious (I know I used this word before - no other word describes it better).And so, amazing performances by Scarlett Johansson, and Min-sik Choi, and some solid acting by Morgan Freeman and Amr Waked, on top of some brilliant action scenes and some real beautiful cinematography, are all getting wasted because by the end of the film the utter stupidity of it all covers everything else. What's supposed to be deep and thought provoking is so empty and ridiculous I found myself laughing a desperate bitter laugh instead of being excited or thrilled.",7,3,9,31 August 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," So, it's a wonderful movie, but what the heck is sci-fi about it?
","Before anyone suspects me of not liking it (even though I already rated it 9/10), I've got to start by saying this one might be the best of the entire saga thus far, and I did like all the previous episodes. I think this one brings together all the best elements of the Star Wars franchise, that is the biggest comics saga of the modern age, the best characters written for such a saga, grand scale CG and a great story of the fight between good and evil, inside the human hearts and outside among all living beings.All that, is very impressive in my book, and I do love it, but I can't help getting annoyed by the repeated references to the Star Wars saga as a sci-fi saga. Ever since it hit the screens for the first time with episode IV I've been wrecking my brain to find anything scientific about it. Look at Ender's Game, at Jupiter Ascending, you don't have to like the movies to see that somewhere at their core there's a scientific issue driving the story, whether it is the idea of future wars being fought on computer screens, and what will it do to warfare, or the idea that biogenetics could push us into a future of relating to people as nothing more than a gene pool. Look at Blade Runner or Total Recall, once again a real scientific issue at their very core. Nothing of the sort exists in Star Wars, they do have light sabers, laser blusters light speed flight, and all sorts of robots. but those are just external gadgets, none of them drives the story. The driving force beyond the story is the Force, and the Force is not science, not even remotely. The Force is some kind of a psychic power, more magical than anything else. It does have deep moral aspects, it does bring out the idea that having next to unlimited power can be a great means of corruption, just like it can be great means for good. But, there's no way this is science. This is sci-fi comics, like Superman, Spiderman, Flash Gordon, and loads of other comics, but the sci-fi elements of sci-fi comics do not drive the story, they simply extend the range of possible variations. Only X-Men, where the origin story of the heroes grew into a combination of a moral issue and a scientific question - how will human's fear of the unknown explode if human mutation did create a new generation of super beings, only there did sci-fi comics becomes a real sci-fi story. Star Wars doesn't, but it's a great series all the same. And The Force Awakens, is my favorite episode of the lot.",9,1,20,27 December 2015
RED," An action fairy tale
","Once you realize you're watching a fairy tale it'll all make sense. It's a simple switch, instead of monsters and warlocks you have high tech assassins and 'techno' whizzes. And since it's a fun fairy tale and each and every role is performed to perfection, the pace is just right and whatever fault I could find with the film becomes immaterial (and even if you decide to go for the details you'll have to admit all this faults are minor details).So that's all I have to say - I had fun seeing it, every one taking part in making it looks like enjoying it immensely - come join the party.",9,1,2,25 October 2010
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Yes, it's a game, but what a superb game it is.
","This is self aware cinema at its best, with nods toward old Bond movies the way they used to be. Especially with Roger Moore (even though Colin Firth is channelling David Niven's mannerism, the movie channels the Roger Moore era of Bond films more than anything else). The gadgets, the suits, the one liners, the impeccable unflinching gentlemen attitude, and even the perfectly choreographed gory and violent fight scenes, all point to one thing - it's a movie that doesn't simply knows it's a movie, it's a movie that wants us to know it knows. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and the firework's display is an obvious proof of that fact. But like all great movies that don't take themselves too seriously, it does it with all due professionalism. Acting, editing, cinematography and all other aspects of movie making are of the highest calibre. And plot twists are abundant - it's a real eye-feast that might be a start of a brand new franchise. I know I'll be waiting.",9,2,9,16 February 2015
John Wick: Chapter 2," A sequel, for better or worse
","When making a sequel, the rule of thumb around Hollywood is to push the action, the blood quantities and the speed up a notch or two. So John Wick 2 follows this rule to the letter, it also follows the first chapter in style, namely the unlikely action scenes are made to look as real as possible. Not synthetic ballet like action but gory bloody fights in which everyone get hurt. That is everyone who's not an innocent bystander. No matter how crowded the scene is, there won't be any collateral damage here. Which means that no matter how real it does look, it's still a movie. But the gritty real appearance does make up for the small plot holes. Keanu Reeves is still within the limited borders of his range and most of the other roles are performed superbly. Ian McShane, is as first class as ever, even if I've seen him doing this role many times before. Common, Laurence Fishburne, Riccardo Scamarcio, and almost everybody else on screen are performing at the highest quality possible.But the worst thing that could happened to John Wick is that it will make it big in the box office, since they're already working on chapter 3. And obviously, it'll be bloodier, faster, grittier. It'll make even less sense, but people will die here by the truckload, so who cares, let us all have action galore.",8,1,3,21 February 2017
Minions," Slapstick at its best
","To remove all doubts, this is no masterpiece, no one making it pretends it is. This is simply a good fun movie that doesn't insult its viewers intellect. About 90 minutes of shameless slapstick, that's both clever and never resorts to vulgarity, even though some fart jokes do squeeze in. As far as I'm concerned this is as good as directing animation can get, considering the fact that one of the two directors does the minion's voices this means more than just technical knowhow and good control over the movie's pace. This is good comedy, and comedy as we all know 'is hard'. So don't underestimate some plain good fun and the absence of pretension is in my book one more big plus. Bottom line, for me, this is the best animation movie I've seen this year, tied with Big Hero 6, though it's considered 2014. I simply count the last 12 months.",8,6,10,21 July 2015
Incredibles 2," Pure fun, with some added value
","I like films made for their entertainment value without trying to hide it, there's nothing to be ashamed about entertaining people. I love them even more if there's some added values put in. Wit and charm never hurt the outcome. The plot is slightly weaker at certain points, sometimes it's definitly rushed. As far as I remember the original the plot was stronger , but I could be wrong, it's been a long time since I last saw it.So here it is, this is really a superb fun film. Really super characters, in believable situations with a stellar cast who performs flawlessly. Not as surprising as they wanted to be, and as I already said the plot itself is not always there, but everything else is really of the highest quality and we all get entertained. We even get the points about family life and the inherent stregth of this unit. There's a slight suspicion aimed at science going with this frenchise, which I find somewhat annoying, but even this didn't spoil the fact that it was FUN. So they must've done something right.",8,1,2,25 June 2018
Spectre," Could've been better with Roger Moore at the lead
","Saw it almost a week ago, didn't know if I wanted to write a review on the film. I know it won't be popular, but if I do write I can't help but say what I think. I loved Skyfall, I think it's one of the best Bond films ever, and as I said then, easily the best of Daniel Craig. Craig is a great actor, and it was wasted in the earlier Bond films he made in the stupid reboot of the Bond series. And I do mean stupid reboot because if you do reboot the series and start all over with a young Bond you can't keep the old M, no matter how good she was.Then came Skyfall, and Sam Mendes, and he did improve it so much he gave Bond back his sense of dry wry humor, he brought back The Bondish feel to the series, and all this while allowing Craig to become a real Bond, being the great actor he always was. So I was really happy he stayed with the franchise, and now I'm even more bitterly disappointed.Spectre is such a disappointment because it has so much potential, a great cast, a director that does understand the series and the lead character, so holes in the storyline were unexpected, but they were still evidently there, though specifying them would mean adding spoilers, and I don't believe in these. Worse than this, somebody decided that Bond needed a personal relation to the leading villain, he didn't. It only makes the story less likely and more egotistical. As if the entire world revolves around Bond. All this including the plot holes wouldn't matter if the series carried on with the light hearted style it had at the Roger Moore era. It doesn't meld well with the current style, the darker Bond created by Craig and co. it was saved by Mendes from becoming a Bourne wannabe, but if it wants to feel real, it has to make real sense, and it doesn't.",7,2,5,27 November 2015
