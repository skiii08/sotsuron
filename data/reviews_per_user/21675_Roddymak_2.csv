The Blair Witch Project," Utterly incredible
","What a stunning and remarkable film that made the world realize we are too involved in ourselves and the media.  These people actually made us believe....Watching this movie alone in my apartment in the middle of October was probably the worst thing I could have done.  I couldn't sleep and I should have been drunk while watching it because it was so powerful and it birthed so much anxiety in my mind that I was experiencing panic along with the cast.  The end was especially terrifying and if only sex could be as intense as the ending of this film!!!  What a climax!!The film succeeded on many, many levels and I am sure that others will soon follow.  A new genre has been born!!The film, as intended, worked and scared the c**p out of us.",Null,0,1,21 October 1999
Hoosiers," Fantastic
","Being IN this movie was a real treat.  The movie itself is a fine adaption of courage, teamwork, excitement and hope.  I still watch it and get nervous if they are going to win the BIG game. Great movie",Null,0,0,24 August 1999
