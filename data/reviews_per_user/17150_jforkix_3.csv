Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It plays on your emotions
","Awesome special effects and some sleek models are the highlight of this much awaited pre-quel to the starwars saga. There are no new concepts introduced, basically lucas decided to get people out of the 15yr draught first. So lots of special effects and action packed sequences seem to be the trademark. Han Solo, basically harrison ford and his humour was missed the most. There was an attempt at humour by Jar Jar Binks but the synthespian is no match for harrison ford. The jedi charm is missing in Liam Neeson. Otherwise the movie is good fun. Sit back and enjoy and the remaining two pre-quels will definitely appeal to your intellect!!!",7,0,0,20 May 1999
Spider-Man," Pathetic
","I must say, this is the worst super hero movie I have ever seen. It was dumb and unnecessary sentimental. The special effects were very ordinary and a lot of times it was very obvious that it was animation rather than the actual guy. Having grown up seeing the likes of movies like superman (which btw was done much more professionally decades ago) I had so much expectation when I went in. I used to watch the spiderman cartoon regularly and that was way better than this multi-million dollar fiasco.",1,1,3,6 May 2002
Mission: Impossible II," running out of ideas for action movies
","When was the last time you saw a good action movie and came back thrilled? The movie was hyped and director john woo had an obsession with slow motion which kept coming every now and then for no reason. It was like there was nothing else in the script so might as well drag it. This movie had almost all the ingredients but was still bad. makes me wonder why? lack of good plot, and cliched statements and actions. Except for a few stunts here and there it was a total farce. The fact that hollywood is running out of ideas for plots and script for good action movies is also evident from the bond movies which try and use the bond image to draw crowd and make money rather than using the movie itself.",5,0,0,25 May 2000
