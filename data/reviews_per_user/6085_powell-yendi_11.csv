Requiem for a Dream," Message Received!
","No one can deny that the message in this movie was powerful. It reveals consequences to drug addiction that are unfamiliar to the general public. One consequence that I overlooked until now is that society would rather punish drug addicts than help them. It was interesting to watch those in positions of power as they abused addicts, took advantage of them, and showed utter indifference towards human life and dignity. I would have rated this movie with a 10/10, but one essential element was missing, backgrounds. Out of the four main characters, the movie only delved into the addiction history of one. It would have been nice to learn about the introduction and descent into drug dependence among the other main characters. They all seemed so beautiful and loving, but viewers would be more sympathetic if traumatic events were used to explain how life can take a turn for the worst.",9,2,3,18 March 2014
Captain Phillips," Stop exaggerating about the shakiness of the camera!
","The naysayers on IMDb are exaggerating about the shakiness of the camera in order to discredit an excellent movie! The camera rocked during appropriate times, like when the camera was in the water or when a boat was rocking. Unless someone has a 14,000 foot tripod to plant at the bottom of the ocean, then complaints about shakiness are ignorant! Don't watch a movie about ocean activities if waves make you dizzy! I will agree that I wanted a little more from the last scene. But then I remembered that this is a true story! There are no balloons and fireworks for every victory in real life! Tom Hanks really outdid himself with this one. In some scenes, I forgot his fame, and actually believed that he was Captain Phillips! In what alternate universe does a rocking camera outweigh medal-worthy acting? All those who want a stiff scene should buy a postcard!",10,0,2,13 March 2014
If I Stay," Warning: Do Not Watch!
","What are these good reviews even talking about? When I go to a movie theater, I go for entertainment. This movie was not entertaining! When I opted to watch this movie, I didn't sign up for a classical music fest, or a special on teens applying to college. If I wanted to be bored out of my wits, then I would have stayed home and read a book! After watching this, I want a refund! The writing was not bad, and Chloe is a talented actress, but the plot was bland! I am very upset with all those people who are rating this movie a 10. They must not have watched the same movie I watched. Maybe they were paid to leave good reviews, or maybe they want others to suffer the way they did. No matter what the reason is for all these good reviews, I am here to tell you that this movie is a snooze fest! There is nothing thrilling, or funny, or cute about it! I recommend everyone under the age of 70 to STAY FAR AWAY from this one. If I can save at least 1 person from making the same mistake I did, then my mission will be accomplished!",4,3,9,28 September 2014
Memento," Good movie (if it's your type).
","This movie is like a beautiful person, who everyone agrees is beautiful, but only some would date. It is a matter of taste. I loved the action, mystery, and drama in this film. I loved the original plot and phenomenal acting. But I don't like movies that lack a protagonist. I don't like movies about bad people doing bad things for the rest of their lives. I like to see at least one good person, who does the right thing, and achieves justice in some form at the end. What ever happened to the universal theme of good vs. evil? Do Americans just want to see evil? Is there an evil trend going on that I wasn't informed of? This movie would have gotten a 10 if it had a happy ending, or even a happy anything. Movies that start and end with wickedness are not my thing.",7,1,2,13 March 2014
Don Jon," Very little to say because very little happened.
","I believe that the director taped an orgy for an hour, then divided the orgy into a series of clips in hopes of capitalizing off of the notion that 'sex sells.' My response: BOO! Tomatoes! And the genre being comedy was the only joke. I am a healthy 26 year old, and I fell asleep watching this in the middle of the day. Thanks for helping me catch up on my beauty rest Don Jon.3 scenes ran on a loop: rating girls, one-night stands, and porn. GIVE ME SUBSTANCE! I have no qualms with movies about womanizers, as long as the movies have story lines. James Bond, Hitch, and even Austin Powers were womanizer movies that had story lines. Boogie Nights was based on porn and that also had a plot. This movie got it's IMDb rating from all the beautiful people and nudity, not for quality! I've seen episodes of Sesame Street with more quality! Back to the drawing board!",2,1,3,10 March 2014
The Intouchables," Finally a twist to race relations!
","I have been so annoyed by movies about miserable black people from the ghetto who are transformed by sweet, gentle Caucasians. Finally, the roles have been reversed! Finally the media is graced with a movie about a miserable Caucasian who is transformed by a sweet, gentle black person from the ghetto. I love to see the underdog maintain a positive outlook, a childlike exuberance, and an optimistic approach that is contagious. Yes, 'The Blind Side' had a similar theme, but 'The Intouchables' supersedes it, because a black person from the ghetto does not need to be mentally delayed to have a good heart. I recommend this movie to all those who don't mind reading captions for a good story. The acting was phenomenal and the fact that it is a true story just enhances the beauty of this movie.",10,3,5,21 March 2014
The Game," I'm 17 years late and I don't regret it
","'The Game' came out when I was 10 years old, which was my primary obstacle in terms of seeing it sooner than now. The movie gained popularity, and I admit that I should made greater efforts to see it. However, with new movies being released every other week, it is hard to keep track of a movie wish-list. This week, I checked the top-rated films on IMDb and 'The Game' came up. After watching it, my response is 'better late than never!' Watching this movie was worth the 17 year wait! There is nothing cheap and desperate about this movie. 'The Game' is simply a display of high quality cinematography! I am not a film student and have no history or interest in the 'art' of movie-making. Yet I can recognize great acting, good story-lines, and sufficiently thrilling scenes. To potential viewers, my advice is to remember that I recommended The Game to you! I look forward to the good karma from imparting beneficial advice!",10,4,6,21 March 2014
The Artist," Thanks, but more captions please!
","Pros: My first silent movie and I loved it! I loved the plot. The actors were remarkable even when they attempted to be cheesy! The dog was adorable. Overall the movie was so cute!Cons: I just wish I didn't have to read lips and assume throughout the movie. More captions would have been nice. In fact, more captions would have made it a 10.I confess: When it comes to movies that I missed in theaters, I give them half an hour to impress me. Otherwise, I simply turn them off and watch cable. This movie passed my 30-minute test and I am happy that I watched it. I highly recommend The Artist!",9,1,4,21 March 2014
In Time," IMDb users have made poor ratings a bad habit.
","Before bypassing this movie, please bear in mind that most of the negative reviews have inaccurate information. Based on what I've read, the naysayers had trouble understanding what happened beyond the first 30 minutes of the movie. Their failure to follow the plot does not mean that the movie was poorly executed, it means that the plot was too complex for those without vivid imaginations. There were no plot holes. Many events and circumstances in this movie can be explained by sociology and common sense. In example, a vacant room with 2 seats was not necessarily staged, it was likely the hiding space for someone in a similar situation. Does the director really have to explain something so basic? Does the screenwriter really need to think for the viewer? The characters explained their motives throughout the movie. So those with complaints about fairness to the rich should simply rewind or watch it again. There is no viable excuse for rating this movie below a 7 for the plot alone. Then points should be added for artistic design, realism, and intensity.",10,0,1,16 March 2014
Mystic River," If you like soap operas, this movie is for you.
","I would have given this movie a 10 for the remarkable acting and story- line. But GOOD LORD WAS IT SLOW! Don't drink a cup of coffee before this one! There is absolutely no motivation to sit and watch a movie so tedious. I got up to clean the house and do some laundry, but didn't even bother to pause it, because I knew nothing much would happen. Seriously, after 30 minutes of this movie, you start noticing the pile of clothes on the floor and the urge to pick it up becomes overwhelming. I recommend this movie to all the housewives when the afternoon soap operas are over. Acting = phenomenal (6 points). Plot = phenomenal (5 points). Motivation to watch = non-existent (-5 points). Motivation to clean your house = Thanks Eastwood (2 points). Grand total= 8/10",8,0,1,19 March 2014
The Reader," How Romantic! Chick Flick all the way!
","The Reader is a movie about a woman who spends her entire life doing unfavorable things and making improper choices in efforts to conceal her disability. Her shame dictates her every move and even makes a martyr out of her. Fortunately, an unsuspecting victim of her low self-esteem grew to love her. Loving her gave this victim pleasure but stifled him simultaneously. Via his love, he chose to suffer through the disability with her, never replacing her as long as he lived. Isn't that romantic? I am so jealous that I still can't find a love like this! This movie gets points for originality, superb acting, an interesting plot, and a heart-melting love story. The Reader is SO SWEET, and would have gotten a 10/10 if the useless 15 minutes at the end was edited out.",9,0,0,22 March 2014
