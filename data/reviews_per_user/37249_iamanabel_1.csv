Skyfall," Loved this movie!
","Movie 007 Buzzing! Fyeww! A bullets flying, action packed film that continues the great story of '007'. From cars blowing up on command to getting shot, and still finishing the job. From the well known opening fight where the hot shot trigger finger pulls the trigger; opens a huge mess of problems for MI6. '007' is a pretty boy who is full of himself. This is a story of a double agent that lives life on the edge from gun fights with no bullets to hand to hand combat. He will never cease to amaze you with all of the advanced technology that he uses to get the job done. The continuous series has had many A list actors that are definitely cut out for this job. All of the actors are what you could call a perfect personality for the pretty boy that gets all the ladies, and he is always pulling the trigger at the right time. The most recent '007' that is said to be the Roger Moore of today is Daniel Craig; who has been a fan since he was a kid. He says he can remember acting out the movies in front of the TV as a kid. The most recent movie in this series is 'Skyfall'. (23rd movie) This movie, made by Sony, brought in a whopping $88,364,714. Sony made this '007' movie like no other, being the first in the series of movies that Bond, James Bond did not get 'the girl.' It was also a huge shock when 'M' played by Judy Dench, the leader of MI6 dies to save the double agents life. The makers of this highly explosive, shoot'em up, love story are very attached. The director and producer have made all twenty-three movies. The producer is Mrs. Barbara Broccoli who is partnered with the director, Mr. Sam Mendes. These two people have done a fantastic job at following the story line of the well known book. The story may become a little slow when they are on a long car ride; just wait, when they get there bullets are going to fly, bombs are going to explode, and cowards are going to run. When this movie is over you will be counting down, and guessing what could possibly happen next. Go see this movie before you are the next one in his cross hairs.",9,1,5,18 December 2012
