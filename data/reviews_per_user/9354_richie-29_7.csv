Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This movie will be vindicated in time
","Right now there is a flood of negative comments about this film, even among SW fans. I'd just like to take a moment to refute several points made by TPM's detractors:1)Midichlorians are NOT the Force! The Force still is the same mystical energy field described in the classic trilogy. They simply are a means with which one can use the Force.2)The pod race is not mindless eye candy (tho the FX are incredible) It showcases Anakin's abilities in the Force and must win the race in order to win his freedom, as well as help the Queen. I guess that whole chariot race in Ben Hur is all rubbish too?3)Jar-Jar is not solely used for comic relief. He is insturmental in bringing the Gungans and Naboo together, as Boss Nass tells him. Jar-Jar informs the Queen that 'Gungans have a grand army' which inspires her to go back to Naboo to free the planet.4)The whole 'ethnic stereotype' controversy is utter nonsense.  Ahmed Best, the voice of Jar-Jar, who is black, has said so in various occasions. It is a well known fact that George Lucas has borrowed heavily from different cutures in the SW movies. The accents are just another example of this. Having aliens speaking a foreign language without any traces of their native tongue would be ridiculous. And what about the Imperials speaking with a British accent in the classic trilogy? Why aren't there any Brits crying racism?5)Darth Maul is not the main villain in TPM. I guess the fault can be placed to the producers for featuring him so prominantly in posters and such while Darth Sideous is the 'phantom menace' of the film. Maul is more like a henchman in a James Bond film.I believe that the amount of scrutiny and critcism given TPM is unfair. I believe that once the next two films are released, this movie will get the respect it deserves. In the meantime, I am eagerly awaiting my widescreen collectors edition on video.",9,0,1,21 February 2000
The Big Lebowski," The Coen Brothers' most entertaining film (some spoilers)
","The Big Lebowski has got to be one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. The film centers on The Dude (Jeff Bridges), a White Russian drinking hippie/slacker who is seeking reparations for his soiled rug and is then ensnared in a sinister kidnapping scheme.Although the convoluted plot makes less sense the more you think about it, where this film really shines is its ensemble of colorful characters, and much of its humor is derived from quirks in their personality. In an era where it seems most movie characters are nothing more than one dimensional cardboard cutouts, it is refreshing to see fully fleshed out characters in The Big Lebowski. A good example of this is The Dude's bowling buddy, Walter Sobchak (John Goodman). At first glance, he seems like a pretty shallow character, a boorish, belligerant loudmouth. He has no second thoughts about smashing up a Corvette or biting a nihilist's ear off to aid the Dude's quest. However when it comes to issues in his own life, he is rather powerless. Notice that when the flamboyant, trash talking bowler Jesus Quintata taunts Walter, he just sits meekly and takes the abuse. He takes care of his ex-wife's dog without any protest and is still observes her religion (Judiaism). Walter's character flaws in turn causes the normally mellow Dude to lose his cool.Oh, look at me, I'm rambling again. This is just one fun movie to watch, with a message that just bumbling through life doing nothing isn't such a bad thing. Whenever I'm feeling down, watching it cheers right back up. Definitely recommended.",Null,0,0,13 January 2001
Man on the Moon," Andy Kaufman, this is your life.
","Spoilers ahead:I've heard all the negative things about Man on the Moon, such as, it adds nothing new about what is already known about Kaufman, or it doesn't go inside Andy's head to see what makes him tick. Well say what you will, at least it doesn't present fabrications or half-truths unlike a certain other bio-pic (*cough* The Hurricaine *cough*). Besides, it would be impossible to try to portray what motivated Andy. Even his closest friends and family did not truly know who Andy really was.Although there are many hilarious moments in the film, there is an underlying sadness about it, that Kaufman was never really appreciated or understood during his life, and is only geting respect after death. My favorite part was the final moments of Andy's life, when he travels to the Phillipines to see a psychic surgeon to cure his cancer and discovers that it's all a hoax. After spending most of his life fooling his audience with his antics, he's the one being tricked. The irony is not lost on Kaufman before he dies. Jim Carrey gives a tour de force performance as Kaufman, and should definitely be in the runinng for the Best Actor Oscar.",Null,0,0,3 February 2000
Toy Story 2," funny and entertaining, with deeper meanings
","In Toy Story 2, Woody is 'toynapped' by Al, the sleazy owner of Al's Toy Barn, and Buzz Lightyear and the other toys try to rescue him. In Al's apartment, Woody discovers that he's actually the star of a kid's show called 'Woody's Roundup' and meets his Roundup gang, Jessie the cowgirl, Bullseye the horse, and Stinky Pete. Woody is now faced with a dillema: Should he stay with the Roundup gang and end up in a museum to be immortalized forever, or go back to his beloved Andy, who will probably discard him as he grows to adulthood?Toy Story 2 is just as entertaining and visually astounding as its predecessor, but its exploration into serious topics such as facing one's own mortality and the loss of innocence in the process of growing up makes it a superior film. Jessie's heartbreaking tale of abandonment is made clear in the song 'When She Loved Me', beautifully sung by Sarah McLachlan. It's a shame that it did not win the Oscar for best song.Although, the movie ends with the typical Disney happy ending, there is a twinge of sadness, as the toys must face the fact that their days with Andy are numbered. Woody puts it best when he says that 'it will be fun while it lasts.' The ultimate message of this movie is that life is short, and we must never lose the spark, that sense of awe and wonder that we had as children.",Null,0,2,18 October 2000
A Clockwork Orange," despite the ultraviolence, one of the most thought provoking films ever made.
","Warning, spoilers ahead:If Kubrick's previous film, 2001, is meant to show humanity reaching for new heights in space, then A Clockwork Orange reveals that we still have a long way to go on Earth. The homeless man's monologue delivered before Alex and his droogs mercilessly beat him seems to indicate this. Despite the all the rape and ultraviolence depicted in the film, A Clockwork Orange has a decidedly anti-violence message, despite all the acts depicted onscreen. It shows how violence permiates our society, as it seen in the torture treatment of Alex, which allows society to assault and abuse him without any means of defending himself. Another good example of this is the writer, Mr. Alexander. He speaks out against the totalitarian government in power and now has a good chance of overthrowing it when Alex, a victim of the government's policies, shows up at his doorstep. However, when he discovers that Alex is the one who raped and murdered his wife and left him crippled, he plots to force him to commit suicide, As a result, Mr. Alexander is in jail, and the government is still in power, and more popular than ever, all because he succumbed to the urges of hatred and revenge.",Null,1,1,24 December 1999
The Sixth Sense," people are looking at this film the wrong way
","I find that most of the negative comments about The Sixth Sense are that it's not scary enough. I, too, was expecting a psychological horror type of film, and other than the suprise ending, I didn't really see what the big deal about this movie was. Upon second viewing, I concentrated more on the relationships between the characters, especially between Cole and Malcom, and found it to be a more satisfying experience. The final scenes between Cole and his mother, and then Malcom and his wife (don't worry, I didn't give the surprise away) were one of the most moving and poignant scenes I've seen. The Sixth Sense, like The Green Mile, is a touching emotional drama, with a hint of the supernatural. Definitely worth a look.",Null,0,0,9 April 2000
Gladiator," great action, no heart. (SPOILERS)
","I came into this movie hearing rave reviews about it, but afterwards, I must say I was rather disappointed. To be fair, the CGI shots of the crowds at The Colluseum were gorgeous, and the fight scenes were top notch. However Gladiator was missing something that other historical epics had, and that was emotion. In Spartacus, we see the horrible conditions that Spartacus and the slaves lived in, and we rooted for them to fight for their freedom. In Braveheart, the film spends a great deal of time developing the romance between Wallace and his wife, and when she's killed by the English, there is a greater emotional response when Wallace fights the English. There was none of that in Gladiator. Although, we see Maximus' wife and son murdered, I felt nothing, since practically no time time was spent fleshing out their relationship. And also Maximus' goal is to overthrow Commodus as emperor and bring control of the Roman Empire to the Senate. I don't know about you, but government restructuring pales in comparison to trying to topple a kingdom. By the time the movie ended, I really didn't care who won or lost. I give Gladiator a 5/10 (5 is for the special effects.)",5,0,0,14 May 2000
