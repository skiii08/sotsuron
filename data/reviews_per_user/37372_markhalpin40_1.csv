The Monuments Men," Better than I thought.
","After all the bad reviews, I was expecting an awful film but it was better than I thought it would be. I agree that the humour would have been better left out as it does spoil what should have been a very poignant and serious story. I guess most of the people who rated this film badly would have preferred a director like Spielberg who would have given us Schindlers List meets Saving Private Ryan and of course, that would have been much better as the true story deserves to be told in blood, sweat and tears. But we have George Clooney and what he delivers is Oceans 14 meets Three kings set in WW2 which was Kellys Heroes and I enjoyed all those films and I enjoyed this as well.",7,1,2,6 May 2014
