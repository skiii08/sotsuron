The Blair Witch Project," Realistic -- to a fault
","Well, the film makers certainly succeeded in doing what they were out to do -- create the illusion that you were watching raw footage.  And that illusion does make the last third of this movie especially frightening. However, the illusion was so well done that until things started getting really nasty forHeather, Josh, and Mike, this film made me feel the way everyone feels about that friend or relative who insists on dragging out his home movies/videos every time you go to visit him -- that maybe you don't want to go visit him after all.",Null,0,1,7 January 2000
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," A subjective objection
","By any kind of objective standards, this is a great movie.  It takes the live action/ animation combination to a new level, and does so with genuine hard work, rather than clever trickery.In the first place, the animation was done by cartoonists who drew each frame by hand, just like in the old days.  Furthermore, they worked without the benefit of the artificial restraints that are customarily placed on live-action footage to make the combination easier (for example, no camera movement of any kind in any shot that's going to include animated figures).And there was hard work on the part of the actors too, all of whom were trained in mime, so that they could create a convincing illusion of picking up and throwing around cartoon object and animals that had some weight to them.  The actors also took great pains with such matters as maintaining convincing eye contact with the animated characters, and being sure never to forget they were in the scene.Furthermore, the movie had a fully-developed plot and three-dimensional characters. (Well, you know what I mean.)  It would have been very easy to get caught up in technique and forget all the other elements that make a movie complete.Alas, however, speaking from a purely subjective viewpoint, I didn't like this movie.  Why?  Because cartoons were a happy part of my childhood, and I hated to see these cartoon characters stripped of their innocence.Let me qualify this, however, by saying that it wouldn't have bothered me in a movie that was supposed to be disturbing. For example, I found the twisted cartoon images in the `It's a Good Life' sequence from THE TWILIGHT ZONE MOVIE quite effective.  But when this corruption is used as a vehicle for comedy, it leaves me feeling like somebody dumped mud all over something I hold dear.",Null,0,1,18 July 2003
The Others," Great ending -- if you make it that far
","How many times have you said `That would have been a great movie, but the ending ruined it'?  Well, THE OTHERS left me feeling just the opposite.  The ending is a truly unexpected twist on the classic haunted house story.  If only I hadn't had to suffer through such a tedious movie to get there.To be fair, the intention was good -- to make an artistic horror movie.  But I had the same problem with THE OTHERS that I had with several other such artistic horror movies, such as THE HUNGER and THE SHINING.  There seems to be an underlying assumption that horror can't be truly artistic, so that the only way to make a truly artistic horror movie is to subordinate the horror elements to the artistic ones.  The result is a movie that doesn't scare you and does suggest there's something wrong with you if you actually like horror.  A truly artistic horror movie is made by someone who loves and respect the genre, and so wants to create the best example of it that they know how.",Null,0,0,1 March 2003
Knocked Up," They should have thought more about their intended audience
","Disclaimer: Since this is a romantic comedy, I am probably not part of its intended audience. In fact, this is a movie I would not have picked to watch, except that I heard Loudon Wainwright III did the music and I wanted to know what kind of music the 'Dead Skunk' guy would do for a movie.Having said that, I feel that the makers of this movie should have thought more about what their intended audience would and wouldn't want. This definitely follows the formula for a romantic comedy, which would mean it was aimed at women, right? But there is a lot of extremely crude humor and extremely heavyweight profanity here, and at the risk of sounding sexist, I'm guessing a lot of women would be put of by this. So maybe this isn't supposed to be a chick flick after all?BTW, in addition to doing the music, Wainwright also has a cameo role.",5,1,2,28 February 2010
Notting Hill," This ain't how it is in the real world!
","If you can accept the movie's being a totally unrealistic fantasy, I suppose it was done well. Hugh Grant is a prepossessing actor, and setting him up opposite Julia Roberts made for an interesting contrast.  There were also a lot of genuinely funny lines, and I particularly like Spike, the boorish Welsh roommate.But the completely unrealistic portrayal of the subject matter rubbed me the wrong way. Okay, you may say this was meant to be escapist, so that I shouldn't judge it for its lack of interest in realism.  Maybe if I could believe its makers never meant it to be seen as anything but an unrealistic, escapist fantasy, I could agree with that.  But this movie seems to be trying to pass itself off as reality. At best, that's an insult to my intelligence -- to expect me to believe the events in this movie could really happen.  At worst, it's a deliberate attempt to fool the viewer into thinking that this is what life is supposed to be like -- which is a sure-fire formula for breeding discontent and bitterness.",Null,0,0,19 May 2001
Armageddon," More entertaining, but less satisfying
","Since this movie and DEEP IMPACT used essentially the same scenario, and appeared at almost the same time, one has to suspect they were out to compete with each other.  After watching both, I felt ARMAGEDDON was more fun, more entertaining, and more upbeat, but I'm afraid I still found it the less satisfying of the two.After a meteor shower makes mince meat out of Manhattan, NASA discovers that's only a preview of coming attractions. An asteroid is heading for Earth, and if something isn't done, it's the end of the world as we know it.  NASA decides to blow it up from inside, and asks oil drilling expert Harry Stamper to go into space and guide the astronauts who'll be drilling the hole to put the bomb in.  Stamper agrees, but on one condition.  He doesn't trust the astronauts to do it right, and wants to take his own crew instead.  The problem is, these guys have never been trained for space flight, much less logged any actual time up there, and they're not exactly prime astronaut material. Okay, this shaky crew does make for a lot of genuine humor that actually enhances the suspense, because it increases the doubt as to whether they're really gonna be able to save the Earth. At the same time, you start to like these guys, so you can work up a vested interest in their fate the doesn't depend on the Earth being in danger.But whatever might have been good about taking the plot in this direction, I thought it created two major problems.  First, the mood of light-hearted adventure that was perfectly fine for a movie like STAR WARS seemed royally inappropriate for a movie hat dealt with something as serious as the impending destruction of the Earth.  Granted, STAR TREK IV went for the same mood and dealt with the impending destruction of the Earth, but that was a hypothetical future Earth, threatened by something that was pure science fiction.  In this case, we have a present-day Earth, threatened by something definitely within the bounds of possibility.  The movie even begins by telling you it has happened before.  Perhaps if ARMAGEDDON had been done as an out-an-out dark comedy, along the lines of DR. STRANGELOVE  which is actually alluded to in this movie  it would have worked for me.  DR. STRANGELOVE showed deliberate, calculated contempt, but ARMAGEDDON just shows poor judgment.And that poor judgment involves not only mood but credibility.  I find it hard to believe that NASA would have taken the pretty-please- with-sugar-on-it approach with Stamper. Rather, I think they would have MADE him cooperate in whatever way the military MAKES people cooperate when there's no time to argue. And if they didn't MAKE him forget about taking his own crew instead of their astronauts, they would have at least MADE him forget about that night on the town right before the mission.Still, ARMAGEDDON does give you a lot of cool mayhem and destruction right at the beginning, rather than making you wait through three quarters of the movie, and it is more uplifting.  I also thought its view of how the general public would react was more believable.  And ARMAGEDDON got one fact right that DEEP IMPACT got wrong. If something that big hit the ocean that hard, it wouldn't just make a tidal wave.  It would flash-boil the water and make it rain.  But I'm afraid those selling points weren't strong enough to make me feel this was the better of the two movies.Now if only someone would make a movie out of the definitive novel on the subject, LUCIFER'S HAMMER.",Null,1,1,9 November 2000
The Graduate," I wish it hadn't switched stories on my
","This may be a classic, but I didn't like the way it started out to be about one thing -- Benjy's relationship with Mrs. Robinson -- and ended up being about another -- Benji's fight to get Elain. Among other things, I thought Mrs. Robinson was an interesting character who got relegated to the role of villainess.",Null,0,1,29 April 2000
