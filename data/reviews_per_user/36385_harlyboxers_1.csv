Walk the Line," walk the line
","I never really knew the story of Johnny Cash, but I always enjoyed his music and I love Reese and Joaquin so I couldn't wait to see 'Walk the Line'. Plus my husband's an aspiring singer. I loved this movie, I'm waiting anxiously for the day it comes out on DVD so I can buy it immediately. They said Joaquin wasn't Johnny Cash and never would be but you'll never find anyone better for that part, and Reese as June was an amazing performance and will make her an academy award winner for sure. The love story between Johnny and June will make every girl fall in love with this movie, and the rock-n-roll legend will satisfy every guy to make it a great movie for all. I hope you enjoy as much as we did.",10,0,2,3 December 2005
