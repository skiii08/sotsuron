Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," see the comment
","Sacha Baron Cohen picked an innocent country (Kazakhstan) which cannot defend itself and took a large dump on it. Why not making same jokes on UK countryside's peasants, since the actor is from UK?? The answer is pretty obvious - he knows which tree he can SAFELY bark on. Sacha could have easily lost his UK citizenship and be banned from UK if he made a movie about UK. This is too much even for the toilet humor. Sure, some of you can say that he made fun of Americans as well... But it was a mild humor comparing to the dirt that he poured on people of Kazakhstan. I wish that this movie was banned worldwide. It is getting there though - Borat has already been banned in several countries.",1,11,24,17 November 2006
