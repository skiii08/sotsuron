The Avengers," Unequivocally the GREATEST Comic-Hero/Action movie to date!
","First of all....WOW! I saw it in IMAX 3D and it was just amazing. The story, the acting, the tension, the character relationships, comic relief. Flawless. Just a work of art. I personally think that all of the Marvel movies in the last decade have been great. Movies directed by true comic fans. All leading up to this one moment in cinema history. And they did not let us down:) It's so ironic that most of the 'modern' action movies are so far fetched. Fake. Pop hype served with sex and a big dose of 'let's come up with a really crazy story to top last years block-buster'. It get's old. This movie, somehow, has a sense of honesty and realism. No doubt, 'super-hero' magic. But the story and connection with the previous individual hero films just made it all come together in a way that makes you feel like you're watching a great flashback of ancient mythos unfold. Just plain fun!",10,6,13,20 May 2012
Hero," One of the most stunning movies both visually and spiritually.
","Hero, as well as 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' are easily two of the greatest martial-arts films EVER made. Personally, I don't feel that the label 'martial arts' even applies to either of these films, since they both go SO far beyond that convention and stand strong on so many other merits. The story of 'Hero' is not that complex, but does offer a uniquely suspenseful trail. The unfolding twist in the story appear to have one main goal....'color'. I don't know that I've ever seen a more visually beautiful film, in my entire life. To me, there is a gigantic power to a film that is so grand and magical....while not superficially falling prey to a large budget or CGI. For those that understand the art of storytelling, Asian film and have a sense of spirituality...this film will make your heart cry the warmest tears. This film says more in it's silence than a hundred average 'pop' films could do in their entirety.",10,1,2,10 January 2010
