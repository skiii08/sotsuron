The Avengers," Not impressed
","I'm a huge fan of comics and when a movie is made I need to see it no matter the number of stars it gets or the budget. Everyone talked about this movie like it's something huge but I'm not so impressed.The actors were great but for an action heroes not enough action.The first hour and a half was just a torture with mindless talk and few fights fought in dark.And the end was similar to the ending of Iron man,the same going in the high altitude,and free falling.I mean you have that massive budget and you couldn't come up with something different.But the ending is only one of the many things that could have been made differently.Just a little more imagination and less effects.Still the 'Star Wars' stand unbeatable.",1,2,8,24 August 2012
