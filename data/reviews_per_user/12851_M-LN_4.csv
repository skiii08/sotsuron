Casablanca," Just a love story. Its simplicity makes it beautiful.
","The world of Rick, that Hollywood-made Casablanca, has a spirit quiet unique in American cinema. Those bored people, spending their time waiting for a plane, makes the place a little strange. Rick and Captain Renault have a special out-of-time charm, with a pinch of colonial nonchalance. The love story is simple. The feelings are strong. This movie brings you into another world at another time, it's almost a dream.",8,1,3,25 August 2000
American Beauty," I haven't seen anything... have I looked too close ?
","The reason why people loved this movie is probably that it conveys the image of revolution everyone dreams to lead : the revolution against the social laws. According to me, this idea is far from being new. I agree with the painting of the American Society (and actually of many western societies), that Annette Benning embodies. Her character is very well described : the woman may be willing to free herself from the social laws, but not able to do so, because no one has ever told her how to do. While her husband is able to follow his feelings, she cannot free her mind of some material concerns like money and image. Her character is actually the best part of the film.About Lester, I would say that his character is not so true. The whole movie suddenly crashes down when he tells the girl that he is happy. This happiness isn't well described in the movie : is it made of music heard in a car, and of marijuana smoked with the neighbour ? This seems a bit fake. He doesn't have any relationship with anybody. He is lonely, or at least the movie doesn't give us any clue about him having friends. The whole movie is supposed to criticize the American society and to explain how to escape. Only the criticism is good, thanks to Mrs. Burnham and Annette Benning. The movie is based on Lester Burnham and Kevin Spacey, and I think it is in fact its weakness.",6,0,0,23 August 2000
The Shawshank Redemption," A good and entertaining movie
","The Shawshank Redemption made me spend a good evening when I watched it. Though quiet common, the plot has a good rythm. The beginning of the movie is even very common, with the scene of a murder and the following trial. The story in the prison goes rather slowly. The actors are good, especially Morgan Freeman. It is a good entertainment, but nothing more.",7,0,0,23 August 2000
Paths of Glory," Much too simple, much too easy
","I was rather disappointed by this movie. It is supposed to bring a strong message about the cruelty of war, not only created by the fights but also by the nature of man. The problem is that the good guys are too perfect while the bad guys are too bad. The story is too simple, and I am not sure it has any intellectual value, despite the evident willing to criticize.",6,14,28,4 September 2000
