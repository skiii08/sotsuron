Howl's Moving Castle," It was worth it
","After years of waiting, I finally got to see 'Howl's Moving Castle' last night. While I must admit that it is mildly disjointed in places, this fact did not dampen the enthusiasm I felt for it. The animation of course is beautiful(particularly the eponymous castle itself), the music from Joe Hisaishi fits wonderfully, and the way in which Miyazaki handles his heroine's dilemma(an eighteen-year old cursed with the body of a ninety-year old)is much more mature and insightful than any Disney film could ever think to do.And, of all the film's secondary characters, I will just say right now that the wheezing dog has got to be the most enduring imaginable. You may understand after you have seen 'Howl's Moving Castle' for yourself.",8,1,2,12 September 2005
My Neighbor Totoro," This is the movie I watch to restore my faith in humanity
","I first saw 'My Neighbor Totoro' when I was maybe seven.At the time, I thought that it was really boring(that was still when I liked Disney movies). Years later, when I discovered 'Princess Mononoke' I learned that MNT was by the same director and watched it again. And I find that I appreciate this film a whole lot more now then I did when I was seven.The animation is absolutely stunning(as with all Miyazaki films)and the story is deceptively simple, told with patient, subtle attention to detail. The best example IMO is the scene where Mei falls asleep on Totoro's stomach.It's fruitless to try and describe it;you have to see it for yourself.In closing, I would just like to say that I can't wait for a decent DVD to arrive so I can view this quiet masterpiece in widescreen in Japanese with subtitles.",10,137,160,29 September 2004
Romeo + Juliet," Well, I liked it.
","Baz Lurhmann's 'Romeo + Juliet' doesn't even come close to 'Moulin Rouge'(a truly beautiful, artistic film IMO);it is uneven in numerous instances and the editing usually is a bit too wild. Having said this however, I would like to admit that I enjoy this movie. Baz is wonderfully creative, and even if the results aren't entirely successful, there's still more imagination here than in many other mainstream films. And what about the scene at the party, where Romeo and Juliet regard each other through the fish tank? That is a genuinely lovely, tender moment, as is the balcony(or pool)scene. But for those who find this version too iconoclastic, try the Zeffirelli version; I like them both.",7,0,1,4 April 2004
Cold Mountain," Moving away from violence to love
","I feel that 'Cold Mountain' not getting more recognition- box office or award- is a shame(at least Renee Zellweger won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress). To me this movie was excellent in all departments: terrific acting, epic cinematography and set design, and above all else a meaningful story. As director Anthony Minghella says on the DVD commentary track, this movie is about the virus of violence, how violence is spread like a disease-the innocent have violent acts committed against them and in turn become violent themselves-. Moving away from violence toward what makes life worth living(love)is the journey that Inman is on.Cudos to all involved, as well as to Charles Frazier for penning the novel that was the basis for the film.In closing, a movie that deserves much more credit and praise then it has received; well-worth watching.",9,2,3,29 September 2004
Edward Scissorhands," A bittersweet parable about conformity(possible spoiler?)
","I love most of Tim Burton's movies, but I would have to say that 'Edward Scissorhands' is my favorite. The art direction and set design are all wildly imaginative and a treat to behold. The hauntingly emotional score by Danny Elfman is also his best IMO. And at the center is the fantastic, indispensable Johnny Depp in the title role. Edward is a character for whom very little can be expressed verbally;Depp uses body language and(above all) his eyes to depict emotion, and it works perfectly.Though there are moments of humor(ie Edward and the water bed)this movie is ultimately a sad elegy for all of those that are ostracized by the 'normal people'. The highest emotional moment(for me) is when Kim(Winona Ryder) and Edward part;she's finally awakened to genuine emotion,but it is just too late. 'Edward Scissorhands' is without a doubt my favorite Burton movie.",8,0,0,5 October 2004
Spirited Away," A Beautiful, Imaginative Fantasy
","This may not be Miyazaki's magnum opus (that honor goes to 'PrincessMononoke' in my opinion), but it is still entertaining, thoughtful, andmasterfully animated. And, just as with his other works, it is perfectlyaccessible to all ages, and carries messages, but never preaches. Myfavorite scene was when Sen/Chihiro rode Haku when he was in dragonform- terrific! I can't wait for 'Howl's Moving Castle' to come",9,0,0,4 July 2003
Gone with the Wind," Gone With the Wind? If it were up to me it would be
","I'll state right off the bat that the cinematography and art direction of 'Gone With the Wind' is extraordinary,and ahead of its time. I will also say that is were my liking for the film ends. The fact that the heroine is a manipulative bitch who doesn't care about anyone but herself(contrary to popular belief, Scarlett DOES NOT love Ashley OR Rhett and as for Tara,it's basically an extension of herself), coupled with a skewed, disgustingly idolatrous view of the American South and the Civil War in general is probably the most honest reason for my intense dislike for this film(as well as the book).I admit to empathizing with two characters: Melanie and Mammy. The former because she is everything that Scarlett is not, and the latter because she's the one that sees through Scarlett.For a meaningful Civil War story, I pick 'Cold Mountain'(film and book both) over 'Gone With the Wind(book and film both) any day.",3,12,34,29 September 2004
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," The Real Best Picture of 2000
","To the skeptics: this is not just another cheesy martial arts movie where testosterone rules above all else. In fact the most impassioned characters in the film are the women, Shu Lien(Michelle Yeoh) and Jen(Zhang Ziyi). The sword fight between the them is one of the film's great set pieces. Although the fight scenes are stunning, 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' also contains beautiful music, breathtaking photography and moments of gentle, melancholic romanticism. I think particularly of the scenes between Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh; it isn't often that unspoken love is so perfectly depicted(watch the moment where he presses her hand to his cheek- that may just be the best part in the whole film). And this movie lost the Oscar to 'Gladiator'-- The injustice of it burns.",10,1,2,4 July 2003
The Elephant Man," Troubling and moving
","'The Elephant Man' has its faults(historical inaccuracies, at times overly sentimental), but it is one of those films where the good things manage to outweigh the bad . The excellent acting(esp. by John Hurt in the title role), inventive cinematography and an emotionally involving story would be the good things. Indeed, there were moments during the film when I was nearly moved to tears; the vision it presents is of a gentle, intelligent man who is ostracized and abused because of his appearance, and his struggle for dignity had me mesmerized. 'The Elephant Man' may have flaws, but it is never the less a troubling, moving film that shows how hideous humanity can be--and how beautiful.",7,7,11,30 August 2003
Moulin Rouge!," Bohemian Splendor
","I love 'Moulin Rouge'. It is my second favorite movie of all time('Princess Mononoke' is first). I KNOW that there are many poor souls out there who detest it; I for one believe this: If you didn't like it, it's either because you didn't get it, or you are simply a die-hard cynic. Yes, it is fast-paced and frenetic. Yes, it is predictable. It is supposed to be all of these things. But at the heart of all this frantic art, there lies one of the sweetest, most beautiful love stories in all of filmdom. Seeing Nicole Kidman (as Satine,the realistic courtesan ) and Ewan McGregor (as Christian, the innocent young amorist) in this movie causes a re-thinking of what great chemistry is: It always, always seems to me that these two people are truly in love with one another. It is a testimony to Baz Lurhmann that this film is so sincere. So many movies today cop out and play it safe. Here is a film that wholeheartedly believes in something, and isn't ashamed of it.",10,1,3,4 February 2003
Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind," Idealistic, but not naive
","'Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind' was Miyazaki's second movie, adapted from his own comic book. Viewers of the film may become involved in debates regarding the movie's relation to the comic(they are exceedingly different). I personally advise looking at them both as separate, but equally great pieces of art.Regarding the film: The music is lush(the first film score of Miyazaki-veteran Jo Hisaishi), the animation impressive despite a few passages of static character movements, and the eponymous heroine is a figure of brilliant characterization; gentle, kind, valiant, passionate and pained.It may lack the cognizant wisdom of 'Princess Mononoke', perhaps, but NOTVOTW doesn't suffer by the comparison. I highly recommend checking it out.",9,4,5,21 May 2005
Three Colors: Blue," Rather cold and distant, but very pretty to look at
","The first in Krzysztof Kieslowski's Colors Trilogy, 'Blue' will frustrate those in search of action or a brisk plot, as well as those who wish to become intimently attached to the characters. But the patient and reflective will be greatly rewarded by the films poetic images.The entire film is lite in blue tones,scored with classical music and dialogue is sparse.The best way to approach it is a painterly appreciation for moments where a sugar cube is slowly saturated with coffee, or of a hand being dragged along a stone wall.Juliet Binoche deservedly won the Venice Film Festival award for her understated performance.Recommended for the patient and cerebral.",7,4,7,9 October 2004
Castle in the Sky," More Miyazaki Loveliness
","I must admit that at first I was a bit disappointed by 'Castle in theSky'; I had ridiculously high expectations for it(that kinda happenswhen you wait for something for a long time) and I was letdown by theEnglish dub- it's just too annoyingly loose, even though the voiceacting is good. However, since I've watched it a few more times(inJapanese with subtitles) I have come to love it just as much asMiyazaki's other movies. There are just so many great things about it:the animation, the gorgeous score, the weird robots, the devoted,innocent love that exists between Pazu and Sheeta etc. So, even thoughthe English dub isn't as up to snuff as the ones for 'Princess Mononoke'or 'Kiki's Delivery Service', that really doesn't matter too much; youcan always watch the subs and as I have mentioned in other comments: Thelanguage of Miyazaki is universal. I highly recommend 'Castle in theSky'",8,3,5,12 October 2003
The Iron Giant," The closest American animation can come to Miyazaki
","In 1999, 'The Iron Giant' was a box office failure, due in large part(if not entirely)on Warner Bros piss-poor advertising campaign. Which is a shame, because this is a unique, outstanding movie.Unlike most of the animated films made in the States, TIG relies on characterization rather than on insipid humor(not that there ISN'T humor in it because there is)to propel its story, which in itself is constructed on 50's paranoia,and the damaging effects of fear. I also enjoyed the music by Micheal Kamen,the voice acting(Vin Disel actually has been in a good movie) and the ending, which I will not reveal.With a new DVD release, hopefully 'The Iron Giant' will get some of the recognition it deserves.",8,1,1,1 December 2004
Princess Mononoke," About as close to perfection as a movie can get
","Hayao Miyazaki is one of the world's greatest filmmakers (if not THE greatest), and 'Princess Mononoke' is perfect in every sense of the word. Beautiful, thrilling, enchanting, and philosophical, this is a film that should be seen by lovers of cinema (and great art!). There's strong debate over which version to see, the original Japanese, or the English version. I love it either way (although they probably could've gotten someone other than Claire Danes for the English version but it really isn't a problem); some of the best scenes have no dialogue (ie. San leading Yakkle and Ashitaka through the forest) and besides, the language of Miyazaki is universal.",10,0,1,21 March 2003
