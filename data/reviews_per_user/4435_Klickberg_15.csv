Walk the Line," Confused as to why these filmmakers were allowed to make this...
","Now, I must begin by stating that I've never really been that big of a Johnny Cash fan. But, maybe that's why my opinion of this film holds some modicum of credence: a lack of bias. Before seeing the film, I didn't know too much about his life except that one of my all-time heroes Shel Silverstein wrote many of his songs, and a bit about what he did before he died (working with the likes of Rick Rubin and Trent Reznor, his wife dying right before he did, etc.) So, I went into WALK THE LINE with a true tabula rasa, not knowing what to expect out of his life. My only really bias for the film at all was that James Mangold was tapped as the director even though his GIRL,INTERRUPTED was mediocre at best, IDENTITY was absolutely horrendous (and forgettable), and KATE&LEOPOLD was certainly nothing to think about. Gill Dennis, the writer, had done nothing at all beforehand except for a few random movies no one has heard of before (LINCOLN ON THE NOSE?!?)And these are the people who are to make a biopic about Johnny Cash?!? Yes, I never really liked his music too much, but this doesn't mean I don't respect him as a man and for what his music did for the rock-a-billy and folk music world (music of which I enjoy quite well).It wasn't too bad for me that the character of Johnny was a whining milquetoast throughout the entire film who spent his time either crying, falling down, doing copious amounts of an unknown drug every five minutes, or begging June Carter to marry him (and then having constant childish temper tantrums whenever she would say no), but that nothing in the movie ever changed.There was never a sense of growth or movement in the film. There was never a real sense of conflict less his problems with June Carter, which I would imagine must have been a LITTLE more three-dimensional than the representation in this banal film.The steady ebb and flow of the film grew further and further monastic, as any time there was any real potential for something new, time was compacted and we were left experiencing nothing. ***POSSIBLE SPOILER*** (a sequence toward the end of the film in which Johnny is at his nadir, living in an apartment with Waylon Jennings, and then all of a sudden it's years later and he's wandering through a beautiful forest to discover a magnificent treehouse that he can now suddenly afford... what happened in the middle there, James and Gill?!? Why not let us in a little bit?!?)***DEFINITE SPOILER**** The hackneyed 'love' (really no semblance of love here, Cash just basically beats Carter down as much as he can until she's so embarrassed and mentally abused that she gives in... I doubt this is the way it happened, and if it did, that's a real shame) story completely takes over every other aspect of the film or the story of Johnny Cash the musician. The three or four other plotpoints slowly dissipate such as exhibited with his sense of immense loss over his brother or his problems with his father. In fact, the end of the film abruptly and without any hint just brings us to some random moment in Cash's life when: BAM! Dad loves him again for no reason we, the audience, can ascertain. But, I guess when the movie ends, you have to tie up those loose strings even if they're not ready to be tied.The movie was certainly watchable, but in the end wholly prototypical and bland. I'm just as confused why this movie is garnering the praise its gained (less the usual Hollywood politics nonsense) as why it was made by its filmmakers. But, I guess that's how it goes.

Source Code," Boring, trite and everything mainstream cinema has been for too long
","I had seen Moon and thought there was definitely something there. As someone who grew up on sci-fi books and Twilight Zone, I was well-prepared for the story and 'twist' that -- frankly -- was rather obvious and direct from the get-go. But, I love Sam Rockwell, thought he was the key to the film, and I was ready to see something from the same director. I was particularly interested to see what the kid would do with a bigger cast, more money and a larger platform.Well, he did exactly what every other small, indie director does once he can 'break out': he made a total flop of a film loosely based on ideas and stories we've seen a million times before. Now, I didn't much care for Inception (and those who did might enjoy this film, because it's very similar, less for story -- which is comparable -- and more for tone: a heady, needlessly complicated film that puts style and pseudo-intellectual malarkey above plot and character development), and I did not see Deja Vu (which sounds very similar, especially the 'eight minutes' part, if I recall from trailers). Regardless, Source Code was no more 'original' than any other large-scale movie that has come out in the last 20 years (if you think Sixth Sense -- which I actually thought was a decent film -- was 'original' in its 'twist' ending, then you really need to read more and/or, again, watch a few episodes of Twilight Zone). Frankly, no studio and no investor (indie or otherwise) can take a chance on a director's sophomore effort and -- essentially -- a first- time writer. Nolan got to do what he did with Inception because of the Batman franchise. Period. It's Show 'Business,' not a non-profit museum board. These movies have to make money, not art. It's just the way it is nowadays, especially with more and more execs fearing for their jobs.To be blunt, I fell asleep through most of this film. Granted, it was late and I was a little tipsy from a previous dinner, but the sleep saved me from having to watch endless repetitions of the same series of sequences running with -- again -- far too little actual plot and almost no real character development. I'm not surprised at all that this film was the writer's first theatrically released project and that his previous endeavors are straight-to-DVD Species sequels. This film was exactly the kind of project that a fellow like that has mulling around in his head -- we've seen it before, has little to no real substance, understands little of traditional plot/character development, shoddy/wooden dialogue with 'hollow men' type characters who are all completely 2-D (some rather 'intentionally'). And, yes, regardless of what anyone might want to say about quantum physics or whatnot, it will be as clear as day to anyone else who understands both narrative screen writing theory and Hollywood politics that very obviously there was an ending (which was neither 'tragic' nor 'happy,' just a little more 'real')... and then the studio brass probably got nervous and had one of their nephews slap on the saccharine 'Everything will be fine, folks, go home and tip your waiter on the way out' tag that so many people are complaining about (even though I fell asleep, I awoke for the last 30 minutes or so, and both my friend and I were well aware that 'second' ending did not belong).I'm surprised that David Bowie's son would be involved in a mess like this (another reason I had seen the film), but -- as they say -- 'even Karl Marx had to pay for his beer.'Overall, this movie has nothing to offer an educated audience nor one looking for something unique and even remotely interesting. Yes, I felt similar viz. Inception, but look what happened there. So, many I'm totally off-base. Up to you!",2,3,10,13 April 2011
The Hangover," Yes, this movie will surprise you
","Admittedly, and perhaps obnoxiously, I'm one of those who would normally never see a movie like this. I haven't really liked any of the other films by the director (those I've bothered to see), and I'm not a big fan of goofy, drunken, frat-fare contemporary American comedies.Thank goodness my roommate downloaded this one and I could see it for free. Hey, why not: I had a free Sunday morning.I don't think either of us stopped laughing throughout the film. Ever. Which is especially surprising, as even some of the funnier movies I've seen over the years tend to wane a bit toward the third act. Suddenly, the plot really comes to the fore and the movie goes from being a comedy to being an action-packed extravaganza or a drama or a romantic farce or whatever. Not this time. You will continue to laugh without stop, even through the credits, thanks to a hilarious photo montage.I was elated that such a movie could be made, and that it could receive so much praise and commercial success. I have found the Apatow movies to be boring, pointless, long-winded, and annoying at best, and have been confused by their success. Thankfully, there are still movies like The Hangover that show normal guys in fantastic situations and how they cope in a realistic matrix (yes, I just used the word 'matrix'--without being capitalized--in an IMDb review of The Hangover).And I also agree that although all of the actors in the film were top-notch (even the bg guys who will fool you every time: what a terrific casting job all around), Zach Galfianakis (sp.?) is the far-and-away MVP of this film. I remember thinking from Moment One, 'Goodness, if he acts like this through the whole film, the movie will already be a winner.' He does, and it is (and he's not the only gem of the picture). Kudos, Todd. You finally made one that's truly hilarious, surprisingly original (there is a lot here you WON'T see in Very Bad Things), thoughtful, well-structured, and--yes, I'll say it--even intelligent. Keep it up, we need more movies like The Hangover. Save us!",9,1,2,23 February 2010
Milk," Merica
","Real-life American hero Harvey Milk had a dilemma around the time he hit his 40s: though he had a fervent passion to help people, he couldn't quite figure out what to do with his life and where he belonged. All of that changed, or so says the valiant dramatization of Milk's tumultuous rise to political icon, when he unfettered the shackles of his longtime corporate job to hit the streets of San Francisco and became the first openly gay man elected to major political office in the history of our country.We've all heard of the deplorable and nearly obstructive rigmarole Spike Lee had to go through in order to make his highly influential Malcolm X a reality. Milk director Gus Van Sant no doubt had to go through similar travails to tell such a story... only he had a great deal of help, what with a cast including Josh Brolin, Emile Hirsch, a surprisingly versatile and accomplished James Franco, Alison Pill, Diego Luna, and--of course--Harvey himself: Sean Penn. There's no doubt about it: however he did it, Gus Van Sant got it done, and he did it with his prototypical flair.It's truly awe-inspiring the way that Van Sant so effortlessly vacillates back and forth between slightly more conventional, if not deftly constructed, fare such as To Die For or Drugstore Cowboy and his far more intimate artistic experimentation of the ilk of Last Days and My Own Private Idaho. He, unlike any other filmmaker I can think of, is truly able to delve deeply into the realm of the Academy Award audience and cable viewership at large, then come back for another round of Gerry or Elephant. I'm just glad to see that there's proof that you indeed can step back and forth between popcorn and caviar.Milk opens, not too surprisingly, with a gut-punch. This is a movie about a very homosexual man who lived, at least in Van Sant's vision, a very homosexual existence. Within the first five minutes of the film, Milk is already hitting on a far younger James Franco in a subway, they mash faces before knowing the other's name, and seconds later are already naked and rolling all over each other, later sharing some birthday cake in bed. From here, the rest of the film grants us the equally unapologetic vibrancy, tenacity, and vivacity of Harvey Milk's final years, of his near-decade in the public eye as he helped to define and embolden the American homosexual community, particularly in the San Francisco Castro district. Employing techniques utilized by fellow biopic directors Lee and Oliver Stone, much of the film is a beautiful and ethereal tapestry of stock footage and news reels melding with the well-crafted dramatization itself.And with a perfectly haunting yet subtle score by Danny Elfman--back with Van Sant for the first time since his equally stunning work on To Die For--the movie, as if often the case with Van Sant's corpus, allows you to completely transcend, to lose yourself in the moment, and to become one with the images you're watching on screen (no matter your sexual preference). In fact, the pastel colors of the gay community and mid-late 1970s Frisco environ allows the film to further pull you into its phantasmagorical dream as you drift languidly through time and through some rather heady incidents in our nation's tempestuous contemporary history.Milk is as much about the history of the Gay Rights Movement, particularly the development of Castro Street and San Francisco as a hardcore gay haven, as it is about Harvey Milk the man. At one point, our protagonist admits to a potential financial backer that he's not a candidate but a movement. It's an apt quote, to be sure, as the real conflict with the film is less about Milk vs. The Machine and more about Milk the political pundit vs. Milk the man, a very seemingly gentle, generous, and loving man who sometimes has difficulties making enough time for his various friends, lovers, and hangers-ons as he does for his political rallies... even after one especially tragic event that befalls one of his most cherished partners.Still, throughout I kept a bicameral mindset: easily lost in this magical tapestry of volatile history and dreamlike wonder, while forever contemplating Van Sant's singular style. As with Elfman's score, undoubtedly his best to date and finally of a slightly different flavor, Van Sant has reached back into his bag of tricks fine tuned through his ambrosial 'Death Trilogy' to come back with something that is both popcorn and caviar, that is both intimate experimentation and accessible commercial fare. Much as with his main character, Van Sant has truly found his knack for combining his personal flair with his public composure.",8,3,7,1 December 2008
Knocked Up," Frankly, found it boring and tired
","I finally saw KNOCKED UP yesterday, and as with a few of the other reviewers, I don't really see what all of the fuss is about. I'd like to think of myself as a 'fan' of Judd Apatow; I never saw 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN, but I like his work from THE CRITIC and the LARRY SANDERS SHOW (and, hey, who CAN'T like HEAVY WEIGHTS?). Simply put, I thought this movie would be a dull and hackneyed rehash of the usual frat fare, and it was. Yes, the fellows in it aren't the best looking guys, and they're presumably 'literate' when it comes to movies and whatnot (though, I do despise the level of pop culture references in this one: felt like more of a commercial at times, both because I could care less about the whole American IDOL/LOST set, and because I didn't think guys like that would necessarily watch that nonsense either). But, in the end, they're still just frat guys/ jocks living inside the bodies of fat slacker losers (who somehow are able to pass through without having jobs). The most difficult thing for me to reconcile about the film is the fact that the script was so unbelievably rigid in its fascism of the characters. People were just simply MARRIED; but you never had a feeling that they truly cared for each other. People suddenly CHANGE at a key moment, but you never really see even the most subtle development beforehand. And no one ever seems to respond to one another, especially when telling (or trying to tell) a joke. There were a number of times in which someone (namely Rogen) says something that makes you cringe and say, 'No. Not even a fat slacker loser like that would think to say something so vulgar at a time like this. He may be a stoner, but he's not mentally challenged, and he certainly knows a thing or two about being a nice guy. He wouldn't say that. He knows better.'The other stories at play were hardly developed and really meandered throughout. This fact, plus the mindbogglingly poorly developed wooden characters led me to feel that the best I could say is that, in the end, this film is pretty decent television.Admitedly, I sat through the entire film, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else. Yes, it was very popular, but McDonald's is the best-selling restaurant in the world and they don't necessarily serve the best food...",3,1,3,16 November 2007
Léon: The Professional," Doh! Why can't more movies TODAY be like this?
","Unfortunately, this movie came out at the same time as 'The Specialist,' which was created as an almost alternative version to this flick (similiar title, and a seemingly similiar plot). The market guys, at least in America, definitely were at fault for the underappreciation of THIS movie. Whereas the main review was always, 'Makes 'Speed' look like a ride to Grandma's house,' there should have been something more along the lines of: 'A thinking man's 'Le Femme Nikita.'' Oh, well.Much like one of my other favorite movies of all time ('Leon' probably being my number one), 'Sling Blade,' this film is a true masterpiece, a real lesson in filmmaking in which everything is done correctly with shifts in tone, a mixture of genre, and even a bit of comedy in places with sincere emotion and pure intensity.I thought this movie was terrific BEFORE the director's cut, but good lord... give the new version (well, old version, I suppose... being the original director's cut and all) a look, and you'll be blown away (ba doom boom chhhh).We're not going to get filmmakers like Luc Besson in this country for a while longer, but at least Soderbergh's getting there, so you never know.
You'll like this movie... or you might not... for those who don't, 'Scary Movie II' is coming out soon.",Null,0,1,4 July 2001
Watchmen," Nothing super about Watchmen
","I went into Watchmen with relatively low expectations. I never bothered to see 300, and I was certain this would be yet another in a line of poorly made 'style over substance' films in which there would be more effort put into the dissociative CGI/video-game effects than any real character development or plot.What I didn't expect is to find this film to be so incredibly mundane, tedious, and flat-out dull that it would become yawningly hard to watch altogether.'Who cares?' and 'Why now?' were the two big questions I began asking myself before finally drifting off and wondering to myself why they can't make 'good' comic book movies anymore like Tim Burton's Batman or Paul Verhoeven's RoboCop. Heck, even Bryan Singer's X-Men was pretty good (which is interesting, being that one of the many screenwriters of this soporific mess also wrote X-Men). What I found so fun and truly innovative about Robert Rodriguez's superlative adaptation of Sin City was that he was able to accomplish all three goals of a film of this nature: 1) He kept the adaptation relatively close to the urtext, 2) He made something that was stylish, fun, a little kitschy, and still made something worth watching with a good deal of substance, 3) Most importantly, he made a real, true-blue, well-crafted film that couldn't have been made any better whether it was based on another text or not.Watchmen failed horribly in all of these regards.I'm not going to go into too much detail here, because I really stopped paying attention after a while, but we're basically left with absolutely nothing new, not an original moment, line of dialogue, or plot line, and very worst of all, none of the characters seemed to be superheroes at all. They just all seemed to be relatively fast and good at karate, I suppose. One character, played by the absolutely terrific actor Jackie Earle Haley (who, like so many of the other young, brilliant actors along this train wreck such as Billy Crudup and Patrick Wilson, seemed to be lost in a lingering soap opera for two hours) literally only had the 'power' of having some kind of cloth-mask whose face morphs to different kinds of polygons or something. That's not 'super,' it's just annoying.Yawn.The only character who had any actual discernible powers (even the so-called 'smartest person in the world'--the one character whose 'superpower' was actually discussed--didn't seem all that 'super') was Billy Crudup's absurdly omnipotent Dr. Manhattan who was soooo super that he could do everything and anything--at least in the extremely limited imagination of the writers and director--and thus was rendered equally boring because there was never any sense of risk or tension with this character.I understand that the movie and the graphic novel are supposed to be about the more existential and 'realistic'/psychological realms of the superhero archetype, but even this supposed 'postmodern' angle on the superhero trope has been done to death by countless movies and books over the last few years, and much better, too (usually funny, light-hearted fare such as the ambrosial The Incredibles or even the slightly less well-crafted Mystery Men).Clearly, as is often the case with 'movies' of this nature or as with sports and other 'soap operas for men' such as professional wrestling, fans have a taste for this kind of thing that blinds them to anything else other than the fact that they're watching crap. As with people who can't get enough of Star Wars, it comes down to the fact that they're watching their dreams come alive on screen, and whether it's good or bad, they could care less...... kinda like me when I watch drivel like Watchmen. No wonder it's doing so poorly. Hopefully the Hollywood brass will finally take a hint and realize Zack Snyder needs to go where he belongs: making snazzy commercials or maybe a show on Showtime or something.",3,9,16,10 March 2009
Spider-Man," Wow! Amazingly terrible! Zoinks!
","I can't believe that this movie was as bad as it was. Quite a feat, really. I knew it wouldn't be so hot, but with a film this big, you've got to see it or you're out of the loop for the month it's soup du jour. Mainly, the screenplay fell completely flat, suffering from the exact same trevails as Koepp's 'Panic Room' (not real long-running plot, simple little scenes with no development, concepts, ideas, and 'important facts' are mentioned then never dealt with again, no rise/fall in tension overall, and the horrendous 'sense of humor' that is basically just a facade for his own knowledge of how bad his writing is by making fun of himself, the movie, and the dialogue while it's happening). Raimi's magical visual style is cluttered by the video-game special effects, which start in the very beginning with one of the most amateur looking credit sequences (stolen nicely basically from 'X-Men,' much like most of the rest of the movie, be it the 'Batman' score, the 'Batman Returns' end fight scene, and numerous homages to 'Superman,' enough to the point that one wonders how much was a joke and how much was them just saving their own ass) I've seen since, well, again, 'Panic Room.' The acting bordered on just plain awful for pretty much everyone, but it was so difficult to tell what was supposed to be 'funny' because of how melodramatic everything was or what was just not done correctly. In the end, a huge mess with a frustrating feel. Even the action sequences and entertaining moments weren't so entertaining. Raimi should stick to his two forte's: slow character pieces or parodying action-adventures (which, this could have been had there been a better screenplay) and Koepp needs to go teach a 'how to write a formulaic, basic, and easily sellable screenplay' class in film school.",Null,0,0,4 May 2002
Across the Universe," They should have called it 'Grease III: The Return Home'
","Wow.Let me just start off by saying that NO self-respecting Beatles fan could possibly enjoy this film. (Notice I say 'could' and not 'will'.)I knew ACROSS THE UNIVERSE would be awful, but I could never have guessed it would be this bad. The idea seemed intriguing, the effects (in the trailer) piqued my interests, and I do feel that Julie Taymor has a definite eye for artistry (even though she's yet to find a good script to direct; and this film is no exception). Plus, I thought that ACROSS THE UNIVERSE might be this year's LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE or American BEAUTY: you know, the film the American IDOL crowd will laud as the next big thing. Well, I wouldn't be surprised if ACROSS gets a few (or more) nods from MTV and the Academy/GG, but it's more MOULIN ROUGE than anything else.Obviously, the songs in the movies are all covers--this is to be expected--but I had no idea that it would be a wall-to-wall smorgasborg of mediocre actors doing their best to try to sing some of the greatest songs of all time. I mean, CLOCKWORK ORANGE might make a fun remake (!!), but what's the point? Why not leave it as is, folks? And that was truly the question I kept asking myself: 'WHY?!' Why make this movie? What... is... the... point?What most immediately came to mind during my viewing of this hapless commercial for a HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL incarnation of the Beatles is something Dorothy Parker once said: 'This is one for the ages (ages 8-12).' What's more to say, really? Don't waste your time and money on this one.",3,9,46,14 September 2007
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," Much better than you think it will be... one of the (only) summer's best.
","When I first heard of 'Hedwig,' I thought nothing of it, discounting it as yet another flash-in-the-pan way-too-politically-correct flick that would be so neo-liberalist-fascist that afterwards I would feel dirty for being a heterosexual.Then I saw the trailers, and realized (at the time) the movie was merely a joke, a parody, if you will, of the likes of a Millenial 'Rocky Horror Picture Show.' Then, I really just gave up and began renting movies like I've been doing for the past few months.A pal of mine saw the film, thankfully, and informed me that in fact the movie was terrific and nothing like what the previews would make you think. So, I gave it a try, and it was AMAZING. Definitely one of the best movies of the year (which isn't saying much these days, but it really was something special).Mitchell's performance was humorous, depressing, saddening, frightening, and simply marvelous. He played the entire spectrum, and to think he did all that whilst directing and writing? Wow. And I was incredibly impressed how well the cinematic tendencies in the film worked out, seeing as it was based on a simple Off-Broadway show. Every scene was precise and effecient with some of the most clever bridges between scenes I've witnessed in some time.It's abundantly clear that Mitchell and his ragtag band of crew members are sure to be forerunners in the revolution to bringing cinema and art in America back to the experimental and innovative stylings of the Golden Era in film (the late 1960's-early 1970's, of course).The rest of the cast was terrific, especially newcomer Michael Pitt who I also thought was fantastic in Larry Clark's 'Bully.' As said by some of the other commenters, I don't even particullarly enjoy musicals, but this was just... well, nothing really could describe it.

Grindhouse," Half and half
","I went to an advance screening of GRINDHOUSE with one rather stolid expectation: I would absolutely HATE the Rodriguez offering and absolutely LOVE Tarantino's fifth cinematic endeavor. After all, I've of course been a fan of QT's since my younger days, and though I admire Rodriguez's apt ability to do EVERYTHING when it comes to the making of his movie (yes, the man is a technical genius), I've never really been a 'fan,' per se, of his work to date. I've been looking forward to GRINDHOUSE for some time now, and as one of the only films of 2007 that looked even remotely interesting, I prepared myself for some balls-out fun.Strangely enough, I had the exact opposite reaction to the film than anticipated. Yes, that's right, friends: far and away, PLANET TERROR is Robert Rodriguez's finest film. And DEATH PROOF is not only Tarantino's worst film--by FAR--but it's probably one of the most boring, obnoxious, disjointed, lagging, poorly constructed, and distracted pieces of blech that has ever been made. Though, unfortunately, QT would probably slap his sweaty, bloated hands together in joy over such an invidious statement.The trick here, of course, was that both auteurs were interested in creating a purposely derivative homage to the old B-movie/grindhouse films of the 70's. EL TOPO, ATTACK OF THE MUSHROOM PEOPLE, et al. Rodriguez pulled this off brilliantly. His film was cannily reminiscent of those dog-eared films--right down to the editing and the grain of the film stock. The dialogue was at once corny AND entertaining, and he was able to put together a fine cast of actors who all played exactly to the source material (except, not surprisingly, for QT himself...cast in a minor character, he's the only one in the whole film who overplays completely, making sure everyone remembers who he is and what he's doing here). Rodriguez has made something that is fun, vibrant, and alive in a way that few recent films are. He has taken from the past and recast it in his own image; it's truly innovative that he has indeed created a damn fine 'B-movie' that is as 'bad' as it is 'good.' You never for a moment get lost in any kind of 'wait a second, what is he trying to do here?' reverie. No, you're blasted ahead at full-thrust, and by the time you realize what he's done, the movie's over and moving to the halfway decent 'mock trailers' that link the two directors' efforts (once again, Rodriguez's own mock trailer is by far the best in the portmanteau film).Tarantino's film, on the hand, is bad, bad, bad. And not in the 'good' way that he intended or that Rodriguez pulled off so effortlessly. The first 2/3 of DEATH PROOF is so incredibly dead and languid that you wonder when the movie's going to actually start. It's almost as though someone has taken all of the left-overs from Tarantino's past films (you will definitely notice very obvious similarities, and not in that--'Hey, hey!' way, but rather in that, 'Oh, I see...' way) and gave them to Kevin Smith and Eli Roth to re-write as a campy B-movie that doesn't quite deliver anything at all. Yawwwwn. Whole scenes of awful dialogue go by and you wonder if they will ever end. Then when there finally is any action whatsoever, it's over before you have a chance to take it in, and then you're right back where you started with basically the same cast of Tarantino- femmes wearing the same outfits with the same hairdo's and talking about the same boring nonsense that would have been better elocuted from the mouths of characters in a John Singleton film. The concept of DEATH PROOF is top-notch: Kurt 'Snake' Russell running amuck with an awesome muscle car as he plows down young devotchkas. Unfortunately, this is not what the film is about at all. No, instead, it's about Tarantino's own insecurities melding with his yawningly dull fantasies that we're all getting VERY tired of being played out for the fifth time. This style worked with KILL BILL, but it's been done. Part of the joy of QT is that he 'gives you your hamburger in a new way.' But, now he's not borrowing from the past: he's just repackaging what he's already given us. Maybe there's a reason he normally takes so long between pictures...The worst part of DEATH PROOF is that whereas PLANET TERROR almost seems as though it could have very well have been taken from the lost annals of 70's American schlock, QT's offering has none of the peripheral special qualities of the former flick. The few times QT tries to play in the game of his 'brother' Robert--a 'missing reel' here, a blatant mistake on the sound track there--you go, 'Oh, yeah. It's a grindhouse flick.' With Rodriguez, these intentional 'mistakes' were seamless and worked within the film's universe. With QT, you just feel that he made a bad film and every now and then decided to wreck the editing a bit to remind you of what he's done.My recommendation: stay for PLANET TERROR, leave for DEATH PROOF. And QT: Jesus, buddy: stop hanging out with Eli Roth.",5,26,46,1 April 2007
The Dark Knight Rises," I've heard of plot holes, but this movie is stinky Swiss cheese!
","Granted, I found the first Nolan Batman to be overblown, dull, trite, and a bit silly (does Christian Bale really need to talk in the Batman voice like that? Thank goodness they made fun of that on South Park), and the second to be a bit better I suppose, but the third might be the worst of all. And the fact that there are those claiming it was 'perfection' or 'flawless' must have either seen a different film than I or are taking their job in the studio's marketing dept. way too seriously (most likely the latter).Let's forget Bale's awful voice work which has marred the entire Batman legacy throughout these three films (there continues to be one Batman and his name is Michael Keaton; I'd rue the thought of how the latter-day Burton would ruin the series further, but his initial two remain some of the last great masterpieces of commercial/studio film to be consigned to celluloid in the last era).Why did Bane need to sound the way HE did? I tell you, I'm not expecting cogent story lines or apt character development from a film like this or from Nolan, but as soon as Bane started talking in the first two minutes of the film, my girlfriend and I turned to each other and knew right away we were in trouble. Forgetting the fact he sounds like an arch-villain from an early 80s action cartoon (or an American Sean Connery, perhaps), whomever did the technical work on his ADR really dropped the ball. You can tell easily that his voice was incorporated into the soundtrack in a way wholly different from everyone else in the film. He sounds like he's talking in voice over the entire time. Yikes. If this movie gets nominated for Best Sound Editing, I'll know the Academy has absolutely no credence at all anymore.Other technical and editing faults spiral throughout the film. I blame Nolan again for this, as so many of the scenes in which characters are talking to each other are clearly edited poorly. Really took me out of the film. And, again, I'm not looking for artistry in a shoot-em up comic book movie made for acne-face'd teenagers, but one would think the filmmakers would AT LEAST get the spectacle/technical aspects of the thing right. Shame. Lazy work all around.The acting was, as usual for these films, subpar except for possibly Gary Oldman who for once didn't have a slew of cliché comic book/TV lines to spout ('Gotta get me one of THOSE!' Yich). Then, of course, there's the many, many, many plot holes that are truly just befuddling. Namely the fact that we have an underground prison that is a central focus of the film and is supposed to be enshrouded in pure darkness, is to be 'Hell on Earth,' and one of the worst -- if not THEE worst -- places someone can be exiled to... and yet whenever they show the actual place, it's well-lit and the folks who 'live' there seem nothing but nice, as though inhabiting a communal little village in which you have doctors and gurus and mentors helping each other out. WHY is this place a Hell on Earth that would spawn 'pure evil' like Bane? I couldn't figure that one out. (And without giving any spoilers, the way out of the place was so obvious -- even to the prisoners themselves -- that it makes one wonder why more of the prisoners don't just up and leave.)You also have the total unreality of a booming metropolis under complete lockdown for like six months and yet everyone still somehow has electricity, water, heat, food, makeup, clean clothes, etc. and even a relatively chipper attitude throughout? I would've thought Gotham would digress into Lord of the Flies pretty quickly, but apparently everyone just stays traditionally phlegmatic in Nolan's yawningly dull cinemaverse. (Not to mention a police force stuck underground who seem to be kinda fine with that after months of no light or clean bathroom facilities.) Sorry, there's suspension of disbelief and then there's just bafflingly lazy writing mixed with lobotomized audience members.As with the first Batman, I was also so incredibly bored for the first hour or so trying to stay awake for Nolan's signature needlessly convoluted, chaotically discursive, and haplessly disorganized 'plot'lines that rather than being fooled like the illiterates who found this movie to somehow be better than Sunset Blvd, The Professional, or Once Upon a Time in the West according to the IMDb score they gave it, I knew -- yet again -- that Nolan is no genius but only a comic book enthusiast who thinks he's making a two-hour TV drama.And two hours were two hours too long here. Even when the movie finally picked up with some action about halfway through (aside from the loud and obnoxious first few seconds that might as well have been one explosion before moving into the doldrums for the next interminable sixty minutes), I had trouble keeping awake, wondering how much longer this seemingly five-hour marathon would go on for. Why didn't I leave sooner? Because $20 for an IMAX ticket is too much to step away from in this day and age and I thought MAYBE there would be some kind of pay-off in the end (there really wasn't; it goes pretty much where you think it would go). So, in conclusion: 1) Fair to poor acting, 2) Awful sound design and voice work, 3) Shoddy/lazy technical logistics, 4) Meandering and hopelessly disorganized script -- surprise -- 5) And, sadly for an action film whose one goal is to entertain popcorn flick style, BORING.",2,17,41,10 August 2012
Toy Story 3," Not just best Toy Story, best movie of 2010
","Finally saw Toy Story 3. By far the best movie of last year, and in fact that only one I would classify as truly 'great.' I love the other Toy Story movies, but this was definitely the best. Not only was it laugh-out funny through a majority of it -- even within the first few scenes -- but there were moments of action and intensity unlike anything I'd ever seen in a 'cartoon' before, and maybe even live-action. It was perfect. Flawless.And it was interesting to watch such a well-made movie... that actually made me feel good for once rather than more depressed or scared or angry!!One of the tricks of Pixar that the few other studios competing for the same market refuse to learn is this: while talking with one of the writers of Finding Nemo way back when, I explained to him my surprise at how well the screenplay came off in the film, how funny and enjoyable I found the movie to be despite its being 'for kids.' He laughed and explained to me that he and the other Pixar folks knew their kids would make them watch the DVD thousands of times... and since said kids would be happy just seeing talking fish, why not write the rest of the movie for adults? Make it something they could enjoy endlessly, too? Good point.Check out Toy Story 3 if you haven't yet. Pixar wins (again)!!",9,0,0,29 April 2011
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Probably one of the most intelligently written screenplays of alltime.
","Any idiot can sit down and spend four or seven years of his life writing out his 'masterpiece.' You do some research, you do some hard work, you get a little help from friends and family, and you get it done. But, it takes a true writing genius (or geniuses, in this case) to create something as original as 'Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure.' The ingenuity of the movie can even be seen in its delightful tagline: 'History is about to be re-written by two guys who can't spell.' This tagline is both simple and clever, while being both corny and slightly comical. Like 'Real Genius,' this film utilizes ideas from both the highest form of screenwriting while still delving into the lowest common denominator, somehow doing both at the same time. For instance, to perfectly grasp the concept of Bill and Ted's 'lingo,' one would truly have to stoop to the lowest rung of the intelligence level. But, with such ingenius ideas as having Bill and Ted meet each other in the beginning of the film, then later finding themselves, allowing the audience to gain insight on what happened in the past is just a stroke of cinematic brilliance. And the running gag about 'when the Mongols conquered China' was one of the many cherries on the cake. Even some of the background comments (after being told he's 'too tall, man' making the phone booth even more crowded, Lincoln responds: 'That's how I'm built.') Any movie where Genghis Kahn is tempted to come into a phone booth by a Twinkie has to be something special. If only production companies and filmmakers would take a chance on something as original as a time travelling phone booth carrying two idiots on the course to better the future, the public could finally go back to watching movies in theaters again.",Null,150,203,19 November 2000
The Social Network," Please stop making movies about j*rks!!
","I wasn't planning on seeing The Social Network. I love Alien 3, was blown away along with everyone else by Fight Club when I was younger and now find it to be nostalgic at best, absolutely hated the 'adaptation' of Benjamin Button, and haven't really paid too much attention to Fincher otherwise. I also don't have a Facebook page and haven't good things to say about Eisenberg.But, everyone else seems to be digging the film, and Aaron Sorkin is one heck of a writer, so I thought I'd give it a go. The film itself was average in quality. No great highs and no great lows, in my humble opinion. The biggest issue for me, though, is more of a slippery slope I've been noticing as of late of movies such as this coming out, all about a slew of j**ks (or 'a***oles,' as the Network itself would claim) who no one would ever care about. Back in the day, it was all about the underdog, the Brando schmo scratching at himself and wearing a dirty white T-shirt. It seems today, though, the new 'underdog' is really just some selfish bozo whose only means of being empathetic, according to the filmmakers, is that he/she might be a computer nerd or short or not so good-looking. As though that's enough to make us care about him/her?The specific problem for me with The Social Network is that none of the characters deserve any empathy (or even sympathy) at all. The main character--whether the real Mark Z. is or not--is a total narcissistic b***ard who doesn't seem to even want anything or have any real goals aside from pi**ing off his ex-girlfriend with whom he seems to have no real chemistry or intimacy in the first place. Just because he continues stalking her doesn't mean he cares about her; I had trouble even believing that he would care that much about her anyway, considering the inhibited/introverted solipsist the movie made him out to be. Then we have his best friend (or 'ex-best friend') who was probably the only slightly sympathetic character in the film (which in this case is like being Valedictorian in summer school). But, even he seems to be selfish, childish, and immature throughout, using his family's money as a means of making or breaking friendships throughout the movie.Everyone else in the film seems to be 'even bigger' j*rks than the character of Mark Z., going around trying to intimidate their enemies and each other without really accomplishing anything or, again, wanting anything real except for 'revenge.' It's difficult watching a movie like this where there's no one to latch on to emotionally. Justin Timberlake was surprisingly charismatic and charming throughout the movie, but as much as I wanted to like at least him--at least one character in the film--his character was also so incredibly despicable and conniving (not to mention somehow very wealthy despite everyone saying he had no money anymore) that it became impossible. I guess he was supposed to be the antagonist? The villain to the other villain(s)? Another issue with this kind of slipshod writing and filmmaking is that we're not granted any semblance of three-dimensionality or humanity that can lend itself to realism. Jesse Eisenberg might never smile (and he never seems to in movies or interviews alike), but I'm sure Mark Z. does. In fact, whenever I see that fellow in an interview or photo, he seems to be smiling quite bright. Maybe it's just now that he has $25b? But, come on. 'Cheer up, Charley! Give us a smile!'An easy fix to this could have been involving characters from Mark's actual life to show the humane and more complicated side of his persona. His parents, for example. Where were his parents? He was 19 during all of this, a minor. His parents could have been injected into the movie to give a fresh and more complicated perspective of the guy, to have them maybe speak with him and with each other about the scared boy inside the angry robot the movie makes him out to be. Or his real-life girlfriend who was there in those early days, perhaps making a composite of this girl and the one-dimensional 'Erica' of the extant film. A girlfriend who stands by him, who caresses him and lets US in on the 'real' Mark who SHE sees, as opposed to, again, the robot the movie makes him out to be. In the end, Mark Z.'s character was just as bad a guy and just as hypocritical as the biggest blonde-haired, Adonis bully fratboy character you might find in an 80's teen movie. Just because he happens to be a 'nerd' (?) doesn't make him Louis Skulnick. Charles Foster Kane wanted the innocence of his youth and craved that time in his life before he became Hearst. And this is exactly what makes him more like 'us,' more of a character with whom we can empathize, regardless of how venal he becomes over time. Mark Z. just wants to pi*s off an ex-girlfriend who, again, I don't even really believe he gives that much of a d**n about anyway. When there's nothing to care about in a main character, a movie is failing. When there's no characters to care about at all, a movie FAILS. Hollywood: please take a memo! You can't combine Revenge of the Nerds with Varsity Blues anymore! J*rks will always be j*rks no matter if they're computer nerds, alienated little eight-year-olds, Southern working moms, pregnant teenagers, or fat. Work a little harder to create real, three-dimensional characters we can care about. There's always something there; it's just a matter of finding it.",5,23,49,3 October 2010
