The Blair Witch Project," Found Footage That Actually Works
","The Blair Witch Project is a unique one for me - imho it is the only movie that relies on the found footage technique and actually works. All the other movies who tried or try to copy the immense success of this one (and I did watch) failed in my opinion mostly, and some of them would have been even good ones, if they just would have used 'normal cam-work-perspectives'.Anyway, for this found footage coup, The Blair Witch Project made rightfully its mark in the history of (horror) movie-making.",7,2,6,8 November 2018
Blade Runner 2049," Well Done
","Blade Runner 2049 lives imo mostly of its very good to sometimes even excellent and superb visuals, on top the acting is good. The bad news is that the story provided adds not much new to the original movie and is just more or less a repetition of the first one (I call it the Star Wars syndrom). Anyway, Blade Runner got a straigth 10 by me and the sequel gets a solid 8 - 2049 is no new classic but a good and rock solid sci-fi movie and sequel.",8,3,11,12 November 2019
Black Swan," About the Dance on a Volcano
","Darren Aronofsky did direct some of my favorite movies regarding modern movie making: The Fountain is one of my absolute favorite movies and with The Wrestler Aronofsky gave Mickey Rourke back his dignity as an actor (anyone remembers Barfly from 1987!?).Black Swan is another masterpiece - a fine mixture of drama and elements of thriller, with great acting (Portman, Kunis, Cassel), and a fine story about the sometimes just too fine line between real passion and madness. The end of the movie is imo for a very long time one of the most poetic ones, maybe ever. Tragedy in the scale of a drama of Shakespeare I would dare to say. Top notch!",9,1,1,9 January 2018
Captain Phillips," A Thrilling Ride
","Very gripping, suspensful movie about piracy and 'kidnapping' of a ship off the coast of Somalia, based on true events. Production and cast are great, Tom Hanks plays Captain Phillips at his best.",8,0,0,9 April 2019
Sucker Punch," Phantastic and Visionary
","After all those BIG disappointments lately (American Gods, The Mist, King Arthur, King Kong, The Wall, Lala Land etc. etc.) I more and more rewatch movies I like a lot. One of those 'new classics' for me is Sucker Punch - a movie which promotes fighting girls (a year before Hunger Games and the inflation of men beating up girls and women hit the screen), it has stunning visuals and a story - if you care - that gives you a lot of material to think about, on top you get a certain tone of melancholia which is just superb. Zack Snyder got at least three masterworks in his line: his version of the classic Dawn of the Dead, 300, and Sucker Punch - these movies beat easy everything Hollywood calls nowadays Blockbuster and tries to sell us - 2016 and till now 2017 are filled with disappointing bad or at most mediocre and certainly redundant outputs of the once called dream-factory: Hollywood needs to learn to dream again, and what I mean is not dreaming about making big easy cash with generic and bloodless products and big names, whose emptiness is disguised by the CGI-department (which is the only part of the filming industry that seems to make a - positive - progress). Not to forget all this primitive implemented liberal p.c.-schrott - how it is well done shows a movie like The Rocky Horror Picture Show from 1975. But I guess nowadays the possession of a notebook and the will to spill one's mediocrity over the world is enough to meet the qualifications to get a job as a scriptwriter (besides the 'right' left 'liberal' state of 'mind') - real imagination and skill are a very rare thing in these modern times. Sucker Punch belongs (imo) to the master league of modern fantastic and visionary movie-making: Matrix, Fight Club, Sin City, Pan's Labyrinth and a few other triumphant works of (more) recent years.",9,6,11,24 June 2017
The Equalizer," May the Blood Flow
","Denzel Washington is just great and The Equalizer belongs like the John Wick (Keanu Reeves) and Taken (Liam Neeson) movies to the new masterclass of revenge/vigilante movies. The Equalizer is a true to the heart successor of our former (or still) heroes of long gone times like Mr. Eastwood and Mr. Bronson: the king is dead, long live the king, so to say.The Equalizer is great stuff - if you like your action spiced up with a good shot of violence.",8,24,28,6 June 2019
It," Horror!?
","Well, I got one trouble - It is not a horror movie for me. I wasn't scared once and the suspense level also is low, I dare to say in no moment my pulse leveled up for an inch. And e.g. the scene with the headless boy, boy, I had a got laugh. If this guy Pennywise would ever dare to bother me I would just bend him over my knee and teach him a lesson.The movie reminds me more of movies like Super 8, Stand By Me and The Hole and as those movies are not bad imo they are more like adventure movies with some supernatural/alien/whatever evil powers and kids as main characters in it.Production and acting are good, but as this movie is marketed as horror I got to judge it as a horror movie. My rate is 4, as an adventure movie, I would rate it 5, maybe 6.",4,1,3,4 October 2017
Hereditary," A Strong One
","I rewatched Hereditary lately and I can say this one grew on me - I even deleted my old review and took the task on me to write a new one. First of all Hereditary provides us a very good cast: Alex Wolff, Gabriel Byrne, Toni Collette and Milly Shapiro really act way above your average horror troupe. Second, the sound-design is an extremly disturbing and good one. Last but not least, we get some very strong and disturbing images and a very few but therefore far more powerful scenes of 'gore'. Some reviewer complain about the ending but in my opinion that 'peculiar' ending is the sweet topping on the cake. Last note: if you like movies about black magick, demonic possession and such stuff, put this one on your watchlist pronto.",8,3,5,1 January 2020
Minority Report," Great Piece
","Like all sci-fi movies Tom Cruise was involved (War of the Worlds, Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow), Minority Report too is a good one. Pro production, interesting story/concept, good acting, good directing, well - I re-watched Minority Report lately after some years and it is still a good and very entertaining one. What else!?
I'm really looking forward to Mr. Cruise's new sci-fi movie Luna Park, looks like it can't be a miss.",8,0,0,13 July 2019
John Wick," Wick Shines Bright
",Revenge movie with lots of dead bodies because a dog was killed - even Bronson or Eastwood can't beat that story indeed. John Wick was and is a pleasure (now John Wick 3 on screen) to watch - great action and Keanu Reeves is finally back at the top.,8,1,1,30 May 2019
Lone Survivor," Of Hunters Being Hunted
","I re-watched Lone Survivor lately and its still a damn fine war movie: fine cast, top choreographed action scenes and pro production, well done soundtrack, and even if its very fictional, the audience gets a taste of the realities of war. All in all a perfect movie about modern warfare like Black Hawk Down and American Sniper, Hurt Locker and Jarhead, just to name a few. And yes, I agree with some critics, Lone Survivor got a good shot of patriotism, but anyway, many (if not most) soldiers are patriots, so if patriotism is used in a movie to show the 'mental-state' or moral and motivations of the soldiers (camaraderie etc.) , its just fine for me - as long as the movie shows us that war takes its toll from all involved too. A real gem for the aficionado of war movies.",9,0,3,28 May 2018
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Fun, Funnier, Life of Brian
","Just paying my tribute here - watching Life of Brian many years ago for the very first time I died almost of laughing too much, at least my tummy and my jaw muscles hurt a lot after that experience. Anyway, this is in my opinion a masterpiece of (intelligent) comedy and by far my most favorite piece of all of Monty Python's works.",8,1,2,1 June 2019
Wind River," Dances with the Wind
","Jeremy Renner is cool as f***, but that's nothing new. Wind River got good acting and fantastic pictures of raw nature but what it lacks is imo a suspenseful and captivating story, so I wouldn't call Wind River a thriller or a crime/detective story but more kind of drama about loss and being lost spiced up with some hunting and shooting. Not bad, not exceptional, but okay, thanks to the good acting and the great supporting act called nature.",6,32,64,29 September 2017
Fury," The Final Chapter Destroyed Fury
","Well, this movie could have been a new classic modern war movie about WWII but the last and final scenes, where a broken and motionless tank and his few crew members killed hundreds of German soldiers (outflanking and such tactics they did not learn it seems to me - something even I was able to comprehend and learn by playing some rounds of Counter-Strike), destroyed the whole movie with too much pathos and 'killing-capacity', so it almost looked like something like The Avengers fighting some poor evil minions ;)",4,3,4,9 April 2019
Fight Club," True Excellence
","This is one of my favorite all-time movies. An original story/script with a truly surprising twist written by Chuck Palahniuk (the book is also just a well-read), perfect directing by Fincher and a fantastic cast - Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Helen Bonham Carter played imo the roles of their life. Like Matrix one of the top movies of the 90s and one of those movies who will stand the test of time like Ben Hur, Gone With The Wind and other exceptional pieces of movie-making.Great art and a must-see at least for everyone who likes to watch movies with an unconventional story (I watched it at least a dozen times.)",10,0,1,8 November 2017
Train to Busan," Good but no Masterpiece
","Lots of praise by other reviewers so I will play the advocatus diaboli here - Train to Busang is a good flick with fast running zombies/infected like portrait in 28 Days later etc. A couple of ppl are in a train as the outbreak hits the nation (South Korea). The fight of these survivors on the train and on some stations is the main plot, centered around a father and his little daughter and a man and his pregnant wife as the main heroes. I liked the movie - camera, acting everything is pro but the movie lost for me a lot cuz some figthing scenes were just not well executed - for example three guys fighting with baseball bats and fists their way through train wagons filled with dozens of infected. No bite, no blow, no wound, it's just simply impossible, it looks like a little bit of a Chackie Chan movie here - trained forces with guns etc. turned cuz they their overruned by the infected but our heroes just get them down with one fist-punch... If u ever had to fight with a mad guy you know what a strength such a man can execute even if you are of more strength and weight. Also the gore level is for my taste rather low - lots of blood yes, but no limbs or guts etc. flying around or flesh bitten out by hungry maniacs etc. So yes, this movie is far far better as all those wanna-be zombie flicks from pseudo-filmmakers with no talent and/or budget but can't beat the elite movies of this genre: a good movie but not in all aspects (some terrible hollow Asian drama scenes) really convincing and in no way the 'best zombie movie ever' like some other reviewers stated.",6,5,17,12 September 2016
Inglourious Basterds," The Mix Is a Miss
","Inglourious Basterds is a patchwork - some scenes are outstanding (Mr. Waltz of course) others just feel out of place and not that funny (the comedy quality is rather not too high).In my opinion if the movie would have hold the level and the tone of the scene with Christoph Waltz as a SD-officer hunting Jews, Inglourious Basterds would have been an intense and new classic. But the path Mr. Tarantino took make this one an ambivalent experience to me - the mix just does not work too well for me. Sometimes it feels like watching two different movies.",6,1,3,25 February 2019
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Watchable
","Well, I re-watched Rouge One and I must confess - I guess I am too old now for the Star Wars franchise. What most annoys me is the fact that the Stormtroopers most of the time just produce hot air by their shooting, their armor is good for nothing (even with a stick you can knock them out - well, I know even the little teddybears in Episode VI did it with stone axes) and the inconsistencies in the movie(s) are countless - a planet-sized shield breaks down because two star destroyers hit it... Also, they still use discs for storing data :D And a little group of ground troops of the rebels engage a whole imperial garrison - I mean common, at least an outflanking maneuver should be included in the training of the storm troops if they already cut down the target exercises and spend money on fake armor. Some more examples!?1. If the building of the Death Star is such a secret operation why use human pilots for transporting crystals and other stuff. Aren't there droids in the universe (or maybe just spaceships with an autopilot-system!?)2. Why the stormtroopers transported the crystals with the tank through the (hostile, rebel-infested) city instead of using air transportation as vertical takeoff is standard there should be enough space for that kind of maneuver or you just make SPACE.3. Why killing the engineers!? If the Deathstar is flawed I would use that team to find the weakness. And really 6 engineers!? I guess you would need for whatever system you are planning and engineering for a project big as the Deathstar dozens if not hundreds of engineers. Even the toilet/waste system for the Deathstar would be a great challenge to manage.4. Last but not least why using Stormtroopers at all and not just Droids (ofc not those dumb ones of Episode I to III)!? I mean K-2SO is a droid specialized on tactical analyzing and he alone killed over a dozen stormtroopers - how many a killer droid programmed and equipped just for one purpose: for killing would have finished off!? Hundreds!?I just listed those as a few examples because I could go on and on and on - the mistakes and logic-bending issues are countless (no counter-espionage, the rebels can move and do whatever they want, the Imperial Army is always surprised, even bases with thousands of rebels are possible etc. pp.)Star Wars imo is highly overrated - if I compare this with classics like the first Alien movie or Blade Runner this is nothing more than storytelling on a level of John Wayne movies (his mediocre, mass output movies). Yes, the first 2 Star Wars movies were epic (the 3rd to a certain degree, I always hated the Ewoks-part) and I re- watched them countless times, but all the other movies and series were just disappointments. And as I watched the first trilogy I was of very young age and the (for that times) epic visuals may have clouded my judgment a little. Even Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon (Buster Crabbe!) or the first movies/show of Battlestar Galactica are Noble Prize worthy masterpieces compared (storyline, construction of the respective 'worlds').Don't get me wrong on a technical level Rouge One is superb, but the story and the 'world' itself are at most mediocre and with every additional movie it shows more and more that there is not much substance to it - just compare it with the Star Trek universe (I am no Trekkie) and you see easy which one is a more coherent and interesting universe. Rouge One is better than The Force Awakens but still nowhere near to be a masterpiece. Final words: if my country would be ever threatened by such incompetent invaders like the imperial forces I would take my pocket knife and maybe a stick too and start a revolution and by tea time I would have defeated them - alone ;)",7,3,6,18 March 2017
Captain Marvel," Captain Boredom Superstrong
","Well, I guess if you go to the cinema to watch a Marvel or DC movie nowadays and want to enjoy the experience you should a) be a brain-dead zombie, b) be a living organism with max. two living cells for brain, c) be a resurrected mummy watching a Marvel/DC movie for the very first time, d) be an alien life-form watching a Marvel/DC...Yes, Captain Marvel got boobs somewhere, that's the good part, and Brie Larson plays her role solid (I like her in that role) like the others theirs, but the story tastes like a soup of beans warmed up at least for a hundred times. The production and CGI is like always pro like most of the works of DC or Marvel, but like with most of those movies, the stories are - mostly boredom in pure essence.Captain Marvel: will make a few or a lot of bucks (who cares), because you know, Captain Marvel is a girl, and everything with a girl must be good somehow, and last but not least, there are still enough superhero addicts around celebrating everything that got some guys and gals jumping around in some superhero's costumes.",5,42,113,8 March 2019
Coraline," Pure Magic
",This is one of those movies that takes you instantly back to the magic of your childhood. One of my very favorite animation movies ever.,8,0,1,28 December 2018
Passengers," Rushed, Lack of Substance
","Passengers is okay - but be aware that it is at least 50% a kind of romance/drama and not sci-fi. Also I got the impression that everything is kinda rushed or just superficially touched (he gets lost in space, Lawrence jumps into suit and within 2 mins he is back on board, than he's dead, and 1 min later he's alive again etc. pp.) and of course you get a lot of Hollywood pathos etc.First of all my main problem is the story itself - common guys, our hero is an engineer who can repair the main reactor (alone!) but after waking up he never really wonders or ask himself why his pod failed, why all the malfunctions are occurring and progressing!? Well, with that amount of time at hand and not much to do (besides dancing and basketball) he showed a tremendous lack of interest into technical stuff - at least for an engineer... Also why not wake - maybe a nice female ;) - a member of the crew to open the door to the ship- bridge!? And did he really tried to open that pressure door with a hammer and a small welding machine!? And an engineer who makes a call for help but he doesn't know that his message will take years to reach earth and years to get the answer back!? Or why there is no main-control- system to talk to!? And on this ship all systems are on although there is some serious and progressing issue with the main generator-system!? Questions raised, but no answers - with this kind of design imo this space-travel is a suicid-mission...So what's left to say!? ofc Lawrence, Pratt, Sheen (Sheens performance as droid-bartender is imo the highlight of the movie and maybe a reference to Kubrick's Shining!?) and Fishburne can play, and the cgi etc. is pro, and the scenario of Passengers had potential but failed to deliver to be great - movies like Sunshine or the classic Silent Running beat Passengers easy. But for a date it may be just the right choice.",5,3,6,30 January 2017
12 Monkeys," Ride the Monkey
","Lately I re-watched Twelve Monkeys - still an excellent movie, and I just miss all those innovative and exciting movies of the 90s like Matrix, Dark City, Fight Club, Trainspotting, Starship Troopers and - Twelve Monkeys.
Compared to today's mass products those movies (with a few exceptions of course) all are titans. Twelve Monkeys: one of the best pieces involving the mighty Bruce Willis.",8,1,1,26 August 2019
Mississippi Burning," Still Thrilling
","Thrilling and strong movie - like In the Heat of the Night a classic with Willem Dafoe and Gene Hackman delivering strong performances. What makes In the Heat of the Night in my opinion the stronger movie, is the fact, that making the movie in 1968 the actors and people involved in making the movie had clearly more connection to those times depicted, the details in 'painting' even the minor roles and supporting characters make the difference here.Anyway, (re)watching Mississippi Burning is still a thrilling experience.",8,2,4,3 March 2019
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," From the Lands of Thousand and one Nights.
","A Hollywood blockbuster in the best tradition - exotic kingdoms, a hero with the right heart, a beautiful princess who can stab back with tongue and sword and lots of adventures and evil beings with black magic.I admit, Prince of Persia is like Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters (Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton) a guilt pleasure for me: a mindless adventure and action story zillion times told before, but what we get on top are beautiful pictures, actors who have fun and a good shot or two of humor and slapstick spiced with battle scenes and duels and some unique ideas.Well, anyway, I watched this one like Hansel & Gretel more than just one or two times, and I don't know, both movies got Gemma, maybe that got some magical influence on me ;)",8,5,7,23 February 2018
Knives Out," Who Did It Again?
","If you like those 'Who Dunnit' crime stories and movies a la Agatha Christie you will like Knives Out a lot. Good story, good twists, some funny moments and a top cast - Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curties, Michael Shannon, Don Johnson, Christopher Plummer to name a few. Production is also on the top, so all in all a good one.",8,6,13,30 December 2019
The Fifth Element," Excellent One
","I rewatched The Fifth Element lately and it is still a fantastic movie, one of the best sci-fi movies of the 90s easy, well aged so to say. Great settings, great story, great production and of course we get Bruce Willis, Gary Oldman and Milla Jovovich. The Fifth Element = popcorn cinema almost in perfection and one of Luc Besson's best.",8,0,1,15 September 2019
Hot Fuzz," Adventures of a Constable in a Mad Town
","One of the best Brit comedies I know besides Shaun of the Dead (out of competition: everything of the extraordinaire Monty Pythons).A super London top cop gets 'promoted' to a rural village and there he gets in real trouble - without spoiling everything, this movie is not only funny with some horror elements but got also some fine 'twists' - who murdered who and why!?Anyway, Simon Pegg plays again superb like he did in Shaun of the Dead. This one is good if you like action and comedy combined. Mr. Pegg should consider to do such a movie again. That would be nice.",7,1,1,11 October 2018
Constantine," Hell Strikes Back
","In my view an underrated and over-criticized movie - Constantine got nice visuals, an interesting story and some good acting. No masterpiece and not Mr. Reeves best movie but a solid piece of horror if you like to watch movies with demons and exorcism and some good ol' action. Thumbs up.",7,4,5,30 May 2019
The Others," Shadows in the Dark
","A fine dark story with a great cast and a fine setting - well, the twist I did see approaching far ahead, but anyway, The Others provided a fine suspenseful time to me. If you like ghost stories, this one is made for you.",7,0,0,6 June 2019
Troy," Still a Great Epic and Heroic Legend
","The only trouble I have with Troy are the unnecessary and somtimes even profound changes to the original story. Cast and production is great, so without those 'plot-changes' I would rate Troy for sure a 10, but as it is, a 8 it is.",8,5,7,9 April 2019
Juno," Yummy in the Tummy!
","A fine little movie and fun to watch. I don't get all the hate and negative critics. This is for sure no life-changing experience but it got likable characters (Ellen Page is just too adorable), some good humor and a good tempo (the movie felt never stretched or too long to me) and the cast is well chosen, all do a good job. An easy fine pop-corn movie. Nothing more, but nothing less.",8,1,4,3 March 2018
Deadpool 2," Just Okay
","Like the 1st Kingsman movie I like the 1st Deadpool a lot and like the 2nd Kingsman movie I don't like the 2nd Deadpool much.Yes, everything is there - action, the sometimes black humor, our bad ass hero, good production value etc., but (I really don't know why) everything just feels forced and 'not cool' (anymore) to me. Maybe I got with too much expectations to the cinema. Anyway, not all bad, but not that good either.Watchable but rather disappointing. p.s. lots of fake reviews, what a downfall.",4,5,10,28 July 2018
The Prestige," Epic Tale About Tricksters
","I am not the biggest fan of Nolan's works (some are good but imho some are pretty overrated/praised like Dunkirk and Interstellar), but this one is (like Inception) a really nice gem with an unusual story.A unique plot woven around two obsessed and rival magicians/illusionists with an amazing cast - Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall and Michael Caine. And on top we get a nice painting of the times around the end of the Nineteenth Century.Good and entertaining.",8,3,5,22 November 2018
Sleepy Hollow," A Superb Gothic Tale
","Fine Gothic horror piece by maestro Tim Burton - a dark wonderland opens its gates for us to enter. Unique, like many movies by Mr. Burton.",8,0,1,1 November 2018
Silent Hill," One of the Best Adaptions Ever
","Without doubt one of the best movie adaptions of a game: full pro production, good actors (Radha Mitchell, Sean Bean, Jodelle Ferland), directing (Christophe Gans, the guy who directed Crying Freeman and Le pacte des loups!) and last but not least superb 'graphics' and an intense sinister atmosphere. If you like(d) to play the game, I guess, you already watched the movie or if not, if you will, you will like the movie too.
The second movie Silent Hill: Revelation is for sure not as strong as this one, but despite many negative critics, I like the sequel too.For the connoisseur of horror and thriller indeed Silent Hill is a great pleasure..",8,1,1,23 February 2018
Hotel Rwanda," Great and Thrilling Experience
","One of those movies that leave you speechless after watching - how cruel people can be to another, there seems to be no limit. Hotel Rwanda - a great movie with great acting and a memorial for the countless victims of that civil war, and maybe for all wars.",8,1,1,24 July 2019
Ready Player One," Kick Player One
","I don't know the writings so I can't compare them. Ready Player One the movie is a very standard and predictable story. It is imo also almost zero sci-fi but just fantasy. I guess it works for the young - because the movie/story is well constructed giving them the impression, the hero etc. that one could be me etc. and it 'fakes' that the movie is about them and their lifestyle etc. pp. 
I was once (in my younger days) a hardcore gamer and spend many hours per day and year to master ONE game - to a certain degree. The notion that some super kids are best in many different style of games in a virtual reality is one of the more obvious things a real gamer can detect that both the writer and the guys making the movie have no idea about pro gaming at all. Steven Spielberg plays the card of zeitgeist, like his last movie The Post. One could say it is a safe bet to get some applause in the media and from the millennials and such kind of an audience. The last movie of Mr. Spielberg I really like(d) is War of the Worlds from 2005. Since then 13 years have passed... Like Ridley Scott Spielberg is another formerly titan of movie making lost in mediocrity, and he seems even not to be able to choose interesting stories anymore. Even the last Indiana Jones was just okayish and way from good. Another synchronicity with Ridley Scott who blasted his great Alien franchise with the last output into pieces (I liked Prometheus but Covenant is by far the weakest of all movies about our beloved alien and was a big disappointment to me). Ready Player One - a fake on gaming, a fake on sci-fi, a fake on virtual reality (we won't jump around in our bedrooms playing in vr but sit laid back in a couch or lay on our beds and just do everything with our thoughts in a not so distant future. I take any bet.) Also from the technical point of view I wasn't very impressed by the CGI.Okayish, if you got nothing else to do.",5,4,8,10 May 2018
The Hateful Eight," Tarantino Is Back
","I am no fanboy of Mr. Quentin Tarantino and imo with Pulp Fiction he reached the height of his creative powers and I was rather disappointed by his Kill Bill, Death Proof and Inglorious Basterds endeavors, but with The Hateful Eight he made another fine movie that just got and hit me straight - fine story, fine cinematography and finest acting, imho in one line with Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West.With The Hateful Eight and Django Unchained Quentin Tarantino is back and returned rightfully to the masterclass of the director's club.",8,0,1,10 September 2018
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," The Last Free Riders
","Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is a fantastic swansong to the good old days of the free and wild west. The titans Paul Newman and Robert Redford play superb the two (anti)heroes who cannot or don't want to adapt to the fast approaching new modern times, and in the end they find no place to hide anymore: in a town in Bolivia they fight their last stand.Great story, great acting, great production - and a fine mix of comedy/humor and melancholy make this one outstanding. The story of Butch and the Kid belong for sure to the greatest ones of the genre.",8,2,5,7 December 2018
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Strange Indeed
","Stanley Kubrick really got some of my favorite movies done: Shining, Clockwork Orange, and yes, Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb. (Of course, I also like and recommend Paths of Glory, Spartacus, and Full Metal Jacket).George C. Scott as the mad and paranoid Gen.'Buck' Turgidson, and Peter Sellers in his roles (Group Capt. Lionel Mandrake, President Merkin Muffley and Dr. Strangelove) on the road of destroying the planet (and first of all the Sowjetunion!) in a nuclear holocaust.Fine and lots of humor and a satirical sharp view on a world on the verge of madness and destruction - in its finest moments the movie reminds me of the notorious The Life of Brian.That the scientist Dr. Stranglove, who is an adviser to the US President and the generals and maybe the last hope for mankind to stop the ultimate war is obviously an ex-scientist of the Nazi 3rd Reich, is just one of those fine jabs into societies smugness that make this movie grand.",10,1,1,12 October 2017
The Beach," A 'I Wanna Hit the Road Again'-Movie
","Fine movie with some suspense and depth (regarding human nature). On top, everyone who traveled for quite some time in South-East-Asia will smile here and there because the movie really shows some aspects of travelling as a backpacker there (if you want or have to travel really cheap) and captures the mood well, especially if you dare to go deeper into the more rural and more backward regions and into the pits of the big cities like Bangkok.Anyway good acting, fine cinematography and a sometimes thrilling story make The Beach an indeed sometimes pleasant trip and sometimes nightmare strikes back.",8,0,1,4 July 2019
Pan's Labyrinth," Ueber-Fantastic
","Pan's Labyrinth is one of the few movies I rate with a straight ten: a fantastic and unusual story, an outstanding cast (Ivana Baquero is incredible good as Ofelia), a superb cinematography and directing - simply put, a movie without any flaw. Everything composed like a well-balanced opera or a play by Shakespeare.Guillermo del Toro did with this movie one of the finest moments in movie history. Pan's Labyrinth belongs to me in the same league as movies like Metropolis, Apocalypse Now, Godfather etc.A must-see. Especially for every lover of the unusual, fantastic and strange.",10,2,3,6 February 2018
Alien," Perfect
","For me, Alien is a perfect movie. Perfect horror. Perfect sci-fi. Perfect thriller. I watched it as a kid, as a young adult, and now in my best years, and still the magic of this movie is always present.Action, production, acting, soundtrack, everything is top-notch and this movie really deserves a 10. Asked, and I tend to be very critical (maybe sometimes too critical), I would not know how to improve this movie. A milestone of sci-fi, a milestone of movie-making in general. Like Lang's Metropolis Alien will shine forever, and I can't imagine a remake or rip-off that will beat this one.p.s. to all movie-makers of the present and the future: don't you dare to remake this one!",10,1,2,18 September 2017
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," The Tunes Don't Ring
","The story is fantastic and morbid/grotesque, the settings and production is well done, the cast plays well, and obviously Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman and the others had their fun making this one, but still just a rate of 6!?My trouble is the music and as Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is a musical this falls heavy into account. I even won't say that the voices are bad but still the songs and tunes don't ring to me like e.g. the songs in Moulin Rouge.Without the music and just as a regular fantasy/horror movie Sweeney Todd would get a rate of 8 from me, but as a musical the rate must be lower, so 6 it is. Yes, still a good watch, but either Sweeney Todd needs better tunes or it needs a transformation into a 'regular' movie to be a really good one.",6,0,0,1 August 2019
Suicide Squad," Harley Quinn Saves the Day
","Without the character of Harley Quinn and the fine performance of Margot Robbie Suicide Squad would be - extremely boring, with Harley Quinn it is just boring. Everything in this movie is just plain from the textbook of making a superhero movie, it is almost like this movie is another cell of a life form called the D.C.-Marvel-virus. The problem: the virus spreads and produces more and more cells but the quality of the cells is getting worse.Suicide Squad gets a rate of 5 from me, without Margot Robbie's fine performance I would rate it 3 and here I am dead serious. This movie is predictable like an Emmerich movie. Word's Autosearch-Function wrote the script I would bet.Final words: Maybe watchable and collectible for hardcore fans of the superhero-cosmos, for everyone else - expect the expected.",5,0,0,4 June 2017
Shutter Island," They Did It Again
","Great movie of Mr. DiCaprio and Mr. Scorsese with some fine twists - like their work Gangs of New York, this one is also a very entertaining one with some unique ideas.
The only sad thing - you can enjoy the twists/surprises Shutter Island provides to their full extent just the first time.Great piece.",9,1,3,30 January 2019
Doctor Strange," Speed-learning by Dr. Strange
","Okayish Marvel output (it seems to me that by the amount of all the superhero flicks produced and published half of Hollywood must be only working for Marvel or DC productions past years ;) Anyway, what you get is the cgi/graphics of Inception and Matrix (this feature is imo really top-notch and the best part of the movie) combined with some pseudo-esoterically blabla and the typical superhero story of a fight between good and evil. Ofc there are some harsh plot-failures like our Dr. Strange mastering the craft of magick or superhero-powers or whatever within some weeks or months of training and beating the masters of the craft... If the work would be so easy I guess we would get zillions of Bruce Lees or Buddhas walking around ;) Well, no matter how talented you are, I guess nobody really thinks that after one year of some martial arts-training he will got a chance to beat a master of the respective or any martial art. The acting is good - actors like Rachel McAdams, Mikkelsen and Cumberbatch can't play bad. Dr. Strange is pop-corn cinema, good enough for a watch, but Ant-Man and Deadpool are still by far the best recent superhero flicks, ofc just my opinion. Next.",6,1,1,25 January 2017
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Dwarfed Between Titans
","I will make it very short - Three Billboards etc. etc. is not a bad movie, but it is also no masterpiece. If this movie was nominated for an Oscar (like Dunkirk, The Shape of Grey etc. pp.) it just shows that Hollywood's output regarding its quality is on the decline (e.g. La La Land a not bad but just mediocre musical won last year 6 Oscars...).The actors of Three Billboards etc. etc. do a really good job and are the best part of the movie, and the story got also some unique and interesting stuff going on. And yes, the movie entertains and got some thought provoking twists BUT in the whole, in the sum it is just a little movie that won't stand the test of time.Three Billboards etc. etc. must be compared with the top notch movies of the crime and drama genre, and there stand some giants like The Godfather, The Silence of the Lambs, Departed, In the Heat of the Night, No Country for Old Man etc. All those movies compared to Three Billboards etc etc. are just playing in another league - only to add some dark humor just can't disguise one fact: Three Billboards etc. etc. is just a small-town crime drama with some merits but no classic ever.In short: a good and entertaining movie with some good ideas but in now way a new classic or masterpiece.",6,2,4,5 March 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," The Decline of Skywalker
","The good news: finally the story of the Skywalkers is done and finished for good. The bad news: all in all Mr. Lucas should have left the original triology (Ep. IV-VI) alone: everything added ist just more or less bad with some nice explosions and CGI, terrible and incoherent storylines, boring characters, and last but not least an excellent example of redundance.Pros of Episode IX: some nice effects and action scenes. That's it. If you please, follow my remedy: I got the original three movies in my collection and all the other movies (including that terrible Solo thing) I banned for lifetime and I will pretend for all eternity that they did not happen at all ;)",4,43,91,19 December 2019

Predator," Arnie the Great
","This is the one and only Predator movie. All the other sequel, prequel and mixquel (Alien) and whatever cannot hold their ground against it. The 'new' Predator (2018) is a joke compared.Predator from 1987 is a great action movie with some sci-fi elements, got a top production, good acting and directing, and the great Arnie in his best 'shape' (well maybe his muscles were more defined in the Conan movies).No filler all killer, so to say - this is the piece you want to see: Predator beats easy still most of all action movies ever done.",8,2,3,10 November 2018
Léon: The Professional," Léon Still Rules the Mob
","I re-watched the movie yesterday and just can state - this movie does not age. A fine and well forged piece of a thriller with some unusual ideas and wonderful actors. The only sad fact - i can't remember one movie of the crime/drama genre with so much quality in the past years (well, maybe with the exception of Sicario and No Country For Old Men). Anyway, Léon belongs like Pulp Fiction, American History X and The Godfather to the absolute highlights of the crime/drama/thriller genre, and Jean Reno, Gary Oldman and the young Portman delivered some of their finest performances ever.If you never watched this one, maybe because of your age, watch.",8,1,1,19 September 2018
Oblivion," Another Kind of Matrix Rising
","Well, instead of making the terrible Mummy, Mr. Cruise just should have made another sci-fi-actioner. 2013 Oblivion, 2014 Edge of Tomorrow, two superb sci-fi-movies with an interesting story, good execution and some heavy action (especially Edge of Tomorrow). Like in War of the Worlds the sci-fi stuff just seems to fit Mr. Cruise and/or he gets offered very good scripts in this genre. Well, this lets my expectations for his next sci-fi project Luna Park rise higher than just HIGH.Back to Oblivion - the story is like sci-fi should be, not some pedagogy in disguises like movies as Elysium and District 9 and the like but some inspirational and intelligent stuff. The story in one sentence - a man must detect that not everything is as it seems to be. Welcome to the Matrix Jack. Btw, wasn't Tom Cruise's character in the superb Ridley Scott movie Legend also just named Jack!? And of course there is Jack Reacher, maybe some hidden message here!? ;)Recommendation for every sci-fi-fanatic.",9,2,2,23 August 2017
Bird Box," Well Mixed, Well Served
","I was highly entertained by Bird Box, and Sandra Bullock played her role good and convincing (bullying her seems en vogue to some people) like she did e.g. in Gravity. Her presence was one of the few things that makes Bird Box a better movie than the average one.Anyway, if you like movies like Blindness (2008), Los últimos días (2013) or e.g. Quiet Place you will like this one too. And honestly, I don't care who is a copy cat of whom (there seem some discussion here) - I am already satisfied and glad if I get served something of some originality in our modern times cursed by pre- and sequels, reboots and rereboots and whatever director's superfinal cut...Not the most original plot, but a well made flick for the aficionado of post-apocalyptic movies with some decent ideas. Watch, and don't bother with all those rate 1 and 2 reviews.",7,1,3,25 December 2018
Justice League," Maybe The Mother of All Bad Superhero Movies
","What you get is an ueber-generic, predictable and mega-boring superhero movie, one you can leave for 20 minutes and take a beer or something or just make a little nap and after getting back into the movie you won't have any troubles to 'understand' what's happening, what's going on. The script is something like I guess will happen if you feed a machine with 5 different basic stories and the task of the machine is to 'create' a new script based on that material. Zack Snyder did some fine movies: his version of Dawn of the Dead, Suckerpunch, 300, Watchmen, but since Suckerpunch he seems to me he lost all interest in making good movies, as long as the paycheck is big enough, or maybe he is just obsessed with the most boring of all superheroes - Superman (I never understood and still don't understand how it is of any interest to read or watch stories about an invincible guy who just beats up inferior guys, well as long as they don't have kryptonite, for me Superman is something like a 'super-bully' beating up most of the time guys who don't stand a chance).Final words: Justice League won't kill you watching it, just don't expect anything great.",3,3,6,2 December 2017
28 Weeks Later," Still Waiting for 28 Months Later
","Not as strong as 28 Days Later, that's for sure but a rating of 1,2, or 3 for certain is undeserved and no serious rating. Some logic issues, yes, but still better than 90% of the movies published under the banner of the zombie/walker genre. I watched tons, and I know what I am talking about - 28 Weeks Later, good, but could have been much better with a more plausible story and with less ueber-life dramatic action scenes (like that car chase and poisoning gas in the streets).",7,1,1,18 July 2019
The Village," Outside the Horror Awaits
","The Village got a good production, a fine mix of mystery with some traces of horror, and a nice twist (first time watching it is a really good one), and of course, an excellent cast (Joaquin Phoenix, Sigourney Weaver, William Hurt etc.). Suitable if you like movies like The Sixth Sense, Signs, The Others, or Sleepy Hollow.",7,1,1,25 May 2019
The Revenant," Fine Piece
","A few days ago I watched The Revenant again - still a fine piece of a movie with strong performances and strong production. But the story reminded me somehow of another movie and per chance I did find out which one: Man in the Wilderness with Richard Harris (a younger audience knows him for his role as Dumbledore in the first Harry Potter movies, the older ones know him from movies like A Man Called Horse, The Guns of Navarone, Mutiny on the Bounty etc.). The story of Revenant got some changes of course, but mainly it is the same story. The old one from 1971 is also a very good and entartaining one, so if you got time give that one a try too and compare both works.",8,0,1,9 October 2019

Knowing," A Story Went Nuts
","The transition between the supernatural events to the alien rescuing 'chosen' children/mankind theme make this one a pretty stupid one including some aliens kidnapping the kids with a car hijacking just right before the world gets burned by mother sun. Wow...Production and acting are solid, sadly the writers did smoke too much of something they shouldn't smoke (at least while writing), or they just lost their wits (assuming there was some to lose), or they thought it is a good idea to try to please every possible (audience) target group on this Earth. Could have been good, as it is, it is a rather underachieving one.Last note: to spice things up I would have added one last scene/picture - our new Adam and Eve running to the Tree of Life, and then a last close shot on, yes, you are right, a snake ;)",4,0,0,27 July 2019
The Shining," The Horrors Within
","Imo without question by far the best adaption of a story or book of Stephen King. A feast for the aficionado of all horrors. Stanley Kubrick showed once more that he was a true master no matter of what genre the movie was he put his hands on. 
On top, Jack Nicholson played our lunatic with a fever and intensity only Klaus Kinski I guess would have been able to play alike or even beat.Great and outstanding movie - I put a spell on everyone who wants to make a show, prequel, reboot or sequel or whatever piece based on Shining ;)",10,0,1,23 March 2018

Silver Linings Playbook," One For Your Heart
","Fine little movie that combines very skilled elements of comedy, romance and drama, with some quiet moments and some feel-good moments, and yes, an end that is 'kitsch', but as long as kitsch is well executed I don't mind.Another plus: Silver Linings Playbook got an overall great cast with obviously a lot of fun playing their roles and the script provides us here and where with some unique moments/ideas and also shows the other side of the coin of having psychological/mental issues - not everyone affected by a mental illness is a depressed loner or a lunatic psychopath, but some got refreshing different behaviors from what is considered to be 'normal' and their behavior is an invitation to rethink our own behavioral routines and structures.Good.",8,0,0,12 October 2018
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," A Guilty Pleasure, but a Good One
","Gemma and Jeremy are the coolest cats in town or respective in all the fairylands hunting witches not only in the witching hours. I really enjoyed this movie, that provides us with a ton of fresh ideas, spicing and shaking up the good old Grimm tale, mocking with mindless fun all fairy tales and vampire stories and the like ever written or put into motion pictures. Hansel & Gretel, a guilty pleasure for sure, but also popcorn cinema in the best sense, of course, no new Inception and no aspirant for an Oscar but fun enough to watch this movie more than just once, and still giggling and laughing in certain scenes and admiring the makeup-art of the witches, the cinematography, and the full action mode. A movie the Wizard of Oz would be proud of. And last but not least, Gemma is the most beautiful witch hunter ever.",8,0,0,22 October 2017
Collateral," Kill' em All

Dark City," Underrated Gem
","One year released before Matrix, Dark City is another dark highlight of the late 90s. Fantastic visuals and a mysterious story (somehow Lovecraft, Clive Barker and Kafka mixed in a sci-fi context) make Dark City one of those movies most of the audience will just like or dislike: you get it or you don't.Last but not least: a fine cast with William Hurt, Kiefer Sutherland and Jennifer Connelly make the whole experience complete.",9,3,5,22 October 2018
Dunkirk," A Work of a Dilettante
","Surprising is how many people claim that this movie has good visuals or even transports well the conditions of battle - imo everything just looks wrong, most of the ships and the architecture of the houses at the beach looks way too modern to be authentic to the times around 1940. That such movies are still possible to make without zillions of dollars proof such fine movies like The Book Thief or The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas. Also, where are the tanks, artillery, trucks, and other equipment etc. of the allies!? Everything just looks underachieving, bad, cheap. Compare Saving Private Ryan - you see that this movie is almost a joke, without all those extras standing around I would say it is a movie made by some students of movie-making or one of those projects of those guys who 'reenact' battles. Alone the landing and fighting on Omaha Beach in Spielberg's epic war movie beat easy a thousand times everything of Dunkirk's boredom. This movie is everything but epic, and this movie is for certain no example for good movie making, maybe good enough for the fanboys of over-praised Mr. Nolan. For me, Dunkirk is a total fail regarding entertainment, suspense or in telling the 'true' story of Dunkirk. Also all the techniques like cam, setting etc. are at most just mediocre. Where all the money for producing this movie was spent, I can't imagine, but maybe Karl Lagerfeld or some other fashion designer did the job himself to make all the uniforms with his very own hands. A movie like Enemy at the Gates must have cost at least a billion dollars, of such dimension is the difference in the quality of the production of both movies. Mr. Nolan did a very good job with Inception, but war movies ain't his business for sure - compared with the mentioned movies and other good to ueber-good movies about WW II Dunkirk is a true work of a dilettante.Saving Private Ryan got a rating of 8 from me, compared I can give Dunkirk only a 1. Zero I would give if I only could.",1,3,7,5 December 2017
Aliens," Epic & Unforgotten
","Asked if I like Alien or Aliens more, I would say it depends on my mood. If I want action, Aliens would be my choice, if I want some dense and thrilling atmosphere and a little more claustrophic feel, Alien would be my choice, but anyway, if I got the time, I probably would just watch both in a row ;)The other movies of the franchise also have their qualities but Alien and Aliens surely belong to the top league of sci-fi movies - for all eternity. Amen.",9,2,5,8 February 2019
The Exorcist," The Evil Within

Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," CGI Galore
","Lots of weird cgi-created creatures (well done), story-line meh, character-development or -likeability compared to the Harry Potter movies also meh, acting okayish. Conclusion: Fantastic Beast and Where To Find Them is no fiasco or total fail but lacks of real substance and I would have preferred a more daring approach storylike. Why not telling the story of bad ass Lord V. and/or the parents of Harry Potter, or the lifetime story of Dumbledore, or at least something like Mr. S. hunting fantastic beasts across the globe in peculiar spots. Anyway, most of those beasts it seems to me are already in the fantastic suitcase of Scamanders, so we missed all the adventures of hunting and collecting those creatures... Somehow this movie reminds me of Mr. Lucas - he wrote and made movie-history with his first trilogy of Star Wars and then, well lets be tender, he lost a lot of his capability to write anything resembling an interesting and captivating story. I got to say of all the possibilities to expand the Potter-universe Mrs. Rowling voted imo for a bad (boring) option. This flick is imo a lot like Disneys versions of Alice in Wonderland - you get a lot for your eyes but not much for your mind and heart. And ofc you get the obligatory Depp in it. The 2+ hour movie tasted like a chewing gum to me - the longer I had to chew it, the more it tasted like blabla. Next.",5,2,3,16 January 2017
Resident Evil," Maybe the Best One
","A real great pleasure at the time of its first release and besides Resident Evil: Apocalypse my most favorite of the whole franchise. With the last two movies sadly Mr. Anderson got a little confused storywise (or he likes it too much to jump around in circles) but anyway, Milla in her iconic role as our heroin Alice was and still is always worth a watch. The first movie of the series got the best story, a real fine dark 'tone' and the only thing I would complain about, if I have to, is the fact that I would have used some more gory scenes, like in the first classics of Mr. Romero's work. Verdict: still good and entertaining.",8,1,1,6 June 2020
Gone with the Wind," One of the Greatest
","A perfect epic movie with a great story and a superb playing cast and one of the biggest productions imaginable. Like Ben Hur and War and Peace a classic for all eternity. A world is going down, a new world is rising out of the ashes of the gone - melancholy, fear, the sacrifice, and hope of a whole generation fighting and suffering in the Amercian Civil War. In our troubled times, where war and terror are present almost in every corner of our world and in times where the status quo seems to be a faster and faster-going constant stream and faster-going flow, where nobody can be sure or predict what the future ahead may bring to us, a movie more relevant than most people think.",10,17,20,11 October 2017
District 9," More Fantasy Than Sci-Fi
","Certainly not a bad one but (imo) not that masterpiece or excellent movie many reviewers claim - the stories 'hidden' message is far too obvious and lacks of depth. The native people of America would tell you another story of 'different folks' arriving. Life is no sugar-candy, someone could destroy the movies message with a few words. In this sense, District 9's story is (like Elysium) a romantic fantasy in the gestalt of sci-fi. All in all: the story lacks of science, especially in the fields of sociology, social-psychology etc.Not bad, but not that good either - and the story is not that original at all, I just say Alien Nation, V etc.",6,2,3,12 December 2018

28 Days Later...," Still Supreme
","28 Days Later... was and still is really one of the finest moments regarding the zombie genre and every director who wants to make a zombie movie should not only watch this one ten times and more but analyse it thoroughly - no matter if one planes to let his zombies walk or run.This one, like a very few other movies of the genre, that take zombies and walkers serious, show that good acting, a good script and a good production are no impossibility if you make a movie about the undead. With Alex Garland (script) and Danny Boyle (directing) of course two very talented guys are responsible for the quality of this little gem.Still top notch - especially if you compare this one to the tons and tons of crappy and mediocre movies that are published under the flag of the undead.",9,0,1,11 October 2018
Lawrence of Arabia," A Titan's Work
","A titan of a movie, unchallenged even by today's biggest and most massive productions. Great acting, great story, every time I watch this one it is a unique and fantastic experience. Peter O'Toole achieved immortality with his performance.
Belongs easy to the best movies of all time and Lawrence of Arabia is one of those movies you can watch countless times. Maybe some time I will get hand on the original book Seven Pillars of Wisdom written by the real Lawrence of Arabia (Thomas Edward Lawrence) and read his epic story.",9,6,8,5 August 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," No Masterpiece
","That Hollywood and the whole industry (including critics) would praise and celebrate that movie is no wonder - hedonists, narcissists and the like just like 'talk' about them, the more and the longer, the better. But for me (not being involved into the movie business, just the guy next door) Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood felt overstretched, too slow, too self-indulgent.
Yes, cinematography, music and acting are excellent (like always if Mr. Tarantino is involved), but the crucial points like humor, the story told etc. are rather mediocre.
Mr. Tarantino likes to experiment, to copy-paste, put stuff in a new context, tries to break limits etc. but imo a running time of almost 3 hours without really having much to tell is - a rather exhausting affair for the audience. I would cut that movie down to 2 hours and then maybe it would work better.
Anyway, not that bad and Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood still got its merits and maybe it will just work fine for you. See for yourself.",5,12,29,28 July 2019
Get Out," Over-Hyped
","Someone remembers the movie Skeleton Key (2005, with Kate Hudson!)!? Well, Get Out is basically the same plot, whereas in Skeleton Key the transferring of the soul or whatever is done with black magic in Skeleton Key a neurosurgical procedure gets the job done. So the plot is mostly (besides the well-done clash of black and white folks culture) a copy cat (as Skeleton Key plays in the deep South we got also a little of the element of black/white culture contrasting).If I would have to choose one of both movies for a cinematic night I would watch Skeleton Key again - the dark atmosphere is far more superior and the suspense also. Also, the end is far more delicate.Get Out has some strong points - good actors, good production and especially the strange circumstances and the growing paranoia of our hero are well done. On the other side, the movie has some weak points too - imo the (re)solution is hasty done, also there are some (important) mistakes - how our hero got the stuff into his ears, as he was bound to the chair!? And the brother didn't see the stuff in his ears - he was clearly checking if the 'sheep' is asleep and knocked out. Also didn't our bad girl see (in darkness!) the blitz of the phone - she should know that the possession/control or whatever of the host is broken, so she would never give the gun to her 'grandfather'. Also the comedy- element is a mixed up experience - some of the subtle comedy elements I liked, tiresome for me was the black buddy stuff cliché: comedy Kitsch zillion times done before - it was (partly) funny with Eddie Murphy in the 80s and maybe you got away with it in the 90s but now...And whereas a good horror-movie mostly has a bad end for the hero (Kate Hudson loses in a certain, surprising kind of way the struggle for her life), the director didn't have the guts to make a 'good' end - ofc our hero should be shot by a cop or ride the electrical chair. Why!? Because the mad comrades of our good evil family would ofc 'delete' all pieces of evidence of crime there will be just one solution left - our black guy would be sentenced for mass murder, or who would believe his story, as many 'decent' white folks would testify against him!? Btw - isn't that the point of a racist society!? ;)This p.c.-ending is imo too much of fishing for compliments or sucking up to the common mainstream agenda - and a good horror movie should everything but be p.c.In short - I was entertained and I like many aspects of the movie (especially all the actors), but in my horror collection Get Out won't make it into the top 100, maybe top 250 but even that's not for sure. The script/the story just is not good enough. Get Out: a little 'horror' snack (the horror-elements are just a few, it's more a comedy and thriller). Not more but no less. Because all this biased overrating I rated 1, my real rate is 5.note:imo the political agenda or bias of many of the reviewers and the votings (with black actors as main characters) is ridiculous - masterpieces like Blade Runner got a rating of 8.2 or Apocalypse Now one of 8.5 and Get Out got 8.1... I've become accustomed to subtract 2 to up to 3 points (deciding if I watch or not) if a black actor is involved as the main character(s) - not because of racism but because the ratings are f***ed up and I can't trust them (like all those fake reviews and ratings in the beginning of any movie initiated by the studios) - Get Out is just another proof of this hysteria.",1,387,725,25 April 2017
Hellboy," The One and Only Hellboy
","I had to write this review - Hellboy and Hellboy II: The Golden Army are a tasty and funny dish with strong visuals, some special superheroes and a bunch of fine antagonists: Guillermo del Toro did a really fine job here and Ron Perlman is the one and only Hellboy.
Both movies of Mr. del Toro are superior to that new one directed by Neil Marshall in 2019 - even Milla Jovovich as the evil witch couldn't save that weak piece - just wondering why a company or producer bothered in making that one... Anyway, watch the only real Hellboy and get a fiery joyride to hell.",8,1,1,22 January 2020
Room," Bored to Hell
","Sometimes there are these special movies - high ratings, lots of ppl loving them and you just wonder - is this the same movie Iam watching ppl are talking about!? I was just well bored, almost bored to a brain-killing stupor. The young kid played his role not bad but if I compare him with the little girl from the movie Hidden (I know, I know, different genres but at least the location/space/set for acting is comparable)- he's just okay. The one thing I was the whole time wondering - why the woman didn't just kill the guy in his sleep. Well I heard about Stockholm-Syndrome, but the woman didn't behave imo like a person with that 'kind of state' would, but Iam no specialist here. Well, so many ppl praising and liking that movie so tbh they can't be all wrong - so just try that movie and see what kind of movie Room is for you. Btw - one very weak point of the movie is for me that I didn't attach to the mother and his son at all - I watched that movie with no sympathy nor dislike for them. Well, I rated it 1 because of all the legions of 10s, my 'real' vote is a 4 but no more.I re-watched the movie and I must say I even do like it less, if it's possible. I realised why I don't like this movie at all: Room tells us the typical Love-Conquers-It-All-Narration but if u have ever known/met a person or worked with a person who was sexually or otherwise traumatically assaulted you know that just love doesn't heal everything. Lots of ppl just never really leave behind the trauma, the trauma is a big part of their life. So this movie is kinda Disney-life and has not much to do with real life. Room is the typical sugar-coated version (and the book also if it has the same conclusion) of a Love-Conquers-It-All-script - it happens in real life yes, but this kind of story is told countless times before on screen and in real life rare. Many real good stories hurt reading, but Hollywood gives you 9 times out of 10 cotton-candy at the end. So does Room. Btw - the boy almost shows no sign of disturbance in his behavior whatsoever. If u see pictures (or meet them in real life) of e.g. war-traumatized kids you understand how dumb this is. If I compare this movie to The Lovely Bones with Saoirse Ronan, Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz u also see that the actors are just mediocre. And whereas The Lovely Bones is really heartbreaking and got suspense and is told poetically superb, Room has nothing of it to offer. Or watch Chained with Vincent D'Onofrio as a sick, emotionally dead serial killer. To watch D'Onofrio's superb play was shocking good. And the relationship between Rabbit (Eamon Farren) and his captor Bob (D'Onofrio) beats everything Room provides easy. Chained is shocking good. Room is shocking naive and boring.",1,48,127,17 February 2016
A Quiet Place," Not Outstanding But Good
","I agree with all the negative critics that there are some issues of logic with the story, but anyway, very good acting, an interesting 'sound of silence' concept (yes, I know Don't Breathe from 2016) and a very good production counterbalance those issues. The concept: a family is fighting for survival in a world after an alien invasion. Those aliens have a very high-developed hearing capability, so every noise can be your last noise, as those aliens hunt and kill every human. The survivors of mankind try to hide and live in this world without making any noise.If you look closely of today's big production and stories (just think of the terrible plot of Ridley's Covenant) the plot of A Quiet Place is not that bad. Or just think of that overpraised 'horror'-movie called Get Out - a critics darling: that movie got a terrible illogical plot and was a very badly executed mixture of different genres but got a good shot of p.c., and it got ratings high as Apocalypse Now at the beginning. Summa summarum: I was very entertained and every rate below 5 is imo in no way a serious rate. A Quiet Place is superior to 90% of all contemporary shows and movies regarding the sci-fi genre. Well, if I could, I would rate 7.5, as I cannot, I rate 8. And last but not least, A Quiet Place is not overloaded with any p.c. crap. That's imo just a big plus in times of all those p.c.-infested movies and shows airing and bombing the audience.If you like thriller and sci-fi, this one is certainly a good one for you.",8,5,11,25 May 2018

The Hurt Locker," An Adrenaline Junkie's Story
","This is a war movie and not a documentary. No movie ever could give us a real 'impression' on war - you don't get the smell and the bullets and shells are not deadly to you, the audience, and even not for the actors..The Hurt Locker is a fine action movie with a devil daring and somehow broken 'hero', and as it tries to give us some 'flavor' of the war in Iraq, or the war on terror, and it does not try to be big on anti-war-propaganda (that*s more between the lines).If you want a suspenseful movie that entertains you, The Hurt Locker is for you: you get a well done production, good acting and some good action scenes. But if you want a somehow super-deep philosophical meditation on war, this one is not made for you.Good - if you like movies like American Sniper, Green Zone, The Wall and Jarhead and the like.",8,2,3,28 November 2018
Moulin Rouge!," Paris At Its Best
","Nicole Kidman as Satine is a true goddess and Moulin Rouge! is one of the few true outstanding stars in the heavens of musicals. A new giant on the horizon like Tom Hoopers fantastic musical adaption of Les Misérables in 2012 (also strongly recommended).Moulin Rouge! is one great joyride from true love, to the deep fall of life's sometimes most tragic moments. Nicole Kidman dying in the arms of Ewan McGregor is one of the best dying scenes ever made in a movie and their songs are just beautiful.Fantastic cast, outstanding visuals, great musical interpretations and experiments and on top an universal never-ending story. A true masterpiece.",10,0,0,3 March 2018
X-Men: Apocalypse," X-Men: On Crutches
","I am and I was never a great superheroes-comics reader (I was more into fantasy and sci-fi stuff a la Jodorowsky/Giménez). So as a no specialist of DC or Marvel or whatever superhero-cosmos there may be existing I guess I can dare to say Iam a little more objective to all the superhero-movies as a hardcore-fan.Imo the quality of Marvel/DC movie-adaption drops fast - Batman vs. Superman, Fantastic Four, Captain America Civil War and yes, the last part of the X-Men franchise name it they are at best average entertaining stuff and lose compared to their predecessors.The issue isn't imo the acting, editing, cgi-quality or other 'technical' parts - ofc that's all well done or at least sufficient executed but the real and BIG issue is - the plot, the story and yes, some of those movies with that a shallow story-line are far too loooooooooong. Less would be more - cutted to 100 min maybe those movies wouldn't be so boring and bored I was (not the whole time but way too much).So back to X-Men: the story is fast summarized, the good and the bad mutants are gathering their troops, after grouping up the first little fights after that the endboss-fight with the supervillain in-between somewhere Stryker and/or other 'normal' guys do interfere, end-credits, closing of the curtain.Also how the super-villain Apocalypse was beaten is implausible - that dude just could have transformed his enemies to sand...Imo the first trilogy was far more interesting story-wise. This movie has no story the other movies didn't already tell us over and over again. And this switching of Magneto from good to bad and from bad to good - really this guys sucks, be a villain or be a good guy, maybe change your mind once, but not in almost every movie/struggle...Anyway Antman and Deadpool are the positive surprises and I enjoyed those 2 movies bigtime, both beat easy everything the 'big players' of the superhero-cosmos provided with their last endeavors.Last words: Not unwatchable but - redundant. The only important info for me was how Professor X lost his hair ;) Only recommended for die-hard-fans.",5,1,10,6 June 2016
1917," Ueber-Hyped
","Overpraised like Dunkirk. All the time you just hear (or read) that the movie was made with an one shot approach/method but this is just a technical question and makes no good movie itself.
Compared to Paths of Glory (1957) or All Quiet on the Western Front (1930) this is not much better (regarding being realistic) like Emmerich's Midway or Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor, but those at least got some fine and epic action scenes.
All in all: a big Hollywood production with every possible war cliche you can conjure up. Also the sounddesign (drones, ambient noises and melodies) does not fit into the movie at all - and where is the sound of heavy artillery that you can hear for many miles!? To sum it up: no masterpiece, but mildly entertaining.",5,25,61,15 January 2020

Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Another Hope Fails
","Well, besides the 'holy trinity' of the first three movies of ST only Rogue One was a good one. Episode I to III (only III not too bad) was a real let-down and the first of the new triology was more or less a retelling of Episode IV, but a bad one. Anyway, this movie will make a lot of cash at the box office and of course the merchandise empire and sales will rise a lot higher.I guess most of the 'oldschool' fans of ST will go into the cinema with the hope to see something good but most will be disappointed - again. But maybe the 'youngsters' really like the new movies, maybe those who grew up with the first trilogy are grown too old for such kinds of movies, I don't know.Anyway, okay for easy and mindless entertainment: watch to complete the duty of your fandom.",6,1,2,15 December 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," Great Piece

The Evil Dead," Of Horny Woods & Chainsaws
","Naturally, I should wait till I write my review number 666, but it would take too long ;)Sam Raimi's Evil Dead and Evil Dead II belong like Romero's Dawn of the Dead to the great (forbidden fruits, I was too young to watch those pieces officially but I did it anyway - I dare to say that my bad VHS copy of a VHS copy of a copy made the movie even more 'devilish' and precious to me) pleasures of my young life then, and still, from time to time, I rewatch these masterpieces of entertaining horrors. The Evil Dead movies combine demonic horror, splatter, gore and elements of comedy with great skill and I guess every director who ever made a horror-comedy movie after did watch those two movies. For me, the first one of the trilogy of the deadnites is the best one.Bruce Campbell played the role of his life in those movies and with the new show Ash vs. Evil Dead, he is on top as a B-movie actor again.",8,0,2,23 September 2017

Into the Wild," With Self-Righteousness into the Grave
","The movie is well shot, got some nice nature in it, and well, some claim this guy to be a hero, but for me he (or better, the character in the movie) is just a self-righteous prick, one of those guys who know everything better, have the right intentions and if one does not comply and such a guy is in power he will burn you as a witch.Anyway, this guy died a silly death, because, well, he was even too 'intelligent' to learn something basic about nature - what kind of plants you may eat and what kind you better leave alone. Na, if you got the right intention you may eat everything. But let's face it, nature got one basic rule: survival of the fittest. The guy didn't stand the test - I am not claiming that I would be ready for living out in the wild, but at least I know my limits and if I would dare such an experiment/experience I would do some (lots of) preparation. A hero!? No. Imho more a candidate in need of professional mental health care - living in the wild is harsh, unforgiving and laborious, not the romantic bulls++t this guy got somehow in his mind (maybe too much Jack London is to blame). The movie is not bad and well shot and got good actors, but I got one main trouble and mixed feelings with Into the Wild, the movie is imo trying to make a hero of someone who was everything but a hero and with professional help, he would maybe be still alive. But in the end, who cares!?",4,5,7,26 October 2017
"Girl, Interrupted"," Am I sane or am I crazy?
","Great cast (Winona Ryder, Angelina Jolie, Brittany Murphy, Clea DuVall, Vanessa Redgrave and others) and an perceptive and intense story about mental illness and coming of age.

Elysium," Blabla In Wonderland
","Elysium got fine actors, a pro production and a fine setting - the thing that makes Elysium a rather disappointing movie is the cheesy script. The allegory to our times just shows that the story presented is some humanistic romantic blabla (yeah, of course you got medical care for billions of people in space...) - and this is the (big) difference between e.g. Blade Runner and Elysium.Because of the candy store story a rather mixed experience.",5,1,3,12 December 2018
La La Land," Not Bad but no Milestone
","I like musicals but I must say I am a little disappointed by this one. Sometimes it is easier to make your verdict if you compare two movies of the same genre to get your opinion straight - Baz Luhrmans Moulin Rouge is imo in every aspect superior to La La Land: the story more drama, the music, singing and dancing superior, also the settings and visuals - superior. Imo first of all the story of La La Land is - mediocre and so are the characters. The story of La La Land is more of a soap opera than drama and so it lacks of depth, and for a comedy, well I miss the elements of comedy mostly. I like Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone a lot as actors but compared to the performances and chemistry of Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman they just look mediocre - I mean Kidman dying in the arms of McGregor is more worth than all of La La Land.Also if I compare La La Land with Sweeney Todd it loses - the story, the characters of the latter are just far more interesting, I didn't liked the music of Sweeney Todd a lot but at least the story was interesting and captivating enough to hold my attention. In La La Land I wasn't emotionally invested into the characters and in the music at all. Ofc I am no lover of Jazz but I remember that the movie Whiplash about the drumming kid got me invested and I liked the passion and stuff conveyed by the maestro teaching his classes and the young talented guy. I also liked the tunes. Also another recent musical Les Misérables with Jackman, Crowe and Hathaway beats La La Land easy. Okay I know, Les Misérables is a classic but the execution is just superb. Imho La La Land plays in the league of Into The Woods (Kendrick, Streep & Chris Pine), latter got its problems with the story but imo the tunes and singing performances are still a notch better. So all in all I would say for a musical, the music, the dancing, the story is okayish, the acting good, but La La Land I would only recommend for lovers of the genre who must see them all. If someone would ask me what musical he or she should watch for an introduction to the musical genre La La Land would not be on my list, or well, far from the top. Tbh - if this is Oscar material it just shows imo that the quality of recent Hollywood outputs don't belong to the best. Ryan and Emma both already have done much better movies before.",6,9,15,17 January 2017
Saw," Hot Dance of Horror
","This is the one that you got to watch from the whole Saw franchise: some unique ideas, some gore, some suspense. The 2nd movie is also a good one, but not as strong as the first one. After Saw 2 the stories told got more and more confusing and repetitive and boring.Saw: unique and a fresh approach on the art of horror at the time first published.",7,1,2,31 March 2019
A Clockwork Orange," One of Kubrick's Finest
","I re-watched this piece of pure excellence lately and it is still an outstanding movie - the story alone is such an unique one, comparable maybe only with The Rocky Horror Picture Show and a few others. Such movies are really a very rare thing.I don't know if Mr. Kubrick was a genius, but only very few directors have made such impressive and outstanding movies. Sadly, for us the audience, he did not make any movies between 1988-1999 - for sure he would have made some more fine pieces.One of the most unique movies ever.",10,3,4,31 October 2018
Where Eagles Dare," Great Epic War Action
","Where Eagles Dare is something like a Mission Impossible movie 'embedded' into a WW II scenario. Anyway, we get Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood, a fine and massive production and lots of action. No serious (anti)-war movie but a highly recommended action movie. Where Eagles Dare is like The Guns of Navarone, The Train and The Bridge of Remagen and others, one of those fine war movies of the 60s that I still like to watch from time to time.Last note: it's funny how some people claim they have some expertise and are too lazy or whatever to use google before writing their 'wisdom' - the Germans HAD helicopters (a few) in WW II. Just google Flettner-282, if you don't believe it. Superficial knowledge is one of the trademarks of our modern social media times, I guess...",8,3,5,10 October 2019
From Hell," Ripping Good
","Fine dark gothic horror woven around the mystery of Jack the Ripper and his murders. What I like most - besides the suspenseful story - is the great cinematography, the visual style of From Hell and the tone of melancholy around the main character (Inspector Frederick Abberline), and also the ending is not your typical Hollywood sugar-candy one. From Hell belongs like Sleepy Hollow or The Ninth Gate to one of the good and unique movies Mr. Depp did before he got stuck in Sparrow Wonderland.",8,1,1,23 September 2019
Don't Breathe," Brain Lobotomized Heroes Drag
","***contains BIG spoiler*** I like the movie but it got some flaws which dragged Don't Breathe down for me - how difficult can it be to maneuver and knock out a blind guy!? For one million dollar I would dare my life at stake and show it on a live show how it's done - fast and easy (ninjas ofc excluded). At least down in the basement it would be an easy task (lots of tools for weapons and hiding spots etc.) - to the movie makers: if the blind guy shoots a gun down in the basement he would loose inevitable at least temporarily his only sense to spot the intruders - his ears would be deafened, gunfire makes some certain noises I think and especially in a small surrounding with walls around, well, I leave the conclusion to you guys... Back to the movie: one of the major traps many horror movies fall in is the dumbness of the protagonists which take out a lot of the fun (at least for me) - if it's not intended like in a horror-comedy. I remember watching a movie called Shuttle where a group of young boys and girls get kidnapped (the girls should be sold as sex-slaves or sth like that). One of the girls had at least 3 times the chance to kill the kidnapper/slave-trader - as the girl was in the end sold and departed to her cruel destiny I just thought: well, you kinda deserved it honey. So if you don't mind to watch some VERY incapable dudes getting hunted by a blind guy you get a good cast, production value etc. and a lot of suspense (not much nonsense in this movie, it hits right to the point of the movie). With less dumb acting characters I would have rated the movie 7 or even 8 (if you are able to put out your why-they-just-don't-do-this-or-try-that-button off in your head), cuz I couldn't put off the button to ignore the mostly stupid actions of our heroes the brain-lobotomized-dumbness-factor dragged the movie down to a 6 for me. Btw - one way to get the blind man confused would have been to put every single radio and machine in the house on, or get some tools in your hand and just throw it into another corner or another room if he comes near you etc. pp. - why playing the old mans game in trying to be silent and outwit his sharpened hearing-sense ;) Also the end - the kitty-room in the basement, all the DNA and stuff (a girl disappears and no cop dropped by to the blind man's house to check just in case, you know, cuz the very girl was involved in some accident killing this very man's daughter!?) and the blind guy gets away with it!? No way (but it's a horror movie, so you need a twist at the end lalala). Imo a very dumb end on top and so the final verdict: this movie plays not in the ivory league of horror shows. And to the movie makers - don't you dare to make a sequel where the blind guy is hunting our surviving girl in some dark woods or in New York!",6,2,6,15 October 2016
Beauty and the Beast," The Rich & Ugly
","I read a fine comment on the story of The Beauty and the Beast - that the moral boiled down leaves us with the conclusion that 'if you are rich you can be ugly but you can still get married to a beautiful woman'. Well, if I would have a hang to be a conspiracy theorist I would argue that the story was invented - or more likely commissioned - by ugly, old rich men to teach women that 'the beauty lies within' ;)Anyway, after I have now filled some lines required back to the movie - this version of The Beauty and the Beast feels like La La Land to me: not really bad but far away from being an outstanding or a new classic. If you like musicals you may watch it, if you don't watch it you won't miss much. Music, setting, directing, acting, everything okayish. If I would have to use one word for labeling the movie, that's it: okayish.Conclusion: the best Disney movies are still animations. On the other fields, be it Star Wars, Johnny Depp's pirating or Mad Hatting, or this movie, the outputs are mediocre, predictable - redundant. Frozen for example easy beats imho everything Disney produced recently with real actors and you have the advantage that you can give a real singer's voices to the animated characters, my wish: for the next couple of years, no more actors singing, let them act and not bore me to hell - if I wanna hear an amateur's voice I take a shower ;) Next.",4,3,6,17 May 2017
Sicario," The King is Dead, Long Live the King
","I re-watched Sicario lately and well, it is still a fine piece of a movie. A great cast with Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin and the great Benicio Del Toro, a good story, a good directing, and a top production.This movie gives us a really dark glimpse into the world of the big bizz of drug-trafficking and the war against drugs and its kings. Dark, outstanding and a must-see. One of the best movies in the past few years regarding the genre of crime and drama with a good shot of action.",8,1,2,19 February 2018
The Descent," The Crave For Flesh and Blood
","First time I watched The Descent I was really surprised by its quality and intense survival horror. Some years released before man beating up girls went wild on the screen, our heroines are fighting for survival into the deep of the earth against unknown hungry creatures.Good production, good acting and directing and a plot/story without unnecessary distractions and fillers make this one a hell of a joyride of 'survival of the fittest.'Good.",7,0,1,8 November 2018
Pulp Fiction," Top One
","I watched Pulp Fiction at least a dozen times, and imo this is Quentin Tarantino's best, sadly he never reached that kind of masterclass again.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," 2nd Great Strike
","After being disappointed by many seconds (Deadpool, Kingsman to name a few) I was really happy that Vol. 2 of the Guardians matches up to the first movie.

In Time," One More Time On The Run
","Well, the time thing is stolen, or maybe a bow to Logan's Run, but anyway, the movie is well produced, got some charismatic actors (good: Justin Timberlake, Amanda Seyfried, nice chemistry) and still here and there a little fine idea.Gattaca, also directed by Andrew Niccol, is the better and more interesting movie, but In Time, even if it's no masterpiece, is no fail but a solid contribution to the sci-fi genre regarding dystopian stories.",7,2,3,12 December 2018
The Happening," Suicide Mission on a Great Scale
","Nice flick with an interesting premise (all reviewers stating this is not realistic etc. etc. - this is a mystery/sci-fi flick and not a documentary). Yes, the movie is in no field outstanding (acting, directing, production etc.) but entertaining anyway. The Happening belongs for sure not to the best movies I ever watched, but also for sure not to the bad ones. If the premise/story sounds interesting to you, just give it a try - it won't kill you ;)",6,1,1,25 May 2019
The Shape of Water," Of Loving a Centaur
","Well, in our modern times it is enough to retell the story of The Beauty and the Beast or The Frog Prince to get a lot of pats on one's 'super-creative' shoulder, and on top even some Oscars. 
Hmpf... Maybe I should quit my daily job and rewrite Cinderella - this time the Prince is still a human being (not sure maybe the prince should be a princess!?) but Cinderella lets say is a female Centaur and on top I serve this fine new inventive ueber-creative super-story with some (lots of) CGI-tricking. (note to myself: add some super-creepy evil white dudes! And don't forget to add some minorities, of course all good, intelligent and lovable!)Ah, I can already see myself standing before the finest of all Hollywood getting tons of Oscars and zillions of money filling my pockets. And all the famous wanna play in my next movie! Well, done Tweetienator! Finally , you made it!Tweetienator says: The Shape of Water - nothing special or innovative and far from the quality of Del Torro's real masterpiece Pan's Labyrinth. Not too bad but nothing really good. An Oscar or some for this flick - poor Hollywood.",4,31,59,7 March 2018
The Fountain," A Never-ending Fountain of Inspiration
","The Fountain is the one movie that made me aware of the existence of a director named Darren Aronofsky. He is one of those directors who make even the best skilled actors better and he inspired (or directed) Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz to make some of their best and most remarkable performances in their career. (I will never forget how Aronofsky reanimated the actor Mickey Rourke in The Wrestler).The Fountain is fantastic, poetic, truly creative and a trip into a dimension of movie making only very rare movies ever reach.

Pro production, pro acting, some really good fine ideas - one of the few zombie-comedies that really work and imho Zombieland is a standard if not the standard of the genre of zombie-comedies. Good actors, good fun - if you like the zombie/walker universe I bet you already watched the movie, if not, take a bite and watch.",8,0,0,3 April 2018
War of the Worlds," Not That Bad At All
","This movie seems to polarize the audience - in my view the remake of War of the Worlds is a modern blockbuster interpretation, means that the movie is made for a mass/mainstream audience (like Independence Day for example).What you get is a pro production and solid acting + some really fine visuals: all in all no masterpiece but in no way such a miss like many reviews claim.",8,1,3,12 December 2018
All Quiet on the Western Front," Where Only the Shells Sing
","Besides Kubrick's Path to Glory imo the best movie on WWI and one of the best (anti-)war movies of all time.The true excellence of this movie is not only in the war scenes and the acting but in the characterization of the soldier's nature and the nature of war. On top, you get a feel for the war of the trenches - without bombastic and shallow theatrical music like recently in Nolan's (imo far overrated) 'drama' Dunkirk who tries to make drama with dramatic music where enough drama already should be. The only 'sound-effects' in All Quiet on the Western Front are those of war - the screams of the soldiers, the 'singing' of flying shells and the many explosions and the sounds of guns. Whereas the remake with 'Sonnyboy' Richard Thomas (playing Paul Baumer) from 1979 is also a good one, the adaption from 1930 of Erich Maria Remarque's epic is imo the more intense and superior one. Fantastic movie, especially for all young who never watched this piece, watch.",9,5,5,23 March 2018

There Will Be Blood," Tough, Rough And Anything But Sweet
","There Will Be Blood - an excellent epic about long gone times (around 1900), with Daniel Day-Lewis showing one of his best performances.Yes, the movie is hard and almost all the characters in the movie depicted are tough and rough and not very likable, but those were the times and such people those times formed.If you want a glimpse into another time and the story of people living and fighting in that world, There Will Be Blood is for you, if you want sugar-candy and a Walt Disney kind of cake, avoid this movie at all costs.",9,0,1,7 December 2018
Joker," Not the Gotham We Know
","Joker is a great movie with a great performing Joaquin Phoenix and all in all the movie is a really fine piece of a drama. But, and this is a big but, the Joker and story of the movie (Wayne Senior a rich numbhead, Clown movement as a civil outrage - here we get all the modern zeitgeist and pc stuff again, and of course bad and bullying guys wear suits etc.) does not fit into the canon of Batman and Gotham City. The 'real' Joker you rather get in the new animation show Harley Quinn (a good one!) - I just cannot detect much of the genius evil madness of the 'old' Joker in Phoenix's one. As a drama I would rate Joker 8 or even 9 but as it is sold to us as a Joker movie 6 it is.Last note: if you are able to shut down all the stuff you know about Gotham, Batman and the real Joker, you will enjoy Phoenix's Joker, if not, you probably won't that much.",6,3,4,11 January 2020
Edge of Tomorrow," Fun to Watch
","Great actioner with some fine twists and fine moments of humor. Like Oblivion I liked to watch the Edge of Tomorrow and especially in the first half the humor elements are well done, and Cruise and Blunt play not only well but have indeed a fine chemistry together.My only critic aims at the fact of this Alpha-Looping - it just won't work this way. Why!? Well, the one rational thing for the Omega to do is to kill an Alpha himself if someone breaks into whatever security perimeter. Think about it - the day would restart and as the Alpha and the Omega know about the powers the next attempt of an attack would be just futile. 2nd thought: in a battlefield of an Earth-scale even if there are only one Alpha in six-million units a battle for a planet would be an operation of all eternity. Why!? In the end, mankind would use nuclear weapons for the last stand. The loss of Alphas and a restart forever would be unavoidable.Well, enough critical thoughts - this movie is certainly for every sci-fi- and action fan indeed a very pleasant gem to watch.",9,0,1,22 August 2017
Downfall," Perfect Downfall
","Downfall is, like Das Boot (1981), one of the best movies about WWII in Europe - a great production, a great cast and directing make the last days of the 3rd Reich tangible for the audience - without Kitsch or too much lecturing. And last but not least, the great performance by Bruno Ganz as the Fuehrer, Adolf Hitler, refine the work.Great and fantastic, and in comparison, one can see how mediocre and bad that last Oscar-awarded Kitsch by Mr. Nolan (Dunkirk) is.Downfall: outstanding and almost perfect, like Schindler's List, Das Boot, and a very few other movies on WWII, which are not just action-driven war movies..",10,0,1,10 November 2018

Army of Darkness," Long Live Evil Dead
","First time watching Army of Darkness I was a little disappointed - too much comedy elements/parts for my taste back then. Anyway, after I got this one on DVD and gave it another try I liked it a lot. Now Army of Darkness belongs like all the other Evil Dead movies to my 'evergreens' of the horror bizz. Of course, I also like the great Ash vs. Evil Dead show mucho and the remake by Fede Alvarez (2013).",8,2,2,7 December 2019
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Real Gothic Horror Style
","A fantastic cast, a fantastic director, a fantastic story. Coppola's Dracula is for me one of the best versions of Bram Stoker's bloodthirsty antihero, the Count Dracula - the imagery of the movie is just magic and true to its bone 'gothic' and I dare to say that Bram Stoker would be very pleased by this adaption: as Dracula is a Gothic horror novel the movie is a Gothic horror movie.Last but not least, the whole cast is just well picked: Gary Oldman, Anthony Hopkins, Winona Ryder, Keanu Reeves and even the actors of the minor roles just play superbly.Bram Stokers Dracula, Interview with a Vampire, Byzantium, Let me in (both), and Polański's The Fearless Vampire Killers (I know its a comedy) are some of my most favorite vampire movies ever. But this one for sure is a classic of modern movie-making with a unique visual imagery - a movie worth your time, like contemplating a painting of one of the old maestros.",10,1,3,13 November 2017

","The Green Mile is one of the few very good adaptions of a Stephen King story/book. On the side of killer movies like Shining, Carrie, The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile is one of those few King based movies that I still like to re-watch from time to time. The story, the settings, the cast - everything is a most delicious and entertaining joy (hell) ride.",8,0,0,27 April 2020
Jaws," That's How You Do It
","After watching that terrible mess called The Meg I re-watched Jaws and after watching I just wondered - why the hell those script writers, directors and producers don't watch such a movie and analyse it before starting a similar project!? Maybe this effort takes too much brains and patience!?Jaws is in almost every aspect (well, of course they got no cgi) superior to The Meg, and whereas the idea of a mega shark got potential the implementation of that idea does not.Anyway, Jaws is one of those iconic movies of the horror genre like Shining, the original The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, The Exorcist, and a few others, and rightly it is so.",8,0,1,19 September 2018
The Wrestler," Wrestling With Life
","Mickey Rourke's resurrection as an actor by playing Randy 'The Ram' Robinson in The Wrestler. A great piece about aging, loneliness, regrets, and finally atonement, reconciliation, finding peace and dignity.Darren Aronofsky shows us life as it is with characters from everyday life on the 'loser's sidewalk' of life. A great drama embedded in the world of the circus of small-scale wrestling, trailer parks, and small town suburbs and small dreams. The Wrestler, next to The Fountain my favorite movie of Mr. Aronofsky. Masterpiece.",9,2,2,8 March 2018
Kong: Skull Island," Fast-Food from the Clone Factory
","I will make it short - this movie is imo no total fail but no cinematic triumph either and also not a good one. But if you enjoy the movies of Mr. Emmerich you will like this one also - lots of explosions, here and there some humorous scenes, some (cgi-)monsters and ofc King Kong and last but not least, tons of inconsistencies and forgettable 2-dimensional characters. So if you like Independence Day, The Day After Tomorrow, 2012 etc. watch this version of King Kong, if you don't like such movies, skip this one. Summa summarum: another waste of a fantastic character like the last Tarzan endeavor.p.s. sometimes I suspect Hollywood got some script-generating- algorithm developed and saves the money for writers, of such generic 'quality' are many of the Hollywood products of past years, Skull Island is another proof of this theory ;)",4,17,32,8 April 2017
Murder on the Orient Express," Not Black, not White, but Grey
","I am a great fan of most of the movie adaptions of Agatha Christie's stories, e.g. Murder on the Orient Express (1974), Death on the Nile (1978) or Evil Under the Sun (1982) and all the other stories around Miss Marple, and I even read some of the books.First of all - Peter Ustinov and Albert Finney beat Kenneth Branagh in the role of Hercule Poirot. Kenneth Branagh is not doing a bad job, but the other two just play imo the role of the Belgian mastermind more convincing and with more charisma and with a finer, more delicate humor. 
2nd: even as the cast of the remake is filled with nowadays famous actors they cannot compete with actors like Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Sean Connery or Anthony Perkins (just to name a few of cast from the 1974 adaption of Murder on the Orient Express).As the story is known the only outstanding 'merits' of this remake are the implements of the issue of racism (for some historical reasons imo poorly implemented and presented). An easy way nowadays to get some applause and attention. As the story doesn't gives you the chance to hide behind Fx and action-scenes the attention of the audience is focused mostly on the actors/acting. Well, they all do are decent job, but imo nothing outstanding.Conclusion: Kenneth Branagh's remake is no pain in the a** but no 'must-see'. If I would have to choose for an evening movie to watch between Sidney Lumet's or Kenneth's movie, I would re-watch the classic from 1974. Recommendable for fans of the involved actors like Depp, Ridley, Cruz, Dafoe etc. and Kenneth himself of course. To the younger audience who may not know the version from 1974 - give the old one a chance at your home cinema.",4,2,2,25 January 2018
Arrival," Sci-Fi !?
","Hollywood needs new ideas or new writers - Arrival is a kind of a mix of Gravity (heroine lost her only child, personal drama) and Interstellar (writers mess up with space and time) and what we mainly get is Amy Adams trying to talk to aliens (wasn't there something called Childhood's End!?) and almost no action at all but at least a couple of aliens (who reminded me a little like those ones in Monsters). But to be honest every Agathe Christie movie has me more captivated in solving the puzzle (of the crime) or watching an Miss Marple or Hercule Poirot in doing so as our heroes in Arrival trying to decipher the messages of the aliens. Arrival is sci-fi of the kind that is more about a political correct agenda (don't fear the alien, this ingredient they took from District 9) as real sci-fi or even entertainment - I would prefer almost every sci-fi B-movie from the 50s with laser guns and stuff to this one who tries to be something like 2001 but fails heavy like Interstellar. To put it simply - the writers of Arrival are not in the league of Phillip K. Dick or Isaac Asimov and the like. This is 'sci-fi' for the political correct audience (almost no violence and in the end all humans wonderously get into some human-world-brotherhood, as if all the conflicts and crimes just would disappear because of some aliens arrival) and like p.c it is: mostly boring. On top some of the talk about the difficulties to talk to aliens is almost zero science or at least only on a very basic level which everyone with some brains could tell you without studying anything. Alone the assumption of our heroes, that the aliens don't expect that the first of all questions of the humans to them will be something like 'what do you want or what do you intend to do?' is so dumb - I mean those guys know humans have had no contact to other 'outsiders' before and they travel the space so they are not dumb like apes - they will approach humans like apes and will know what kind of confusion etc. they had produced with their landings. And the regular cliché that the U.S. military or CIA or whatever organization of the government has no own specialists regarding communication with foreign cultures etc. is super-dumb. Another p.c. stuff: almost every movie nowadays has a woman as hero to save the world or to boss around etc. pp., I just wait for the first African-American transgender woman to save or conquer the world or Ethan Hunt returns after an operation as a woman ;) But the worst is that the makers of Arrival have imo forgotten the main reason why you make movies: entertainment. And no, I don't need action to be entertained, I watched Polanskis Carnage and I was Extremely entertained without one explosion or shot done. All the real classics and masterpieces of sci-fi like 1984, Dark Star, Logans Run, Soylent Green and the many others raise big questions in science and philosophy etc. but they also ENTERTAIN great. Arrival is everything but big in entertaining - e.g. Oblivion with Cruise is a masterpiece compared to Arrival. This I say with a heavy heart because I especially like Amy Adams as an actress (this is one positive aspect of the movie, her performance ofc is good). What else left to say!? I just hope that in the next movie of Ridleys Alien-saga the aliens and humans don't have something like cuddly or encounter groups to solve their 'communication' problems :DNote: If I would be a producer or writer I would make a persiflage-movie about the p.c.-movment with a hero like an African-American homosexual transgender of Jewish origin who is mentally challenged and sits in a wheelchair but is the best and most lethal special commando of the USA (with Trump as President) - the story would be executed in the tradition of Naked Gun with a good shot of Rambo brutality.",4,4,10,17 January 2017
The Conjuring," Fine Horror
","One of my favorite horror movies of the past few years regarding evil spirits/demons. Superb acting by all actors, and Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are just unbelievable believable in their roles as a couple hunting and fighting satanic forces. The Conjuring is a roller-coaster-ride of suspense and horrors and if more movies of the genre would have such good acting, production, and high-octane horror-level, horror movies would rule the universe like Emperor Ming.Even if you usually don't like or watch horror movies, this one, you should watch.Note: the 2nd movie is also a good one but not so impressive and nerve-racking.",8,0,0,15 September 2017
Halloween," The Evil Within
","One of Carpenter's fine moments - together with all those classics he directed like The Thing, Escape From New York, The Fog, Assault on Precinct 13, or Dark Star just to name a few.Halloween defines together with the first installments of Friday the 13th (1980) and A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) the slasher genre - but there is, of course, also Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre to mention, which was four years earlier in 1974 released. All those movies are iconic on their own and (still) outstanding contributions to the horror genre.Halloween: still a fine gem (together with its continuation Halloween II) - even if the gore level is rather low compared to new productions, but the violence somehow 'feels' the more realistic.",7,0,0,21 October 2018
Wonder Woman," Prepubertal Massproduct
","The movie is not a real disaster, and a younger audience may even like it, but for me it is just the 1.000.000st superhero-movie. The plot set in WWI is super-dumb, generic, and well, Gal Gadot is very pretty. The first hour felt really loong stretched and extremely boring. The rest of the movie is just boring and the fighting scenes are all a terrible awful composed overloaded cgi-feast. How this movie gets such a high rate, and especially even by the IMDb staff is a mystery to me. But lately, I noticed that many movies I didn't like at all were rated high by IMDb staff - Wonder Woman got a 8.0 and the last King Arthur a 7.7 by IMDb staff. Really!? For comparison - a masterpiece like Apocalypse Now is rated 8.4 by IMDb staff. King Arthur and Wonder Woman are not even on the same planet as the dark vision of Mr. Coppola.For me IMDb loses it's creditability rapidly. Wonder Woman like King Arthur - mediocre movies at best. A rating of 8 or higher!? Ridiculous.Some reviewers call this the best D.C. output so far - well, if this is the best D.C. can do, the company should pull back from movie bizz and focus on publishing comics again.But I will confess, if I would be still aged around 10 or 12 I maybe would like Wonder Woman more.Last but not least, the main theme, the setting of a woman fighting in the trenches of WWI is just a recycled idea - Mr. Zack Snyder did this already in Sucker Punch and the execution of the fighting scene there is zillion times better done. Even too lazy to write an original script for such a big production... Disappointing.Anti-Fake-Rate: 1 Real rate: 5",1,3,13,1 July 2017
Paths of Glory," Of the Madness of War
","An outstanding movie about the terrors of war (WWI) - one of Kubrick's best moments (well, one could argue he just had 'best moments', I admit). If you like to watch movies about war, this one should be on top of your list. Timeless classic.",9,0,2,27 October 2018
Carrie," Blood Speaks
","Carrie is like Shining another masterpiece of the horror genre and both those movies have something in common: they are based on a work by Stephen King, and last but not least, they belong to the rather thin line of outstanding to well-made movie-adaptions of Mr. King's work.What else!? The director is Brian De Palma (well done!) and Sissy Spacek plays Carrie outstanding and most memorable. The iconic scene where she is covered in blood and pure terror/madness shows on her face I will never forget.Belongs on the must-watch list of every guy and gal and whatever who wants to be taken seriously as a lover of the arts of horror.p.s. the remake (2013) with Chloë Grace Moretz in lead is not a bad one (my rate a 6), but can't beat the original. The original is imo far more serious in tone and somehow depressing, and got more impact on the audience.",8,1,1,7 December 2018
1408," The Haunted Room
","Sadly, many movies or shows based on the works of Mr. King are of bad to very bad or at best mediocre quality, only a very few are exceptions and good conversions. 1408 belongs to the later - yes, it is certainly no new Shining or Carrie but it is a good movie with lots of suspense, fine acting, some nice effects and some fine killing and thrilling moments. Good.",7,0,1,10 May 2019
The Woman in Black," Haunting Good
","The Woman in Black is a really fine contribution to the Haunted House genre. Intense atmosphere and a good cast, fine production that cares for the details (the house alone - I would move in without second thought, of course with all necessary preparations: shotgun, chainsaw, garlic and some more convenient tools would move in with me), and Daniel Radcliffe, who once again shows that he is more than Harry Potter for lifetime.As I did not know much about the movie before I watched it, I was really pleasantly surprised, as many newer movies of the genre are not very 'haunting' - many of those movies lack of atmosphere, thrill, the 'right feel', but this one won't disappoint you. Like The Others (Nicole Kidman) or The Awakening (Rebecca Hall) a good one.",7,0,1,23 February 2018
The Silence of the Lambs," Timeless Classic

The performances of Anthony Hopkins and Jody Forster are stellar and unforgetable - an (almost) perfect movie.",9,0,0,21 January 2019
Black Panther," Pink Panther is the True King
","The story of Black Panther is an ueber-generic-bubble, zillion times already told (wow, a villain wants to conquer a kingdom!), boosted with some CGI, some good, some mediocre, but like e.g. the new Star Trek s*ht called Discovery the magic is gone, and my brain melts almost into nothingness watching that kind of stuff called blockbuster today.Btw: a panther is always black. So a black panther is a tautology if I remember my terminology right. There are no white, green or red panthers in the to mankind known universe, there is only one exception I know about, and that's the famous Pink Panther! And he beats the Black Panther easy in humor, in storytelling, even the grade of violence is superior ;)I suspect there is a global conspiracy to kill all of mankind by boredom or mutate us into brain-dead zombies. But for my redamption and safety of my sanity I got some copies of Pink Panthers great adventures.Final words: Ceterum censeo Carthaginem esse delendam (Cato, the Elder).",4,60,134,17 February 2018
Mother!," Mixed Experience
","I really have mixed feelings about Mother. Strong are the performances of the main actors: Jennifer Lawrence, Javier Bardem, Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer. They all shine like Jodie Foster, Kate Winslet, John C. Reilly and Christoph Waltz did in Polanski's Carnage. But whereas Polanski provides us an 'everyday story' with a fine psychological analysis and a well-choreographed rise of tensions between the protagonists, unmasking neuroses and deeper layers of the involved characters, leaving a lot of room for the actors and their skills, Darren Aronofsky drowns the great cast and wastes their fine performances in an unbelievable and absurd story overloaded with (imo) pseudo-intellectual symbolism with a really plain 'outcome'. Mr. Aronofsky directed some of my favorite movies - The Fountain, The Wrestler, Black Swan, and whereas I didn't like Noah the first time watching it, the 2nd time I liked that one too. But Mother!? I don't believe watching it a 2nd or 3rd time will change anything: the story is for my taste too artificial and of course, if you read some surrealist's poetry you can find tons of layers and of possible interpretations (projections of the reader etc.), same I guess with this movie, but for me the mixture of symbolism, drama, some elements of horror and thriller and Genesis just doesn't work out well - the whole movie I was annoyed by the unbelievable and stupid behavior of the protagonists (even if they are just 'symbolic') and some 'stuff' happening felt just out of place. Also if I try to interpret Mother with the help of the Old Testament (like some reviewers indicate) this just does not work well for me - if Bardem is God and Lawrence is sth like Mother Earth or 'Life', such concept is unknown to the Genesis or to the Holy Bible (alone the idea/concept that 'Mother Earth' can suffer or has a personality is just a projection, and here imo Mr. Aronofsky, the atheist, misunderstands or misinterprets the Christian concept of God, as nature is nothing but God himself), and if I got to rewrite the Genesis so the characters somehow fit in, I could also use, let's say Shakespeares Hamlet as a reference for interpretation and do the same. (Alone that the audience must know the Genesis to make such connections, just imagine someone watching the movie without knowing anything about the Genesis, imo a great fail, good symbolistic codes should be universally applicable). Sadly I must state: this is the first fail of the greatly talented Darren Aronofsky. And I have the mild 'feel' that the very (well hidden) message or lecture of the movie is just one of the usual esoteric texture of romanticism - man fails to achieve Eden because he is too selfish, greedy etc. pp.So what is the essence of the movie!? That life is a cycle!? That people behave like they do because they are people and do the same mistakes again and again!? Wow, a lot of noise to make such a plain statement... Final words: a great packaging (acting) but also pretentious with a shallow content. A rate of 4 - but only because the great actors saved Mother! from being a disaster.",4,1,2,7 December 2017
Blade Runner," Timeless Classic
","A truly fantastic masterpiece with great performances by Harrison Ford, Daryl Hanna and Rutger Hauer (+ the entire cast).

In short: one fine piece of a movie for all eternity and maybe Mr. Scott's best one.",10,1,2,10 November 2019
Ben-Hur," Best of the Best
","I don't know how many times I watched this movie but every time I enjoyed it deeply, imho Ben Hur is one of the best movies ever made.Everything is top-notch, everything is perfect - acting, directing, production, like Alien for the horror/sci-fi genre, this one is a milestone, and no matter what, this movie will always be a gem on the crown of movie-making. Ben Hur is one of the very few movies I have no idea how I would improve it. With Ben Hur Charlton Heston found immortality.",10,2,2,22 September 2017
Identity," Excellent
","I rewatched Identity lately and it is still a fine movie - of course, watching first time without knowing the twist is an experience you don't get a second time.

Lucy," Lucy Simply Rocks
","I like this one a lot - good production, a fine cinematography, plus lots of well 'composed' action scenes and a fantastic Scarlett Johansson. The story of course is one of pure fantasy but Luc Besson's movies mostly have that taste of ueber-life. Well done.",7,6,9,15 September 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The Force is Undead
","So many possibilities to tell stories following the event after killing the Emperor and Darth Vader in Episode VI - and what they opted for!? A re-telling of Episode IV (a lost droid with a ofc important map in his memory, a deathstar again blabla). This is now the 3rd destroyed Deathstar - the engineers of the imperial troops seems to me are not very capable of learning how to secure a Deathstar and the script-writers are in an immense lack of imagination or not daring or probably both. This time a whole planet is the gun - what's next!? Must the rebells/resistance destroy a whole galaxy to get rid of the 4th Deathstar!? Also what I don't like are the zillions of inconsistencies here - no cameras or motion trackers on the base, all the gates and doors open, u just have to push the button or walk through the ofc open gates, and remember the base is a whole planet but ofc the heroes just stumble over each other. Or all the intel the storm-trooper-traitor got about the Deathstar - I mean he was just a storm-trooper of low rank, how the f*** he would know how to bring a planetsized-weapon down!? So in a meeting this dude just says - ah you need a plan how to kill that thing!? Easy! And on top they take a captain of the stormtroopers hostage and she just shut down the shield, and no other commando-post is able to override the shutdown!? It's just ridiculous the more you think about it. Or the scene where the Millennium Falcon is (re)entered by Han Solo and Chewie- looks like the universe is a small neighborhood. Even in my hometown I wouldn't run by coincidence over one of my old cars... Really I try to think of sth I like in this movie - and there is nothing. literally nothing. i don't like all the 'humoresk' comments through the whole movie, I don't like that every scene has a equivalent scene in one of the old movies, the acting is mediocre, the action is mediocre, everything is predictable, the dialogs - well, never were a strength of the Star Wars movies. Rethinking all the fuss about Star Wars imo there are only two decent movies at all: IV and V, with VI (the Ewoks...) the decline already began. Episode I to III were stuff made for kids (I mean little kids)- droids with humor and afraid of being shot I expect and enjoy (!) in comedy-movies like Wall-E - but not in a sci-fi context like Star Wars. Only III of that trilogy wasn't too bad. So if u didn't see VII already - wait till u can stream it or buy/lend on DVD (wait till its cheap), in a cinema I will never go again to watch a Star Wars movie. JJ Abrams did a great jobs with the 2 Star Trek movies and I hoped he would do great stuff again - but with this work he did a bad job. I know, I know he didn't wrote the script but he got enough influence to put the Star Trek franchise on the next level, why not Star Wars!? Well, how its done Miller showed with Mad Max Fury Road - I had to watch that one 3 times in a row - but this one I will never watch again.",4,10,12,23 March 2016
The Matrix," The Perfect Matrix
","1999 got some of my absolute favorite movies done: Fight Club and Matrix, American Beauty, Sleepy Hollow, Blair Witch, Girls Interrupted, Cruel Intentions and Sixth Sense. 1999, really a superb year for the cineaste. The first movie of the Matrix trilogy got not only a most imaginative story but also a style and cinematography that was at that time (and imo still is) most innovative. And of course unforgotten are Keanu Reeves as Neo, Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity and Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus, and last but not least, Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith.Lana Wachowski and Lilly Wachowski achieved nothing more than one of the modern classics with this movie. The following two movies of the Matrix universe are not that good, and I understand that some people argue that Matrix does not need additional parts or an expansion of the story told, but I like Reloaded and Revolutions anyway. Fight Club, Matrix, and Inception - for me some of the best fantasy/sci-fi movies ever made, like the first Alien movie and Blade Runner - modern movie-making at its best.",10,0,2,9 November 2017
Looper," Just Another Time-Travel Failing
","Well - I don't like time-travel-movies much because most of the time imo the writers screw the story up. But the high-ratings and the fine actors involved dared me to give the movie a try - and ofc it failed... Far too many holes to the plot (e.g. if the gangsters in the future got a time-travel machine there is no need for loopers at all, just think about it.) Also the movie didn't hold my attention well - too much dialogue for my taste which lead into the kingdom of sleepiness. The implementation of the mutant kid didn't make the story better at all. Another aspect are all the action scenes - uninspired and at best mediocre stuff. Summa summarum: imo one of the few good time-travel-movies is the original movie Time Machine of George Pal from 1960 with Rod Taylor in lead. If a director or writer wants to rise chances for making a bad movie - he/she makes one about time-travel.",4,2,3,10 January 2016
Life," Boy Scouts to the Front!
","I will make it short - what you get is Carpenter's The Thing playing on the ISS-Station.First the positive features: a good cast, good setting, cam and cgi- effects-department. Everything pro and well done, I mean we get Ryan Reynolds, Jake Gyllenhaal and Hiroyuki Sanada (he played the role of the Captain in Boyle's superb Sunshine!).The downers - an total unbelievable plot, to an extent that the hunt of the alien got ridiculous, which weakens the movie a lot for me. I rated 5. With a fine, well-crafted plot, especially not so many logical flaws and dumb actions from ppl who are in reality handpicked and well trained and tested but act in the movie so dumb that I have the feeling boy scouts would have done better.Without a with dumbness 'infected' crew this movie could have been a new classic of space-horror. With that major flaw Life is still a good one-time watch, but no new classic of the genre - sadly, I must add.",6,1,4,3 June 2017
Deadpool," Deadpool for President
","The basic story of Deadpool is in no way special - superhero against villain(s) etc., but despite the typical superhero-way-of-life Deadpool is one of the movies in the superhero vs villain cosmos that I really like a lot and will recommend with full heart for watching. First top ingredient - humor. Black one. For adults not for kids. Not only the violence but also the talking makes Deadpool a flick for a more mature audience (kids won't understand half of the jokes - fortunately one could say ;)) On top I didn't see many movies where watching killing (and the context how the killings are done) is so much fun - even if its not p.c. ;) Overlaying everything there is always the 'vibe' of not taking itself too serious which I guess I like so much. On the otherhand the action scenes show far more hard stuff as the typical Marvel/DC movie, even some gore. What more to say!? Fortunatly the director/writers dared to do things different with Deadpool also Ryan Reynolds is just a perfect match as Deadpool. A movie with a similar approach/mixture of humor and violence I remember is Kingsman: The Secret Service. Also a superb flick. So if there would be a presidential election in the superhero-world I would work for the campaign for Mr. Deadpool - so there's just one choice: Deadpool for president!",9,3,11,25 March 2016
Cloud Atlas," That One Grew On Me
","I confess, first time I watched Cloud Atlas in the cinema I wasn't too fond of the movie. A few years later, I bought the DVD and I watched it a few more times, and every time I liked it more.What you get is a fine epic piece with different stories interwoven into one great big painting. This is really an unusual piece of a movie and like Jupiter Ascending everything - acting, production etc. is well executed, but the story of Cloud Atlas is far more interesting and complex.Well, in my view, Matrix is still the masterpiece of the Wachowskis, but Cloud Atlas is for sure a like like.",8,0,0,7 December 2018

","Like the first Saw movie, Cube is a real fine watch - a unique idea/concept and a good production and decent acting make this one an entertaining and thrilling joy-ride, spiced up with some twists and psychological warfare. Nice one for the lover of horror and sci-fi alike. And after all those years still good.",8,1,2,7 September 2019
Green Book," A Way Too Simple Movie of Zeitgeist
","Most of the reviewers here state how important the message of the movie is. I will play the advocatus diaboli here: I don't care about the message of a movie without entertainment - in the first place by watching a movie I want to be entertained and not educated.Green Book is that kind of movie that you make in our times if you want the applause of today's Hollywood's p.c. crowd (remember Shape of the Water!?), add some known actors and you can grap easy some prices here and there. 2nd choice: make something about saving nature. Creativity!? Daring!? Uniqueness!? None.Anyway, the message of course is one already told many times before (e.g. The Intouchables, Driving Miss Daisy to name some obvious ones), but I admit the actors work well.Well, today's Hollywood crowd seems to be rather some bunch of social workers and educationalists than artists - by the way, I find it really somehow rather comical that those rich guys and gals try to tell me how to live to save nature, considering how many different estates/big houses and other stuff like cars and planes those people got. Just imagine for a moment in what kind of state the Earth would be if all 8 billion people on Earth would live that kind of life-style of those true lovers and preachers of Mother Earth...Back to Green Book: a rather mediocre and rather powerless movie (just compare it with a masterpiece like In the Heat of the Night) with some funny moments and solid acting, but with a story obviously fishing for compliments and applause - and some Oscars.",5,55,108,25 February 2019
Annihilation," Visual Candy Bar
","I can understand those reviews who state that Annihilation got some plot holes, or maybe issues of logic, but a good trip must not make 'sense' or must not be bound to logic.Anyway, the longer Annihilation rolls on the stronger and stronger grows the dense and mesmerizing and dark atmosphere of the movie, and the visuals are sometimes a really fine trip into wonderland.If I got something to complain, that would be about the rather obvious choice for the last twist, but anyway, supported by a strong cast (Portman and Leigh strong as always), Annihilation reminds me a little of Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain (2006) - you may or may not understand everything of those movies but still they are beautiful like a fine poetry or a fine painting. In my view it is always rather an indicator that some piece of art did something well and interesting, if the audience is divided in its evaluation/assessment.I like some of Alex Garlands stories/movies a lot (Sunshine, 28 Days Later, The Beach, Dredd) - so I like Annihilation. The Fountain got a straight 10 from me, Annihilation gets a well deserved 8.",8,1,2,26 May 2020

Gangs of New York," Of Butchering Bill
","Gangs of New York gets a lot of bad and harsh critics but I like this one a lot. It is for certain no movie with super deep story and it may not be historical accurate (I can't judge that because lack of knowledge) but it is imo an epic movie with a fine cast (Daniel Day-Lewis, Liam Neeson, John C. Reily, DiCaprio, Cameron Diaz and some more) and on top a perfect cinematography and big production.Again Martin Scorsese got me enchanted with this one (like with some of his later works: Shutter Island, The Departed, Hugo). Gangs of New York is maybe not one of his top works but beats easy 99% of all movies released in the categories drama and crime.Love, hate, revenge, crime, the fight for survival in a dark world - a movie the word epic is forged for.",9,5,7,3 March 2018
The Cabin in the Woods," In the Woods Always Hell Awaits
","The Cabin in the Woods seems to split the audience in people who like it and people who dislike it. But a rate of 1-3 of course is total nonsense: the movie is a comedy and therefore (like some reviewers stated) can't be 'abysmal' to the horror genre, well, it's no horror movie but a horror-comedy (even a parody)...What we get is a very pro production, a lot of references to different more or less iconic movies of the horror genre, a pro cast (Hemsworth, Connolly) and some indeed unique and funny ideas - how one can 'hate' this movie or give it a rating below 4 is really beyond my imagination.If you like horror-comedies, this one is certainly going to entertain you in a good way.",7,0,0,19 October 2018
Moon," The Man On The Moon
","Moon was a really pleasant surprise to me, as I watched the movie in the cinema without knowing anything at all about the movie but that is sci-fi and got something to do with the moon...The twist is not that surprising but the dense 'tone' or atmosphere of the movie is carried and refined by the great performance of Sam Rockwell. The story itself is interesting enough and we get here and there some obeisances (story-wise) to some classic sci-fi movies like Silent Running etc.Good.",8,2,4,22 November 2018
Her," Ueberfantastic
","This one took my by surprise - I went to the cinema only because a friend recommended this one to me and I did not read some review or story about the movie before I watched it. 
Her: a unique story told, superb actors with fine performances. Joaquin Phoenix plays the guy who falls in love with an operating system with so much finesse and convincing, without making the character of Theodore looking just ridiculous, which would have been the easy way to go. Alone Mr. Phoenix's performance is worth watching this fantastic movie. And last but not least, Mr. Spike Jonze should direct more movies.Recommendation for everyone who loves weird characters and sci-fi of the different kind.",8,0,0,9 January 2018
Mad Max: Fury Road," Superb Oldschool Action
","Well, I re-watched Mad Max: Fury Road again (5th or 6th time) and the movie stands the test of time - this is a hell of a trip and all those reviews who are negative don't understand one simple fact: this movie doesn't intend to be something else than it is - a postapocalyptic joyride on the wheels of hell. The story may not be the most sophisticated one (but tbh none of the movies of the Mad Max franchise are) but it gives what it promises: A trip on the fury road. A big bonus imo is especially all the 'analog' done stunts - if I compare this with these Fast and Furios movies for example, where almost every action scene screams CGI, I am really happy to watch this 'traditional' done action scenes, which are btw just stunning.Mad Max: Fury Road is just great and superb. I also like Tom Hardy as Mad Max (okay Mel I like more, but anyway) and Charlize Theron shows again that she can play all sorts/genres of movies and characters.I enjoyed and will enjoy this one greatly, and I am eager to see the next movie of the series. Imo we need some more - so we can binge watch this over a whole weekend. That's my future plan for living, an aim worth for staying alive ;) All thumbs up - well done, Mr. Miller!",10,6,11,24 May 2017
Hacksaw Ridge," Mel Gibson Fishing For Compliments
","Well, the first hour of Hacksaw Ridge is very sloooow and of course the hero marries a beautiful nurse he met... Yawn. After that you get a long-stretched and far more brutal version of Forrest Gumps Nam-hero scenes, sometimes underlined with very cheesy emotional music. Well, after all the fuzz over Mr. Gibsons behavior he must ofc deliver something to get back a favorable public opinion. I liked Mel Gibsons The Passion of the Christ a lot, also Apocalypto, and ofc Braveheart, but compared this is rather a weak movie. I don't know why but between all the explosions and killed soldiers and the gore I don't see why this movie should be a new classic or Oscar material at all. Compared with (anti-)war movies like Apocalypse Now, Saving Private Ryan, Paths of Glory, Das Boot, Hotel Rwanda and the like I find this output of Mr. Gibson rather mediocre. Well, sure we get some fine action scenes and lots of gore but this imo don't defines a (anti-) war-movie as a good one, the story of this one is rather stereotypical and stereotypical told and not very interesting - I mean with or without gun, there were and are thousands of medics always 'in action', without such fuss about having no gun or having a gun. A movie told about a unit of medics, that would have been something to honor those men (and women), but this movie is something about a stubborn Christian guy which in my view is not very likable (all ppl talking to and with god are in my view highly suspicious ;)) I will just raise one question - if those hero has the choice to grab a gun and shoot a Japanese soldier to save one comrades life - what would be his decision!? This movie gives no answer to questions like this and is therefore imo just sentimental and a praise of Christian belief without contributing anything new to the questions war and its realities raise.And the last 'heroic' scene - our medic praying and the unit waiting for him to finish before to start the attack and then the attack in slow-mow with VERY cheesy music - this is just bad, a persiflage, a comical end to something who tries to be a movie about a serious matter. In the end our hero even plays football with nades... And ofc with help of the prayer of our hero and the help of the old god of Abraham the US boys beat the evil Japanese. No more to be said.note: the nades kicking scene raises in my view the question how many ppl our hero killed (friends and enemies) unintentionally in just kicking them away in an overcrowded battlefield like depicted ;)",5,20,38,26 January 2017
Warcraft," No Taste
","In short: too much CGI, a boring story, boring characters, long-stretched battles. Well, you get everything a fantasy and action fan craves for - beautiful pictures, great heroes and battles and stuff but somehow in this movie everything just looks and feels like a cliché and made without care. If you got a dish you taste if a cook is cooking with care to details and he likes his job and tries to surprise and please you or if he is just doing everything by the books like an automate. That's somehow how Warcraft hit me - everything is here but it tastes like convenience food: artificial and boring to the tongue and mind. Recommendation only for fans of the game/franchise and/or fantasy die-hards.",4,3,6,23 February 2018
The Runaways," Rock On
","Lately, I rewatched The Runaways and was again highly entertained - some solid and good 70s rock 'n' roll music and vibes, and a story of the ups and downs of the Rock 'n' Roll Circus. The girls perform well, but Michael Shannon is rocking the show - once again.
The Runaways = a good movie with some fine moments of joy, greatness, rebellion and of sadness and destruction.",7,0,1,24 April 2020
Gladiator," Masterclass
","Not only the absolute top production of Gladiator, but also Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix giving some of their best performances, make Gladiator to one of the few top movies that tell us stories of and in the times of the Roman Empire: Ben Hur (1959), The Robe (1953), Quo Vadis (1951) and The Fall of the Roman Empire (1964) comes to mind.This is certainly one of Ridley Scott's best and most ambitious work he has ever done. One of those movies that will never ever grow old.",9,0,2,27 October 2018
The Great Gatsby," Stunning Visuals
",The movie may not reach the depths of the book of Mr. Fitzgerald but anyway I like it - stunning visuals and a little sip of a long gone time got me well entertained. Not as great as Moulin Rouge! (regarding the visuals) but still a good one.,7,1,2,4 June 2019
13 Hours," Top-Notch Action
","I really don't know how accurate the story is retold by the movie but as an action/war movie 13 Hours works really well. Captivating and entertaining and a top-notch production - Mr. Bay should do more movies of that quality and bore us less with all those terrible movies of the Transformer franchise. 13 Hours is recommended if you like movies like Black Hawk Down, American Sniper, Lone Survivor and the like",7,1,3,13 September 2019
Alien: Covenant," Easy the Weakest Movie of the Alien Saga
","O Ridley, what have you done!? I am a great and longtime fan of the Alien franchise and despite the bad receiving of Prometheus I like that one a lot too, but Covenant!? Covenant is easy by far the weakest movie of the Alien-Zyklus, on top the resolution where the breed of the Aliens comes from is just not imaginative, but boring and a clichÃ© on top. What makes the movie even worse is the behavior of the crew - whereas in the first Alien movie the crew did a good fight and used a lot of wits to survive it seems en vogue nowadays to let the protagonists act with an IQ of 60 and below - same with the last sci-fi horror movie Life which had so much potential but ppl acting like they left their brain behind somewhere on the Earth spoil everything.BIG SPOILER: The moment Fassbender number 1 cut his hair everyone with some wits would know why he did so, or what he's up to... Kitsch. (I am always amazed that the writers assume that their protagonists have never seen a movie and smell such simple feints miles ahead.) If this is all Mr. Ridley is able to envision to contribute to the Alien saga I have one plea - let do someone else the job and don't add another mediocre and redundant piece to the story.",5,2,6,9 July 2017

The Martian," Space Soapera
","Okayish movie with some funny moments but very predictable story and therefore in no way a masterpiece like some claim but rather the typical Hollywood astro-blockbuster like Armageddon, Deep Impact etc.Not really bad but also not really good. At max an one-timer. That rescue mission based on some real science/physics!? My a**.",6,0,1,2 April 2019
Evil Dead II," Hail the Groovy Bruce!
","This is the 2nd movie that made Bruce Campbell immortal - as a B-movie actor. And how glad I am that he's back with the delicious Ash vs. Evil Dead that got everything I love regarding the Evil Dead movies: gore, splatter, demons and a good shot of (dark) humor. On top, this is one of the very few movies that really made something worth watching out of Lovecraft's invention/writing the Book of the Dead, the NECRONOMICON. I am still working to evocate my first demon with the help of the Book of the Dead, but maybe I need an edition that is really bound in human skin ;)Sam Raimi directed and produced a lot of movies but imo the best ones are still the two first Evil Dead parts and Army of Darkness.",9,2,2,12 October 2017
The Island," On The Run For A New Life
","Pop-corn sci-fi actioner with some dystopian flavor and fine well-kown actors (Ewan McGregor, Scarlett Johansson, Sean Bean).Some people live in an underground facility sheltered from the outside world which is said to be deadly polluted. A regular lottery is held and the winner gets to leave the facility and its restrictions and move to The Island, a paradise, the last habit where humans still can live outside (that lottery remembers me a little of the renewal game in Logan's Run from 1976).Well, The Island is a Michael Bay movie, so its aimed for a big mass audience, so you can't expect any extravagances, but for what it is, it is a good one.Summa summarum: Nice production and a good speed and action - not outstanding but solid entertainment.",7,0,1,22 November 2018
