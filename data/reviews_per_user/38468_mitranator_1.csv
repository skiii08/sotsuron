The Lobster," Avoid at all cost!
","Pseudo intellectual masturbation, a sick and disgusting combination of violence, twisted and heartless. 2 hours of unnecessary depressive state. As some people find God anywhere just'because',some people will find art in this piece of garbage. I personally would rather prefer to watch a traditional horror movie that scares but leaves my conscience in piece,than to feel sick and depressed. If you would like to experience mental illness and psychiatric sensations you could give it a shot.By far the worst film I've ever seen.I should claim my 2 wasted hours back from the director.",1,1,3,25 March 2017
