First Man," It's the same director after 85. They've landed on the moon. We're still on the earth!
","So far, the first man on the moon has won the prize. It was shortlisted for the main competition unit of the 75th Venice Film FestivalAt the same time, she won the nomination of best female partner for the 76th Golden Globe Award and the 72nd British Film Academy Award. Up to now, the film has been shortlisted for the 91st Oscar for best original score and best visual effect.
The director of this film is Damien chazeley, a young director. I didn't pay much attention to his personal information before. When I knew he was born in 1985, I was shocked because his 'blowout drummer' and 'city of love' are excellent works. It's sad to see the 'Moon' shot by others and the 'Earth' shot by our post-80s directors at the same time.The film focuses on the life of the legendary American astronaut Neil Armstrong, focusing on his process of becoming the first man to land the moon in human history from 1961 to 1969. It also shows the unimaginable national and individual sacrifice of human beings in the most dangerous journey of space exploration in history.At the beginning of the article, from the subjective perspective of commander Gao, commander Gao made a forced landing in the desert during the test flight, followed by the death of commander Gao's little daughter, and the whole family fell into grief. Commander Gao wanted to change this situation and resolutely chose NASA's Twin Star program under the situation of being grounded by the original unit. This was to prepare for the Apollo program of landing on the moon. After a series of near death training, his companion Elliott crashed while driving the trainer. Shortly after that, he and his colleagues boarded the Gemini 8 and completed the docking in space for the first time. This is also the first step of the moon landing plan. After the docking, when everyone was immersed in the exultation, there was a problem with the spacecraft. The near death training was put to use. The spacecraft was rolling in space at the speed of one circle per second. The colleague had fainted Gao Si After a series of investigations, the organization finally confirmed that this was not caused by the man-made operation error of commander Gao, but by the mechanical failure. Commander Gao and his colleagues formally joined the Apollo moon landing program. Later, commander Gao attended the White House banquet on behalf of the astronauts. At the same time, his colleagues were carrying out a test of the cabin of the spacecraft. As a result, three of his colleagues were burned alive. Commander Gao survived, but he was burdened with the unfinished business pressure of his colleagues. Later, when testing the lunar lander, the aircraft could not land safely. Commander Gao used the seat ejection + parachute to retrieve a life. Soon after, commander Gao is about to enter Apollo 11. His wife is under great pressure due to the uncertain future. Of course, it is clear that commander Gao's Armstrong has successfully leapt out of the human stride on the moon. After returning to the earth, commander Gao's wife sees commander Gao in the isolation room.The whole story seems to tell a story about how a hero was tempered. But looking at the details of the film and the language of the camera, the director satirized the absurdity of the image game between the United States and the Soviet Union during the arms and space race, the lives of dozens of astronauts, and the huge expenditure on lunar exploration that led to the government's financial tension and people's March, all at the cost of catching up with the Soviet Union to land on the moon in advance.The absurdity of this image game is reflected in many parts of the film. For example, in the 41st minute of the film, commander Gao and his colleagues walked into Gemini 8, and a row of staff stood on both sides of the spacecraft, like waiting for the experimental results of the mouse. All they wanted was to get the results and improve the spacecraft.When the two men just entered the spaceship, the staff called out who had the Swiss Army knife when fastening the safety belt. The buckle of the original safety belt was stuck by a foreign object. It can be seen that there is no doubt that the reason behind the rough and crude equipment - to catch up with the schedule.The spaceship was closed by the crew, which was also shot from the subjective perspective of the astronauts, like the feeling of being covered with a coffin, oppressive and helpless. Commander Gao, who was about to take off, saw a bird passing through the triangle glass. The next scene is even more joking. There is a fly in the capsule which should be so rigorous and scientific.Later, the director used a series of parallelism lenses, including the internal angles of the cabin, the squeaking sound between screws and seams, which made people think that the rough construction of the spaceship is likely to break up. While commander Gao's life and death are uncertain, commander Gao's family has arranged publicity and shooting.In the film, one hour and 18 minutes later, when three colleagues were in the Apollo module for plug-in test, an astronaut and the staff were talking by radio, and the quality of the conversation was poor. The astronaut ironically said that if we can't hear the conversation in the three buildings, how to make the earth moon conversation.Then there was the electric wire fire in the cabin. The whole cabin was full of oxygen. The director used an external lens to show how tragic the accident was caused by the staff's mistake. There were two doors in the experimental cabin. The outer iron door was deformed by the explosion, and the people inside could imagine it.As commander Gao was about to leave his wife and drive to NASA for the Apollo landing, NASA executives were preparing a speech on the failure of the landing. I think that's why I gave 8 points for this film. Some ethnic groups are different. They can't let you put the problems you encounter in the behavior of a big country on the screen. Twists and turns? Nothing! Everything is going well!
When commander Gao went into space with Apollo and was about to land on the moon, alarm 1201 sounded. Commander Gao twice asked the ground headquarters for the meaning of alarm 1201, and twice he got the same answer: checking! And the third time I asked for help, the ground headquarters replied that it was OK! This reminds me of the style of the Russian fighting nation.In the whole story, the director also expresses such a concept in the film. Human life and death is just the death of a certain role in other people's world, and there will be new roles to replace it. Yes, it is very sad. After the death of commander Gao's daughter, he and his wife gave birth to a new life, and she slept in the bed of the deceased daughter. Even more so under the national ideology, the death of commander Gao's colleagues will soon bring new colleagues to the top, and people will only remember the man who finally completed the moon landing.",8,0,1,9 April 2020
