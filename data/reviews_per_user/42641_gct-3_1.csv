Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Who needs a 'SW for kids'??
","I'm so sorry folks, I really, really loved the trilogy myself, but you gotta admit it: THIS ONE IS THE WORST!Lucas. You own Star Wars, and you mess it up with your chewing gum commercial kids and cute Jamaican aliens. Ambitionless and decadent, you've forgotten how to direct.Thus, my first (and biggest) disappointment was that the long, grand scenes (like the trilogy's first scene with the Emperor, etc)weren't present. Why they're gone? Because they're expensive, and they take TIME to shoot.IV/V/VI are action for teenagers, and film art as well. Of course, we all saw them first when we were, like, 8 years old, but then it was SO cool to see violent, scary movies made for teens! This doesn't have that magic at all!Jar-Jar: YOUSA SUCK! We all know that Jar-Jar is a CGC. It doesn't look at all real when the Jedis talk to him, and none of his movements are realistic. Why all the BAD CG? Jurassic Park CG is much more convincing!Anakin: Yeah. You're such a cool little kid with NO acting talent. See you in the next 'Home Alone'-movie. The racing scenes were boring in rel to VI's 'forest scooters'.I'VE GOT TO ADMIT:* The Princess ruled bigtime. Grand. Beautiful! Excellent!! * Darth Maul was a nice evil character. I loved the light staff. (And I don't mean the staff at Industrial Light & Magic) * The revelation of the senator as the future emperor. * Having seen VI, I know that Anakin is finally killed. Whew!These few pluses make it worthwhile to wait for II and III.This is a mediocre film. Other SW fans; I know some of you slept outside the cinemas for days, but please, don't pretend that this is a good SW.You're only stomping all over the brilliant three.",1,28,53,21 November 2000
