Requiem for a Dream," excellent movie, very realistic depiction of drug use and its consequences
",I loved this movie. It is a masterpiece from the acting to the music. No glamorization of drug use but the horrible consequences of legal and illegal drug use. Brutally honest. I loved the fridge scene when Ellen Burstyn gets psychotic and has hallucinations. The only problem I had was the depiction of ECT (electroconvulsive therapy)= brain shock at the end of the movie that was done with the patient fully awake and alert. ECT is done with the patient under general anesthesia (deeply unconscious). That was really the only 'mistake' in the movie. I loved everything else.,10,0,1,13 July 2002
