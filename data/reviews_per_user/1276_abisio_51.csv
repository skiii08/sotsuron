Blade Runner 2049," A movie longer than the ideas in it
","Denis Villeneuve has become an interesting director; INCENDIES was interesting, PRISONERS quite cynical, ENEMY and SICARIO real masterpieces. Not that fond of ARRIVAL but anyway it was acceptable. I am not a huge fan of Ridley Scott; I always believe that his visuals and concepts were larger and more interesting than the movies he crafted. Take for example PROMETHEUS and its follow up ALIEN CONVENANT. The first one was an interesting concept; completely destroyed in the follow up. Villeneuve was able to expand the BLADE RUNNER concept but instead of developing his ideas he dedicated more the visuals and expanded the movie to 2 hours and 44 minutes; which is at least one hour more than it needed to be. BLADE RUNNER was far from an action flick with a running time below two hours was able to deliver an idea; this one only delivers boredom. Lots of unnecessary over extended scenes that even great actors like Ryan Gosling have trouble to dealing with. And after almost three hours; the ending is simplistic and take away any interesting concept that could came earlier. Basically the final scenes leave the viewer expecting for more and obviously frustrated.In brief; if you are a hard fan of the original get good nap before entering the theater; you are going to fall sleep anyway but at least not so often.",4,25,51,9 October 2017
The Equalizer," Denzel is fine but the movie disappoints
","If it was not a Denzel Washington movie; it could easily pass for 'B' direct to video movie. Low production values; not outstanding characters or actors (aside from Denzel and little used Cloe Moretz), a quite predictable and lazy written story, several 'USA POLITICALLY CORRECT DETAILS' **spoiler follow** Denzel never kills a cop **end of spoiler** This is a movie Denzel can do it while sleeps and he is really good; but it is not a good movie by far. Too long for his own good and cheap special effects, uninteresting final showdown. Antoine Fuqua made the mid budget 'Olympus Has Fallen' last year and the looked far more expensive that this one (which reportedly cost over 50M) In brief; if you are a fan of Denzel; get 'Training Day'; this one is not worth the over two hours spent.",2,28,59,14 December 2014
Skyfall," Bardem wonderful but a very boring Bond film
","One spectacular action sequence on the beginning and the sadly few minutes Barden is on screen are the only worth things in this far below average action film. Do not get fooled by critics. This is not an art movie and Bond has nothing to do with Bourne. Bond is glamour and sin; a guilty pleasure about thinks we would like to do (seduce other people, always win a fight, smoke, drink and pay no attention to authority) but morally cannot.Bond does not need shrink but in this absurd politically correct world; a person who does what he wants must be psycho so 21st century 007 is basically an alienated and unstable person.Brocolli's please go back to the original. This movie is too boring to be considered and action movie.The final confrontation is so uninteresting and predictable that you can leave 20 minutes early and feel OK.The worst part, the only sympathetic character is Silva (Barden) who is basically the bad guy.Do not lose time with this product",1,12,27,14 November 2012
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," The best Star Wars movie since Empire Strike Back
","ROGUE ONE fill a very small gap of the 20 years between Episode III and IV. Perhaps the proper name should be Episode 3.9 because I am pretty sure if this is successful; Disney fill create 6 or 8 episodes covering the 20 years between Darth Vader rising, the Empire, the fall of the Jedis and the coming of age of Luke and Lea (who appears in the last scene of this movie thanks to the magic of digitization. ROGUE ONE is about the stealing of the Death Star blue prints. You know from the beginning (unless you never saw the original saga) that they will succeed and who will survive; but even with that limitations writers did a far better job than with the copycat that became Episode VII. The movie is mostly formulaic, but there are some very good dialogs and better action scenes than the previous films.Felicity Jones is good but her character is too clichéd and not particularly interesting; who really carry the movie are Diego Luna, Donnie Yen, Wen Jiang, Riz Ahmed and the voice of Alan Tudyk as the cynical and comically depressing K-2SO In brief; it is not for younger kids but worth spending 2 hours and 14 minutes.",9,4,13,15 December 2016
Captain Marvel," Lots of action but very lazy written
","If you are expecting intense action more or less from the beginning, Captain Marvel will not disappoint (as far digital unrealistic action is your thing). Sadly there is not much more there.
However my biggest disappointing was Brie Larson character. It seems there is no clear direction about tough and rude or sympathetic. Well it is neither. Most of the time she looks lost and looking for the exit.Her only good scenes are the ones with Sam Jackson (she cannot content her laugh; it seems they were having a really fun time)Jackson gets to play the funniest character (a big change for Nick Fury, always dramatic). He is able to carry most of the movie easily and with very good help from Jude Law , Ben Mendelsohn. With the three guys charisma, Brie gets completely overshadowed.While the predictable story develops; the movie is entertaining; with some very kinetic fights and lots of humor; however when the final confrontation arrives; things gets ridiculous; particularly when she alone, like Superman (or Supergirl), fly to space, destroy missiles and scares the bad guy from the first Guardians of the Galaxy.
The movie becomes unnecessary stupid and the cheap and lack of imagination in the cheap FX of that scene makes matter worse.In brief; it is kids movie perhaps below 15 or you have to be Marvels Hooligan otherwise is not for you.",6,1,8,8 March 2019
Star Trek Into Darkness," Star Trek spirit still lives
","I am not a fan of J J Abrams and I am really concerned about his Star Wars project; however I must admit that his reboot of the original Star Trek keep the spirit and humor of the original series better than any of the previous movies with the original cast.The original series was as much about Sci Fi as Harry Potter's books were about magic. The important thing was really 'human nature' the rest was an environment needed for the development.In this case, the best parts are the legendary discussions and smart one liners between Jim Kirk (Pines), Spock (Quinto) and McCoy; with the added bonus of a really funny Scotty (Pegg) and a strong and smart Uhura (Zaldana). This two last characters never got fully developed on the original series.The action and spectacular scenes are very well made, but seeing them in 3D was too much for my eyes (advice see this movie in 2D ).The bad guy has been another well made decision. Cumberbatch has probably more screen time than any other character; and he uses it very well. Even when you know what he will be no good; is able to look trust able.The only real problem (aside from the 3D strain) is the plot. Everything is too predictable and there are a few holes that could have been easily avoided; but Abrams never seemed to care too much about that.In brief; excellent acting and dialogs; spectacular action scenes and a so so story makes this a perfect way to expend two relaxing hours.",9,9,22,10 May 2013
Oldboy," Complex thriller
","Lets start saying that OLDBOY recently got the 2004 Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival;  probably the most prestigious Film Festival in the world, so that must mean something about this movie.Directed by Chanwook Park a Korean director, who was also responsible for Joint Security Area and Sympathy of Vengeance two dark superb and unexpected thrillers albeit somehow slow for the American taste?This time, pace is a lot faster, but the movie takes the darkness of his previous work to unexpected limits.  The story seems simple. Drunk and irresponsible men is kidnapped one night and kept captive for a long time, in a room with a TV set.  His wife is killed at the same moment, becoming the prime suspect; his daughter sends to foster parents.He plots to escape and get revenge on his kidnapers, but everyday he is treated with brainwash drugs and hypnosis.  After 15 years he is suddenly released without any explanation.  He receives money and a cell phone, from where a voice tells him that he must seek revenge.With the help of a young woman he accidentally meets, he starts seeking his captors in a growing spiral of violence, but everybody around him seems to be part of a plot leading him to unexpected situations.
What starts as a vengeance movie, slowly becomes a puzzle where all pieces match by the end.  This is like THE SIX SENSE without the phantasms.Chanwook Park has created a movie about the human condition, about the subjectivity of good and bad.  When the movie reaches its conclusion, all-moral values are destroyed and many people will be looking for the purifying fire that never arrives.  I cannot tell more without spoiling the movie, but let us just say that according to this movie, SIN IS A MATTER OF KNOWLEDGE.Beware; this movie is for adults. Not because of the sex scenes that are just what the movie needed  or the violence that is probably more than necessary, but because no young person could ever understand how deeply philosophical this movie gets.",Null,15,90,27 June 2004
Orphan," A very different kind of horror movie
","After seen that mediocre (to put it lightly ), unoriginal and full of gore horror movies like HALLOWEEN or Friday THE 13TH receive very good comments (and even get remade ) I quit the genre until I was invited to the pre-screening of ORPHAN and was greatly surprised. ORPHAN was directed by an European director I barely heard about; Jaume Collet-Serra (and I see hundreds of European movies every year). He directed GOAL II a movie and HOUSE OF WAX. I saw part of the first in a plane years ago; without paying much attention because I am not fond of sports movies. To my surprise; ORPHAN does not rely on easy scares or heavy gore to get the thrills. It uses kids as the main victims; and just for that we are already frightened; but the perfectly staged scenes involving them like the tree house or the car going down the cliff are the most terrifying scenes I saw in years. Pure cinema and camera work. This is an American produced movie with European pace. Is more interested in create suspense; as it will become horror later; thus the two hours direction.If this movie has a problem are very little. The tension becomes exhausting sometimes; however there are not fillings; just a lot of ideas and a crescendo that obviously require some extra time. The end is sadly on USA standards and damages and almost perfect movie; but it will probably satisfy most of the public",8,8,19,24 July 2009
Zodiac," Much ado about nothing
","Let me begin explaining this:<ul><li>ZODIAC has duration of 160 minutes or 2 hours and 40 minutes. - Is about the investigation of a serial killer that can only be demonstrated three killings even when he claims 13 or more. - The killer was never caught - The movie is based on real events</li></ul>At almost three hours ZODIAC could have been a decent four night's miniseries in any network channel. The three killings are strong but not really gory. It does not have 'A' list actors even when the acting is excellent.Even if you do not know the story (as it was my case) after the first half, there not much to sustain any interest. All you get are continuous dialogs, a little humor and more dialogs. Robert Downey Jr character is the only one interesting (but partially developed). No other really deserves real interest or rooting for.In brief; I am sure there are better ways to spend almost three hours of your life.",4,34,181,21 February 2007
Crash," Just go and see this movie; do not ask or loose even one minute
","It is not fair to say that CRASH is the best 2005 movie. CRASH is the best movie of the last five years or probably the last decade.CRASH can be compared with Altman's SHORTCUTS or with MAGNOLIA; however is better than the first one and far-far better than the second is. While those movies try to explain the human relations in a metaphorical or intellectual way; sometimes using images without any real significance (like the frog's rain in MAGNOLIA) or long and sometimes boring monologues (just to justify some actor's ego); or focus mostly on a mid-to-high class, CRASH use real day to day situations and people, from every social level.Trying to tell the history is difficult. Let's say that a chain of events create temporary situations between unlike to be together humans beings. A wealthy couple is robbed from his SUV in a rich LA district; looking for the car a frustrated stops a black couple and abuse the woman in front of her husband. This humiliation causes a crisis in the couple and a meditation of ethnic rights. Similar abuse an Arab in a store (the store clerk calls him OSAMA and blames him for throwing 747 in American buildings).The first half hour of the movie, looks like everything is about racial conflicts; which is somewhat a tricky subject even when the arguments are acceptable, but suddenly more twist of events, shows another side on almost every character.The characters are so well defined (even in very short scenes) that at least three situations generate more horror or suspense than all RINGS movies together (without using any ghost).The acting is outstanding. Every actor put his or her ego aside and play their part no matter how risky they are. Sandra Bullock is very good as the hysterical and racist wife goes credible from the queen of the bitches to break your heart in the last scene. Even better is the rest of the cast.This movie is about people, about both sides of the coin. It carries the most important meditation about the human being in less than two hours. Sadly IS TOO GOOD TO WIN Oscar but at least give it a commercial success; so who knows, probably Hollywood starts doing GOOD MOVIES.",10,5,17,7 May 2005
Ocean's Thirteen," Let your intelligence be insulted
","Ocean 13 (as Ocean 12 was before it) is basically bunch of actors, some of the A-LIST, trying to look cool in front of a camera talking as they are friends from life (well the at least the bigger names).The story makes little sense but the scam itself is completely stupid and very lazily or absurdly planned and too many loose ends. Just an excuse to give some screen time to everybody (and there are really a lot of people).The best are Al Pacino (so so), Matt Damon and Andy Garcia that at least look natural.There is no suspense, no sense of danger, no passion, no sex, no violence and overall no fun on the whole movie.",2,14,61,7 June 2007
Interstellar," A very long piece of crap. Nolan's give us a break please !!!
",If you ever saw Kubrick's 2001 then do not waste your time in this movie. If you did not;then rent or buy 2001 and avoid this piece of crap.'INTERSTELLAR' is a dumb and lazy written cash cow disguised as a philosophical statement. 'INCEPTION' was the same thing (but less stupid and more entertaining or at least had more action and violence ) Do not be fooled by the concept; there are just one or two interested statements in this movie but taking three hours for that is excessive.The whole things must make sense in Nolan's depressing mind; the world is ending but people is still selfish enough to make matters worse. The movie has zero humor and the positive or hopeful message is as fake as the special effects.In fact; this is a movie about God; but Nolan's refuse to even refer about religion; so the movie is about 'something' that is never clear and makes absolutely no sense. ***SPOILER AHEAD*** Without saying too much about the first ending (there is a second happy ending to ensure better box office receipts and is even more absurd ) why whoever could create such a device just pass the message and solve the problem ?. ***END OF SPOILER***McConaughey is talk is almost incomprehensible. Anne Hathaway is always good; but his character is under written. Jessica Chastain has to deal a completely absurd and unbelievable and over dramatized situations (and she does not succeed).In brief; do not commit the same error I made. Save your money for a better and more sincere money; this one is just a scam.,1,15,30,1 December 2014
Oblivion," A new low for Tom Cruise
","I did not have great expectations with OBLIVION. TRON 2 was really a piece of crap with nice FX. Sadly I was not wrong; but the effects are better.I really liked Tom when he was a human person with defects and qualities (RISKY BUSINESS, TOP GUN, COCKTAIL, JERRY MACGUIRE; even the first MI ). In his new face as action hero; Tom became just PERFECT. He is always the nicest, the strongest, the smartest and all the ...est you can find. That could work for a while but after so many movies it just became a repetition of exactly the same. If you do not believe me see back to back OBLIVION and JACK REACHER.Here his acting is basically a repetition of his sad, fierce, tender, loving and surprised face. It is a pity he gave up on Oscar's glory; he should have done that with the action hero mode.The story is a mixture of the shallow elements of MOON, 2001 and a couple of Bradbury tales (in fact I am pretty sure Martian Chronicles includes a very similar tale); but because of the high budget it never becomes existentialist but violent in the third act. The problem is that the few action scenes are not really interesting. The shutdown with the drones has some dramatic effect but even GI JOE II gets better battles.The worst part is the epilogue; SPOILER begins After an heroic act; he cannot stay dead; he has to be resurrected.END OF SPOILER.In brief; Tom can do better. He does not need to be controlled by the Hollywood machine. Reject this movie so he tries to give us something worth seeing.",4,31,61,19 April 2013
The Matrix Revolutions," What happened in the editing room ?
","Matrix Reloaded left plenty of open possibilities for the third part. Monica Bellucci character or the Twins, plus the long discourse of the Architect.  Well not much of these are in the third part.  Monica has one scene, the Twins are nowhere to be seen and the Architect; well things are not exactly as he said.Is Matrix Revolution a good or a bad movie ?. In action terms, combat in ZION is a spectacular FX long sequence; but the lack of humans in it, reduces the emotion. The dead of one of the main characters with no FX, is too long and not particularly emotive so people started to laugh and whistle. The end of the movie it is so open that I do not think anybody will be satisfied, plus is far from happy.Matrix is a comic; with all the darkness we are used on them. The end of the movie (and of the trilogy) is as dark as you might expect from a comic (were you have to wait for the next issue). However, even if the end could (and for sure will) disappoint you like it did to me; I feel that it was the proper and logical ending.I came to understand, that Matrix was never intended as the blockbuster it became. The optimistic beginning has nothing to do with the outcome of the rest; it was as the Architect pointed, just an illusion.However, I believe there were a lot more on this movie than we see in the screen.  I wont be surprised if  many story lines were left in the cutting room to keep the movie within the two hours commercial duration. I only wish the Wachosky release the `Directors Cut' someday.  In the meantime, if you saw the second, do not loose the third, but if you did not see the second, please do not go and keep the first one with your good memories.",Null,0,0,5 November 2003
The Revenant," The most spectacular move of the year (and no FX)
","I am not a fan Iñárritu; but I concede I saw all his directed movies since AMORES PERROS. I went to THE REVENAT with doubts; mostly because having seen the original about 40 years ago, still remember it as boring and depressing. However; when I saw this version trailer; the images were so amazing that I felt the urge to see it. Well, I was not disappointed at all. The story is pretty much the same but told in much more bearable way (the original Richard Harris spent 90% of the movie alone). But are the images and effects that stand out; created by using wide angle lenses on close ups and moving the camera on 360 degrees; creating immersive images that easily transmit to other senses. You feel the cold, the water and the suffering. If Iñárritu tried to demostrate that nature is the greatest and most spectacular (and dangerous) thing in this world; he succeed. The digitally created THE FORCE AWAKENS should hide ashamed of what has been achieved with a camera and some lenses. Just the Indians or the Bear attacks; completely compensates the price of the ticket; but there is more from where that came from in this incredible movie. The acting is superb. It required very humble and committed actors to accept these roles. Tom Hardy is terrifying in a character that pure selfishness and not allow a hint of sympathy. Di Caprio in his most physical interpretation until today is outstanding. You are able to feel his pain and suffering. In brief; if you want to see the most spectacular images or the most terrifying fight man vs nature. Just go and see this movie.",10,13,35,29 December 2015
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," The best Harry Potter adaptation
","For many years, we old Harry Potter's fans had been angry on the disappointing adapting of the books; a brief synopsis the action parts none of the things that made the series a modern classic or a literally work of art. As an example; the best (and longest) book; The Goblet of Fire was so badly adapted and worse directed that the real meaning of the book (youngster anguish, rebellion and sexual awakenings ) was completely trimmed. Characters and actions related to the next part where eliminated, creating a hole in relationships and even our feelings from some characters (i.e. Sirius Black). David Yates took over on the franchise but even if the adaptation was better; the movies barely reflected the books. I regained hope when I heard the movie will be shown in two parts; finally Hollywood greed will be useful for something !!!.Well, the first part is really like the book. There were a few trims but the slow action and Harry's, Hermione and Ron desperation and disorientation was perfectly staged. Three almost kids fighting against the world without any idea on what to do.A few people (who did not read the book), though the movie was too paced and with poor special effects. There is some true about that; but the pacing was exactly right as in the book and the special effects this time not really that important.Let's hope that Yates do the right thing for the last and most expected part.",9,0,1,19 November 2010
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," The terminator is alive and healthyÂ…again
","I really loved Terminator, but  Terminator 2 was kind of a disappointment. Moments full of action, sometimes very slow (and almost boring) and no story at all. However, for  Rise of the Machines,  Mr. Mostow, the same who was able to do something with acceptable with Jurassic Park III (another extinct franchise), came to the rescue and got something sometimes better, sometimes (particularly by the end) darker and overall funnier than both predecessors.
Two Terminators come back to the past to defend/destroy the future resistance. The obsolete but still useful T-1 (Arnold better than ever) and the new model (Kristanna Loken) whose more interesting advantage is her ability to control other machines.  The future has changed, but judgment day is still unavoidable, and the importance of the players has somewhat shifted. John Connor is one of the targets, but there are others as important as him.  Also, this time the story has a couple of un-exploited but interesting twists and the darkest ending of the series. 
Arnold character, has a lot more development than the previous films.  He owns almost all the jokes and together with Claire Danes completely controls the screen.  Nick Stahl is sadly not on the same level. While Edward Furlong (on the same character in T-2) looked like a future leader, Nick looks like a future looser, not near the fighter he is supposed to become.The action, this time deserves special mention. The first car chase is worth the price of the ticket.  MATRIX looks pale in comparison and the special effects does not look `digital' at all. This seems to be real cars and buildings destroyed. If really it was a trick I am buying it.My only complain (aside from Stahls character) is the restrain of some scenes.  It looks that they really targeted the PG-13 (the movie is rated R), and failed, but the feeling is that they could have go further but they didn't.This is a 4.5 stars over 5; I hope they keep the same quality on Terminator 4.",Null,0,0,1 July 2003
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Far better than 3 and 4 but not yet there
","Mission Impossible was a beloved TV spy show that played like a scam and deceive tale; full of suspense and unexpected twists. None of the movies played that way; however the first two crafted by the legendary Brian de Palma and John Woo; had such brilliant moments that made you forget the movies were no more than very standard action flic.It was well known; Cruise (producer and start) had a lot of discrepancies with both directors so he switched to lesser known, more manageable ones; crafting the forgettable MI-III (whose higher points were the addition of Simon Pegg and a decent turn of fresh Oscar winner; Philip Seymour Hoffman as the bad guy; but has the worse script ever created for an action movie absolutely predictable and far from original ) and the ultra spectacular but also forgettable MI-Ghost Protocol (Cruise hanging on the tallest building in Emirates is pretty much the only thing I recall about the movie).MI-5 Rogue Nation was directed by Christopher McQuarrie; a not very experienced director (he is unable to produce any kind of suspense) but smart enough to compensate with lots of humor and prioritizing secondary characters. McQuarrier fails in the Vienna's Opera chapter. The sequence is well staged but lacks suspense so it's become too long. Luckily Simon Pegg keeps the moment funny. However; after that, the movie becomes more interesting. Rebeca Fergusson is a great surprise and her character gets lots of screen time and she makes the most of it.Sadly; aside from her and Pegg; other characters has very little to do. Reener is fine in a really small part; Alec Baldwin is completely unused and even worse; the real veteran of the series Ving Rhames has almost nothing to do.In any case; the after the first third; the movie become more fun and with good action scenes and a few predictable but acceptable twists.",8,0,2,5 August 2015
Dunkirk," Another pretentious but mediocre and insulting movie from Nolan
","I rarely see a more overrated director than Nolan. He is one of the few with James Cameron able to get incredible budgets on the most unlikely movies but while Cameron make fun movies, Nolan just me make depressing ones that at the end make very little sense.
His Batman trilogy was depressing. Tim Burton was fired from Batman because it was too dark (but ironically fun). Nolan did the same but forgot the fun.
Inception and Interstellar were spectacular movies that really made not sense at all. Critics praised them as masterpieces when out of the visuals aside there were nothing really interesting or important to say.
Back to Dunkirk; well there is not real point in it. The movie just tells the story of two soldiers (a third one appears after the first half) trying to get out of the beach. There is no emotion; just a lot of failed attempts to escape.
There are no explanations of what really happened; why 400K soldiers were left in the beach; why allied soldiers reject the French ones. In fact soldiers are mostly showed as cowards trying to run away and save themselves.
On the other hands; officials are shown elegantly dressed and apparently not affected at all for the events surrounding them. 
There is also a boat captain with his son and a help who are only trying to be patriotic but seem to know more about war than any other military around. 
The movie has continuity errors all over (like Cillian Murphy appearing in two different timelines). It is also very hard to believe that Germans send four or five planes to attack 400K defenseless men (for what could had been the hardest hit on allied forces) and allies only send three (with little gas) to save the 400 thousand men there.It is even harder to accept that when civil boats arrived; Germans basically stop attacking and 300 thousand men were able to be saved in few minutes.In brief; the movie is insulting to soldiers that fought and die over there and are only painted as cowards when officers are shown as valiant heroes when basically their mistakes cost the lives of so many. Is also insulting to the public because it gives little information about the events and try to create happy ending of that carnage.Please avoid the movie and alert others about the piece of crap this is.",2,2,4,18 January 2018
The Lego Movie," Another misconception kids movies
","The Lego Movie is another (like Pixar's) nostalgia, highly sentimental movies targeted more to adults than kids.Perhaps boys in love with Lego products will find the movie appealing; but my 5 year old daughter and her cousin same age; plus my wife (who fall asleep for most of the movie) found it boring.Kids movies are for kids. Kids want fun. You can pack a few important messages (like Disney's Wreck it Ralph ) had; but without loosing the main goal; make the movie fun.Lego's Movie with static very static characters and not particularly interesting action fails miserably in that department. The ending itself is so forced that feels like 'out of ideas'. Many people saw the movie; but I do not think many will repeat like happened with Frozen or Wreck it Ralph.",Null,5,11,9 February 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Good movie but please do not let Bryan Singer direct again
","X-MEN has been called the 'thinking people comic' and there is a lot of truth on that. It is as dark as Batman and full of fantasy as Superman but not shallow as both. X-MEN concept is a profound and not easy to work; racism and power struggle. It is quite interesting but requires lots of character and situation development, drama and action in equal parts. My belief is that the franchise never got the popularity of Batman or Iron Man was because of Mr. Bryan Singer lousy direction. The universe of the mutants is a crowd of characters but Mr. Singer is unable to work with more than two or three in the first line or developing complex dramatic situations without sorting out with FX.Days of Future Past is another example of his lack of control.As in his two previous movies; many mutants beloved characters are just shown for a couple of seconds doing almost nothing; Storm, Shadowcat, Iceman barely have a couple of lines; but this times even Stewart and McKellen has almost nothing to do (McKellen looks bored and uncomfortable in his very few scenes). Quicksilver gets a few minutes of screen time, does his thing and is send away for the rest of the movie. During his scenes the other characters has little to do.The script is good enough to cover most of Mr. Singer errors; but some things just do not make any sense:*****SPOILER ALERT ***** After losing Vietnam; do not believe Mr. Nixon will avoid a conflict with mutants, specially if one mutant is able to move a baseball stadium to surround the White House. Such power showdown should immediately provoke the mutants persecution. Dinklage character (Dr. Trask is not clearly defined); he is a different kind of mutant but is also an ambitious and greedy person. Why try to put him as an idealist ?.Young Magneto is pretty much a psycho during the movie. Most of his actions do not make any sense; while the old one gives his life to save the others.Raven / Mystique internal conflict is lame and could have been easily solved in much less screen time. She is a killer so why try to make her a nice person ?. Perhaps the projected spin off ?*****END OF SPOILERS ******There are many more errors; like the negation of X-MEN Last Stand; the one directed by Brett Ratner when Singer decided to make the boring Superman Reboot in 2006.Chris Columbus directed the first two Harry Potter's movies; but then realized he was not ready to handle the tone of the book so he pass the baton to Cuaron and then to other directors. Mr. Singer learn from him if you love the franchise.",8,0,0,27 May 2014
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Improves on the book far better than the first part
","In my younger and more patient years I read The Hobbit and LOTR. I always loved the universe Tolkien created; but never considered the books truly entertainment In fact, after re-reading The Hobbit recently; I found it disorganized. This was really a tale for her children and the book looks like that. Enters Jackson who made a masterpiece of LOTR. He deserves all the praise; but he worked with very good material; which is not the case here. The book is underdeveloped. The quest is interesting; but there are many characters without any personality; and the way the events are resolved is not that interesting. In a decision I applauded; Jackson altered the book adding events and characters and resolving situations in more dramatic, dynamic way. The timid adjustments on the first movie made it just OK, This time; he free himself and the longer the movie is twice the fun and without really breaching from the book. ( I still do not see the point of Evangeline Lili's Turiel but she is involved in several action scenes and is always charming ). In terms of effects and action the movie supersede any action blockbuster since LOTR. The Dragon sequence is outstanding; but there are others on almost the same level. There are also several 'human' situations that flesh out what otherwise could be taken as a total fantasy. In brief; clocking on two hours and forty minutes; do not miss it in cinemas and try to see it 3D since this movie really deserves that treatment.",9,7,15,13 December 2013
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A long boring mess only saved by Di Caprio
","If you love 69-70s nostalgia; this movie might be for you but you will need to check some of history inadequacies Tarantino fancies so much (is Sharon Tate is not killed in this movie).
Aside from the nostalgia not really much happens. There is a big story about a fading TV actor (Di Caprio deserving another Oscar) even that is too long. The rest are pretty much random scenes of something bigger that seem to be left in the cutting floor (cannot imagine how much because the movies is almost 3 hours long).
Tarantino is able to recruit outstanding actors; there is no way to explaiin Di Caprio, Brad Pitt (good too but with an underwritten character), Al Pacino (two scenes mostly a cameo),Margot Robbie; completely underused and a few other others that are barely seen in one or two scenes without any connection with the rest of the movie.
My belief is that Tarantino made a very long movie that could not be released completely for simply commercial reasons and did not has enough violence to justify a two parts as KILL BILL.
To be sincere this is the kind of movie would not released with other actors and directors.
In brief; do not lose your time. Wait for the directors cut or full version; but this one is a waste of almost three hours without nothing funny unless you were born in that decade.",3,3,8,14 August 2019
X-Men: Apocalypse," Another mediocre X-MEN movie by Brian Singer
","I love the X-MEN saga and acknowledge that Singer made a very good job with the first two movies (specially X2 ); but I still consider X-MEN UNITED (directed by Brett Ratner) one of the best of the whole series (the movie was more expensive but even under-performing; made more money than the first two; and is still the second best of the series. Singer left X-MEN to pursue Superman; but failed and his next two movies as well. He finally returned for Days of Future Past (a huge commercial success; but as a movie far less interesting the previous installments. However; smartly Singer joined past and actual main characters in one movie and that underused trick help the movie become the highest grossing of the series. In another smart move; he end Days of Future Past with a hint of Apocalypse; the most beloved of the X-MEN comics; grating a lot of attention and expectation on this one. Well sadly this time; Singer imagination run out and the movie become a very poor mess. A lot of characters with poor development. QuickSilver (Evan Peters) and Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee) are the only ones to give some humanity to their characters. McAvoy, Fassbender and Lawrence do what they can; but the script does not help. Byrne and Hoult (and the rest of the cast) has very little to do and look uncomfortable. Even Oscar Isaac fails to create a good baddie.In terms of special effects; things are not that better. Lack of imagination is everywhere. The final fight; seems copied of older movies and the FX and digital images look cheap.X-MEN interest on the saga is based on the characters. McKellen and Steward or Fassbender and McAvoy as Magneto and Xavier can carry a movie by themselves if they let them; but in this case their characters are secondary to a bunch of new mutants and a bad guy none of them interesting or close to charismatic.In brief; it could have been the best X-MEN but lack of imagination made it the worse.",6,5,13,29 May 2016
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Probably the best thriller of the year but it will not be released in USA
","Millennium 1, The Man Who Hate Women is a thriller; but most of all a character study. Explaining what happens will not make any justice and will diminish the lasting feeling after enjoying it. The sad part is that the movie does not seem will have a wide USA release. It will probably be shown in New York and/or Los Angeles in a couple of theatres and as USA people hate reading it will be miserably ignored. It is sad because dumb things like I LOVE YOU MAN, DUPLICITY, THE HANGOVER or any romantic or formulaic movie gets wide release and huge publicity while this master piece; based on a master piece book will be limited to a DVD by the few people with still some cultural knowledge in the country. If this does not bother you; then search for some of the above mentioned movies you will for sure be delighted with.",9,41,84,13 July 2009
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Stop Disney stupidity. Avoid it and FORCE them to the right path
","Perhaps you are not interested in spoilers; but believe it is better to read this before spending two and half boring hours trying to understand where the movie is going and find out it is not going nowhere.
The movie can be described as many sub-plots that some barely join at the very dissatisfying end but the others go absolutely nowhere.
Rey trying to get attention from Luke 
Rey trying to connect with Ken and turned it to the light. 
Poe try to become a leader despite his rebellious attitude 
Fin trying to avoid war and find Rey and his friendship with a new female character that (as sympathetic as she is), does not add anything to the movie.
Fin trying to get a Master Hacker to save the rebels; a plot so absurd that looks was added later to give some emotion to the movie (and failed).
While in the original saga, Darth Vader was the conducting force; here is Ren becoming the new Vader; but what is the point of the rest ? Aside from Rey and Ken story everything else seems to be just fillings. In fact Gleeson with less screen time is able to get far more personality (and laughs than Ken)Luke is underused and his character is completely the opposite as it was in the original; however his scenes are the best part of the move.
Rey and Ken acting is so forced that is difficult to produce some kind of sympathy; it could possibly be the directors fault.
John Boyega is a great and charismatic actor; however his character has become uninteresting and sometimes boring.
Poe character does not make any sense as it happens with Laura Dern Admiral. In brief; my theory is that the movie has been re-written while filming so in order to save money they star in some way and end it up in another without any real progression.When the movie ends; looks like a new saga will start with complete different characters. Let's hope so but also with a new director and a new writer able to go back to the good thing the original double trilogy was",1,5,6,16 December 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Great actors, great production, lots of actions but ...
","In terms of production and CGI I can say this movie is better than the first AVENGER; however in terms of story; there is not much there. The first AVENGER was all about egos colliding and it really work. In fact the best thing was Loky and the constant fighting between them When at the end decided to fight together the movie lost lots of steam. The second installment find them together so Joss Whedon had to find a way to divide them and create conflict. His excuse is the madness of over egocentric Tony Stark by creating an AI based on the scepter of the first movie. Sadly from that on the story does not hold very well. As the conflict is not so believable than the first time; he basically creates a lot of one-liners for each characters that at least keep the humor on a good level.I admire that Whedon gives a balanced moments for everybody to shine. Exception is Captain America with a character so stiff that seems to be wanting to be in another movie. The concept of Captain America been the leader (as being America the leader of the world) is somewhat uncomfortable and not quite proved here; specially when all the big thinking and planning comes from all the others. It is a pity because Chris Evans is not a bad actor but is unable to outshine his colleagues here. Downey as ever makes you cry and laugh without even putting a lot of effort. Hemwsworth THOR is quite sympathetic and can be funny and deep when is needed. Renner is an excellent actor and he really deserves a hit. As a family man, he creates a lot of suspense by the end just with the look on his face. Ruffalo is also OK; but this time he is a little to depressive. His hint a romance with Black Widow is like a fresh air in the movie; but is she who creates the sexual tension. Scarlett is as always too good for any movie. She is the only action hero that can be feminine ever during the fights and also we a desirable woman. Taylor-Johnson is fine; but I would like his character to be bigger. Olsen is really terrifying as Scarlett Witch with almost no talking. In my opinion she was as good as Johansson even with less screen time. On the action department; again Whedon is not that good. Relying to much on CGI is not longer interesting. There are spectacular scenes on the beginning and the end that never transmit a sense of real danger. Perhaps; the fight between Iron Man and Hulk is the best and funniest action set in the whole movie. In brief; it is not a boring movie; lots of action but the best are the character interacting between them. Let's hope somebody find a way on the third Avenger to make something different because this will not hold for a third time.",7,2,6,30 April 2015
Blood Diamond," A movie deserving a wide audience
","BLOOD DIAMOND is before everything else a movie full of good intentions. It is probably the type of history that will bother and teach in someway to everybody.Solomon (Djimon Hounsou) is a pacific and innocent African native that trying to protect his family is captured by rebels and forced to work in a diamond mine. After witness several atrocities in the name of freedom and diamonds, Solomon finds a huge one and decides to keep it for himself (probably as a way to protect or recover his family); he is discovered in the intent and almost killed but saved the last minute by an enemy (or government army) attack. Danny (Leo di Caprio) on the other side is a white African mercenary doing weapon trade (for diamonds of course). Circumstances somewhat difficult to believe put these two on the road Solomon trying to get back his family and Danny the huge diamond.This light and sometimes forced storyline is used to cross over several African countries and see atrocities of every kind between Black African's native; and a few by White people. The images are so strong, that if do not feel at least some guilt seeing a diamond; it is just because you are blind or has strange life values or beliefs.It is true that white men created the huge mess in Africa; but it is also true that local corruption was (and is) the hand pressing the trigger. There are too many to blame for Africa's recent and not so recent history and the movie excels showing the cruelty behind it and even the absurdity of all that.However, the movie with all its good intentions is far from perfect. Perhaps shortening certain scenes and avoiding the ALL American moral ending could make the movie far better and do not diminish the impact of what you just saw; but as many movies intended to create some shock BUT NOT TOO MUCH, it almost implies that even when Americans consume 75% of world diamonds, they will never do it if they knew where they came from.Let's see how truth is in this statement.",7,3,7,4 December 2006
Midsommar," An unnecessary long and boring remake of The Wicker Man and The Wicker Tree
","The original Wicker Man (1973, with Christopher Lee) was not a terrifying movie until the very end but the suspense kept everybody guessing. The movie become a cult sensation (at least some of the final cuts of the film) not as an horror movie but as a metaphoric view of religion and society; there was some legends that the movie was based on real facts about Pagan cults, north of UK. The Wicker Tree has the same original director and a very similar story but instead of a Christian Police we have an Evangelical couple on a difficult relationship.
Midsommar takes basically the couple in crisis and a couple other characters, moves them to Sweden instead of UK.After a family tragedy; a girl joins her former boyfriend and some other friends, a group of grad students working on a thesis, on a visit to a Sweden community to appreciate the summer solstice celebration.They meet there white dressed community; quite inclined to drugs and rituals (and strange music).Ari Asher already showed he prefer style over substance (and story) on Hereditary (a movie that copy a lot from Rosemary baby's and other horror classics) but at least that movie was shorter.It seems he loves to film but hates editing; basically in love with his own scenes. Here, the continuous display of white dressed people dancing, playing instrumental music and doing strange rituals (in eternal daylight) becomes tediously repetitive without adding anything to the promised intrigue. Characters reactions became so absurd that even the movie laughs about some events. Clocking over 140 minutes the movie will be too slow even cutting an hour off. It is incredible that with such unnecessary length the resolution is rushed and confusing.There are couple of violent deaths shown, and a few others not. Everything quite predictable and not very engaging; because the director keeps distance with the main characters avoiding any empathy. In fact it is never clear if anyone is worth saving; specially Puig characters who is borderline obsessive and perhaps psychotic.In brief; there is no horror, the movie is tedious and far from entertaining. Critics praised it because its pictoric values, but people run out of the cinema after a while or start snoring. Skip this one and go to see something worth like THE FALL OF THE AMERICAN EMPIRE",1,94,175,4 July 2019
Elysium," Just perfect; but only for people with brains
","When was the last time you left a theater from a sci-fi movie really thinking. Well in my case, it was Neill Blomkamp previous masterpiece; 'DISTRICT 9'. Elysium is not for everybody. The strong social / apartheid critic on District 9; is magnified here ten times more. Those looking for brainless and empty action packed entertainment might be disappointed. The violence level is really high and almost non-stop; however there are no super-heroes here. Damon's character, gets beaten a lot and humor is almost absent; just because the reality been depicted here has nothing to laugh at.In LA 2154, an small percent of the population lives in a space station called Elysium where technology and cleanness let people live for a long time and illness are easily cured.While overpopulated Earth has become a factory field where poor people lives in unhealthy condition working as slaves and controlled by very fascist robot-policemenMax (Damon) plays a petty thief who in work accident gets contaminated (he is forced by a supervisor to enter in a dangerous place ) and will die in 5 days. His only option, try to reach Elysium and get cured; but that is not easy. Jodie Foster is Secretary Delancourt; the security chief of Elysium. She is not really kind with illegal immigration ('we must defend the house we built for our sons '; she states in one moment; forgetting they live in paradise thanks to the hell people in Earth are suffering).In order to get the resources to reach Elysium, Max must first steal secrets for an Earth gangster; but those secrets are really important for Mrs. Delancourt so she hires Kruger; an assassin / mercenary the kind government officials use and then discard. Things get pretty ugly. Everything that happens is a reference to social issues; not only in America but in other countries. A couple of Cuban friends; immediately cataloged the movie as 'SOCIALIST' or 'LEFT'; nothing far from the truth. The movie is only concern about the abuse that governments and governments officials do against common people.It is great movie; put your brain to work and see it immediately",10,16,42,9 August 2013
Beauty and the Beast," Another inferior remake of a very good movie
","People be advised; Disney industries are taking good old movies and remaking them in a cheap and fast way in order to extract new money out of older ideas. Recent Kong Island is a simple example. The movie is basically about half of Peter Jackson's King Kong version; but with lower productions values; minimum writing and barely no character definition (well Kong OK).This Beauty and the Beast has most digital images than the animated version; so considering this more realistic is no more than a joke. I give that Emma Watson (out of Ermione) was a good choice; she is capable, has charisma and obviously is drawing a lot of kids to the movie (who loved her on the Harry Potter's series). The rest; however is forgettable.Lumiere and Gaston steal the show as on the animated version; however while Chris Evans is able to do something with his character; Ewan Mc Gregor has not such luck since he is basically an animation that has a lot less to do than the original.The lowest point is the 'Be my guest' song; which was one of the highest achievement in the other version. The scene is confusing and not even nice to see. The ballroom scenes (another higher point of the original; nothing here).There are a couple of new songs that add nothing new or interesting and a few changes on the characters like the unnecessary rewriting as LeFou as gay. I understand that Disney wants to run with times; but this was no more than a very lame (and offensive) comic relief.I am not sure if Bill Condon (a sometimes good director ) was responsible or Disney executives did it; but this a cash cow that will make money but kill the flock.In brief; get the animated version and forget this crap",6,6,15,20 March 2017
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Harry's enemy is Hollywood not Voldemort
","There are already too many reviews of Harry Potter and the goblet of fire; however, I cannot pass the opportunity to express my disappointment with this last installment, script and director.The fourth Harry Potters book is probably the most complex and important of the series. It completes the setup, started on the 'Prisoner of Azkaban' which was the best adaptation yet of the series.'Goblet of fire' is a rather difficult book. It is not kid oriented at all. Hard matters like racism, government totalitarism, youth rebeldy and adult distrust are treated far from light all over the book. Something that continues even harder in 'Order of Phoenix'.Mike Newel, a romantic comedy creator, was in my opinion the worst selection for this one. He could probably be able to handle the first lighter installments but this one was a job for Cuaron or probably Tim Burton. This is far from his league and it shows.Newel / producers decided to make a 'Politically correct movie'. Subjects of racism and fascism together with government corruption and bureaucracy are nowhere to be seen here. The strong riot in the 'Quidditch World Cup' are gone, just a brief look of burned tents. The alteration of the news by a selfish reporter is barely seen and more as comic matter than the prejudice caused to everybody. Even the end has been lightened as much as possible (it is a miracle they did not change it at all).What is still there of course are the usual Hollywood blockbuster things. Very simple story, lots of action / digital effects (not too good, my 9 years old nephew said that the movie was 'too digital').Still, my biggest disappointment was J. K. Rowlings has become so money desperate to allow the slaughter of one of her best novels.Beware, the Harry Potter's series is really a literature classic. It is one of few books I ever read that span imagination while TEACHING DIFFICULT SUBJECTS that parents have difficult to touch.I want the whole series made movies as everybody else, but perhaps it is time to say enough. Literature is art, and a couple of 'functionaries' do not have the right to destroy art to fulfill their commercial needs.",4,0,0,28 November 2005
Pitch Perfect 2," Better than the first but far from being a good movie
","After recently seeing the first Pitch Perfect; I had absolutely not intention to see the second one; but unexpected reasons made me do it. On the good side; I can tell that there are more songs, some musical numbers are better presented than the first movie and there is a serious statement about art (music) being not cutting and pasting other peoples work but being creative. In any case; that serious moment does not goes any further. Compared to the first; some acting is a little better; but still Kendrick has zero charisma and Wilson is unfunny.The story on the first movie was an absurd collection of clichés without any real logic; this one is pretty much the same but as most of the original cast is here and a few more characters have been added; Banks (the director) had to force more absurd (and not really funny ) situations to give everybody some screen time or adding an extra musical number.The worse; is how insulting the movie is to common intelligence. Beyond the lack of logic; we never see of this people study; even when they are about to graduate. Even more surprising is where do they get resources for trips, vehicles, dressing, traveling and all other requirements to stage that kind of shows.Again; the absurdity of the situations is such that some characters even question it; but that is all.In brief; considering that the music moments are the only worth parts of this movie; get the soundtrack instead of losing your time.",4,1,24,31 May 2015
Whiplash," The fifty shades of Fletcher
","If you are really into S & M then forget that ultra tamed Grey movie and get into the real thing with this one. If you ever saw Fame (seventies original), you know that success in the artistic world is just pain. Even in something not so popular as the Jazz and classic music world; becoming just an orchestra member means suffering. Whiplash is the story of a drum player trying to succeed with a very extremely perfectionist but sadistic teacher. Did you ever consider drums and important part of a concert ? Yes; they are there but usually just as an accompanying instrument. Aside from STOMP; I really never care about a drum solo concert. Well, this movie will prove you wrong. There are moments in this picture you will hold your breath for the length of the scene; and some bloody moments will make you look elsewhere; but it is not an horror movie; is just a story of fighting your own frustration for some and for others about the God complex.J.K. Simmons is outstanding as Fletcher; the narcissistic and sadistic teacher; but Teller is also excellent as a mediocre person trying to get some kind of triumph in something. Whiplash is dark (there is almost not scenes with natural light) and humor is completely absent; but it will make you vibrate on pure emotion on the last scene the way you never imagined just hearing drums.",10,1,3,22 February 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," The first Scorsese comedy; and really good at it.
","If you consider this movie as a comedy; it is probably the best one of 2013. You are going to laugh very loud with this one and feel not guilt; because what happens here is real and quite serious. Jordan Belfort is a real person; it was one of those stock brokers that made tons of money scamming people (really ? or just doing what stockbrokers do ?). As in any moral tale this guy went to jail (otherwise you will never hear about what happened) for not paying properly to his major partner; Uncle Sam. The moral dilemma of the movie is that if this guy kept doing his job but pay his taxes he would never went to jail (in fact he did not go a hell hole). On the first few minutes; Mathew McConaughey in an outstanding cameo that really deserves him another Oscar; basically defines the whole movie. He basically describes how greed make people stupid and how smart people profit on that. After that outstanding moment, we enter in a full rage of orgies, drugs, more orgies, much more drugs and a series of debaucheries rarely seen in an American mainstream movie. I am pretty sure that there is more nudity and sex in this movie than the sum of all American movies in 2012, 2013 and perhaps next year too. It is not really too original; you will predict everything that will happen and how it will end; but this time Scorsese decide to go for laughs and Di Caprio, Hill, and most of the male cast went for it; making something fun and original out of something predictable. Di Caprio is outstanding ; completely believable as an ambitious youngster and then as a greedy and charismatic and egomaniac. Hill is always fun; but his character is not really half important. Kyle Chandler is very good as an FBI agent who might be not so convinced or perhaps is too coward to be bribed (or the book and / or movie did not dare to tell the whole truth). Jean Dujardin shines as the Swiss banker that basically hates his customer. The women here are not particularly interesting. Cristin Milioti (as Jordan's first wife) is able to give some personality to an otherwise underwritten character. Margot Robbie as Naomi (Jordan's lover and second wife) start as a bitch and we do not get anything else from her or her character. In brief; and excellent comedy of a very serious subject; that could have benefited from some trimming ; but otherwise always funny.",Null,1,6,26 December 2013
It Chapter Two," Same as the first part but not the same
","I saw the original made for TV (1990) movie which was considered at that time one of the best horror movies ever made. Considering the incredible success of the 2016 remake; it is obvious the material was really good and terrifying. Putting kids in danger always is.
I never read the IT book; but I understand that chapter two is basically within the same book.
Chapter 2; gather after 27 years the original 'Loosers Club' when the only member staying in town realizes Pennywise is still alive.It is not the same threatening kids than adults; so Muscetti uses lots of flashbacks with the original kids; but as we already know who survives there is no much to be scare there. So to compensate that, the movie takes the characters apart;. creates a few horror scenes for each character and then join them together in the final act in the big confrontation.I cannot deny that I had several jumps on my seat; after the first two hours the movie becomes repetitive as the horror scenes and there is still another 50 minutes to go.In terms of acting; Bill Skarsgard perfectly fill up Tim Curry shoes and sometimes is ever more terrifying.As the adults; Bill Hader and James Ransone are the ones who really shine mostly because they are the comic relief. Chastain is completely lost here; her character is less written than the younger one. Mc Avoid is better but his characters is also underwritten. The rest is just standard fare.In brief; if you see the first one you probably will want to see the second; but it is not really as good or terrifying",6,1,3,6 September 2019
Kong: Skull Island," Barely OK King Kong reboot
","Kong is basically a reboot of King Kong but with two main differences:All the action takes place in Skull Island (where Kong was originally found). Kong is less humanized than the original. Here he is a big monkey that protects its zone. Still his character is better defined than the rest; which makes sense since he is the real protagonist.However; as interesting as it looks an island full of monsters, there is not much you can do after a while without being repetitive; so you need to include human conflicts in between (thus the A list cast ) and there is when the movie fails. Characters are mostly unlikable and all of them under developed characters. The charismatics Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson have to deal with character that barely written. They are both quite capable so their chemistry works (but not thanks to the script). John C. Reilly, comedy skills and sympathy are wasted with very little opportunity to do anything interesting. What John Goodman and Toby Kebbell are doing in this movie is almost a mystery. Their characters die pretty quick and nobody really cares. Kebbell also plays Kong; he is not bad but a far cry from Andy Serkis in Peter Jackson version (again it is probably not his fault since here Kong is a beast most of the time). Samuel Jackson has done nutcase and bad guys before; he is efficient here but has done better in other movies.Shea Whigham, Jason Mitchell and Corey Hawkins are the only characters that have a few (seconds of) good moments and interest; sadly the movie did not use them a little more.In terms of FX and digital images; the quality is superb and some action scenes are really outstanding; but it barely cover half of the movie time (or less).Making the Kong less human is an artistic decision. The original was, like Beauty and the Beast, a love history here is hinted but no more.In brief; the movie is entertaining and fills out almost two hours of your time without making your brain work at all. But if you are looking for spectacular images and monsters; see The Great Wall. Is a little less brainless and the images are a work of art. If you only want to see Kong; see this one but later get the Peter Jackson version and you will see the difference between a work of love and just a Disney mass marketed product.",7,4,7,10 March 2017
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Very good but not LOTR The Return of the King
","The third part of the Hobbit (The Battle of the Five Armies) it just takes a few pages of the Hobbit book. When you consider that the full book is about 150 pages and you can read it in 3 or four hours; it is difficult to understand how can Jackson made 7.5 hours trilogy (about 9 on the extended cut). Well basically adding characters and secondary events to the main story. Was that good ? It was not bad; but a little less could have been better.As a book; The Hobbit is really a kids tale. There is no much character development; the message is quite simple and the end is somewhat sad. There is some mention of the ring but it is not a prequel to Lord of the Ring (or at least it was not originally conceived that way).The in itself covers three situations/action settings; the attach and killing Smaug; the battle of the five armies and the end which is basically a farewell.I was surprised the first set was so contained. It is spectacular but not that impressive.The second set; the battle is more spectacular but still not impressive; until the end; Two man to man (or man to Orc and Elf to Orc) fights (not part of the book) are far more suspenseful and touching than the rest of the movie.I believe Jackson got tired (or out of ideas) on those massive battles. He kept them for the public; but he was far more interested in the love triangle between Dwarf, Elf and Elf.In brief; it is not boring at all and worth the price of the ticket; besides these two sagas took too many years to be made right.",8,17,33,17 December 2014
Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War," Best war (or antiwar) movie ever
","If anybody, after Apocalypses Now and Saving Private Ryan or even worse, the very little but depressing information we are getting about the Iraq work, still thinks that war is an adventure, I recommend him (or her) to pick up a gun and take the first plane, boat or car to go there and send back one of the thousand soldiers that do not to want to be there any more. As I sure many war supporters will not do that, just because supporting the war with a car sticker and from our comfortable home is, well, just comfortable; at least spend two and a half ours to see one of the most touching and realistic war movie ever made.The most important, and sad thing is that this movie is from South Korea, a country that lived a hard civil war and they are still fearing it. The sad part, is because American audiences hate to read subtitles, but if your mind needs more than Hollywood FX and repetitive shallow stories; then this movie will touch you very very deep.This is the story of two low class brothers, the elder overprotecting the youngest, recruited (against their will) in the 1950's Korean War. In order to get this brother out of danger, the older must became a con-decorated hero (or probably a con-decorated dead hero), so he embarks in any suicidal mission or risk situation possible.As he became famous, his personality changes and becomes more a beast than a human being, killing every enemy in front of him (armed or not). The movie carries us very realistic on the destruction of war (the carnage is but as enormous), but clearly state that the real damage occurs inside these poor people minds. We see how they are used (and abused) on a purely political fight and constantly betrayed but their own governments and superiors.The last act of the movie, after and unexpected twist, is somehow unnecessary and predictable, but the immense acting skills of the two leads make for a very touching ending.In terms of production values and script, TAEGUKGI (Brotherhood at war) competes and surpasses many Hollywood productions even Spielber's SPR.Advice; rent the movie or buy the DVD but DO NOT MISS IT.",10,6,8,22 June 2005
The Secret Life of Pets," The best kids movie this side of the summer
","If you are looking for a movie full of dramatic moments; slow pace and sadness; that basically bore your kids but make the critics praise as a masterpiece; stop reading and go to see some PIXAR / Disney movie (like Dory or Zootopia) and watch your kids get impatient to get out of the cinema. If on the other hand; you want your kids to laugh non-stop for about 90 minutes and you enjoy with them; then do not loose one minute, get tickets for the Secret Life of Pet and start laughing on the first minute with the Minions short and keep doing it short until the very end of titles. There is some moral message about friendship, trust and love; but it will be guilty pleasure laugh and a few suspenseful moments.***SPOILER AHEAD**** Word of advice and possible spoiler; Snowball (the rabbit) is the most twisted character seen lately in movies; it can easily be part of an horror movie; but as played by Kevin Hart; it is historically funny whenever on screen. The same can be said for Gidget (played by Jenny Slate); her transition from a white sweet puppy to a dangerous and terrifying fighter is another of the top moments of the movie. ****END OF SPOILER****In brief; it will not win any Oscars; but is still the funniest movie of the summer.",10,34,64,10 July 2016
Centurion," Better than GLADIATOR and 300
","CENTURION is very different war movie. There are not really good guys; in fact everybody is really cruel; so even if told through the Roman's eyes, it is clearly stated that they are as barbaric as their enemies (the Britain PICTOS). It is a British movie about how the British barbarians defeated the more sophisticated (and powerful) Roman Empire. Directed by Neil Marshall (the genius behind Dog Soldiers, The Descent and DOOMSDAY) do not expect standard fare action movie (even when action and gore are usually over the top). Acting is good and character development is exactly what is needed (there are usually some dark sides left to viewers imagination).In brief; good action and gore but a very very good movie.",8,2,10,6 September 2010
The Dark Knight Rises," Bore-man rises
","Quick short comment; DARK KNIGHT RISES is boring, the action scenes are not interesting and the plot is absurd. Acting is fine but some dialogues are unintelligible. Now; let's expand: - At almost three hours, this movie pace is terrible. - Action scenes are very spaced but not spectacular (aside from a few mass movements the rest is pretty rudimentary). Even the airplane highjack, publicized as made without digital effects, does not look that impressive. - Most of the actors deliver; but trying to understand Michael Caine long diatribes or even Tom Hardy behind Bane's mask requires a lot of effort. - There are outstanding performances like Gary Oldman and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the real heroes and most developed characters. Anne Hathaway gets easily away with the treacherous CAT WOMAN and Marion Cotillard completely take over the screen when she is in it. Last, the plot; even fantasy requires a logic; but this is not the case here. In order to justify the revolution and kaos, Nolan created a series of unrealistic events: - A respected senator, gives up everything after a few hours of meeting CAT WOMAN; and an army of SWAT teams, appears in a matter of seconds after someone use the senator's phone. - A computer scam puts a billionaire in state of bankruptcy in a matter of hours; causing even his car to be repossessed - Why taking over Wayne's company when Bane knows everything about everything; even BATMAN's identity. - The newcomer Blake, knows BATMAN identity; but the police chief has no hint at all (even when he ask somebody to contact Bruce Wayne about BATMAN). - What is logic on taking over a city to be blown up three months later? . Besides; what GOTHAN has to do with the personal vendetta behind all this ?. It is not the first time, Goyer's writing breaks logic just to justify some event and Nolan did the same in INCEPTION making the last act absurd; but this time the went as far as breaking almost every possible logic just to make the movie darker and force twists. It is even worse (or lame) that following up on the previous movie; they insist on stating that real facts should be hidden for the common people and the creation of FAKE IDOLS (heroes) are necessary to keep society controlled (a very fascist concept also used by Stalin ).",3,11,25,21 July 2012
Mother!," A strange concept for a movie
","A lot has been said already about what the movie is about so without going into too much detail I will express my humble opinion. There are many possible lectures about this movie the obvious one is that 'Mother' is nature, Him is 'God' and pretty much nature destroys creation when attacked forcing God to start over again.A second interpretation could be an insecure woman who tries to create a whole universe around her and his husband; but he is not happy in that confinement so she ends in her craziness she ends up destroying everything she cannot control.I love movies that make you think; and the first interpretation is an 'ECOLOGIC' one; but far from subtle. Aronofsky is not David Lynch; his metaphoric expressions have very little subtlety but he gets to the point (whichever it is).The second interpretation; makes the movie the complete opposite to 'Rosemarie's Baby'. Perhaps this is just a writer creating a story taking elements from religious symbols (Adam, Eve, Cain, Able, Jesus, Communion ) and failing to reach his goal.Acting is very good; but the over use of Lawrence face feels too much. She is a great actress; but I do not think he was the perfect match for the role. Barden is great as always; he is one of the best and most intense actors around. Under using him is a real sin. More screen time for him and Ed Harris should have made the movie fantastic. Pfieffer is always good even when the character is irritating.In brief; out of curiosity give it a look; at least it will make you thing a lot.",8,4,10,17 September 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," An uninspired remake of Episode IV; the Force was not strong with the writers!!!
","Do not be fooled with all the mystery. The Force Awakens is a poorly remake on Episode IV; the original Star Wars. 1-Small robot lost in a deserted planet carrying a map with something (originally was a blue print) 2-Robot found by a young person who does not know but has a strong connection with the Force (originally was a boy now is a girl) 3-Escape from the planet helped by Hans Solo and Chewbacca and another person (originally Obi Wan now an ex trooper) 4-The big bad guy uses a mask and dress in black 5-Rebels get the map 6-Rebels attack huge planet/weapon by shooting on a hole and finally in the last minute blowing it before it destroy another planet (originally the planet/weapon was smaller) 7-Main character killed by the bad guy in black To make matters even more similar there is some kind of Emperor, a British general that does not like the black bad guyI am pretty sure J.J. Abrams will defend is similar items as an homage to the original; but in my opinion this is just recycling and not particularly original.Ignoring this few similarities; lets focus on the new things:1-The main Jedi character is a girl called Rey (Daisy Ridley is OK but still too green to carry a movie by herself). Besides her character is even more childish and very little defined. Luke which at least has a motivation for fighting.2-Hans Solo is replace by a black guy (I do not think he is African American since this is outer space) who instead of being an scumbag is a troop deserter (John Boyega; really very good and capable of getting a few good laugh); but is still not interesting enough to carry the movie.3-R2D2 has been replace by BB-8; very cute and digitally enhanced to be almost alive; but it does not even come closer to the personality Lucas infuse in the R2D2 coupled with C3PO 4-Christoper Lee was replaced by Domhnall Gleeson; something I rather erase from my mind.5-Joda is replace by something like a Chinese woman with a lot of cheap philosophical statements (like the Light Sable is calling his master). (Joda was not in the original Star Wars but somehow is the most remembered character).On the plus side; there is more humor than the original; and the action scenes and environments are more impressive; considering it cost perhaps 50 times more than the original and there were huge digital advances in the last 38 years; the achievement is not impressive.Which is impressive and sad; is all the media attention and public deceiving to the public that Disney Corp and Abrams created on a movie that even if entertaining is not really superior to the original.",5,24,45,18 December 2015
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," In the future AVOID any movie with Mr. Yates as director
","Harry Potter's saga had many directors; I will not go back again to who was the best (hint; a Mexican guy), but by far Mr. Yates was the worst. Mr. Yates was only interested in make an easy sell PRODUCT. The only reason the first was paced was to fill out two movies with only one book. Now, we are at the end so WHO CARES, let's just finish it, get the money and keep going. Clocking barely two hours, it feel rush and incomplete; missing lots of interesting (and even important) parts on one of the richer book of the series. Hermione and Ron do almost nothing; the others even less. Harry gets a lot of screen time but not necessary good scenes. Even the battle at Hogwarts (the only part Mr. Yates seems to be interested ) is a lame copy of 'The Two Towers' without any kind of emotion. His direction so bad and unimaginative that when most of the characters die; we do not feel anything. In brief; worth seeing to understand how better the book is and because it is the last one; but AVOID any further movies with David Yates as director.",Null,69,104,15 July 2011
Pitch Perfect," What a piece of crap
","Surprised by the unexpected success of the Pitch Perfect 2; I decided to give a try to the first part. Not that I was planning to see the second but out of curiosity. Let's clarify; I like music but know nothing about the mechanic of it. An acquaintance; well versed in opera, told me that you can get sounds with your mouth and throat than no other instrument can; so the premise of an 'a capella' movie must be something interesting.Well; do not lose you time. There are a few know songs but it is hard to believe the music was not instrumental. Choreographs OK; but not better than GLEE which is free to watch. The story is so full of clichés that the characters predict the outcome. The situations and motivations are absurd; but the resolution are even worse It is really not a surprise since characters are not properly defined; so their behavior change according to the movie needs.Acting is terrible. Brittany Snow is able to cause empathy follow in a second place by Skylar Astin; but the rest of the cast is awfully forced or uninterested or boring(like Anna Kendrick ). The worse surprise was Rebel Wilson; she is absolutely not funny.How poorly is this movie directed and scripted that John Michael Higgins and Elizabeth Banks are there also (she is one of the producers and future director of the second installment ) like in Greeks plays as 'narrators' basically informing us that performance is good or bad.Again; I know nothing about mechanic of music; but I am pretty sure judges in this kind of competitions evaluate sound quality and originality over modern songs.In brief; do not lose your time.In fact; the only the only moment trying to do something smart",1,27,44,29 May 2015
Deadpool," A absolutely necessary refresh of the Marvel's movies
","After painfully regretted wasting my money on the mediocre (to put it mildly) Age of Ultron (or Avengers 2); basically a carbon copy of the first Avengers minus the humor, any kind of emotion or coherence; I decided to dedicate my resources to serious creators, not to studios only dedicated to squeeze a cash cow far beyond dead. I caught ANT- MAN in a long flight and just because there was really anything else to watch so I gave it a try; and enjoyed almost two hours of decent fun time. The movie was not good but at least it wasn't taking itself too serious and Paul Rudd did a good job.When I heard about DEADPOOL; perhaps the funnier character in Wolverine; played by Ryan Reynolds a guy who can take sarcasm to the next level and without the constrains of the PG-13 rating; I decided to give the movie an opportunity and I was not disappointed.Without the limitations of kids oriented movies (but still restrained in my opinion); DEADPOOL can say and show things any other movie of this kind would not dare. There is some nudity (nothing erotic), a sex scene (not too erotic either but played for laughs), strong bloody violence and continuous F-bombs and cruel one-liners that might not be appropriate for kids (I doubt many kids will understand most of the jokes). Could the movie have been better; perhaps a more developed villain could have helped (however this is the kind of movie where the main character is interesting) or perhaps less restraint in images side not only the verbals. MARVEL's made a bet with this movie; but it was not huge one. The production values are fine but there is no extra money for cameo or big names (Reynolds break the fourth wall a few times and joke about the money constrains).In brief; it is the funniest Marvel yet and really deserves a public with brains)",9,6,17,15 February 2016
John Wick: Chapter 2," Almost perfect
",The first John Wick was such an original and perfectly crafted movie that 10 out of 10 seems only fair. The sequel lacks the originality of the first one but carries I higher level of dark humor.The end however is so sad that I only hope Chapter Three takes less than than three years to arrive. The sad ending (which is perfect by the way but humanizes the character perhaps too much) is the only reason I gave 9 out of 10 stars. Chad Stahelski the stuntman turned director of this one and the first; knows a few things about action movies and overused clichés. The stunt sequences are impressive and clichés are used as dark jokes between the impossible to follow body count. Almost everybody in the theater was laughing and/or gasping with every scene change. The prologue of the movie where Peter Stormare (usually a very bad guy which always dies) gives the finest comedy moments of his career in during a maelstrom of killings and car crashes and as a final touch his life is spared.After that hyper-active beginning the movie slows down for a few minutes (it needs some story line to justify what comes next) and re-start with a higher level of violence but dialog to a minimum ('He does not like to waste words' a character states).In brief; more violent and with more humor than the first one; so do not think; just go an see it once or twice at least.,9,18,38,12 February 2017
Gangs of New York," An American history lesson for adults
","I absolutely disagree with all those peoples considering GANGS OF NEW YORK a minor Scorsese's movie.  Scorsece had created different kinds of masterpieces on different subjects, and also some failures ( which is not the case).After the incredible filmed and orchestrated beginning battle, seems start to look rather conventional (Father killed, son looking for revenge), but a few minutes later, you realize that things are a lot more complicated than originally seemed. That the story keeps twisting every time, because the main characters (specially THE BUTCHER played by Day-Lewis) are three dimensional human beings so it is not to easy to judge them as saints or evil. However, with all the moral ambiguities growing every second, the  story is just an excuse to glue several historical facts (as the infamous CONSCRIPTION DRAFT), to tell the chronicle an important part of a young nation, but most of all, to make the MOST IMPORTANT STATEMENT ABOUT RACISM ever delivered (Jewish were not the target here  and even Black people were not the main focus; just Europeans against Europeans). 
Is very hard to accept that most of the blood splatter on the birth of this nation was related to racial issues.  My feeling (based on the last scene which clearly show the TWIN TOWERS) is that Scorsece is making an analogy between past and present events. It will be up to each viewer to agree or argue that.The movie itself is not perfect, but with a running time of  more than two hours and a half, some things could fail. One of them is the uninteresting love story between Amsterdam(Di Caprio ) and Jenny (Diaz).  Probably the only conventionalism in the movie, the lack of passion in the two scenes together is something I blame more to the Director than the actors. Scorsece eliminated any moment of erotic or sexual tension between these two characters when the first scene together was so promising . Probably as a compensation, he kept lots of breast (not full nudity only breasts) on other gratuitous scenes.  There was a matter of MPAA rating (I heard that the European version is longer and a lot more sexual), which is another stupid thing. I don't think kids below 17 could be interested or should see this movie, then what is the reason to cut it ?.Performances, are a mixed bag. Daniel Day Lewis is SUPERB and Oscar worthy. Just a notch down are Liam Neeson, Jim Broadbent, John C Reilly and Brendan Gleeson; all of them creating ambiguous characters.  Di Caprio, does a good job, and is not miscast as many people believe, but his character has not many more possibilities.  Cameron Diaz, gives an almost decent performance, but her Jenny, is not really more than accessory to keep things running so or writers did not developed or it was left on the cutting room.",Null,0,0,19 January 2003
Spectre," Mendez and Craig new milestone Worst Bond Movie Ever !!! Avoid it !!
","James Bond or Agent 007 has been since it beginning in books and specially in movies the standard male fantasy. He can seduce any women, practice every sport and win, drink as much as he wished and never get drunk, live all the fashion. drive the best cars (preferable Aston Martin) or any other vehicle (like jets, Helicopters, boats) and fight and kill any enemy without regret. The Regan era; and sadly most of his followers; consider the emblematic British spy as a piece of crap and decided to moralize it; both Timothy Dalton movies kisses required an AIDS test. Luckily Pierce Brosnan's Bond was somewhat a back to the origins. He smiled and made jokes;, seduced women, drink and kill when necessary; but some Hollywood asshole and a few absurd critics; decided it was becoming a parody and wanted for Jason Bourne style. A killer without personality looking for vengeance. Those critics; obviously did not know or even care to understand that Bond's movies were meant for entertainment and never to be taken seriously. It gave us the people who lived and suffered the Cold War; some hope that WW III will not happen.But; the people who control movie industry decided to think for the people and very little care about public want. So they created this monster. Daniel Craig's Bond is basically a tortured person looking for vengeance. Humor is gone; and it is hard to believe a person without any kind of charisma could seduce anybody or even have any friend.His previous three movies; had at least a decent action scenes that compensated somehow for the lack of fun in the full movie; but this time Mendez and Craig decided to ruin everything for everybody.The peak of the movie is the short sequence before the titles. It is somewhat original (at least the helicopter part); but nothing after that comes even closer to be entertaining.To make matters worse; Tom Cruise's MI-Rogue Nation; has basically the same script. In fact Cruise's self righteous movie has infinite more humor and ten times more action than this absurd drama.Mendez who did a good thing with Javier Barden in the previous movie; waste in this one group of outstanding actors never letting do anything interesting.Christoph Waltz has little change to become an interesting villain and whenever he is able to show his charisma; something stupid happens (who has the stupid idea of making them foster brothers ?). Monica Bellucci is there for no reason. Léa Seydoux could have been replaced for a cardboard; since her chances to act are minimal. Ralph Fiennes looks bored in his short screen time; obviously because his character is not interesting at all.As I stated before; in terms of action; aside from the first scene; there is not much more. There are a car and plane chase that is interesting. a car chase that is too simple and too dark to enjoy, a few clichéd fights with Dave Bautista and others, a few shootings and an explosion at the end that is simple cheap.None of the action pieces makes a lot of sense and do not take more than half hour in total; so the other two hours of the movie are basically bad acting (Craig with this stone face), terrible dialog (everywhere) and a few postal shots of a train in the desert.It is obvious the movie was troubled when start and director; after making history on create the most successful Bond ever; both want to quit.Why they accepted, other than contractual obligations and a paycheck, are beyond my knowledge; but does not justify this disaster. We the public do not deserve this type of insult.In brief; a very bad movie that you should avoid and let the producers know this is not the kind of cinema we are willing to see.",1,121,241,15 November 2015
V for Vendetta," Governments must be afraid of people not people afraid of the governments
","A few days ago, a city inspector or norm enforcer functionary gave me $ 100 fine for being parked in MY OWN HOUSE. Reason, just because two of my wheels were on the lawn and that damage the beauty of my neighborhood. When I tried to talk to his supervisor, I questioned and humiliated like a common criminal in the City Hall office. The conclusion of the discussion was 'WE WONT BE TALKING ANY MORE WITH YOU, PLEASE LEAVE'.I remember that before September 11th five years ago, USA was the FREEDOM country. But, after the tragic events, government officials (police and civil servants) had been, invoking our security, abusing of their power and mistreated citizens and all of us had been closing our mouths and humbled.Now, five years after and for the first time a movie dare to talk about the abuse on the people and it does in a really very fearless way. 'V FOR VENDETTA' is being sold as a comic which is really it is; however not the type of movie is you will be seeing a second or third installment (well everything is possible in Hollywood).Completed a few years ago, the movie was not released until now (commercial reasons or fear?). Now that the American government is being questioned about everything that happened in recent years this movie comes with another theory about everything.The story does not happens in the USA (neither was the comic), but the events depicted are easily related. There was a huge massacre attributed to the Muslim terrorist and a Chancellor using that to become a 'DEMOCRATIC DICTATOR'. The movie clearly suggests government intervention on terrorism blamed events.Other current events are shown. The use of 'FOR YOUR SAFETY' propaganda and the abuse of lies in the media in order to keep the people frightened and accept every possible abuse. Did I mention corruption on the highest government levels, tortures and people kidnapping? Due to its strong political subject, 'V FOR VENDETTA' is a must see movie which does not means is really a great movie. The rhythm is uneven; there is far more talk than action (probably because the great Hugo Weaving never take out the mask) and many implausibilities (like Portman's torture). The acting is very good Stephen Rea and Natalie Portman are able to carry the movie most of the time. John Hurt is a little too much as the hideous Chancellor.",8,1,3,16 March 2006
