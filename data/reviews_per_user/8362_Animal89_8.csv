Ghost," best film of the 90s
","WARNING: contains a few SPOILERSThis is with out a doubt, one of the best films of the 90s. Its funny, witty, clever, romantic and never boring. It sounds like a horror or suspense film and thats exactly what i thought when i first watched it, but believe it or not, this is more of a romantic comedy and there is (nor meant to be) anything scary about it whatsoever. With a well picked, all-star cast along with a clever and romantic story line and some unforgettable moments, ghost is a fantastic choice for anyone who simply enjoys great movies.Recommended: to anyone who enjoys romantic comedies or generally funny films, or are fans of Whoopi Goldberg, Demi Moore or Patrick Swayze.Not recommended: to no one reallyWatch this if you liked: Casper",8,3,4,31 May 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," FANTASTIC!!! 9 out of 10 at least
","FANTASTIC!!! 9 out of 10 at least. A great combination of action, adventure, comedy, mystery and a touch of romance. All in real Disney style. Anyone who has been on the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' Disney ride will notice a few odd jokes that others don't see, so you'll get a few extra laughs. Johnny Depp is hilarious, the special effects are ground breaking and edge of the art, the fight sequences are fantastic, the music is addictive, and this whole film is a feature you'll want to watch again and again. This is a film that almost anyone can enjoy but I would particularly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Johnny Depp (from hell, sleepy hollow, secret window) or the producer Jerry Bruckheimer (bad boys II, top gun, armageddon, pearl harbor). If you enjoy this film then look out for its sequel due out in 2006.",8,0,2,24 May 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," mother nature gets her REVENGE!!!
","WARNING:contains a few minor SPOILERSI had low expectations when i went to see this film and was actually pleasantly surprised. It was much less of a special effects parade than i thought it would be and focuses more on the factual and emotional parts of things. It is the sort of thing that makes you think about what would happen when we push global warming to its limits, how will nature take its revenge? And how long have we got left till it does?Is it already too late? It is also a fantastic sight to see tornadoes rip through LA and flood water pour through the streets of New York with the lady liberty up to her waist in it.Recommended: to anyone who enjoys disaster movies or takes interest in global warming or the end of the world.Not recommended: to anyone who is paranoid about the end of the world or global warming or are afraid of flying.Watch this if you liked: Independence Day, Twister, Volcano, Armageddon",7,0,0,2 June 2004
Little Miss Sunshine," The Breakfast club hits the road. Best movie this year so far.
","I love going to the cinema and seeing a film that completely and totally original, something that is just nothing like anything I've ever seen before and so my response to 'Little Miss Sunshine' was one of love at first sight.The narrative follows a pattern similar to the legendary 'The Breakfast Club' before it. A dysfunctional family whose youngest daughter Olive has made it to the final of the little miss sunshine contest must travel to California and by a string of bad luck the entire family ends up coming along.Every member of the family is unique and they are all superbly portrayed by a talented and well-picked cast with each character being original and well developed. However what makes 'Little Miss Sunshine' so fantastic is the chemistry between the characters. As the trip begins a wall can almost be seen around each individual character as they dwell silently in their own problems. As things start to go wrong and bad moves to worse, one by one the family opens up to one and other, their stories sporting hilarious but frequently moving results and the relationships between them are truly touching.Now for the new and completely original and brilliant part. This film strikes the perfect blend between extremely moving drama and its comic element. Its brand of humour is beautifully original and very odd. As the film gets moodier and more intense the humour gets blacker and so blends with the feel of the film meaning that no gag is out of place and that many comedic parts actually add to the mood of the film. This allows the audience to laugh and enjoy the film but still take it seriously for what it is. It is all topped off with a final scene that is so bizarre and unpredictable you won't know weather to laugh or simply look sheepish.It's a fantastically black comedy and moving drama with a unique and touching look at family life. Best of all it was the most original film this year and in an age of sequels, second sequels, spin-offs and remakes, originality is becoming a precious gem which is getting increasingly rare. The last truly original film the I saw was 'Pirates of the Caribbean; The Curse Of The Black Pearl', and that was 3 years ago.Also recommended; The Breakfast ClubForrest Gump",9,1,4,15 September 2006
Spider-Man," not just a kiddies super hero film
","when my mate first dragged me off to the cinema to see spider-man the movie, i was really not looking forward to it as i was expecting to be watching a kiddies super hero film. i was wrong. spider-man is anything but a kiddies super hero film. its a love story, a tragedy, an action film and a sci-fi all rolled into one with a well chosen cast, clever story line and edge of the art special effects.one of the best things about this film, is that unlike a lot of super hero films, there is no clear line between good and evil, their is no real bad guy and no real good guy. all characters seem to have good sides and bad sides, and different reasons for each. try looking at the story from different characters points of view and you'll see what i mean.8/10recommended; to anyone who likes tragedies , love films, action or science fiction. or to fans of the spider-man or marvel comics.not recommended; maybe to very young kids as this is a bit more violent than the cartoon.watch this if you liked; hulk, LXG movie, spider-man series or comics, marvel comics.",8,0,1,20 July 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," much better than the other two
","WARNING: contains very minor SPOILERSThis is the best Harry Potter film so far and beats the other films by 100 miles. This film is a lot less plastic than the other two especially the first and has a much simpler but solid story line, it also doesn't confuse you by showing all the lessons which have nothing to with the story. It also has a less clear line between goody and bady and lets you have the freedom to make up your own mind. The special effects are finally starting to get better as well. My only criticism of this film is that in the first half it rushes right to the last few chapters of the book and a lot of important information either goes past to fast to notice or isn't there at all.Recommended: to anyone who enjoys the Harry Potter series in books or films or likes fantasy in general. Or is a fan of anyone in the cast.Not recommended: maybe to young kids, this one is scarier than the other twoWatch this if you liked: The other 2 Harry Potter films, the Harry Potter books, lord of the rings, the worst witch (TV)",8,0,0,5 June 2004
Schindler's List," bought a tear to my eye
","There were a lot of war films made that were focused on the holocaust or shoah, but there are probably none that iv seen or heard that come with in reach of the effectiveness, power and shear touching emotion of schindlers list. I'm not one to cry over a film, (in fact i don't think i ever have) but on more than one occasion during this film, tears came to my eyes.I think the reason that schindlers list is so effective, is that it feels so real, instead of simply showing you the holocaust, it puts you right into it. You feel the pain and suffering felt by those in the film. You feel guilty about sitting on your comfortable sofa munching on your big tub of popcorn, watching so many people suffer.The effect of the black and white picture is that it makes it even more real as most of the footage from the holocaust is in black and white, it also allows you to pick up a few small but vital details.It the soundtrack is moving and deserves all the praise and awards it got.Recommended; to people who take an interest in the holocaust or spielberg films in generalNot recommended; to people who don't like films that are sad or make you cry, this is definitely not going to be your scene.Watch this if you liked; the diary of anne frank",8,9,13,17 July 2004
Shrek," The ULTIMATE fairy tale spoof
","I never saw this film on the big screen and am still kicking myself for it, but when i did eventually see it i could not help but love it. This is the ultimate fairy tale spoof telling the original fairy classic with a few hilarious twists in the tale. It spins off from almost every fairy tale ever written, as well as classic TV shows, films and celebrities.This 5 star favourite includes and all star cast with the hilarious talents of the ever great Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy, along with a rocking sound track and some side splitting humour, this is a blockbuster not to be missed and a film to remember.Recommended: to anyone who is a fan of anyone in the cast of enjoys film spoofs or comediesNot recommended: to absolutely no-one",8,3,4,9 June 2004
