Walk the Line," Moving, passionate film
","I didn't know very much about Johnny Cash or June Carter before seeing this movie, so I went into it not knowing what to expect. What I found was a rip-roaring, fiery, passionate film about a man dealing with the price of fame, painful events of his past, a difficult relationship with his father and his enduring love for a woman other than his wife.Pheonix as Cash is brilliant and doesn't let up the intensity of his performance once- Witherspoon is the same, full of gusto and passion. The supporting cast are all great and lend to the tapestry of the film brilliantly. The film also gave me the chance to get to know Cash's music. Pheonix and Witherspoon are both amazing at this and you again get a sense of intensity and passion from them both. Amazing film, 10/10.",10,1,2,8 April 2006
Star Trek," Star Trek is Back
","So, Star Trek 09. The resurrection of the franchise, or it's destruction? For me, it's the resurrection- at last, Star Trek moves beyond the stale, tired formula it employed for Voyager and Enterprise, and it's free of the blight that was Nemesis. Star Trek is reinvented and invigorated.Is the film perfect? No, of course not. Will it please every Trekkie? Definitely not (we're a fickle bunch, and we all have our own opinions about what Star Trek should be). Did it please this particular Trekkie? Absolutely! It was fun, full of energy, and it got people talking about Star Trek again.",9,0,0,16 February 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Into Greatness
","So, JJ Abrams sequel to the 2009 Star Trek film is finally here. I saw it last night, and now I offer up my thoughts and opinions. Be warned, this page contains MAJOR SPOILERS! I've tried to avoid doing so, but I make no promises, so if you don't want to know the juicy details, stop reading.... round about now.OK, so on with the review. First impressions? Great film. The title is a little misleading- the film has darker moments than the first installment, but it's still quite lively and exciting. The story moves a long at quite a fast pace, and by the time you're done getting over one particularly dramatic moment, there's another.Kirk and Spock's relationship, as well as Kirk's relationship with Starfleet at large and even his other senior officers, is strained at times in this film. He is eager to prove himself after a knock-back, keen to avenge the death of his mentor, and believes the rules and regulations are an impediment to his progress. He learns that his recklessness can prove costly- having not lost a single member going into the film, this soon changes as his mission and personal quest takes him deep into the heart of Klingon space, and then takes him back to face an enemy nestled within the heart of Starfleet- an enemy playing Kirk off against another enemy.The villain? Well, lets state the obvious- it's Khan, and Cumberbatch plays the role brilliantly. He is ruthless, cold and determined, and steals the show.There are some unexpected cameos- Leonard Nimoy reprises his role as Spock Prime for a nice little moment, and we get some interesting role reversals- not to mention a rehash of the epic cry 'Khaaaaan!' It's a tad cheesy but certainly entertaining! The action sequences are amazing. The Enterprise falling from space toward earth has to be seen to be believed, and the 'fight' between the Klingons and Khan is very impressive. Visually the film is a feast. One I would certainly watch again, and I eagerly await the DVD!",8,10,24,10 May 2013
The Terminator," A Legend is Born...
","It's fair to say The Terminator film, made on the comparative cheap, propelled both James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger to the pinnacle of stardom. Not only that, but the film would give rise to a huge franchise.The Terminator is the perfect vehicle for Arnold- his physique lends itself naturally to the role of an unstoppable killing machine, and his movements in this film are robotic and cold. There is not a single sense of mercy from this machine- the Terminator is a creepy, relentless killer.The Terminator is also one of Linda Hamilton's earliest roles and her character of Sarah Connor, the mother of humanity's saviour, is a role she would come to be closely identified with. Her wide-eyed, innocent character has her world shattered, and Hamilton's performance is good. She conveys this perfectly.Michael Biehn plays the desperate, war-weary Kyle Reese, the man sent back in time to somehow protect Sarah from the Terminator. His aggression, his rigid military attitude, slowly gives way to pain and torment- both because of what he's been through and because he falls in love with Sarah, ultimately becoming the father of the very man who sent him back in time.The special effects are great for the time and watching the film today, it still looks good, which is remarkable considering when it was made. There are several stand-out scenes (including where the Terminator rises out of the fire) and the whole film is a fast-paced, gritty, nervy tale, as you wonder how the good guys can possibly destroy the machine chasing them.Things end on a poignant note- the Terminator is destroyed, but Kyle dies. Sarah then has to face the future, knowing that sooner or later, a great storm is coming.",9,1,1,18 December 2013
Forrest Gump," A Beautiful Film
","There are few films that possess a truly breathtaking and epic feel to them these days. Many try, but don't succeed. Forest Gump succeeded in feeling epic to me, even though when it boils down to it, the film is about one person.That one person is one of the most remarkable characters ever to grace the screen, a simple man who nevertheless embraces what life brings him and as a result, has some amazing experiences. Tom Hanks shows how versatile he is, making what must have been a demanding role look effortless and natural. The result is that you really care about what happens to Forest, whether he's running, fighting in Vietnam, or seeking to prove to Jenny how he feels.Gary Sinese is also great in this film- his was a truly challenging role- he played a soldier who ends up losing his legs, and feels that Forest cheated him out of his destiny of dying in battle. To simulate having no legs is a true challenge, but he does it, and it's believable.The only thing that lets this film down is that it goes in for a somewhat predictable, sentimental ending, in which Forest's angel, Jenny, dies, shortly after they are married. Nevertheless, Forest Gump is an excellent film and it's no wonder Tom Hanks took home an Oscar for it.",9,2,5,31 January 2008
Rush," Vroom Vroom!
","Capturing the true spirit of Formula 1 on film is challenging. The sport does not lend itself easily to the medium of cinema- it is a popular genre but it's still seen as a niche market in some ways. Yet behind the corporations and money men there is a deeply human side to the sport that Rush captures perfectly.Racing drivers are human beings, subject to the same forces as the rest of us, and back in the 1970s, the sport was far more dangerous than it is today. To become an F1 driver was to know that two out of twenty-five drivers would die each year- with the risk of serious injury never far away. To take such risks on a regular basis meant you had to be a certain type of character to jump into the car.What Rush does is tap into that human side of racing. Chris Hemsworth takes on the role of playboy James Hunt, who drinks, smokes and sleeps (with several women) through F1, and who is fully prepared to put his life on the line is pursuit of glory. Chris, formerly of superhero Thor fame, is great as the arrogant yet likable Hunt, capturing his fragile side too- beneath the partying and exuberance is a man who needs the thrill of dangerous racing to feel alive.Daniel Bruhl is Niki Lauda, a no-nonsense, ultra-serious guy who takes a keen interest in the cars he drives, seeking to maximise their potential whilst minimising the risk. Whilst for Hunt it's all about the thrill, for Lauda it's about business and professionalism. Yet both desire victory and championships. They are polar opposites and push each other hard- Bruhl captures Lauda's attitude and strict approach really well, sounding just like him, acting just like him.The film pulls no punches with driver accidents and Lauda's own serious accident either. It gives us a glimpse into what Lauda went through and into his recovery and bravery as well.In short, both actors give a good account of themselves as two of Formula 1's most amazing figures- and Ron Howard has done a fantastic job of recreating the cars and scenery of the era. The cars are faithfully reproduced and look incredible. The blend of real machinery and CGI is done so well that you almost can't tell the two apart. The film is great, whether you love Formula 1 or not.",9,2,3,14 September 2013
Ratatouille," Delicious
","It seems the Disney/Pixar alliance can do no wrong. Ratatouille brings typically slick animation and marries it to a sweet little story- with injections of subtle and not-so-subtle humour along the way.Remy is instantly likable as the rat who dreams of being a chef- Linguini is equally likable, as the well-meaning but bumbling young man who doesn't realise that he is in fact the rightful owner of the restaurant he works for. Anton Ego is cold and fierce as the 'villain', although Skinner (the head chef following the death of Gusteau, the original owner and Linguini's father) is the main, yet incompetent, bad guy.Add in a love interest for Linguini in the form of Colette (which frustrates Remy no end), and you have a neat little film. It isn't the very best of Disney- but it's a good film that is worth a look.",9,0,1,9 July 2013
Independence Day," The Return of the Blockbuster!
","Independence Day is clearly aimed at a US market- the patriotic chest-thumping practically never lets up, and it's easy to criticise the film for it. However, it is also surprisingly well-thought out in terms of story, has some very good performances, tremendous action, and is a lot of fun.It's a big film- long, crammed with large sets, huge set-pieces, and a build-up that, whilst actually quite long (the explosions don't start till about an hour in) is very well done and sets the film up nicely for its second act.The city-destruction sequence manages to look both horrific yet dazzling at the same time, the fighter attacks are well done, and you can't help but be swept away in it all. Few films have managed to convey the same sense of scale as this.",9,3,5,31 May 2013
Frozen," The next big Disney hit
","Disney is the machine that keeps churning out good movies. After the excellent Monsters University earlier this year comes a charming and heart-warming tale that belies its name. Frozen is about family and about love. It's good warm, friendly characters, genuine cast chemistry, and it's good fun from start to finish.The animation itself is superb. The way in which ice crystals and the like come together is glorious and the film is visually a triumph. It's wonderful eye candy.Another great thing is the soundtrack. Disney films generally produce great songs but in recent years songs have either been absent or below par. Not here. The songs here are sweeping, beautiful and full of heart.I really do think Frozen deserves to stand as Disney's next big hit, and I'm sure it will.",9,3,6,29 December 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," A Balanced Film
","Whereas the era of Toby Maguire's Spiderman was marked by a Peter Parker wound up tighter than a coiled spring and on the verge of tears on several occasions, Garfield's Spiderman is more at ease with himself, and certainly more street-wise. He is tougher in some respects, but also more likable as a character, which shines through quite a lot for me in this film.The almost-forced love story between Parker and Mary-Jane in the first three Spiderman films is replaced by a more natural, gentle portrayal, and the on-screen chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma is better than that between Maquire and Kirsten Dunst. The primary villain of the piece, Electro, is well-performed by Jamie Foxx but the character is a little clichéd and to be honest, doesn't get enough screen time either. I rather liked the new spin on Harry Osborn, who, like Parker, is less of an emotional wreck and, despite some acts of petulance, is more likable than James Franco's interpretation. His transition into the Goblin is motivated more out of desperation than anything else, so he garners more sympathy than before.The action sequences are well staged and manage to convey a strong sense of excitement and tension. All in all, I would rate this film quite highly!",8,0,1,19 September 2014
Transformers," A Reasonable Beginning
","The first installment in the Transformers trilogy does a reasonable job of setting things up and manages to look the part nicely- for the most part. The technical aspects of the film are incredible, and the Transformers themselves look very real. The battles are well done too.However, the film suffers from too many human moments. The cartoon was always about the battle between the Autobots and Decepticons. This film, and its sequels, focus too heavily on Sam and his relationship angst, rather than what the focus should be on- massive robots slugging it out.Another complaint- in the midst of all the battles and and fights, it becomes very hard to figure out which robot is which- only Optimus and Bumblebee (whose 'speech' gets quite annoying after a while) stand out from the blur of samey transformers.Despite these flaws, it's still an entertaining film- but it could have been a lot better.",7,0,0,23 May 2013
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," Delicious
","Once again a kid's film succeeds at entertaining more than just the kids! The entertainment value of Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is immense- this is a colourful, bright, lively film with likable characters, great imagination and undoubtedly a winning recipe.Steve the monkey is fantastic- especially when he's ripping gummy bears limb from limb! And the major's journey from fit to fat is quite funny too, as well as serving as a subtle reminder about the dangers of over-indulgence.What makes the film though, is the creativity. Snow ball fights with ice cream. Giant pancakes flattening schools. Huge steaks falling straight to your plate. It's great to watch and I highly recommend it!",Null,0,0,16 November 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy," Send in the Guardians!
","I have rarely enjoyed a film as much as I enjoyed Guardians of the Galaxy tonight. From the funny little dance we get from Quill at the start of the film, to his funky moves at the end, this film keeps things refreshingly light and yet also manages to offer up real heart. You warm to all the characters - from the surprisingly eloquent Drax to the wise-ass that is Rocket, to Groot's innocence, Quill's badboy ways and Gamorra's quest for vengeance, each character has something of worth.The bad guy is a little flat but we don't get to see enough of him, which is a shame as he could have been an interesting enemy. That said, he offers a few good scenes of malice.The scope of the film is huge and both the sets and CGI work is top-notch. The film is beautiful, with lots of strong attention to detail.I also loved the soundtrack. The use of 80s songs rather than a traditional score makes the film seem more down-to-earth. I loved this film and it is one of the few I would consider seeing at the cinema again.",10,1,5,21 August 2014
Jurassic World," Silly Fun
","I've read a lot of reviews criticising Jurassic World's story, and yes, I dare say the plot is not the most solid (training raptors for the military, making new species of dino), but the film succeeds in what I would consider its primary mission - to entertain! This is a film about a dinosaur theme park - the very concept is heavily stretching the boundaries of disbelief - even the first film is ultimately guilty of this - yet so many people are up in arms about THIS film's plot! In terms of the actual film - well, technology has come a long way since the original 1993 film, so the dinosaurs look more impressive than ever, and the park itself is brought bang up to date, looking incredible. The scenes with the two kids were a little annoying - we're supposed to get a sense of family connections and therefore connect with their characters, but some of the scenes are a little unnecessary (such as them going off on their own, even after the order to return to the main park), and defy belief a little.Chris Pratt pretty much steals the show. He's flavour of the month right now and he certainly has charm and presence. Bryce Dallas Howard's character starts out being very much a by-the-numbers sort, not really appreciating the animals (or the park's visitors) for what they are. However, as the film progresses she becomes more likable (as she ditches her businesswoman persona to reveal a human being underneath).There are quite a few nice little nods to the first film. There's a guy wearing a Jurassic Park t-shirt, and the kids find the remains of the original park, where the new I-Rex repeats the roar that the T-Rex treated us to. The original jeeps put in an appearance as well.So all in all, the film treats us to a bit of nostalgia, it has fun, and the characters are in fact, quite likable. It won't win any Oscars and it doesn't have the most compelling plot ever made, but it's a great popcorn movie, which is what you want from a summer blockbuster!",8,85,166,17 June 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," A Step away from Greatness
","Age of Ultron was always going to be in the shadow of the first Avengers film. The first film gave us THAT moment, when all of these heroes united on screen for the first time, and it felt epic. Topping that was never going to be easy for AoU, and it doesn't quite hit that mark.There are some unresolved questions. At the very start of the film the Avengers are together again, apparently going around the world, taking down Hydra bases. When did they start doing this? How did they get in touch with Thor to rope him into it? We're left with the gang all together and we're meant to take it as read that this is how it is. That said, it was impressive to see them all as a functioning unit, a team (even the Hulk is on-side), taking out wave after wave of bad guys.We're introduced to two new characters (Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver) but I can't help but feel they needed a film of their own to flesh them out - there's too much going on in AoU to cram in much back story or give them the time they deserve, however much they try.Ultron is great. He isn't perhaps as fearsome as the trailers suggest, but he can go pound-for-pound against Thor, which should serve as a mark of his strength. He believes humanity needs to go - they have had their time and the world needs to move on. He isn't necessarily acting out of pure evil - he just sees humans as too chaotic to survive.James Spader is quite dry and witty in this role - it's hard to imagine anyone else doing it.The film is peppered with some nice moments and good one-liners but it could have benefited from a slightly more serious tone, and Ultron needed to be a touch more dangerous - he was painted as the villain to seriously test the Avengers, and he doesn't really come across as THAT dangerous - it sort of feels like AoU is teeing up Phase 3 rather than concluding Phase 2 - it's a good film, that they tried to do too much with, and so got a little muddled. That didn't stop me from enjoying it though!",8,2,6,3 May 2015
The Dark Knight," Very Good
","It's easy to look at The Dark Knight through a rose-tinted lens. The film is inevitably remembered as one of Heath Ledger's last films, and as such there's a temptation to view it in a romanticised way.However, looking past that, the film is quite simply very good. Dark and foreboding, filled with tension that makes you sweat. Ledger's Joker is a maniac, Bale's Batman is as moody as ever and put to the test by a villain he can't find, can't predict and seemingly can't stop.How far are you willing to go to stop something bad? What's the line you don't cross? That's part of this film, a big part.Aaron Eckhart deserves a lot of credit too- his role as Harvey Dent presents him in a tragic light- what he goes through leaves him becoming the very thing he fought against, and his performance is very good. Overall the film is very strong, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.",9,0,1,31 May 2013
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Weak and Unimpressive
","Unlike the first film, which was moderately entertaining, Revenge of the Fallen is a mess. The chaotic battle scenes are even more chaotic, making it hard to figure out what's going on, and the film once again falls into the trap of too many human relationship scenes, missing the point of the cartoons completely. The transformer designs are even more monotone than before, Bumblebee's speech problem, despite being annoying in the first film, is still there, and it's as though the producers took all the flaws of the first movie and deliberately made them worse. Very disappointing.Good points? To be honest I can't really think of any. Shia Lebouf is not a bad actor but doesn't have a lot to go on here, Megan Fox is as stiff as a board, and it just doesn't work.",4,1,5,23 May 2013
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," A Great End
","Star Wars is one of those things that is larger than life. It goes beyond the movies. It's something that transcends such trivial ideas like entertainment.The Star Wars Saga has become a thread of our lives, with people all over the planet knowing about the characters and story, with references about it littered all over pop culture and other shows. It's a legend, there is no doubt about that.Episodes 1 and 2 might not have lived up to overwhelmingly high expectations, but Episode 3 delivers. It's no surprise that the darkest episode of the Saga is also one of the best- The Empire Strikes Back was a foreboding story as well, and it's often rated by fans as being the very best.Everything about Episode 3 is quite dark and tragic. Even the early interchanges between Anakin and Obi-wan, which are light-hearted and humorous, are tinged with sadness, given what we know will become of Anakin later on. Then there is Dooku's demise at Anakin's hand, at the behest of the Chancellor- the beginning of Anakin's slide to the Dark Side.The battles are epic in scope though the opening space battle, for it's amazing opening, is a bit of a disappointment. In the first shot we see dozens of ships pelting each other with firepower, only for the focus to then be almost entirely on two fighters- not the sort of battle that I'd hoped for! Still, it's well done, full of intensity and the subsequent crash landing scene is brilliant.The only other complaint about the film is that Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman still seem a bit wooden at times, though this might be more due to Lucas's dialogue than anything else. The lightsaber duels, the climatic final duel between Anakin and Obi-wan... all of it is brilliant. This completes the saga beautifully.",9,3,5,20 December 2005
The Lion King," Disney's Pinnacle
","I've seen a lot of Disney lately. My daughter has made sure of that. I've seen 101 Dalmations, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, Ratatouille, Up, The Princess and the Frog, Meet the Robinsons, all the Toy Stories, The Little Mermaid, Mulan, and probably more, several times over.They are all good films, with some being better than others. Some you simply associate with classic Disney, others not so much.The Lion King however, is a class of its own.When I first saw the trailer as a kid I was captivated. When I saw the film for the first time it was an incredible, beautiful journey, and even now the film still holds incredible power. It is, to me, Disney at the height of their powers, the very peak of their work.The story is effectively Hamlet but it's executed so well, with such passion and love and beauty. The characters are timeless (especially Timon and Pumba!). It's hard to believe most of the animators of the time were rushing to work on Pochahontas- how many of them now wish they'd stuck to The Lion King?",9,0,0,31 May 2013
WALL·E," A Love Story
","There are a few major themes running through Wall-E. It's a film about the environment, it's a film about determination, but most of all, at its heart, Wall-E is a love story.Everything that little robot does, he does because he is trying to impress, help or save Eve. He is lonely and Eve is the first person he's had to talk to in hundreds of years. She quickly becomes everything to him.And despite the first half the film having virtually no speech, despite the fact that Wall-E and Eve don't so much talk as beep and squeak, there manages to be a real sense of warmth, affection and love between them. The film proves that animation can have tremendous depth, and the other messages are not preachy or in-your-face. This is a winner.",9,0,1,24 June 2013
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Good... But is it Great?
","Following on from 2013's Man of Steel, BvS is the continuation of DC Comics effort to create a shared universe (in much the same fashion as Marvel). It remains to be seen if DC will have the same success as Marvel, but on the strength of BvS, they have a fair chance. The film is pretty entertaining and clearly well made – but there are issues.Be warned, if you want to avoid major spoilers, I suggest you stop reading round about now.Final warning.If you're still here, I can assume you've either seen the film or don't care if it gets spoiled for you. Don't come crying if you read something you didn't want to know.First, the bad: at 153 minutes this is a long film, and if you're seeing it with kids (another issue I'll come to in a mo), they may get fidgety after a while. I couldn't help but feel they could have trimmed some fat off the movie and not lost anything of the story. In particular, the dream sequence involving Batman fighting minions of Superman in a desolate future could have been lost – we were already aware by that point of Bruce Wayne's anger towards Superman, and the weird 'message from the future' moment didn't make much sense in the context of anything else.This is also a very dark film. It carries a 12A certificate (as did Man of Steel, and as do all the MCU films thus far), but it pushes the envelope of that quite hard. The final fight with Doomsday is brutal and I'm not sure if younger kids would get through that without nightmares. I can understand that the core audience might want a more 'grown-up' approach, especially in light of how generally light-hearted the Marvel films are (DC films tend to be a bit grittier), but BvS straddles the fence and really needed to make a decision as to just how grown up it wanted to be. Suicide Squad will (judging from the trailer) push the envelope even harder – are DC brave enough to make it a 15?That all being said, Ben Affleck gives a solid performance as an older, slightly world-weary Batman. He's disillusioned with dealing with run of the mill criminals, angry with Superman for the events of Man of Steel, and losing a little of himself in the process. Whereas Bale's Batman had one rule (to not kill), Affleck's Batman is fully prepared to, or at the very least isn't afraid to expose his enemies to fatal situations.Jeremy Irons does a reasonable job with Alfred, who tries to act as a conscience for Bruce. Beyond this, there's not a lot for him to do.Henry Cavill reprises his role as Superman and in BvS has to face up to his status as both an object of fear and an object of worship. He is trying to find an identity for himself – for all his great power, he cannot find peace (made all the tougher with Batman gunning for him).Jesse Einsberg steals the show as Lex Luthor . His performance is excellent, with Luthor being just the wrong side of maniacal. He is full of nervous energy, and is also a genius – a dangerous mix – and he is something of a manipulative sadist too. I hope he gets some screen time with Jared Leto's Joker!Gal Gadot is Wonder Woman and frankly, her character is underused. I know this is Batman vs Superman, but there's not really a lot for her to do other than look pretty and fight, which seems like a wasted opportunity.Amy Adams is back as inquisitive journalist Lois Lane, who pokes around into the business of Lex Luthor and tries to keep Clarke Kent focused and grounded. Adams is an underrated actress who in my view deserves more credit than she gets, and she does a good job here.One final thought (and major spoiler).Superman apparently dies. His death is an act of final heroism to stop Doomsday, and the catalyst for Bruce to try and unite the heroes of the world. The very final scene (after much grieving and mourning) hints he may still be alive, which is a little contrived and also blatantly obvious – the writers are unlikely to kill a key character in the Justice League in the very first ensemble film they make!So all in all, it's an entertaining film. It's not one I'd take young kids to, and it wouldn't hurt to be a little shorter, but it would be worth another watch. There's more to come from the DCU, and it should offer an intriguing counterpoint to the style of the MCU. I look forward to see what's next!",7,2,4,8 April 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The Force is Strong with this one, but first, let's go Beyond!
","Today marks the end of one long wait and the start of another - with The Force Awakens finally here (my review is further down this page, be warned, whilst I won't be going out of my way to spoil the film, I cannot guarantee no spoilers), I feel it's a good time to reflect on that journey.When I first heard that Disney had purchased Lucasfilm and were planning on making a new trilogy, I will admit to skepticism. Whatever you may think of the prequel trilogy (and indeed, the original trilogy), the six films that comprised the saga tell a complete story - the rise, fall, and redemption of Anakin Skywalker (which of course, several other themes running parallel to that).As time went by, and trailers began to emerge for The Force Awakens, I found my concerns gradually being replaced by a sense of hope and anticipation. The trailers revealed a less flashy and more lived-in feel to the universe JJ Abrams was trying to build, and the news that he wanted to build sets and use make up and physical props more than CGI was encouraging. There was something about seeing familiar settings and characters that evoked the charm of the original trilogy, rather than the bland imagery of the prequels.With each new trailer, the Star Wars fan in me grew more excited. I was also remarkably impressed at how few spoilers there were - the trailers gave us new clips and moments without actually giving anything away - and everything about them heightened the desire to embrace my inner Jedi.In the final few days building up to the film, I felt like a kid at Christmas. I even had a Star Wars Advent calendar that I was using to countdown to the big day!As this was going on, another sci-fi saga was quietly going about its business, slipping under the radar as Star Wars hogged the limelight. The news that a trailer to Star Trek Beyond would debut before The Force Awakens was very cool to me - and it was yet another reason to look forward to the 17th December. I managed to resist watching the trailer online, so my first dose of it was on the big screen.So, on to the main event. The Force Awakens. What do I think?Final warning, if you want to avoid spoilers, stop reading now.Still here?Don't say I didn't warn you. Here we go.imageThe film is a visual feast from the moment it starts, yet not in an in-your-face sort of way. This is a lived- in universe, with physical objects you could reach out and touch, rather than the CGI-laden prequels. Everything - the sets, costumes, puppets and the odd burst of CGI work here and there - is done with great care, reverence and attention to detail.After all the theories about who the bad guy really was and about who, if anyone, would die, the film gives us what is effectively A New Hope, but reworked and brought up to date. There is an early revelation about Kylo Ren's true identity, and a confrontation near the end of the film based on this that you half-suspect is coming, yet it still manages to hit you where it hurts.Of the newcomers, it's actress Daisy Ridley as Rey who steals the show. After all the (admittedly small) pointers in the trailer that point to John Boyega's character being the next Jedi, instead it's Rey who has a strong connection to the Force, and Ridley portrays her journey from a lonely scavenger to budding Jedi brilliantly.Boyega also does well. Like Rey, Finn is trying to find his identity, having abandoned the life he knew. Despite some outward signs of fear, Finn is very brave, loyal and determined, eager to prove himself.Oscar Isaac plays Poe and it's hard to really judge his performance because we don't see too much of his character. The X-Wing vs TIE fighter moments we're treated to are breathtaking and beautiful and we're also treated to what could best be described as a homage to A New Hope's trench run.Kylo Ren is played by Adam Driver and his character is perhaps best described as a Sith who lacks discipline. He is full of angst and anxiety and is being pulled in different directions - Driver does a pretty good job with Ren - a pity he wouldn't have been old enough to play Anakin in the prequels, he would have done a good job!So, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher. They both did well at playing their respective characters - both Han and Leia are weary of everything, which is hardly surprising given what they've been through. Mark Hamill isn't in the film long enough to establish anything!So how do I feel about the film? The visuals are incredible, the music evokes memories of the original saga, and the performances are excellent. I need to see it again, to properly take it all in, but I can honestly say that I loved it. The Force has truly awakened!",9,4,19,18 December 2015
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Better than Revenge but still average
","I wanted to like this movie. I wanted to be optimistic about the finale of the trilogy. Sadly, despite some good and even great moments, Dark Side of the Moon falls prey to the faults of the first two films.Too much focus on the human drama- yes, I know the films want to connect to a modern audience, but to fans of the original cartoons, the focus should be on the struggle between the Autobots and Decepticons, something that the films misunderstood completely.The set-pieces are very impressive. The huge tunneling thing that crushes buildings is a sight to see. Still, the film just doesn't feel like it was about the Transformers, and so for me, misses the point.",6,1,4,24 May 2013
