Saturday Night Fever," surprisingly offense
","I love dancing, so I rented SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER and was caught completely by surprise.  The film is not about the joys of dancing at all.  Instead you are bombarded with profanity, misogyny, drug use, promiscuity, racism, homophobia, suicide, and even rape.  I cannot understand how this movie is so big and popular.  All my life I've heard about this film and have encountered numerous satires.  Since when is mainstream America so accepting of such material and content?  This movie is extremely offensive and definitely adult-orientated.  I assume that all of this is just the film's reflection of the disco generation because I am already aware of their ignorance.  The disco scene was largely a 'white' mainstream rip-off of two subcultures: the African-American and gay club scenes.  So, in that regard SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER was a good portrayal of that time.  I was just amazed that such a mainstream and well-known film had so much bigotry.Now, don't get me wrong.  This movie did have some credible moments (the opening sequence was fabulous!), but I was really caught off guard.  I am a fan of fun and dancing and that is why I like disco music, but I certainly did not find any in this movie.So kids, if you want to watch a movie with good old-fashion dance fun.  This movie IS NOT for you.  You'd be better off watching Baz Luhrmann's STRICTLY BALLROOM (1992).",Null,0,3,24 August 2002
Alien 3," 'You're all going to die.'
","Ah yes, the notorious ALIEN 3. It pains me that even after so many years people are still complaining about this movie. Now, I can understand fans being a bit disappointed back in 1992. I mean hell, James Cameron's ALIENS was an utter triumph. It basically broke the curse dooming sequels into being nothing more than inferior insults.Nevertheless, it is wholly unfair to judge ALIEN 3 against its successful predecessor. So many viewers walked away saying 'No guns? Blah! You can't have an ALIEN film without guns.' Now please, that is just ridiculous. Cameron's sequel introduced guns into the equation. The original (and widely popular) ALIEN was a science fiction fright flick with no guns.The problem that Cameron created with making a great sequel is that now how is another film going to top it? Perhaps it can be done, just look at the challenges Cameron himself faced when he first announced he wanted to make a sequel to ALIEN. Everyone told him 'no' and that it would end his career. Hmm.Nonetheless, Cameron made it remarkably difficult for a new film and director to step up to the plate. On top of that, the studio (FOX) made the equation damn-near impossible. There were literally hundreds of scripts and treatments for a third ALIEN film. Ideas and plots eventually snow-balled into a conglomerate mess as production started. There were even teaser trailers released indicating the aliens reaching earth (an early version of the script) which ultimately contradicts the film that was made.Enter a talented young man named David Fincher, perhaps best known for his background in music videos. Fincher takes the job as his feature film debut, most likely with high hopes. Production starts as no 'official' script is completed and later filming begins even as new rewrites are being added. Fincher eventually abandons the film (before completion) citing studio interference and officially disowns it. What's left of the disaster is edited together (complete with even more reshooting) and released to an already skeptical fanbase.I only learned of the production debacle years later and began to understand why Fincher would ignore the film completely. It must be a bizarre fluke that the film turned out as well as it did. I can only assume the film's integrity stems from Fincher's involvement. ALIEN 3 made me take notice of this director's name and sure enough he soon did receive the success he deserved with his next film SEVEN (1995).Now, with all of this in mind one might dismiss ALIEN 3 as utter sh**. I disagree. I saw the film opening weekend in the summer of 1992 and loved it. And it still today is my favorite entry in the series.ALIEN 3 departs from the previous two films by creating a dark, violent, philosophical drama of mythological proportions. This film introduces a new aesthetic, beautiful in all its stygian richness. Gone are the grim air ducts and technological trappings of the first two films. Instead, Ripley awakens in an inescapable hell deep in the nothingness of space - a labyrinth world of golden light, thick escaping steam, and lost souls. She's crash landed (with the xenomorph onboard) into an abandoned prison planet inhabited by an all-male population of murderers and rapists.The plot is incredibly rich with drama in that Ripley finds herself with no hope. She is inescapably attached to this alien and it will forever destroy her life. And it is here, in this purgatory of sorts, where she finds the courage to finish it once and for all. Of course, Elliot Goldenthal's magnificent score helps as does Fincher's visual metaphors (most notably the funeral scene) and overall style. The film results in a provocative tale of faith and human emotion set against the absolution of death. A theme that, I feel, far outweighs the significance of any other ALIEN film.",Null,12,24,4 August 2004
Dawn of the Dead," F***ing Nursery School
","When there's no more room in hell, Hollywood will remake a classic...completely void of any intelligence and hardly capable of any creativity.  This film relies solely on chase scenes and...well...chase scenes.  This 're-imagining' of the superior 1978 classic DAWN OF THE DEAD is nothing but cheap in its mindless pursuit of thrills and chills.The ultimate flaw of this film is that it does not even care to treat the zombie plague as anything more than a device to have characters flee in fear.  The film completely ignores the zombie genre tradition and instead goes the route of obviously ripping-off the successful 28 DAYS LATER by making the infected run and scream.  That film at least took the zombie genre and completely reinvented it - creating an all new experience.  This film makes no such advancements.I'm sorry for the harsh review. If you do not want analytical criticisms of your picture, then do not take the title of the ultimate zombie film. That picture is after all best known for its strides in atmosphere, character developments, and political/social satire - none of which appear in this remake.  In all fairness, hardly any similarities exist between these two pictures.  That's a good thing because I actually feel that I would hate this film more if it tried to emulate the original masterpiece (much like 2003's TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE remake).If this is a different film, then why work from the original 1978 George Romero screenplay and retain that title?  The only reason would be name recognition to make some cash (and of course to wound longtime horror loyalists).  Why did they have to tarnish the original's name?Another serious problem with this film is its total lack of coherency. The whole film was littered with moments of inconsistency.  It is almost as if the filmmakers pondered : how can we have this group escape a barricaded shop with their only exit (one door) completely swarmed by zombies?  Hmm, I've got it!  Let's just use a cutaway and then when we come back to the survivors they are already outside and running.  Perfect!  Let's just edit their way out of trouble!How do they gain entrance into the mall when its completely sealed and `shatterproof?'  Let's just cutaway to an interior department store window shattering and have the characters just stroll on in. Brilliant!  No explanation of how they got in or how zombies aren't entering the same way. Who cares about logic?  Let's just show people running and swing the camera around a lot.Seriously though, the filmmakers did fail at nearly every aspect of this picture but there are two notable exceptions: the pregnancy/birth scene and the armored vans/chainsaw escape.First, the pregnancy/birth scene.  All right, this was very provocative on a number of levels.  Not only was it original, but also very compelling from a dramatic/analytical standpoint.  It was not done for a mere weird/disturbing scare.  The scene was a great moment for the characters involved (it really built Mekhi Phifer's role) but it was also a statement on human nature given the abysmal events of this particular apocalypse.  Really moving.  Without a doubt - this was the highlight of the script.  Furthermore, this will most likely go into zombie movie history along with Lucio Fulci's zombie vs shark moment (1979's ZOMBIE) and Peter Jackson's zombie sex scene (1992's DEAD ALIVE) - which also spawned an offspring.  This moment is the film's only contribution to the genre.Second, the armored vans escape plan (and the subsequent use of chainsaws) was a logical and brilliant move by the screenwriter.  An absolute pleasure for those horror fans more suited toward the PHANTASM and EVIL DEAD sequels.Not a highlight of the film, but definitely a pleasure all its own was the brief appearance of Matt Frewer.  I almost expected his last words to be a digital stutter - for those of us who remember his MAX HEADROOM days.There are also a few cameos (from the cast of the original) scattered throughout the film, but it provides only a second or two of satisfaction for fans.  A Tom Savini cameo cannot save a picture (case in point - 2001's CHILDREN OF THE LIVING DEAD) no matter how cool it might be.Bottom line : the picture is a brainless blockbuster/michael bay venture that will undoubtedly be eaten up by the mindless masses of America.  Some may be happy that the zombie genre is back, but its back in the worst way. Grade D-.",Null,0,0,10 April 2004
Spider-Man 2," EVIL DEAD forever
","Surprisingly satisfying for the Raimi fan. The sequence where Doc Oc wakes up in the operating room is straight out of EVIL DEAD. The sound, cuts, and pacing are pure Raimi. Good to see it again after so long. One doctor even pulls out a chainsaw to defend himself! Bruce Campbell should've been cast for that part, though he did do quite well as the theater usher.As for the film itself, I enjoyed it. Much more so than its predecessor. Sure, it can be criticized as mindless or poorly acted. However, it's a comic book movie and vastly superior to the large array of comic book adaptation pieces of sh** being put out these days (is anyone really going to waste their time with CATWOMAN?). So, it was utterly satisfying to me as a childhood fan of spidey. Made me feel like a kid again.",Null,0,0,7 July 2004
Predator," 'If it bleeds, we can kill.'
","This is one of those pictures where Schwarzenegger actually got lucky.  The film's strength is that it can stand on its own without him.  Of course, he gives a good performance in all but how demanding could the role really be? 
This film is great on so many levels.  First, director John McTiernan does a phenomenal job here.  As far as I'm concerned, this is his best work.  Next, you've got an amazing score by Alan Silvestri - a musician who needs no introduction.  Lastly, there's the creature itself.  However, the thanks for that is a somewhat vague mixture of the Thomas screenwriters and the horde of special effects designers brought into the project.   Apparently, there was some trouble with the 'look' of the creature once production started. Nevertheless, the result was the true star of the film - a real marvel of science fiction and horror.Although this film may solely be for action fans (there's a number of one-liners), I argue that it achieves much more in credibility.  This is actually a well-crafted suspenseful adrenaline rush of horror.  Easily, one of the best films of all time.",Null,3,4,29 August 2004
The Exorcist," let jesus F*** you!
","One of the most over-rated films of all time.  This movie is not scary in the least and yet somehow it is one of the most recognizable 'scary' movies. I don't understand why.  Maybe if you are a sheltered Christian - then, I assume, this is scary stuff.  I've just never found the devil to be scary. If anything, the classic, literary, and biblical character of Lucifer has always had a romanticism in its appeal.This film's scare factor is a complete puzzle to me.  A devil-possessed young girl spewing profanities and projectile vomit is simply comical.  Some of Linda Blair's lines in this film are downright silly.The only notable element of this film was the special effects.  Make-up effects artist Dick Smith is a revolutionary in his field and this film is a showcase of his craftsmanship.  The movie broke new ground only with Smith's contribution.  This film should only be watched as a testiment to some of Dick Smith's work...or if you just want to see an underage girl masturbate with a crucifix.",Null,1,2,22 November 2002
Alien vs. Predator," 'We're in the middle of a war.'
","The ultimate question here is whether this film was a good idea or not.  It all began in 1990 with the Dark Horse Comics publication of a five issue series called Aliens Vs. Predator.  Additional series followed over the years including novels, video games, trading cards, and even a toy line.  In a sense, the AVP concept had already crossed every medium years before the film was made.  Various pitches and scripts were discussed since 1990, but nothing really resulted for the project.  The closest the movie came was a script called THE HUNT (based on the original AVP comic book) written by Peter Briggs in 1991 which never came to fruition.Some argue the project was never pursued because producers felt both franchises were already dead.  PREDATOR 2 (1990) and ALIEN 3 (1992) both met with mixed results from the public, despite the fact the latter grossed more than ALIENS (1987) worldwide.  Nevertheless, a fourth ALIEN film was released in 1997 around the same time that writer/director Robert Rodriguez was writing a script for a third PREDATOR installment.The success of New Line Cinema's FREDDY VS JASON (2003) no doubt gave 20th Century Fox the idea to finally push AVP into production.  Is it just coincidence that Fox announced AVP a mere month after the widely successful opening weekend of FREDDY VS. JASON?  Fox's new found enthusiasm for the project raises some concern.  Shooting started in October of 2003, a mere ten months before its scheduled release date.  Isn't that rushing it a bit? This must be a cash-in.After watching the film myself, I don't dismiss it as such.  I feel it's a somewhat genuine effort and pretty fan-pleasing.  I don't know where or how Paul W.S. Anderson (and his own script) came into the project, but he didn't destroy the picture too badly.  His involvement was heavily debated in fan circles from the get-go.  My only hope with Anderson directing was a return to his style in the largely neglected EVENT HORIZON (1997).  Furthermore, Anderson spoke quite enthusiastically (to say the least) about the project.  Read any Fangoria Magazine interview to see how much of a fan he is and how well-suited his intentions were while writing the script. Unfortunately, that doesn't translate exactly into the finished product.In terms of the fan's desire and a sequel's purpose, AVP does moderately well.  Anderson brings the xenomorphs to modern day earth and the deadly hunters to Antarctica.  The two twists deliver quiet well for fans.  It was such an incredible thrill to see the heat-driven predators in the arctic snow.Anderson was also sure to add a few details to prove he had done his homework.  The dark and claustrophobic tunnels from the ALIEN movies are here (triangular this time - which is amusingly fresh) and so is the predators' hunting code (one throws a human back for being too weak).What AVP lacks is a solid narrative.  There's a good story here, but Anderson seems to rush into things way to easily.  His need for speed tragically diminishes the film's potential.  He also seems to play to the twelve year old boys in the audience, or at least their mental equivalent. What he fails to notice is that you don't have to dumb things down for kids.The overall pace of the film was horrible.  The film's final running time is around the 84 minute mark.  As I said, Anderson made it very fast.  There's literally less than five minutes of screen time that passes between a face-hugger impregnation and the alien's birth.  I understand that you have to have aliens in the picture for the predators to hunt, but that's ridiculous.  And where did all the aliens come from?  We only see six to ten humans get impregnated yet there seems to be an endless number of aliens running around.  And why do we only get to see one predator fight one alien at a time?  It would be so much more exciting to see a predator take on a swarm of aliens or at least two predators fighting together as a team.  We finally got both creatures in the same movie, so let's make the best of it!Another oddity of AVP is its PG-13 rating.  This was a major shock to the fanbase considering that the aliens are born through violent chest-bursts and the predators skin their prey.  Fortunately, AVP doesn't feel too PG-13 but there are a few moments where the film obviously cuts away from the violence.I'd be able to deal with the ultra-fast pacing, bad dialogue, and lack of proper character development only if AVP hadn't made the predators so hokey looking.  This was the biggest disappoint for me.  Special effects technology has advanced since the original PREDATOR films, but apparently not for this one.  I don't really understand what went wrong considering the effects were handled by Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff Jr.  Fans know their reputation, so what happened?Another disappoint is the general neglect of the aliens.  They are hardly in this movie.  Furthermore, the humans in this film do little but flee from both deadly species.  We the audience may already know everything about the two creatures, but these characters don't yet.  That should have been explored more.Of course, I am a life-long fan of both franchises so I doubt any AVP film could live up to my expectations.  Naturally, I felt let down by Paul W.S. Anderson's picture but it could have been a lot worse.  Loyalists can damn me all to hell but I'll honestly admit that I enjoyed watching AVP.  There weren't enough problems to make me truly hate it. It might have been a mere `cash-in' for the producers, but I feel Paul W.S. Anderson gave an honest effort here.  My criticisms of the film are just from a creative standpoint, really.  I recommend AVP to fans, but the average movie-goer won't be able to appreciate it or even understand it.",Null,0,0,24 August 2004
