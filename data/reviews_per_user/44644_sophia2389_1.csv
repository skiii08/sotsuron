E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," About E.T movie
","I think that it was original to make a movie with aliens for children even some of them could be scared. I have not seen this movie before. I liked the performance of the little boy named Elliott who played very well for his age. He was innocent but very mature. Steven Spielberg used good effects. The movie showed another vision of an alien who is not like a monster here but has feelings as a human. He became attached at last.I would recommend this movie to anyone who has not seen it, to spend a good time with this famous movie. The movie was made for children but also for adults who can return to their childhood. I also liked the relationship between Elliott and E.T which was very strong. The end of the movie was touching and made me cry.",10,0,1,6 November 2009
