The Avengers," Might be the best in the MCU
","I can't think of anything to do to make this movie better. The writers and director nailed the tone perfectly.I know there are those who rate Infinity War higher, but that movie didn't me away like this one. After seeing it in the theater, I immediately wanted to see it again. I love IW and have seen it numerous times, but I love this one more. If they didn't do this one right, there is no phase 3 and phase 4. Team up movies hardly ever work, but this set the standard.",10,0,0,15 March 2019
Captain Marvel," Hopefully not the face of MCU going forward
","The story was okay, but if you have watched other movies the twist, if you can even call it that, doesn't work.They don't really develop her character, other than she doesn't quit, but that is a trait shared by all the MCU heroes. She is sarcastic but not really funny. The only motivation her character has is being told she can't because she's a girl. When she learns the truth about her past, she doesn't have any struggle about it and how she needs to act going forward.Usually MCU movies have a sense of drama, of danger, and this one doesn't. She is so overpowered that you don't doubt for a second that she can possibly lose. I'm really worried she going to over shadow the original Avengers in Endgame because she is so overpowered, she destroyed warship with bare hands, is going to one punch Thanos?Stan Lee tribute was nice.The CGI looked fantastic. The music was good, except playing 'I'm just a girl' during final fight fell flat. I liked the 90s references and wish they had better incorporated the 90s into the movies the way GotG does the music.Brie's performance was fine, I think the script held her back. Samuel L Jackson is his usual self. I thought they had good chemistry and played well off each other.In the comics Mar-Vell is a man and he is the first character to defeat Thanos. In the movie they charge the character to female, played by Annette Benning for no reason I could tell. Benning did a nice job in her role, and only comic nerds who know about the change.",5,1,2,9 March 2019
Avengers: Endgame," I loved parts but just couldn't love all of it.
","The good:. The fan service was very good
It gave people what they wanted, a heroic send-off for Iron Man and sentimental ending for Captain America. The revisiting of previous movies was great overall. I almost lost my mind when Cap picked up Thor's hammer. I was glad Captain Marvel wasn't in the movie very much.The bad:. U was hoping the Russo's would give Capt Marvel a better character, more likeable. The interaction between her and Peter at the end was best bit if dialogue she has had. The biggest thing though was I just couldn't get past the time travel and creation of a multiverse. By creating this multiverse and their actions not affecting the past, it lowered the stakes. Loki gets away, no problem, we'll just ignore that and go to another point in history to get what we need. Thamos from Guardians of Galaxy dies, no problem. I know there is a certain level of suspension of disbelief in all MCU movies. These just felt like a cheap and easy way to write. So Cap creates a new timeline by living in the past apparently. Does he stop Hydra from infiltrating SHIELD? Does he prepare his timeline for Thanos?Also, it probably hurt that we had to wait a year. the build up was massive and nothing can really live up to that level of hype.I've seen it twice and I don't care to see again for awhile. I have seen Infinity War 7 times as point of reference.",7,8,13,9 May 2019
