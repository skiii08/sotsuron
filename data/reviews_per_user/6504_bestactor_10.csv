Black Swan," Derivative and Stupid
","It is evident that this movie is based on a very weak concept working in elements of many other good to outstanding movies. Interesting ideas do not make good movies. The 'screenplay' is a mess and has no idea what story is being told. Part of this method is to fool the audience into thinking they are watching something when they are really watching close to nothing, and not the good Seinfeld 'nothing.' The acting is good, especially Cassel who has been seriously unrecognized for his extreme versatility in bringing very different characters to fully developed performances. Natalie Portman is getting lots of nominations. I have always liked her performances, but this is far from her best work, mostly because the screenplay is probably the worst she have ever had to act. Even the silly Star Wars sequels are far superior and gave her much more to do. It doesn't take a whole lot of talent to play psycho with all the camera tricks going on. The cinematography is mostly nauseating for no particular reason. Everything is confusing and blurry, so it doesn't really matter what is being shot.The only explanation for this movie's success is that critics and audiences have never seen the films Aronovsky stole from to make this--Repulsion, Red Shoes, The Tenant, All About Eve, films of Cronenberg and DePalma.",2,15,27,23 January 2011
United 93," Outstanding, Superior, Another 'Citizen Kane'?
","This is such a realistic portrayal of some of the events of Sept. 11, 2001 that it is difficult to evaluate this film as one does other movies. Yet, this is an artistic creation, and all decisions regarding script, cast, set, etc. were made for specific reasons by the director. I believe Paul Greengrass has achieved something never before in cinema--a truly compelling and gripping portrayal of actual events, without succumbing to Hollywood jargon or cliché or an overindulgence in sentiment, taste or reverence. I didn't realize until after watching this movie the first time that the cast includes people who portray themselves. While that lends a semblance of authenticity I don't think it would have been any less realistic with all professional actors. This is a movie that deserves respect and recognition because it succeeds as an outstanding film as well as a credible account of events. I doubt any other movies that portray the events of 9-11 will come close to achieving such a rare balance.",10,1,3,28 May 2006
Inglourious Basterds," A True Homage to Stupidity!
","You might enjoy this movie if you believe Tom and Jerry cartoons are the greatest artistic achievement of all time. You might enjoy this movie if you have absolutely no knowledge of history. You might enjoy this movie if you have never seen a good one. You might enjoy this movie if your favorite actors are Larry, Curly and Moe.Tarantino has created his buffoonish, cartoonish, lampoonish impression of World War II. When every character and action is a joke, why give a shoot for over 2 and a half hours of shtick and schlock. There is no acting. It is all acting out. Tarantino is impressed with anyone who can speak or read a non-English language. There are only 6 billion such humans in the world. Tarantino has such a warped concept of what is good acting, good writing. He can frame a shot. The first scene is what made the movie with critics. They left after the first 20 minutes and assumed the rest was as good. What is worst of all is that Tarantino betrays his extreme ignorance of all realities of WW2. In order to take liberties with the truth you need to at least understand where the facts stop and fantasy begins. Tarantino misses the boat completely, so the entire premise of the movie is totally flawed. How could he miss depicting the Nazis as vampires? Why didn't he show Hitler's 30 inch ebony dildo and his crypt under the Brandenburg Gate? Also, the real Inglorious Basterds were not Jews, they were escapees from an insane asylum. They all had extreme physical deformities. Obviously, Hollywood wasn't prepared for the sight of freaks. Those facts should have been included. No legitimate WW2 movie would neglect to include them.",1,36,68,20 August 2010
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Outstanding Adaptation of a Very Difficult Piece
","When I saw the very first preview I was terrified that Tim Burton had really mucked it up. I must admit that my fears were unwarranted. This is definitely the best film Burton has ever directed. His direction and Johnny Depp's performance make this film adaptation of the Sondheim stage masterpiece succeed beyond all expectation. There are quite a few of the top film critics who have thoroughly embraced this movie. I'm so glad it is getting its well deserved accolades. I saw the first run on Broadway before it won all the Tony Awards. I know this piece very well. The changes and deletions from the stage version are reasonable and increase the success of the transfer to film. Stage to film adaptations are the most difficult of all. It is amazing how many stage works are making it to the filming process. It is a testament that imagination and intelligence are not completely dead in the film world. Although I knew exactly what was coming, I wasn't prepared for the sweep of blood and pathos at the end. It was powerful and poignant. Depp deserves credit for keeping this compelling from beginning to the bloody end. He will definitely get my vote!",10,7,13,23 December 2007
Meet the Fockers," Despite a talented cast this movie absolutely STINKS!
","Predictable, forced, crass, long, boring, stupid, silly, tasteless are just a few of the adjective that come to mind for this piece of dreck. It is pathetic to see the waste of talent on and behind the screen. The director and screen scribblers should be nailed to Mel Gibson's cross and dragged through Hollywood for everyone to spit on and jeer at them. Meet the Parents was mediocre. This is a worse offense because of the gross abuse and waste of money and talent. Movies such as this should be fined a fortune to fund independent films. This is a study in how unoriginality, predictability and clichés sabotage extraordinary talent, especially at the hands of a hack director. Sometimes a cast can salvage terrible material and direction. This cast sinks faster than the passengers on the Titanic.",1,10,20,24 April 2005
Saving Private Ryan," Despite the harrowing opening, a very average movie
",I have seen many WWII movies and this is NOT one of the greatest. The opening 20 minutes are absolutely disgustingly brutal but the rest of the movie is a hackneyed rehash of so many better movie plots. And ultimately we never know whether all the effort to save Private Ryan was worthwhile. Was he inspired by his rescuers to be as extraordinary as those who died for him? Did he become a teacher?,1,10,24,1 July 2003
Seabiscuit," Nice and tasteful and BORING!
","I feel a little guilty for not liking this movie more because it's so obviously 'nice' and 'uplifting.' However, for something to be ultimately uplifting it must have some real sense of sorrow. In this I felt sorry for characters and events but the movie demanded no emotional investment whatsoever. It has a good period look and feeling but a very superficial gloss that prevents any immediacy of experience. The races look way too fake, especially the conversations between riders. Randy Newman's wafty weepy score just adds to the corn syrupy goo. The performances by this talented cast are absolutely static. The best performances come from the horses, but even they sometimes seem unnatural and plastic.",1,12,32,10 August 2004
2012," This Cast Deserved to Die!
","I cannot believe how terrible this movie is. I've usually enjoyed Roland's disaster epics, but this has precious little to recommend. The disasters start looking the same--not much variation for multiple earthquakes and tidal waves. There is an enormous deficit of imagination so the disaster effects become extremely boring. Not even a Titanic collision with Mount Everest deserves attentive watching. The digital effects are professional, but still lack any creativity in the design and set up. After the wide variety of vistas Roland created in Day After Tomorrow, this is simply BORING!The script is another complete disaster, and not the fun kind. I have never wanted to throttle a lead character so much as I do Dr. Adrian Helmsley. In fact, most of the characters of color are written to portray completely pathetic wimps who know much but are ineffectual in dealing with the crises. These characters pretend to project altruism for humanity, but it's nothing more than self-satisfying, egocentric sentimentality. They don't have the integrity to make the necessary hard decisions. The only truly altruistic character is Jackson/John Cusak. It would have been more memorable if he had given his life to save the others.",1,5,7,19 July 2010
Mr. Holland's Opus," Someone got carried away after watching an episode of 'The Wonder Years.'
","It is amazing that this movie is held in such high regard considering its abundant mediocrity. It does have an engaging cast, but the story and writing are unbelievable or cliché. There is more authenticity in any episode of 'The Wonder Years,' which seems to have been a stimulus for the writer to scribe a high school teacher's soap opera set against the realism of the turbulent '60s. I would be astounded to find out that any part of this movie was based on anyone's actual experience as a teacher. As devoted as teachers may be to their thankless profession, the prospect of a teacher so removed and distant from his hearing impaired son is ludicrous. There is no believable explanation for this strained relationship. If Mr. Holland had a hang up because his son was deaf--guilt, anger, etc., the film makes no such connection.",4,4,11,28 December 2004
Gladiator," Best Picture? You gotta be kidding!!
","I cannot understand how this truly lousy movie won best picture of the year. It never ceases to amaze me how current directors and producers continue to regurgitate good movies from the past into the current excrement that stinks up movie screens today. Ridley Scott doesn't even know how to frame a scene of sweeping spectacle. He may as well have been doing a TV commercial. They obviously spent millions on scenery but he never showed what they built. Whereas Martin Scorsese can make a few million spent on a set look like a billion dollars--Gangs of New York, Age of Innocence, New York, New York. Joaquin Phoenix is more campy than Joan Collins at her campiest.",1,2,12,1 July 2003
