The Lobster," Most Unpleasant Experience
","There are many reviews of this film, many of them as bizarre as the film itself.To give potential viewers a realistic idea this needs to be said: It is not by any stretch of the imagination a comedy. There is not a single scene in the film that is funny at all. Most scenes are bleak and menacing.It is a Science Fiction HORROR movie which will have a most depressing effect on most viewers. I truly do not understand how so many reviewers can claim to have found any humour whatsoever in it.Sadly it did not have any interesting ideas about life and is best avoided except by people who enjoy watching the misery of a bleak world.",1,38,62,12 February 2016
