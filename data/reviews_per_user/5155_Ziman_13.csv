The Blair Witch Project," Don't ruin it before you see it.
","First and foremost, DO NOT SEEK OUT information about this movie.  See it with a fresh perspective.  If you already know too much about this movie then you will not enjoy it. (*Those of you who already DO know too much, are already aware of it -- if not, then you MAY still enjoy it.)DO NOT VISIT the Blair Witch Web page... I implore you.  If you want to enjoy this film, then DO NOT RESEARCH any more on it.There are NO spoilers in my review here.However, for myself, I may as well have read the trans-script before seeing it, for all the research I did on it.  I normally do not pursue movies like this, and now I know why.  In fact, avoid EVERYTHING about this movie if you want to enjoy it... I cannot stress that enough... Up to and including the documentary on the Sci-fi Channel (or on 'Space' in Canada).I am not about to spoil this movie... but I want to say that a fresh mind and a clear perspective is required to get the full feeling.  You can read my review safely, I won't reveal anything about it for you.The ENTIRE picture is made from stock 8mm video tape, and 16mm black and white film... this material was actually filmed by the three people we see in the film.  It was later edited and compiled, and transferred to 35mm film and transformed into the feature I am reviewing called 'The Blair Witch Project'.Everything about this movie, that we see, is real.  That much I can assure you.  The footage we see is real, the noises we hear, and the emotions that Heather, Mike, and Josh display are real.  I sense, however, that we are missing some footage that could have been added.  The missing footage may not exist, but if additional conversations do exist on this stock material, or more personal emotions, or whatever, to bring the realism to the big screen, it should be added.I couldn't feel for these people as much as I wanted... Maybe because this personal footage (if it exists) is not included.  Or perhaps because I read too much on the movie and was expecting to see more... who knows.I can see, if I went in with a fresh perspective, alert, and freshly virgin to the whole Blair Witch story, and completely unaware of what was to come... I would have enjoyed it more fully.This film has a potential of becoming a classic cult piece... but only for those with a limited pre-knowledge of it.  Otherwise, your perspective is twisted and possibly shattered.Go see it, only if you know little about it.  It will spook you... it will give you the creeps, and you will never go camping in unknown woods again.-ZimanPS: As arrogant as this may be, and although someone's posting will bump mine, *** DO NOT READ OTHER REVIEWS!!! *** ... there are serious SPOILERS in some of these reviews.Also, if after seeing the movie, there is anything you want to be absolutely sure of... you can find it in the credits. You must stay and read the ENTIRE set of credits... especially the final screen of credits.",Null,1,2,12 August 1999
Catch Me If You Can," As fun as it is intriguing.
","Fact (and true) Frank Abagnale Jr. ran away from home in the mid 1960s at the age of 16.  By age 19 he had impersonated a teacher, an airline pilot, a doctor, a lawyer, all the while cashing millions of dollars in fraudulent cheques.  If you're angry because I told you this up front, don't be. As I've said this is a true story and these facts are all told to you in the first 2 minutes of the film.Also, as you should know by now if you've seen the trailer, 'Catch Me If You Can' tells this intriguing, fast paced, fugitive life style of 'Skywayman' Frank Abagnale... as told by the man himself in his book by the same name.I'll leave it at that... the facts are there, but how it's all told is purely another matter all together.  And what actually happens to Frank, and his life should all be left to you to discover on your own (for me to spoil a movie in a review is quite uncommon anyway.)But the storytelling is key, and Spielberg's translation from the pages of Abagnale's own scribe is very strong.  Even though we are a mere observer, the film seemingly tells the story from Abagnale's point of view... as well it should, since the man himself lived the life, and wrote the book that the film was based upon.But regardless how well you know or don't know the story of Frank W. Abagnale (who dropped the 'Junior' years ago), the film has a way of freshening it up, and bringing new life to it.  We see his relationship with his parents, with the woman he eventually does fall in love with, and with his encounter with lawman Carl Hanratty, who seems to be the major target of his eluding.  In this translation, we get to see the charm and charisma DiCaprio gives Abagnale's younger self as he makes his career in crime.The films delivery is also quite simple.  There are no secrets, no hidden agendas... just tells it like it needs to be told.  But that suits this story.  I usually take pleasure in films that surprise me, or one that brings me to a revelation that makes the film's outcome.  But in 'Catch Me If You Can', I take more pleasure in seeing what comes next, instead of trying to determine how things will end up. (Most likely because I already know -- but as I've already mentioned, that doesn't take away from the movie.)  This makes the movie 'easy' to watch, and at the same time entertaining, and not at all dull.'Catch Me If You Can' is as fun as it is intriguing.  Although it isn't the most moving picture out this year, it doesn't need to be.  It simply is. It tells an interesting story, and does it well.  A solid recommendation, and if it's the first film you see this year, it's a good start to 2003.",Null,0,1,2 January 2003
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Pushing the limits - Big-screen style.
","Trey Parker and Matt Stone really pushed the limits on television with the introduction of their TV series of the same name.  'South Park: Bigger Longer and Uncut' heightens these limits to big-screen proportions, and fulfills the title quite nicely.The form that Parker and Stone take to bastardize society and then show it on the screen in this manner is purely hilarious.  I laughed far more than I thought I would.  Their perverse, harsh, and tasteless humor shines through, and on a larger scale.  The songs and dances are equally entertaining and just as offending as they are humorous.You need to like South Park, and its offensiveness to enjoy this movie... which I do.I rate this movie 8 out of 10.  More so because I got much more from it than expected... and enjoyed it enough that I will be returning.PS: There are reasons it has an 'R' Rating. I urge you to NOT take your kids to see this movie.",8,0,0,3 July 1999
Lilo & Stitch," 7 of 10 stars. Another Disney non-musical.
","When one thinks animated feature' (at least in the North American sense), one conjures up a musical rendition of an adapted fairy tale or legendary story.  Disney has been largely successful with that format in the past, and they seem to be diverging from it.  They brought us the hilarious antics in `The Emperor's New Groove' which was furthest from that format.  Now they bring us another break from the pack, `Lilo & Stitch'.Experiment 6-2-6' was designed by an alien race to be a super-soldier of sorts.  An artificial life deemed to be unsafe it is condemned to imprisonment.  However, it's clever enough to elude its captors, escapes, and crash-lands on Earth.  The landing target is, of all places, Hawaii where it is adopted by a young girl named Lilo (pronounced LEE-lo').  She is unaware of the creature's origins, mistakes it for a strange dog, and names him `Stitch'.  The story follows Lilo and Stitch (hence the title) as Lilo struggles with her broken family life (being raised by only her older sister), and Stitch adapts to life on Earth, while attempting to avoid capture by the society from which he escaped.  I found this film to be as entertaining to me, as the children in the theatre found it. The relationships in this movie are those that children can relate with.  Stitch's adapting to life in Hawaii is one that comes off quite comical, and routinely unexpected.  His social skills are lacking, and he reacts quickly, without thought, which is the source for the comedy.  I found myself laughing out loud at several of Stitch's antics, and his overall character behaviour really doesn't grow tiring.The movie does take an emotional side too as Lilo confronts her broken home and grows attached to Stitch, who ultimately is threatened with his own capture.  Although it could have gotten completely sappy at the end, it doesn't, which is refreshing.  Of course, it is a Disney feature, so a happy ending is always expected, but it's a light one complementing the light-hearted romp of this movie.Granted, it's not Disney's platinum achievements, nor is it an AMAZING story but given the low-key promotion this movie has had, it might slip by you un-detected.  My recommendation is that you do not let this happen. It's completely suitable to go to with children, or as a date flick, or even with a buddy.",7,1,1,13 July 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," An excellent counterpart to the series.
","I did not do a review for The Fellowship of the Ring last year, because I wasn't sure how I really thought about the film.  I liked it, but to me, it wasn't the spectacle nor was it the film everyone else around me thought. Maybe it was how it ended, and maybe it's because I didn't feel there was a lot to the story itself.  Then again, I have had absolutely NO previous exposure to the Lord of the Rings stories.  Sure I knew they were around, but besides that, knew nothing of them.That's not to say I didn't like the movie.  I just wasn't all that captivated with it like everyone else.  I do agree, that it was well done, well told, and offered a scope of cinema that is not common.  And when the extended version of The Fellowship of the Ring came out on DVD last month, I picked up a copy.  And I'm actually glad I did.  It gives a bit more background to the story, and offered me a refresher before seeing The Two Towers.And now, I am more able to give The Fellowship of the Ring its fair score. It does an excellent job to set up the characters, the relationships, and the mission.  This becomes more apparent from watching The Two Towers. Since I now know about the origins of the characters and what their objectives are, I can pay more attention to how they strive to meet their goals.  The Two Towers has a lot more substance to the plot and to the activity than its predecessor.  There are also different locales to focus on and simultaneous story lines.  Instead of just focusing on the fellowship as a group, we have their separate quests and adventures.  We have Frodo and Samwise who are trying to reach Mordor (as well as their new tag-along friend) we have Aragorn, Gimli, and Greenleaf on their quest, and we also see where Pippin and Merry have been led. (You may recall these groups were all separated at the end of The Fellowship of the Ring.)What's also nice is that there is a self-contained story here.  With the first story the quest began and they ran into some road-bumps, but the story didn't really end (of course not, we had 2 more chapters to go).  The story of this journey continues with The Two Towers yet there is also a self-contained, yet connected, story at work here.  As well, there is a new story of Gollum.  We learn a bit more about this odd creature -- a decent blend of good, bad, and his own personal struggles.The battle sequences in The Two Towers were more powerful and had more impact than previous, but justifiably so.  The tension in Middle Earth is rising, and both sides are nearing a peak and rising to achieve their goals at whatever cost.However, I had a bit of a complaint.  I would have liked a better explanation of these `Two Towers'.  What are they exactly, and why are they so significant?  They are apparently significant enough to deserve the title.  If their role was explained, then I apparently missed it. 
The Two Towers does well to complement The Lord of the Rings series.  And as such, I can now hold The Fellowship of the Ring in a better light, since now I have the benefit of its tale to be the setup for The Towers.  I can very much appreciate how this epic trilogy is going to continue when The Return of the King comes to theatres this time next year.",Null,0,0,21 December 2002
The Incredibles," Another winner from Pixar
","In recent years, since the success of X-Men, we've been bombarded with superhero comic-to-screen conversions some doing a good job, others not so good. Needless to say, it's a new genre that seems to already be getting tired of itself as well as the fan interest. The Incredibles however is a refreshing new superhero film. Unlike the recent lore, it's not based on a comic book series and therefore does not need to conform to nor preserve any preconceived notion of what it 'ought' to be. Instead it is a completely unique creation from the folks at Pixar animation, who once again have dished out a winner.As the story opens, we find Mr. Incredible (Bob Parr by day, and Craig T Nelson by voice) is one of many superheroes living in [insert name of anonymous metropolitan city here]. Co-existing with other heroes like Elastigirl and Frozone, who we also meet, they all hear the call of duty and rushed into action as regular as clock work Mr. Incredible is loved by the public, revered by law enforcement, and even has followers of fan clubs.He is proud to serve, but also balances his own personal life as well as being a superhero.That is until one member of the public sues Mr. Incredible and wins. This begins a long string of lawsuits against Mr. Incredible and various other superheroes that wind up placing them all into hiding never again revealing their super-identities to the public. That is until someone discovers Bob Parr's REAL identity and persuades him to come out of hiding to perform on more deed that only Mr. Incredible can accomplish The Incredibles is yet ANOTHER amazing Pixar accomplishment. Each animation feat since their feature Toy Story has been an improvement on the one before. The animation details on several of the water and natural elements in The Incredibles leaves me to wonder at times, if it was shot photographically, rather than computer generated, the animation is THAT well done.The Incredibles differs from its Pixar predecessors. Films like Toy Story, A Bug's Life, and even Finding Nemo are all targeted at children and have child-like qualities. This, however, is the first film from Pixar to achieve a PG rating and aptly so. The Incredibles' humour, dialogue, and story line surpasses the G-rated audience. Nothing in the film is offensive, mind you that's just not Pixar's way but I doubt most of the story would be appreciated by a younger crowd. However, since the original Toy Story audience has grown perhaps Pixar is merely growing up with them.The voice acting was well chosen. I think Craig T Nelson was an incredible selection (if you pardon the pun) for the voice of Bob Parr. I'm curious as to how he Nelson has escaped voice acting until now. A decent actor in his own right, he possesses a commanding voice for this type of work, and especially this character. At times, I thought I heard hints of Adam West (TV's original Batman) coming through Nelson's performance a sure sign of his 'hero' quality. Holly Hunter also was well picked for Elastigirl. She comfortably strikes the medium between heroine and housewife by being commanding and authoritative, yet 'homey' and sweet. Samuel L Jackson serves up a comedic presence as Frozone, Bob Parr's best friend and a performance for Jackson that rivals his own from Pulp Fiction.Although slow in spots, I still thoroughly enjoyed The Incredibles. It offers a great blend of action sequences and super-heroics, has fun with a bit of a satirical poke at superheroes in general, while at the same time offers it's own flavour of comedy that seemingly only comes from Pixar.",8,0,1,7 November 2004
Men in Black II," Not worth the time or admission price (minor spoilers)
","When riding on the coattails of its predecessor, a sequel should at least attempt' to out-do the first story.  Whether or not it succeeds in this endeavor usually remains to be seen.  Men In Black II fails and no effort at this attempt seems obvious.If you recall the first Men In Black, it gave us something we really hadn't seen before a sci-fi action flick, with a comedic twist.  The story set itself up nicely upon opening, and the plot had direction and a place to go. The film was full of fresh ideas, filled with new and exciting concepts into the whole alien-conspiracy' theories.  The effects were clearly thought out and worked very well but I digress, as this is a review of the sequel.and a much anticipated sequel from the original fan-base.  However, as anticipated and as over-promoted as MIB2 was, it should incite something the audience yearns to go see, something equally fresh as the original gave us. Unfortunately, it does not, and it fails in almost every aspect.It's a mild distraction at best and most of what we see in MIB2, is not fresh and new, in fact merely a re-hash of what made us laugh, and awe over in the first one. We re-visit Jeebs, the pawnshop owner with the floating eye (and you can BET you know what happens to him  almost like you expect it to happen) to Frank the Pug (the talking dog) who spouts of one-liners in an attempt at dog-humour.  We even run into the worm-aliens (you remember, from the coffee-room in the original movie) who seem only to be present for the mere re-hash effect.  They lend very little to the plot.What little we do see that is new, really isn't all that exciting, nor does it lend itself well to the story.  The trailers for MIB2 depict a scene with a huge worm eating the subway train.  This is probably the most thrilling and most involved sequence in the movie, and since you've already seen it in the trailer, the scene won't surprise you when it appears in the theatre.As for the acting, it might be hard to tell but it would seem that Will Smith and Tommy-Lee Jones do their best to carry their characters over from the first movie into this sequel.  And for what little substance there is to this plot, they seem to give what they can to their characters, almost in an effort to make up for a bad story.   Lara Flynn Boyle, the antagonist, is neither as threatening nor convincing a villain as Vincent D'Onofrio was in the first movie.  And Johnny Knoxville well I can't figure how he got into the movie, except maybe that he can just about handle the role of a bumbling villain side-kick.The one thing I did admire, however, was the subway locker.  The scene didn't last long, but it was perhaps the most original element of the entire movie, that didn't lend itself to being recycled from the first.Otherwise, I was quite disappointed from this effort. I really don't recommend seeing it.  This movie is only 88 minutes long, so if you still feel you can bring yourself to part with 9 bucks to go see it, at least not much of your time will be wasted.",3,0,0,13 July 2002
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Tarantino is a genius... another masterpiece.
","As the trailer and the opening credits will tell you, this is the 4th film by Quentin Tarantino.  Granted he has had other projects other than just four, but this is his fourth that he has written and directed himself.
Kill Bill: Vol.1 is the first half of an epic story about a woman, `The Bride' (codename Black Mamba) who was gunned down at her own wedding by the mysterious and apparently powerful (and yet unseen) `Bill'.  The Bride, as she is affectionately credited (and her actual name is bleeped out for dramatic affect) survives the gunshot and comes back with a vengeance to do nothing else short of  `kill bill'.Quentin Tarantino grew up watching samurai movies and serials.  He has admitted on several occasions that they were partly responsible for inspiring him to make movies in the first place and that he has aspired to make a modern-day samurai movie.  Kill Bill is that movie.Kill Bill: Vol.1 is nothing short of brilliant filmmaking.  It has the `pulpy' feel of Pulp Fiction (dare I say pulpier?).  It contains some of the brute violence (some say gore) of Reservoir Dogs, and is even influenced (admittedly) from a number of external sources and including Japan's Shadow Warriors series, old spaghetti-westerns, and there is even an exceptional Anime sequence right in the middle.What's interesting to note is that all of these influences are often times so clichéd within their own genre, one wonders how anyone could attempt to make a movie with those elements without being one big cliché in and of it self.  The fact that Tarantino is a genius (to partially quote my friend Rene) makes it possible for him to pull it off WITHOUT feeling like we've seen this movie a dozen times already.In Kill Bill: Vol.1 Tarantino also has the knack of being able to push the realm of reality a tad over the top but somehow not leaving us in disbelief or disgust.  Rather we are left in awe. His heroes (or heroines as the case may be) are not perfect and not without flaw, and we can at times see them falter, and I think that is what brings it down a notch from ridiculous.Of course, Kill Bill: Vol.1 is packed with pre-existing music that only Taratino could accurately select and incorporate perfectly into his scenes. With perfectly choreographed action sequences and a haunting soundtrack to boot, you'll almost feel like you're watching a dance rather than a duel (In fact, on my second viewing, both my girlfriend and I were BOTH tapping our feet to the music) None-the-less, there is no shortage of pain, sweat, and blood to re-enforce that this is a brutal battle.Personally, I haven't enjoyed going out to a night at the movies in a very long time as much as I had in going to see Kill Bill: Vol.1. In fact, it took me two-viewings to ensure I could be accurately inspired to write this review.  People only mildly impressed by Tarantino in the past may feel the same about Kill Bill, however, anyone who truly recognizes and appreciates his work, will enjoy Kill Bill to its fullest.(NOTE: Volume 2 is expected to be completed this February.  Let's refrain from calling it a sequel, shall we?)",9,0,0,18 October 2003
Big Fish," Moving film, should not be missed.
","'Most men, they'll tell you a story straight true. It won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.'Big Fish is a film all about such stories not the straight true ones but rather the interesting ones.  Stories as they were told by Edward Bloom to his son William, since the day Will was born.  The stories are tall tales of adventure that several fathers tell their children (as the movie opens) either around campfires, as bedtime stories, or as anecdotes at family gatherings.  Edward's stories are filled with fantasy, danger, excitement, humour, and even romance. These stories, to Will's dismay, never stopped.  Edward told them well into Will's adult life, and often to Will's embarrassment, and ultimately forced the two to stop speaking with one another.Now, due to Ed's failing health, Will returns home but is persistent on knowing the truth about his father.  He insists that his father put aside his tall tales and come to grips with what really happened in his life. Will wants so much to know who his father really is before he dies, that he won't even allow his father his final days as he would prefer.The story switches back and forth, from real/present time, and back into Ed's stories.  Even through the fantasy and exaggerations, we learn more about Ed Bloom through his stories than we do from anything else perhaps because this is all he has left.Tim Burton has put together an amazing tale in Big Fish and has displayed it in an amazing way.  We get to see first hand (so to speak) Edward's stories in all their exaggerated fantasy as only Edward Bloom could have told them.At the same time, we get a very REAL story about a son and father who have drifted apart. They were 'strangers who knew each other well' as Will puts it, and brought back together because of his father's illness.  It's not that Will doesn't love his father, but he so much wants to connect with him that he gets frustrated when all Ed wants is to live in his stories.As Ed's stories are brought to life on screen, they are perfectly crafted and shot vibrantly (when vibrancy is of essence).  Of course, these images are extraordinarily bright and at times exaggerated, but justly so, as we expect that this is the way the stories were told.  Tim Burton is well known for his unique imagery, and Big Fish takes full advantage of Burton's visionary and imaginative talents.The characters that are included in Ed's stories, including the younger Ed Bloom himself (played by Ewan McGregor) are also a bit exaggerated, but they need to be for the purpose of the stories.  The characters in real/present time are truly believable in their feelings toward with the bed ridden Edward Bloom (played by Albert Finney).  His wife, Sandra (Jessica Lange) loves him dearly his son William (Billy Crudup) although frustrated loves his father and Will's wife, Josephine (Marion Cotillard) who doesn't know Ed, seems to enjoy his charm.  All have their individual and distinct relationship with Ed, throughout the picture.Big Fish is an exceptionally moving film. It's charming and fantastic enough to share with your children, warm and romantic enough for couples of all ages, and touching and moving enough to knock down even the strongest of viewers. Although the film was out last year, I didn't catch Big Fish until its recent release on DVD.  As such, it is the best film I have seen so far this year.  Big Fish is available for rent or purchase on DVD.  It holds my high recommendation and should not be missed.  I'm granting it an IMDB rating... 8.5 out of 10",9,0,0,28 April 2004
The Matrix Reloaded," Excellent mate to the first film
","The first film was an excellent peek into the universe of the Matrix and gave us the answer to the question What is the Matrix? - which, incidentally, was aptly utilized as the promotional tag line from the 1999 film.Now, in the eagerly anticipated sequel, The Matrix Reloaded, we pick up the story some time after the first and learn SOOO much more about the Matrix, its universe, and about the war that rages on.Without spoiling the film, just be aware that some time has passed since we left the first story.  Neo has exercised his abilities. Agent Smith seemingly is growing stronger. and the universe is a LOT bigger than we had originally thought.I will refrain from telling you any details about the story, or how it develops, but it does lend heavily on the premise that you know what happened in the first episode.  Unlike many other sequels, this one does not remind you where you have been or what you have already seen.  That being said, if you think you might need a refresher course, you probably should watch The Matrix again before going to see it.There is no shortage of action in this film.  All well orchestrated special effects, (including the trademark Bullet-Time effect), well choreographed fight scenes (ala Matrix-style of course) and a superbly done chase sequence that could only have existed inside the Matrix itself.The great thing about inventing a world like the Matrix, is that the Wachowski Brothers can do pretty much whatever they want to inside this universe. Even better is that they don't over-do it and make it foolish. Even though in any other movie, it might be. here, it's all feasible and believable.By now you are aware that this story line aims to be a trilogy, with the third film being released this coming November.   Although the first film arrived 4 years ago, 2003 promises to be the year of The Matrix. what with two major motion pictures, a major video-game tie-in, and The Animatrix short film releases (currently online and with a DVD coming soon).
The Matrix Reloaded is a very comfortable fit as a sequel.  It's a good match, and is on-par with the first film.  It doesn't out-do its predecessor, but it does serve up a decent pay-off for the setup you were given already.   It also does well to lead us up to part three: The Matrix Revolutions (thankfully we don't have to wait another 4 years for that!)[Note: If you want a little more of a tease to help get you psyched up. stick through the final credits. There's a little surprise at the end you might enjoy. ]",Null,0,0,14 May 2003
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Captivating and genius story telling.
","It's back to school for students of Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and that means more mystery, more danger, and more adventures for our magical trio; Hermione Granger, Ron Weasly, and of course the famous Harry Potter.The first movie in this series, Harry Potter and the Philospher's Stone (or Sorcerer's Stone, depending on where you lived) had to meet the expectation of millions of fans (children and adults alike) of the J.K. Rowling's books. And live up to them it did. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets now has even more to live up to based on the success of the first movie, as well as the book it is based upon.  And it delivers, just as much, if not more than the first.Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets begins in much the same place we originally found Harry at the Dursley's residence, just before Harry's birthday.  Without surprise, the Dursley's have no sympathy -- nor respect for Harry.  He has, however, upgraded from the cupboard under the stairs to his own bedroom (formerly Dudley's 2nd bedroom), and is anxiously awaiting his return to Hogwart's.  However, someone is trying to prevent him from going back that someone is Dobby the House Elf (who serves another wizardry-family, and who by now you've seen in the trailer for the film).  Regardless, a Harry Potter story just wouldn't be the same without a trip to Hogwarts.You may remember that last semester saw the leave of the Defense of the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Quirrell.  This year a rather conceited Kenneth Branagh (as Gilderoy Lockhart) has replaced him.  And we have the pleasure (and I use the term loosely) to meet Lucius Malfoy, the father of the Slitherin nemesis of Harry, Draco Malfoy.  There are a few more additions to the cast, as well the rest of the students and staff of Hogwarts are all present and account for this year.Like any good sequel, certain events should remind us of the first story, when it is necessary, and without running into a constant re-telling of the previous story.  It accomplishes this feat VERY well, and tells it's own unique story with absolute perfection.  We also get to learn a little bit more about the history of the wizardry community, a little more about Hagrid's past, and a little bit about Hogwarts past.  Joanne Rowling has a knack for writing a compelling story full of wonder, adventure and mystery and it's one thing to be able to inspire a thought or idea and create imaginations but for Chris Columbus to be able to feed the scribe new life and create a living, breathing image, is exceptional. 
When I saw the first film last year, I immediately was compelled to read the book, and see how accurate the conversion to film really was.  I found it to be quite accurate perhaps the most accurate book to film conversion I have seen.  (I was sorely disappointed when it wasn't even NOMINATED for the adapted screenplay Oscar.)I have yet to complete Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets in book form, but I am mostly expecting a good translation from book to film yet again, based on the content and imagery I saw on screen, and comparing it to the experience I had with the first film.[Aside: Keep in mind, that my first love is film.  More times than not, my reading of the book before seeing the film has left me hating an otherwise good film.  I'd prefer to enjoy the film and it's instant satisfactions, and THEN enhance that experience by reading the book.]I had, however, read about a quarter of The Chamber of Secrets before going to see the film, and what I read was VERY accurate on-screen.The visual effects are very well done, including the completely computer-generated character, Dobby the house Elf.  As well as all the mystical and magical creatures that one might expect to find at a school like Hogwarts. The completeness of this environment and the detailing are incredible.  Nothing in this world seems out of place.  Everything fits perfectly, and lends the realism and authenticity that is missing from many films.Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets is a truly immersing experience, even more so, I found, than the first film.  There is a sensation that you are right there at Hogwarts with Harry, discovering the clues, uncovering the mysteries, and experiencing all the magic that is to be found in a Harry Potter story.This only being the second in the series (that promises to be seven in all) it is clear to see that this film franchise promises big things in its future.  The stories are full of wonder, wit, charm, and gripping plot lines that certainly deliver, will keep you satisfied, and leave you eagerly anticipating the next installment.  I'm likely going to take a lot of flack for this next comment, but I dare say that this collection of films promises to be bigger and more successful than the Star Wars franchise.  Not that I don't love the Star Wars films, but the Harry Potter films are truly sensational and pure genius story telling and movie making.If you saw the first film and loved it (and why wouldn't you?)  I highly recommend seeing Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets.  If you haven't see the first film then by all means, rent it, and then go see this one. I'm giving it a very solid 8.5 IMDB score.",9,0,0,16 November 2002
X2: X-Men United," Good 2nd chapter in the X-men saga
","When we left the last story of X-men back in 2000, Wolverine had very little clue into the origins of his adamantium skeleton but was on a quest to find more Rogue had decided to make her home at Xavier's school of the gifted, and we had the benefit of meeting the further characters of Cyclops, Dr. Jean Grey, Storm, Professor Xavier himself, and of course his arch nemesis Magneto.After being introduced the characters of X-men from the 2000 movie, the story continues in this year's X2 with the addition and cameos of a few new characters.  One such character is in the opening sequence.  We get introduced to Nightcrawler.  Born Kurt Wagner, this mutant turned to a life of a circus-freak side-show exhibit, but a bizarre twist turns him into a vigilante who has infiltrated the White House.Logan's (aka Wolverine) story picks up where it left off in the previous chapter looking for some more clues at Alkali Base in Alberta where his fateful procedure' seemingly had taken place.We further find Charles Xavier visiting his now captured enemy, Erik Lehnshherr (aka Magneto) in his custom built non-metal prison, and Rouge has found her place at Xavier's school in the arms of love interest, Bobby Drake (who goes by the alias Iceman).These serve as a reminder of what was left for us to contemplate at the end of 2000's X-men while eagerly waiting this sequel, X2.  And now, with Magneto behind bars, there is new enemy to fear this man is William Stryker.  His motives parallels Magneto's from the first chapter... however instead of uniting the planet into a mutant population, Stryker sees fit to eliminate mutants entirely, and goes through the Washington as his first steps to do so.There is plenty of action in X2 and the story is full of surprises that one might not necessarily expect.  There are also some very clever events that take place without revealing them here, suffice it to say, I found them to be pleasantly and interestingly thought out.We got most of the character development in the first film, and this leans on our knowledge of that, with only a few subtle reminders.  I might have wished for more character development, but the realm of X-men is huge and the list of characters is too long to involve EVERYONE and still have a substantial story line, so I forgive it for that.   plus we DO get some good insight into Nightcrawler, who seems to be the largest new character this time around.Logan (Wolverine) doesn't seem to be as sarcastic as he was the first time maybe he's learning to adjust to the ways of mutant life.  But I also had wished for more banter between him and Scott Summers (Cyclops) but that is also justified near the end.X2 is definitely worth the price of admission, but I would say that a review of the first film on DVD is worth a watch before going to X2 for nothing more than the affect of continuing the story.",Null,0,0,5 May 2003
Gangs of New York," Excellent epic, good characters, perfect setting.
","Gangs of New York takes place in 19th Century New York (the early 1850s to be exact) and tells us the story set around the masses of Irish immigrants coming to New York, at the same time the civil war was raging, and an insight into early gang influences in New York.The English `natives' who were descended from early English settlers (when escaping British rule) are the dominating gang in New York's `Five Points' neighbourhood.  The opening scene displays a showdown gang-battle between some of the earliest Irish immigrants and their allegiances, against the `Natives' who object to outsiders coming in to their territory'.Sixteen years later, the young boy who had escaped the war is now a man.  It was his father that led the Irish `Dead Rabbits' gang, but was brutally killed in that brutal and bloody opening battle.His return is subtle, and he unintentionally works his way into the gang, befriending the man who killed his father sixteen years earlier. 
However, there is much more to this film that a possible vengeance plot. There is the civil war aspect, and the political hand plays a very persuasive role.  Immigrants are constantly arriving by ship, and there is a draw to their attention.  The big picture' story here is one that you do not want to ignore.Even though the elements of gang mythos are present (the power-by-fear, the sharing of profits, the respect, and even the political involvement) do not fool yourself.  This is NOT your ordinary gang-film. Gangs of New York is so much more and with good reason.  This film has been on Scorsese's mind for a little over 20 years.  In fact, it was supposed to be his next production after Taxi Driver was released in 1977.  Apparently it got pushed back for one reason or another as well, the production release was delayed due to the September 11th attacks, and the release was delayed due to the mass of summer blockbusters.  But its delay was worth the wait.  The production of this film is astonishing.  There really is no reason to doubt that you are in 19th Century New York City, no reason to believe that the characters are real.  Their behaviour for the time period and location they are in is absolutely believable.DiCaprio plays his most commanding role, and he does it fairly well.  He can't do an Irish accent, but that's nothing to be concerned about.  However the show is stolen by Daniel Day-Lewis.  Day-Lewis gives his character, Bill Cutting, a very ferocious, cynical, and confident demeanor.  That's not to say the other characters are not equally colorful, because they are.  But it is his delivery of this character that makes him shine. I would be disappointed if he is not nominated for a supporting actor Oscar.Another interesting point of mention (without spoiling) is the attitude between different groups that are shown in the film and how they compare with those that exist today  ranging from law enforcement, fire fighters, politics, and even crime involvement.Gangs of New York may be the best movie out this year.  It's an epic piece, set in a period' time frame, in a setting we all are familiar with.  We can relate to the characters, and we can learn a few things along the way.Although the film is excellent and well done, I found some parts of it a bit weak.  It's 8-star rating here BARELY squeaked by. But regardless, you should still not miss this one.",Null,0,0,21 December 2002
