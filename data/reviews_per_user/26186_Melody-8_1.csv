Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Just My Opinion!
",I thought the movie Star Wars Episode 1 was just as good as the original ones.  I loved all of the new characters.  I think that all of the different creatures add a lot to the movie.  It keeps it from getting boring.  The plot was a good one.  The force was sent to save life as in the original ones.  So it sticks to the first ones well.  I can't wait until the next one comes out!,10,0,0,1 June 1999
