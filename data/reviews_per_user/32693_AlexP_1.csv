The Blair Witch Project," Easily one of the most frightening movies ever made.
","The Blair Witch Project is easily one of the most frightening movies ever made. It plays with your head in more ways than you can count. A movie that taps in to what *really* frightens us, as humans.  Most people are frightened of just being lost in the woods, and everyone is scared of being lost with something *else* in the woods.  It'll make you small.Filmmaking history, mark my words.",10,1,3,29 April 1999
