Requiem for a Dream," Brilliantly Wrtten, Directed, and Acted
","Rarely does a movie depict life in its reality. Darren Aronofsky is one the most impressive film directors, whos films I watch more than once. Watching Requiem for a Dream, years ago, moved me emotionally, and I since had rented it when there were stores such as Blockbuster, where DVDs could be rented. I used a gift card to purchase this, in a twin package with Pi. I also used the gift card to purchase Black Swan. Few movies attract the talents of Darren Aronofsky, Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, and Jennifer Connelly. All excellent actors. And while this movie is a bit disturbing at times, I'll watch it over and over.",10,0,0,5 August 2017
Spotlight," Informative and Relevant for those raised under the Archdiocese of the Catholic Church
","Spotlight is Spot On. Decades of concealment of child sexual abuse. I rented this Best Motion Picture of the Academy Awards on iTunes a couple years ago. The Pennsylvania Commonwealth House of Representatives and Senate refused to overturn the statue of limitations to allow the Attorney General to prosecute and sentence each and everyone to imprisonments. Excellent writing, direction, and acting.",10,0,0,20 July 2019
Green Book," A True Gift to an Audience
","Green Book is based upon a true story, and one that's important for most people to view. It's regarding race relations the history of discrimination purely based upon a person's color, and not their contributions to their own community, but to society as a whole. This film was beautifully written, directed, and acted. And while I was able to laugh in parts, I found it more drama than comedy. I strongly encourage more people to view this to fully comprehend what our past has allowed white people to do to those who aren't the same race or ethnicity.",10,6,14,13 January 2019
