First Man," Can't believe the positive reviews
",One of the most boring films I've ever seen. Nothing to offer. The two hours and 25 minutes are just plain boredom. Wanted to leave earlier from the cinema for the first time ever.,4,0,1,27 October 2018
A Star Is Born," Better than valium
","Can't believe the rating of this movie on IMDB. I wasn't convinced in the beginning to see it but I wouldn't like to miss a 7.9 star movie.
Omg. It's so boring and soooo predictable.",3,2,5,10 February 2019
Marriage Story," Not great not terrible
","Somewhere in the middle.
Certainly not a movie to be rated more than 8 stars in IMDB. Reading the various reviews you understand that the people who rated it 10 stars (simply ridiculous) is because they saw part of their lives in the movie. But is that enough for a good review?
Anyway.
Overall, the movie is quite realistic but also quite boring and pointless regarding the aftermath.",5,2,7,26 December 2019
