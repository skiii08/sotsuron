Minority Report," A suspensful futuristic thriller, with twists and turns all about
","Steven Spielberg has once again crafted a masterpiece (with the exception of A.I. - let us just put that behind us). Tom Cruise has stunned viewers by acting in such movies as `Jerry Maguire' and `A Few Good Men', and `Minority Report' has certainly been added to that extensive list. Cruise plays a detective named John Anderton who works in the Pre-Crimes Division in the year 2054. With the combined use of astounding technology and 3 precogs (aptly named people who have been gifted with precognitive abilities), the government is able to predict murders in advance, and stop them from taking place. Cruise plays the chief of the Pre-Crimes Division based in Washington D.C. when he becomes targeted for a murder he has not committed.yet. The movie continues and at first I thought it would be one of those cliched movies where an innocent man runs from the law - but as the film progressed, I began to see that nothing was at it seems. The acting by the main characters was commendable, but the extras did not add to the veracity of the situation. The technology was plausible for half a century in the future (except for maybe the use of cars that drive up the sides of buildings) and the advertising (although very annoying at times) added to the reality. All round a great movie that is not predictable and very suspenseful.",Null,0,0,12 September 2002
Remember the Titans," An inspirational true story
","Remember the Titans is a movie that no one can forget. Any person who has had the honor of seeing this movie, WOULD remember the titans. Denzel Washington gives (as usual) an extraordinary performance, portraying his character as if he really is that character. Although an underrated movie, it truly is a masterpiece. With many other great, young, up and coming actors, the movie gives viewers a sense of joy by the end. To see the heroics of these young football players, uniting together as one no matter what the colour of skin, is outstanding. A truly brilliant movie, filled with some suspense, funny scenes, hard hitting football scenes and most of all, inspiration.",Null,0,1,12 September 2002
