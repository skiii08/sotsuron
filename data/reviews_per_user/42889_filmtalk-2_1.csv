The Blair Witch Project," BLAIR WITCH: HIGHLY ORIGINAL, SCARY THRILLER!
","I saw this movie in all of its glory at one of the manysold-out performances of the Sundance Film Festival and it wasincredible!  A truly unique conceptual horror-film where thepoint-of-view is through the cameras of 3 film students creatinga documentary about the mythical Blair Witch who resides in thehills of Maryland.  Legend has it that she tortures and killsall that walks into her path.Well, with that in mind, the film opens with these 3 poor soulsmissing for several years, last being seen in a nearby townasking questions to the creepy locals.  All that remains oftheir existence is the footage that they shot, which is piecedtogether in an attempt to discover the mystery of theirdisappearance.Pretty cool, eh?Yes, The Blair Witch Project sure is.  The directors and writersDan Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez are a force to be reckoned within the world of independent, thought-provoking film-making.  Metthe producers at the fest too, who also should be congratulatedfor this exciting movie.",10,1,4,10 February 1999
