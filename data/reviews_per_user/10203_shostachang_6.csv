Changeling," not easy to watch
","there's absolutely no winning with the doctors. If you smile too much, you're delusional. If you smile too little, you're depressed. If you're neutral, then you've lost touch with basic human emotions. All anyone can do is learn how to behave properly. The Wineville Chicken Coop Murders (also known as the Wineville Chicken Murders) was a series of kidnappings and murders of young boys occurring in Los Angeles and Riverside County, California between 1928 and 1930.

Gone Baby Gone," They deserve much better
","The Opening:'I always believed it was the things you don't choose that makes you who you are. Your city; Your neighborhood; Your family. People here take pride in these things. Like it was something they'd accomplished.The bodies around their souls. The cities wrapped around those.' When I was young, I asked my priest how you could get to heaven and still protect yourself from all the evil in the world. He told me what God said to his children. You are sheep among wolves, be wise as serpents, yet innocent as doves.Now, Rats, roaches all over the place. But the kid's room, in the back , was spotless . No, l mean, he swept it, mopped it, it was immaculate . The little boy's sitting on the bed holding onto his PlayStation or dear life. There's no expression on his face, tears streaming down. He wants to tell me he just learned his multiplication tables. l mean, the father's got him in this crack den,, and this little boy just wants someone to tell him that he's doing a good job .'",8,0,2,7 July 2009
Gran Torino," highest expectation
","The movie is structured as a delicate metaphor; the old car symbolizes the old man from various perspectives. Even though the car is kept in garage and cannot be used as anymore as an advanced, stylish vehicle, the prized possession still stands for the past glory and all the pride. In the last scene of the movie, Tao drives the Gran Torino bestowed by Walt and vanishes in the distance, which simply implies that when someone is getting old and is gradually stepping out of the dominant social life, he could still play a crucial role and drive the weak and the young on a reliable weaker into peace and safety. The movie Gran Torino helps you delve into the inner world of seniors. As they become marginalized and sometimes are not treated with equality, they appear to be tough-minded but actually call for people's care and understanding at the bottom of hearts, at the same time, hope to contribute more to the community they live in and realize their value as a social being.",8,1,8,7 July 2009
2001: A Space Odyssey," A Parable of Wisdom
","In the film, the manifestation of the giant rectangular rock is always associated with the scene that moon and sun emerged in the same sky, according to Chinese astronomy, this means something extremely odd is about to occur, which is true to the film as well. In the first episode: the dawn of man, the ape-like ancient men approached the rectangular with great fear and curiosity, when they finally dare to touch the surface of the rock, the sight occurred and soon after which, one of them was inspired to make the first tool in human history from animal bones. Here wisdom was inspired and expressed in a violent and combative way,they were just means to kill others, tools to satisfy stomaches and ways to express anger. Wisdom was far from the thing that could bring them happiness, or had they aware of anything called happiness?",8,0,4,7 July 2009
Rear Window," Hitchcock's humor
","This is a suspense; which, of course, is an interesting place to talk about Hitchcock's sense of humor. James Stewart's, Thelma Ritter's (the no-nonsense nurse, God bless her soul), and, lo behold, even Grace Kelly's! Which makes me wonder why Chinese movies can be funny, but are generally not very humorous. Humor is not a lipstick that is applied at the last moment, to lighten things up. As the New Yorker film critic Anthony Lane puts it, humor in movies should be 'something that is already there---a luminous, natural coloring under the thrills, a blush in the very notion of romance'. That's why the comic moments in Chinese movies always strike me as contrived, as carefully--but separately--planned, like in Sad, really.",6,0,2,7 July 2009
