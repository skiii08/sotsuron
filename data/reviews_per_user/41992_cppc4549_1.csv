Casablanca," This film has badly aged
","This film appears to have badly aged. Old sentimental and patriotic rhetoric about the 'tough guy with tender heart', helpless woman who 'suffers' because she's torn between two lovers, manichean vision of the good (Americans), rather lost (French collaborators), and bad (the Germans) guys. Even Titanic seemed much more convincing. And why is it that Humphrey Bogart is supposed to be such a seductive legend? I find him dull and devoid of expression, much less empathy. I think the demographic breakdown of the vote on Casablanca explain in part the basis for the enthusiasm: most positive have been old-age men. Those who are still admiring the patronizing male.",4,11,30,8 July 2004
