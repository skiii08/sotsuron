Hereditary," Uhh really? After all the hype!?
","Let me just start by saying that I read so many 10/10 reviews on this movie that it made me giddier then a 17 year old girl getting ready for prom. Buttttt then... a serious kick in the ol apple bag... what the shoot!? Such a boring and non scary movie I just can't comprehend all the reviews stating how 'gripping and terrifying' this movie is. Overall I would say it's a too long bore fest. If you want a movie that is actually psychological and incredibly horrifying/disturbing check out yellow brick road, that movie literally made me sleep with the light on! Only for one night though I swear!!!!!",2,8,14,6 June 2019
