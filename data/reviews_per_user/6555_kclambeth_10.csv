"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Fat and Fantastic!
","I loved Shaun of the dead and hot fuzz so i knew i would like this but it was even funnier than i thought it was going to be.A strong cast, the storyline was obvious but then i think that was the point, it was supposed to be a clich√©, that's why it seemed funnier. The direction and writing were very good and generally the pace of the film was perfect.I adore Simon Pegg in these roles, his ability to play the straight, flawed individual but make him the funniest man on screen is great and you're drawn to his story, no matter how ridiculous his predicament is. His best friend was hilarious, the setting of the London marathon was a great idea and Hank Azaria played his part well as the whole way through i wanted him to not get the girl and lose the race.It's not as funny as Simon's other films but i really enjoyed it and it was well worth paying to see, in fact i'd watch it again tomorrow as there was so many laughs throughout to hold my interest.Overall i love the Britishness of this film, the good guy and his basic life, it's not showy, or Hollywood it's just a simple film with comedy stars doing silly things and making us laugh, a perfect pick me up if you ask me.",9,78,106,11 September 2007
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," harmless fun and great mad situations
","I had wanted to see this for ages but never got round to it. i had heard good reviews and bad but wanted to judge for myself.I really enjoyed it. the character of Borat is not intended to offend the world but mock the world and let us all laugh at ourselves. the documentary style adds to the spontaneity and the improvised moments (I'm not certain what is and what is isn't) make it even funnier. it seems people are so easily offended that they don't even listen to the joke, or get caught up in the madness of a man like Borat actually interacting with American society.Sacha Baron Cohen is excellent at this portrayal and he manages to contain this character throughout and his manager is also funny. it is a well pieced together story commencing with his initial arrival to make a documentary and discover the American dream but ends up on a very different journey.Some of the scenes were very cringe-worthy (In a good way)really Borat is getting away with saying and doing things a lot of people wish they could do or say. in the earlier scenes when people are running from him for simply approaching them, it lets an audience get an insight into how society reacts to different people and different cultures; i find this interesting.Overall I found it a laugh out loud, hysterical film with unusual situations. it is accelerated into drama with the American citizens having to co-exist with this tactless man who deep down is shown to have a heart but lives simply in a different way to what we are used to, it may be exaggerated but it is simply supposed to be a bit of fun.",8,0,0,18 April 2009
Shaun of the Dead," Simon, Edgar and a slice of fried gold
","What can i say? i adore this film. i love Simon and Edgar collaborations and this is brilliant. funny, witty, inventive and a great showcase of the zombie genre! The writing is great and watching this film a second (or even ten) times is a must. i have noticed so many things i didn't the first time round and so many ironies and gags.What i love is how quotable the film is and how it depicts the horror genre without true drama and tragedy but with a laugh, yet Shaun remains convincing throughout and the situation is totally realistic (If zombies existed) the characters are all great and bill Nighy is fab as step dad phillip and the pool cue beating set to 'don't stop me now' by Queen is genius. It is filmed and directed fantastically, with great detail and care and it's got plenty of blood and guts if that's your thing.Simon Pegg is such a great actor and he is so easy to watch, he makes me laugh and feel sad and his partnership with Nick Frost is inspiring.Overall, a cult film in my opinion, so much better than any other modern comedies which rely too much on 'gross out' humour rather than wit and intelligence, plus this has got the blood too, what more could you want, as the film poster says, it's got romance too, but not heavy on it.If you haven't seen it yet, what are you waiting for?",10,0,3,25 January 2008
Hot Fuzz," The greater good...it's great and good.
","Hot fuzz is a must see for all movie fans; there is so much to see and so much happening.Starring as always the brilliant Simon Pegg and the funny Nick Frost as two policeman (Nicholas Angel and Danny) in the sleepy village of Sandford (or IS it sleepy?) This film manages to combine laugh out loud humour with drama, murder, kick ass action sequences and in some ways a love story. The script by Simon and Edgar is very witty and well thought out.The supporting cast are great too with great, peculiar personalities that really confuse Angel when he first arrives in Sandford, Jim Broadbent especially comes to mind as he gives a great performance as Danny's father.Overall the film is worth watching again and again as you miss loads the first time you watch it; the acting and direction is great and everyone works so well together. The only bad point is that it should have been about ten minutes shorter but that's just being picky.Another triumph from Simon, Edgar, Nick and the crew.",10,1,2,25 January 2008
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Reaping his vengeance!
","This was another brilliant Tim Burton/Johnny Depp collaboration, it was impossible to imagine anyone but Johnny in this dark role and he had a great singing voice too.Overall there was nothing i disliked. i loved the songs, the atmosphere, the acting and the mystery of the story of Sweeney Todd. Johnny Depp was perfect in this role and i had glimpses of Edward scissorhands and Ichabod Crane in his portrayal, which was great. The atmosphere really set the scene and the stagey feel to the set made it seem more theatrical and creepy. the darkness was eerie and when watching in the cinema, it makes for an even more chilling experience.Helena Bonham-Carter was equally as good and the supporting roles were good too and their vocals strong, the rhythm of the film was flowing as fast as the blood from the razors.The blood looked a little un realistic, but i think that seemed almost more theatre like to me and keeping in tune with the stage production. I really enjoyed this film and would love to see the stage show as well as film versions of musicals do tend to trim a few songs here and there which is my only qualm.Go and see this as soon as you can and if you love Gothic horror, blood and gore, fantasy, mystery and tragedy and good Stephen Sondheim songs, you will love this.",9,0,0,8 February 2008
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," What curious case?
","I don't get the hype at all and cannot believe the score this film gets. I really wanted to see it but was thoroughly disappointed. This is a VERY slow paced film and I mean slow, I usually enjoy films that are slower moving like 'Lost in Translation' but this is way too long and the plot doesn't hold up. Reasons I was not impressed:1. For a very special condition such as Benjamin had, he was not at all special, he was not charming, emotional or even burdened by his condition.2.Brad Pitt's acting lacked any depth. his character was merely like a 'normal' person and we were treated to a life story of a very average type of man.3. Too long- could have been half an hour shorter. it was so slow moving that i got very restless and watched the clock to see how long it had left. all i ended up doing was watching the end to see how he would regress into childhood.4.The narration is very annoying. The old Daisy is practically inaudible and the narration of Benjamin's diary is intrusive and schmaltzy.5. No conflict. I waited for some and it never came, every time something began to happen in his life, a new scene started. characters were to and fro like yo yo's, he didn't learn anything from any experiences and an audience learns nothing from this man (who is different in a very big way)6. Despite great special effects, the darkness after a while appears dull and I was hoping for a least one 'light' scene.7. The acceptance of Benjamin. he was not shown to be bullied, questioned or ridiculed and unlike the superior Forrest Gump, he had no sense of humour and was not brave.Overall, the film was slow, dull and far too long. the film looked quite good, but the plot was lost. the unusual premise should have spawned an intriguing life story of a very un-common man but instead we just got a pretentious, Hollywood style life story of a man with no depth, which was simply in reverse.",4,4,8,21 April 2009
The Holiday," Enjoyable escapism
","I think this film deserves a better rating than the current 6.9 on IMDb. I to expected it to be just like other rom com's but it was much better than i expected and very enjoyable.The story starts with Amanda (Cameron Diaz) and Iris (Kate Winslet) fed up with their love lives; Amanda's boyfriend has been cheating on her and the man Iris loves has just got engaged to someone else. They both decide to switch houses for Christmas for an escape from their complicated lives; so Iris jets off to Amanda's place in sunny L.A and Amanda goes to Iris' quaint cottage in snowy Surrey, England (if only it really did snow at Christmas!) Amanda soon meets Iris' handsome brother Graham (Brilliantly played by Jude Law) and Iris meets musician Miles (Jack Black) and you can guess the rest...The acting is strong and well handled. At first i found Cameron Diaz hugely annoying but as it went on i warmed to her character; she and Jude had lots of chemistry and their relationship was handled well and Graham's secret was a good twist.I thought Jack Black was great in this different role, he and Kate also had chemistry and he was totally believable. I wish their storyline had been a bit longer though as they spent way more time on Cameron and Jude's part.Kate Winslet as usual was funny and touching as Iris and maybe one of the best parts of the film was her relationship with the old man (Eli Wallach) they both seemed to have a connection and it was nice to hear his stories of when he was a writer in the good old Hollywood days when he knew Cary Grant and co! If you want beautiful scenery, escapism from the millions of horror and action films out there and good characterisation, than this is for you. It's not as soppy as other rom/com's and it's easy to identify with the characters, it's also very festive and my dad even liked it and he hates romantic films!",8,31,36,17 May 2007
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," 'Is that an African swallow?'
","I love this film and slightly prefer it to the Life of Brian (which is hilarious) I only saw this for the first time last year and was so glad i finally got to see it after many years of wanting to.The Pythons have such a unique style of comedy that at the time was groundbreaking, it's not as shocking or controversial by today's standards but the point is they weren't afraid to take risks or not do something for fear of looking stupid.Set in legendary King Arthur's England, King Arthur (played brilliantly by Graham Chapman) and his knights set upon a quest to find the holy grail. The quest takes them to the most ludicrous places (like the castle Anthrax) and they face the most bizarre situations (the bridge of death to name but one) and meet some peculiar characters including the Knights of Ni.The acting is great with Chapman as King Arthur and the other pythons playing many small roles, each very talented and individually skilled. There are many laughs, my favourite part being the conversation about the migrating swallows. I really enjoyed this film and think more young people should see it, it is one of the few films labelled as a comedy that actually makes me laugh.Although it is over thirty years old, it doesn't feel dated to me, it has a contemporary feel to it and i think it will still be popular in thirty years time. This is in my opinion the best film they have done; 'Life of Brian' is a close second but wasn't too impressed with 'the meaning of life'.Anyways a must see and deservedly in the top 250.",10,3,4,10 April 2008
Slumdog Millionaire," Brilliant, touching and beautiful
","I was shocked at some people rating this at six or seven. I understand people have different tastes but this film is so good that I can't imagine someone not liking it.I don't want to go into the storyline because I think it's one of those films that needs seeing for yourself. When i first went to the cinema I was in awe the whole time, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. When the credits rolled, myself and my two friends (and most of the audience) were just staring in awe at the screen and it was so good i went again the next week and loved it just as much the second time.The first thing that strikes you is the beautiful cinematography, everything is top notch-the direction from Danny Boyle, The writing, the soundtrack, the team work of the production team who seem to love what they were working on and the acting is so good. Not only Dev Patel and Freida Pinto as the older Jamal and Latika but the talent of every actor playing Jamal, Salim and Latika is amazing especially the young boys playing Jamal and Salim (sorry their names escape me) and the 'who wants to be a millionaire' host gives some light relief humour.I highly recommend this film, a friend of mine just rolled her eyes when I told her i had watched this film as for some reason she has a real problem with British films which is a shame because she's missing out not only my favourite film of the year but maybe one of my favourite films ever.When a film makes you not look away for a second, makes you talk about it for days and actually means something then you know it's something special and it certainly is that.",10,0,4,17 April 2009
Atonement," Visually beautiful
","I wasn't sure if i wanted to see this film as i'm not usually into romantic dramas, but this was something else, it's not just a 'man loves woman with lots of crying involved' plot; it's a beautiful, tragic story set in WWII.The story starts in 1935 when 13 year old Briony- not understanding the situation between her sister Cecilia and their gardener Robbie- accuses Robbie of something he did not do, changing the three of their lives forever.The acting is top notch, especially James Mcavoy who was fantastic, Keira Knightly was great too and unfairly criticised i think, she is a fine actress who portrays Cecilia with great care. Saoirse Ronan and Romola Garai who play Briony are fantastic too and you really feel for her as she comes to terms with her actions but never overcomes the guilt she feels.The cinematography, and the direction (by Joe Wright) is stunning, the palette of colours used are beautiful-from the rich greens and vibrant blues of England's countryside to the blacks, greys, browns and sepia's of Dunkirk. The beach scene at Dunkirk was probably the best visual piece in the film (or other film) I could watch it over again as i couldn't take my eyes off it. The beach scene was very moving, having Robbie walk along the beach in silence with just the chilling sounds of a small group of soldiers singing was very moving and showed the other side of the harshness of war, not just from battle sequences.I highly recommended this film, the acting, direction and score is superb. I haven't read the novel so cannot comment on the adaptation factor, but as a film it is a memorable one. My whole family enjoyed this film, which doesn't happen often in a family with such different tastes. Atonement may not be everyones cup of tea, but i say give it a go just for the experience of it all.",9,0,1,29 March 2008
