Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Who cares, its STAR WARS!
","Despite all the negative reviews, I still loved this movie and have gone back to see it 2 more times already, and its only Thursday!  The one thing I always liked about Star Wars is its ability to capture my imagination and take it on a ride.  This movie delivers on that thrill.  I can't help but to continue picturing myself wandering around in dazed wonder at the places depicted in this film and all other things Star Wars.Naboo is the most beautiful place I have ever seen depicted on film.  I just wish Lucas would leave more room for human character development and plot - that is where the real story lies.  The story line is good, but can be drowned out by too much computer generated characterization.  Jar Jar Binks is a little too much, and the junket dealer and slave owner is too contorted.  And what the hell is 'Willow' doing in there?  The coincidence of C3PO being made by Anakin, come on!  Lets have a little plot diversity - not everything can be that connected, force or not - leave a little more to chance.On the other hand, all of the characters were well acted.  Natalie Portman did not give a stiff performance.  Jake Lloyd did a fine job. Liam Neeson and Ewan MacGregor were perfect as Jedi's.Overall, the story unfolds perfectly, setting the tone for episodes II and III. I loved the movie and plan on seeing it a few more times on the big screen.  Wow!",7,0,0,21 May 1999
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Too fast, Too cut, Too short
","This is hard to post this, but I'm disappointed with the third film. Oh, don't get me wrong, the style, the acting, the mood, the intensity and visauls... all were simply awesome, best yet in fact! I was even able to get past some of the major discontinuities. However, this film was paced too fast, almost as if everyone was over caffienated. All the scenes felt rushed. Very little was explained, too little detail, too many jumps from one scene to another - disjointed, not smooth.I mean, the film went from fall to spring (as evidenced by the Womping willow dropping, and then getting its leaves back) in less than 15 minutes by the clock! Think about it, 6 months of the school year went by in 1/8 of the film!! Rushed, rushed, rushed.They also changed the ambient 'situationals' of several of the scenes, apparently all in an effort to get through this film as fast as possible.And finally, I think the smoking gun, is this film is 15 minutes shorter than the first two films, yet the story is longer and more complex. Why did they cut out so much? What were they thinking?No mention of Moony Padfoot, Wormtail?!!From what I can tell, this film basically went from the highlights of every OTHER chapter.Hopefully, upon repeated viewings this film will grow on me. But unlike the first two films, I walked out of the theatre feeling cheated. This film deserved to be 30 minutes longer. When the film came to an end.. my feeling was, 'that's it, it's over?'I think it obviously comes down to a combination of direction and editing. Was Alfonso on speed? Sure seems like it to me.Hopefully, they will come out with an extended version at some point, assuming they filmed more critical scenes. Please oh please, lets pray they did!Hopefully the new director, Mike Newell will do a better job for the fourth film, which is even more demanding of complexity, detail, pacing, and length.P.S. Gary Oldman was brilliant!",10,0,0,5 June 2004
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Heart Achingly Beautiful
","I watched this film 3 days ago, and I have been struggling to find a film that I would consider better.  I have not.  Since 1981, my favorite film of all time has been 'The Empire Strikes Back'.  There have been several very good films in the last few years, 'The Usual Suspects', 'American Beauty', 'Shawshank Redemption' and 'The Matrix'.  None of these comes close to the heart-aching beauty and reverence this film has.  This film has it all and more - plot, emotion, action, passion and suspense.  Several times throughout the film I was moved to tears, not necessarily because it was sad, but because it was moving.  I even cried during an action scene!  After 20 years, finally a film that takes over as my favorite film of all time. Please go see this film , you won't regret it.",10,0,0,22 January 2001
The Matrix Reloaded," Awesome, Best Mind-Bend Ever.
","After reading the reviews here and the in the newspaper I was expecting a less than stellar sequel.  They were wrong!  Yes, the film dragged at first. Yes, the some of the Zion scenes dragged a bit.  Yes, there could have been more polished editing in parts.  And yes, the music could have been better, more emotionally pulling like the original one.Beyond those minor annoyances this film blew my mind.  The scene with the Architect is truly one of a kind.  If you didn't follow all of the implications then I suggest you watch that scene again.Spoilers Below:In case you didn't figure this out:1) The Oracle is the mother of the Matrix, and as such is maintaining the status quo.  She is not on the humans side, and probably never was.  She is simply doing what she does, which is to cultivate 'The One' to perpetuate the cycle of death and rebirth of Zion, whose sole purpose is to give the humans they can't entirely control, the illusion of choice. In other words, Zion is merely a release valve for the most spirited humans to play out their choices in a safe and controlled manner.2) Since this cycle has now played out 6 times, that means it's not even close to 2199 as Morpheus once believed, but probably closer to 2699, since each cycle appears to take a minimum of 100 years to get from birth of Zion to 'The One'.This is mind blowing stuff.  And that alone, I give this movie a 10/10.  Oh, and some of the effects are absolutely mind-blowing, especially the truck explosion.",10,0,0,17 May 2003
The Matrix," Replaces Blade Runner as the Premier Cult Classic
","I absolutely loved this movie!  This movie is all plot!  The special effects are the medium to express it.  We all know how amazing those two films are.  I expect this film to do very well at the box office and continue to garnish a steady stream of revenue for many years to come as a favorite cult classic of the techno-savvy and psychologically astute audience.  This is not a film for the sedate.For those familiar with Moore's law and the eventual emergence of nanotechnology, the plausibility of 'The Matrix' is all to real.  The Matrix reminds us of the value of our humanity and I think cautions us to wake up and not take things for granted; that we may go forward with wisdom and compassion aboard a technological rocket ride that frees us, not enslaves us.  The message is simple - increase your intelligence now!",10,0,0,6 April 1999
