Miracle," Miracle on Ice
","A marvelous movie that is more about the human spirit than simply a sports story. Herb Brooks is considered one of the greatest motivational coach's of all time. Herb was inducted into the National Hockey's Hall of Fame in 2006, which was overdue, however he earned the right and his family have the knowledge that his spirit will live on in the larger context of Hockey Legends. Kudos to Kurt Russell for his excellent acting in showing the essence of the man and keeping the force of Herb's genius in perspective. Gavin O'Connor's direction was superb in catching hockey at ice level where the action is most intense and capturing the competiveness of the young hero's who made hockey history relevant to all athletes no matter what the sport they participate in. On a personal note I just threw out a pair of plaid pants last year that were very similar to the outfit Kurt Russell/Herb Brooks wore and the memory of the late seventies and early eighties are still fresh as is the memory of the actual event that was celebrated in Canada as much as it was in the United States.",9,1,1,25 December 2006
