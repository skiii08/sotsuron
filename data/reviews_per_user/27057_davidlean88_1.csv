The King's Speech," the years hope as the kings speech overcomes all the stammers
","i always thought that Colin firth had been wasted in many roles including that of in mamma mia...but in a single man and in love actually i thought he was marvelous...and in came the kings speech.believing it to be a rise and shine movie or the movie of a person actually surpassing challenges to find out the utmost sense and confidence of him will be a clich√©...it can be simply told as the film focuses on how a king, finds out the king within...watch out it for the brilliant performance of Colin firth and supporting cast, and one of the funniest and sensible screenplay, the same i have witnessed in social network...go watch it",8,1,6,9 February 2011
