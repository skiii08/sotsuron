Spartacus," Kind of lame
","Finally saw it and I've got to say, in a lot of ways it was pretty bad. The Roman power politics, and the final battle scene were great but not enough. Why would anyone follow Douglas' Spartacus? He doesn't appear to have been a very bright general, or even a particularly good gladiator. We keep hearing about the great victories his army wins, why don't we ever see one. Any scenes with Spartacus and Varinia were atrociously get-up-and-rummage-through-the-fridge bad. And the score was deadly, even embarrassing at times. Why put an extended version in the director's cut? I've got to assume Kubrick had little control, the music he chooses is usually fascinating and none of his touches caught my eye. The movie is all right, but aside from its scale, and Roman drama, nothing special.",7,0,4,28 June 1999
To Be or Not to Be," Decent but disappointing
","Sometimes classics live up to their reputations and sometimes they don't. This one didn't.  It wasn't bad - some quite funny bits, likeable, never boring, but nothing outstanding, except perhaps in the subject matter. I've been watching a few Lubitsch movies recently and I ended up watching this one within a few days of watching Shop Around the Corner.  I was struck by how much sharper and wittier 'Shop' (which I felt was everything it was cracked up to be) was in comparison to To Be or Not To Be.  Benny's character was a little too buffoonish, Lombard's character was a little too boring (though the first scene between Ehrhardt and the false Siletsky was excellent).  Unfortunately, this film was just a little too over-the-top, silly, and conveniently plotted, without ever tapping into the fun of a real screwball comedy. Oh well...",6,11,30,25 January 2003
