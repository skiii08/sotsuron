Requiem for a Dream," There is no justice.
","There are two establishments that have me thoroughly confused.  They are the MPAA ratings board and The Academy Awards.  First, a gruesome, disgusting gore-fest titled 'Hannibal' gets an R-rating, which, in essence, allows children of any age to see it (with a parent, granted). Yet 'Requiem for a Dream', which shows very graphically the potential horrors of drug use, and which should be seen by teenagers, was threatened with an NC-17 rating, barring anyone under 17 from seeing it at all.  The film was eventually released as unrated.  Secondly, I cannot begin to understand how 'Requiem for a Dream' wasn't even nominated for a Best Picture Oscar in a year when that award was actually won by a such a mundane piece of rubbish as 'Gladiator'.  And probably an even bigger travesty is that Ellen Burstyn's performance in this film, a performance of a lifetime, lost out to the ho-hum, no-effort work of Julia Roberts in 'Erin Brockovich'.  'Requiem for a Dream' is disturbing, shocking, and at times, difficult to watch.  But it is one of the most important films ever made.",10,0,0,27 August 2001
That Thing You Do!," You had to live it to really appreciate it.
","I find myself mesmerized by this film.  I identify with its characters because either I had friends who had similar situations (playing in a local rock band, trying to make good), or I myself went through some of the same 'growing pains' of adolescence, such as parental upset, and the joy and sorrow of a first love.The songs (especially the title tune) are catchy, yet simple, and at times annoying (due to overplay), but, hey, that's the way rock 'n' roll was at the beginning of the 'British invasion'.  At least they have a good beat and are easy to dance to!!Baby-boomers will appreciate how Tom Hanks catches the true flavor and feel of the era.  The young actors showed their capabilities by getting the personalities of their characters down just right. You'd think they actually lived through the early 60's themselves.  It's sort of an 'American Graffiti' with a different set of teens.Watch for a cameo by Peter Scolari, who, on TV, was Hank's co-star in 'Bosom Buddies'.",9,4,5,23 February 2001
