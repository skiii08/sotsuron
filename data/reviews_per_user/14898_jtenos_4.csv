Raiders of the Lost Ark," Classic adventure, all-around fun movie
","Harrison Ford shows his many talents in this movie, from comedy to butt-kicking action.  This is possibly his best work, and has become the epitome of the genre.  There's a little humor in the movie, enough to break away from the action a little, but not too much to ruin the mood. Overall, an outstanding movie, and only the first of three such brilliant movies.",10,0,0,3 January 2002
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Lots of fun, a very good movie
","This movie was fun from the beginning through the end.  It was a real pleasure to see an all-around good movie, with plenty of action, more comedy than I expected, and some drama and romance, all while telling a pretty good story.There were several scenes in the movie which were taken directly from the Disneyland ride, and they were done very well.  They fit right in to the movie, and would not even be noticed by someone who hasn't been on the ride. However, those of us who have, the scenes were very entertaining.Overall, this was just a lot of fun.",8,0,2,19 July 2003
"I, Robot"," Not bad, but not a blockbuster
","This movie was all over the media as the biggest hit of the summer.  It was pretty good, but certainly not worth all the attention it got.  Will Smith played his usual character, the same guy from Bad Boys and Independence Day.The concept was a little ridiculous, especially for a movie set only 30 years in the future.  But the special effects were good, and the acting was good.I would recommend this movie if you're looking for a mild action movie, with good special effects, but not necessarily an 'intelligent' movie or real strong action.  It's worth buying, but only after you already own all the other movies you like.",6,0,0,20 July 2004
Men in Black II," Pretty good, not even close to the original
","This is one of those movies where it may have been a better idea just to not make a sequel.  I would say it's worth watching, but it's really not very exciting or interesting, and not as much fun as the first one.  However, the one thing that is more fun is the pug, Frank, who's a much bigger star in this one than the first.  Aside from him, the characters are predictable and the story pretty weak.I'll probably buy it, but it won't make my top 100 list.",5,0,1,31 July 2002
