Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Episode I was fantastic
",Episode I was fantastic. The effects where so good you didn't realize they were only effects. The story was great! The only possible problem was that Jar Jar got a little annoying at times. It was a great movie that I believe lived up to the hype as much as possible.,6,1,1,19 May 1999
Alexander," Save yourself 3 hours and skip this movie
","What a waste of time. The battle scenes (the few that existed) were poorly done. You couldn't tell who was who, or what they were doing. You had to wait until it was over to see who won, and even then you didn't really know.Throughout all of the 'supposedly' fast moving scenes, the camera work was really shaky also. That just added to the difficulty of figuring out what was going on.Some good points:* The acting was pretty good. Farrell and Jolie played their parts well.* Most of the CG work looked good. I especially liked the work with the Eagle.",4,1,2,27 November 2004
American Pie," Funniest movie in years
","WOW!  I certainly didn't expect this movie to be so funny.  I was laughing so hard, I had pains in my sides.",8,0,0,15 June 1999
The Matrix Revolutions," Save your money
","I rarely (if ever) comment on movies, but I really had to for this one. I'm a huge Matrix fan, but this movie really bites.  I can't believe how crappy it is.  Hardly any of it makes any sense.If you haven't seen reloaded, don't bother watching it or this one.  If you have, then at least wait for the DVD.",4,0,0,5 November 2003
