Casablanca," Incredible!
","I watched Casablanca for a class, and, while I initially thought that I wouldn't care for it, I find myself being able to confidently say that it's actually one of my favorite movies, not just from the class but also in general. In terms of acting character and plot the movie is just superb, the best performance being, obviously, from Humphrey Bogart. Technically, the movie is one of the best that I've seen from that period of time. The camera is EXTREMELY mobile, especially in Rick's Caf√©, moving between the tables and sweeping the expanse of the dining room. The sweeps of the streets were incredible, and the shots seemed to be getting longer, which was nice to see. The most notable thing, technically, was the sweep of the airport as Ilsa and Laszlo's plane takes off. Overall an amazing movie, something I would definitely recommend both for the storyline and for the technical elements.",10,5,7,15 October 2012
Citizen Kane," Great
","Citizen Kane is yet another classic that one spends entirely too much time hearing about and entirely too little time actually sitting and watching, which I think is incredibly unfortunate, as the movie is absolutely brilliant both plot-wise and in technical terms. It is well lit at the appropriate times, but not without the occasional blown out or 'underexposed' shot to demonstrate certain circumstances like being in a dimly lit library or being outside. The lighting is actually very interesting to watch in this movie due to Welles' tendency towards very dramatic lighting schemes. The editing, also, works very well, with clips 'layered' over top of each other to show the passing of time and other such things. The sound is very clear, as it had a trend of being in the very early days of sound where you could hear every noise, from a pillow being fluffed to a room being torn apart. All in all a fabulous movie that I would watch again and again.",8,1,2,10 December 2012
The Graduate," Fantastic
","While I have my issues with The Graduate technically, it's definitely not to say it's not iconic and awesome in its' own right. The use of lighting is really incredible in this film, and really speaks to the time that it was made. Though everyone was pretty much ignoring the Hays code at this time, they still cut out the lights to avoid depicting anything beyond a single kiss between the two main characters, even though there wouldn't have been anyone to stop them if they had done that, and they would have just gotten a harsher rating. Moving on, the angles for certain shots were great, and there was very dramatic lighting a lot in the beginning. I especially liked the POV shots (one of the very earliest I'd seen) during the birthday party scene. There seem to be a lot of shots from very far away, which work very well when the main character is traveling or when he is driving or looking for his girlfriend in a sea of people on a college campus. The upwards-and-downwards angles during the final scene in the church were really great. Great plot, great movie. 9/10 would see again.",9,0,0,10 December 2012
Singin' in the Rain," Amazing
","Singing in the Rain has got to be one of my favorite movies of all time. I'm 20 years old, and my mother raised me on the songs, but I had never seen the movie itself until I took a cinema class in college, and boy, was I missing out. The music and sound were incredible, as well as the tracking shots. It all has a kind of staged feel which I felt fit very well with the plot of the movie, since most of it DID take place on the stage. And, we have the introduction of dancing and musical numbers, which are always a great thing to throw in. Keeping in the trend of having the viewer feel like the people they are viewing, everything was lit very well, which is reminiscent of the stage lights that they had to stand under. Furthermore, the viewer is introduced to the type of problems that they might face if they were in show business during the transition from silent to sound: Worrying about one's voice, etc. I really think it's an incredible movie that doesn't get near enough attention.",9,1,2,10 December 2012
Psycho," Awesome
","Psycho is one of Those Movies that you always hear about but rarely manage to sit down and see for one reason or another. I'm honestly thrilled that I took the time to do that for my cinema class, because I've discovered yet another incredible movie I probably never would have watched any other way. It's a perfect example of a late code film that's trying to deal with mature subject matter. I find the use of cuts and editing and lighting to keep a murder mystery to Code really fascinating to watch, and I have, over and over again. While at times the movie has a certain 'underexposed' feel (very dark, that is to say), that hardly detracts from the plot. In fact, it adds to it. You really feel the imposing darkness at night, the dim lighting of the house above the Bates hotel, and the brightness of day. Also, the use of sound is really interesting not with the voices or the various background noises, but the score itself, especially in the iconic 'Shower scene'. Truly a must-see.",9,0,0,10 December 2012
