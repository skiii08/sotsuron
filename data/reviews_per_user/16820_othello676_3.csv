Alien 3," Misunderstood
","Reading the comments of people here, I find the same criticism of a lack of suspense.  I suppose this is true but only because the movie is only marginally interested in it.  Each Alien film represents a different type of filmmaking and Alien 3 has been labeled the bastard child of the franchise. This is an undeserved label.  Alien 3 is about pain, hopelessness and loss and those are cinematic qualities that most people refuse to associate with or accept.  People wanted Alien 3 to be another guns and ammo war fest and they were handed the equivalent of a moody and dark art house feature.SPOILER HERE.  In my own humble opinion Ripley had to die.  She had to lose everything.  Otherwise Alien 3 would have been a standard issue sequel. This film takes Weaver's Ripley to a fitting conclusion.  To have her live at the end would have not only betrayed the character but it would have been a complete sell-out that pandered to the audience.  This film has guts and demands a lot from the audience.  And those who criticize it for not having enough action should realize, such as Fincher probably did, that they couldn't have topped Aliens in that department.  It's an action masterpiece and to try and duplicate it would have been foolish.  I have always applauded Alien 3 for being a highly stylized and individual movie.  If you saw it before and hated it, see it again and watch it for the movie it is. Don't hate it because its not a movie it never pretends to be.",9,1,4,25 February 2000
Alien: Resurrection," Gooey
","Alien: Resurrection is a real head scratcher of a film.  Each Alien film represents a different style of filmmaking.  Alien was a good representation of 70's style films.  Kinda slow, almost boring, but none the less jarring when it needed to be.  Aliens is the primo example of 80's action films. It's about the best of all action films from the 80's.  The underrated Alien 3 makes a case for taking established series down very dark and painful paths.  It's plays out like a big budget independent film.  Alien: Resurrection on the other hand comes across like some trashy European horror film.  It's not necessarily a bad film it just chooses to follow the road even less taken.  Its gory from beginning to end and one has to question the validity of the film after Alien 3.  I suppose the biggest drawback is that the film feels incomplete.  The feeling of pointlessness you get at the end doesn't go away.  It would like to lead into a new storyline as its ending is all geared up for Alien 5, but as both 3 and 4 were marginal failures, it'll never happen. That trashy European horror film feel is obviously due to the direction of Jeunet.  I guess this can be interpreted as Alien in the hands of a Frenchman.  He works out all kinds of loopy visuals to help along the saggy story.  In the long run this film is more for genre fans only.  No mass audience could ever accept it widely as was proven upon its initial release.It's sort of depressing to see the Alien franchise end like this.  I felt Alien 3 brought everything to a fine conclusion.  Now the ball has been sent rolling again only with nowhere to go.",Null,0,1,25 February 2000
