The Lobster," some old bs
","Lobster was painful to watch and its length made the experience excruciating. Most of the characters were not likable and it was difficult to care about them. I imagine the director wanted to create a deeper meaning, but he failed to create any meaning at all. Even as a satire of modern relationships and the pressure people experience to be a part of them, I found it failed to deliver. The film was humorless and pretentious. The theater was nearly empty and no one laughed at any point in the film. I failed to see the point and also I failed to see why characters in the film did as they were told. I saw no basis for the creation of the rules of this society and the rebel group of singles in the woods seemed even worse than the couple police in the hotel.",1,30,47,5 June 2016
