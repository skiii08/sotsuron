Resident Evil: Afterlife," OMG crap-house
","I cant even begin to explain how crap this movie is, don't waste your money...hell don't even waste your bandwidth downloading it the movie is utter crap. I've played the games (no super fan) so kinda know the story but you have nothing to worry about if you don't because this movie has no story so even the random person walking in the theater has just as much knowledge as the avid gamer who's like WTF is going on? Good thing this director doesn't write books because he'd be cited for plagiarism with how many scenes were stolen. All I can say is that I've been using IMDb for like 8-10 years now and haven't reviewed anything but this movie was so crap-house I couldn't help myself. IMDb reviews on movies are horrible 7.2 out of 10 my god the reviewers on this site are used to garbage, either that or the 'reviewers' are people who work for the movie it self and have to try and bump a movie so hopefully they can screw a few out of some cash. Its time to start using rottentomatoes for getting reviews.",1,21,43,13 September 2010
