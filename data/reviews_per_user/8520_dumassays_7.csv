The Longest Yard," Longest Yard... Touchdown!
","I haven't laughed like that in a long while. Welcome back Adam Sandler. Sandler hasn't offered a performance of this scale and quality since Happy Gilmore. With movies like Punch Drunk Love and Eight Crazy Nights, you had to ask yourself if Sandler had lost his golden touch, though he did save himself with his dramatic roles in Spanglish and 50 First Dates. Sandler, like Jim Carrey and Robin Williams, really belongs in the comedic roles, where quick wit and obvious ad lib are not only welcomed but expected. Sandler absolutely dominates in this film. He wasn't hurting for supporting characters either, Chris Rock's role as Caretaker is a bit unbelievable, but he delivers his lines with his well known stand-up approach to comedy. He's funny and lovable, a definite asset to the movie. Burt Reynolds, taking on the senior role this time around, as opposed to the lead in the '74 version, obviously has a lessor impact on the story, but he plays it well with his hard nosed, shy but deadly, attitude. Then there is Terry Crews as Cheeseburger Eddy... if you thought that this guy was funny in White Chicks, then you can expect more of the same hilarity in The Longest Yard. Every scene with Crews is laugh out loud.I didn't know what to expect from this movie being that it was a remake, but I can say with sincerity that I was truly impressed with the acting and story line. With characters like Sasquatch, Mc-Asshole and Colonel Sanders, it would be difficult not to be. This movie is not to be missed!",9,14,28,23 June 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Doesn't Hold Much Water
","Well, to be honest, I'm somewhat disappointed. The premise of the storyline was decent enough, the acting was on par with the first installment, and the chemistry between all of the main characters was great. My beef is with the grossness of it all. For those who have seen this movie, I'm sure you know what I'm talking about, all of those sea creatures. I'll even go as far as to say that I thought the idea of the evolution of the men to creatures was interesting... but the reality of it, or the visual effects of it, were disgusting. In fact as times it really took away from the story.All in all I'm not sad that I went, but compared to the The Black Pearl, it doesn't hold much water.http://www.suggestamovie.com",6,1,3,30 July 2006
Madagascar," Fabulous Movie
","There has been a tremendous amount of hype surrounding this movie... the next Shrek supposedly. While I found the characters lovable and the quips numerous, this movie lacked the same quality of entertainment value I've found in movies like Shrek, Shrek 2, Monsters Inc and Ice Age. The animation genre is sometimes lacking in appeal for the adult crowd, and I find that Madagascar has come up short in providing enough of the classic one liners found in the likes of Aladdin , Toy Story and Robots.Notable characters who make the movie worth seeing include: King Julian the Lemur - Sacha Baron Cohen Skipper the Penguin - Tom McGrath Marty the Zebra - Chris RockNotable characters for all the wrong reasons:Melman the Giraffe - David Schwimmer (worst performance ever, he should stick to movies where his dumbfounded expression gets him some credit). Gloria the Hippo - Jada Pinkett Smith (while she had some decent moments, on the whole the movie could exist without this character and there be no significant loss.) Alex the Lion - Ben Stiller (lackluster is the best word I can use here to describe his delivery of lines... he's supposed to be a central character but he just comes across as a pain in the butt.)While I would recommend seeing this movie, for movie-goers of all ages, I wouldn't get too pumped up about it unless your mom still packs a lunch for you.reel2reel.blogspot.com",6,0,0,20 June 2005
Batman Begins," Dark & Delicious
","It took George Lucas three attempts to make a prequel that was worthy of its franchise but Christopher Nolan struck gold in his first attempt. Batman Begins lives up to the vision of Tim Burton when he made Batman 1 and 2. The star cast of this movie, with the exception of Katie Holmes, is stunning and although it takes a few minutes to get used to Christian Bale as Batman, it's easy to see why he was chosen for the lead role once those minutes have passed. His acting, as we have seen in 'American Psycho', is intense and dark just like the movie and he steals the show from veteran actors such as Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson and Gary Oldman.Michael Caine, as usual, was great as he brought life into Bruce Wayne's father figure and butler, Alfred. His character is witty and stern and no one could have pulled it off better. We do not get much of Morgan Freeman in the movie although I do hope that changes in the next installment. Morgan Freeman plays Lucius Fox, the inventor and scientist who made Batman's suit and his gadgets. The story blends very well between the childhood memories of Bruce Wayne and his present life (in the movie), helping us understand what really created the anger within Bruce Wayne. The movie walks us through the trial and error experiences of Batman which helps Bruce Wayne, Luscious Fox and Alfred create the Bat gadgets. The movie also answers all the questions we had about Batman's past like how did he train to become Batman, how did the Bat symbol come about and how did he get the ideas for his Bat Tools. Overall, a great experience.",8,1,3,4 July 2005
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Mr and Mrs Smith - Awkward Couple
","'Awkward' is probably the best word I could use to describe the on screen chemistry between this supposedly married couple of 5 or 6 years. While Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are fine actors respectively, together they just didn't sell it. Another viewer I overheard as we were making our way out of the theatre commented that they had a 'totally unrealistic relationship', which I have to agree with. For two supposed spies/hit men to not realize that they are each living a fictitious life with one another is somewhat ridiculous. Where did they park their instincts? The worst of the unrealistic points of this movie has to be when Mr. and Mrs. Smith face off. There is just something disturbing about a husband smashing his wife up against the wall and repeated blows to her abdomen. But I don't want to spoil all of the fun here, let's just say that there are two saving graces in this film, Jolie's ass whooping fight scenes and Vince Vaughan's character is a hoot! I wouldn't have thought that he could shine any brighter than he did in Be Cool, but once again Vaughan has captured my heart as the whacked out underdog in this role.I think that this movie is somewhat ill-suited for the kiddies, the violence and the occasional profanity is really driven more towards the teenagers and up crowd.reel2reel.blogspot.com",4,6,12,20 June 2005
War of the Worlds," War of the Worlds, A Winner
","With the recent negative publicity surrounding Tom Cruise, I'm thinking Amblin Entertainment and Steven Spielberg specifically, must be biting their nails with the potential spill over on to War of the Worlds. In my opinion, any movie-goer who misses this flick because of the personal pitfall position Cruise has put himself in, is denying themselves what will likely be THE movie of the summer of 2005.War of the Worlds certainly has the star quality that you would expect in a blockbuster, with Tom Cruise, Dakota Fanning, newcomer Canadian, Justin Chatwin and a short but stunning performance by Tim Robbins. It also has all of the special effects that we demand now from the likes of Spielberg and the Sci-fi genre.Cruise plays the role of a divorcÃ©e, and somewhat deadbeat dad, who not only has to take his two kids for the weekend, but also protect them from the onslaught of a deadly alien race. Cruise does not disappoint in the least in this movie so whether you are a die hard fan of Cruise or Spielberg, or someone just looking for something fabulous on the big screen, this is the movie to see. Waiting for the DVD release is not recommended.For those of the squeamish nature, be weary as there are some scenes in this movie that literally had my stomach doing flip flops.The only thing in my mind that would prevent this movie from stealing this coveted title of 'movie of the summer' would be if movie-goers saw Batman Begins.Enjoy this movie!http://reel2reel.blogspot.com",8,2,6,2 July 2005
V for Vendetta," V for Victorious!
","When I first saw the preview for this movie I was immediately disinterested because of the man in the mask. However after sitting down last night and watching it I was quite taken with not only the performances of Natalie Portman, Hugo Weaving and Stephen Rea but the premise of the storyline.This movie is so out of the ordinary and frankly a bit weird that you are glued to every minute of it to see where the hell it's going. I found it started out somewhat slow, but its momentum picked up and never stopped straight through to the very memorable ending.Definitely rent this film, watch it with someone who doesn't like to talk throughout a movie, someone that can handle a decent conversation at the end, because this movie will almost certainly provoke dialog... consider the rule of any government who dictates through fear, be they democratic or otherwise.http://suggestamovie.com/",7,10,19,2 July 2006
