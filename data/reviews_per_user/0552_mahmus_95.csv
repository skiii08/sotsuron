Ford v Ferrari," And old-fashioned Hollywood. In a good way
","An old-fashioned Hollywood movie with great performances and exciting racing sequences.Them testing the car and clashing with Ford executives is fine, but the movie really is at its best when it focuses on racing. Even then, the performances from Bale and Damon are so good that they make even the rockiest parts of movie watchable.The third act is so much fun it mostly makes up for many problems I might have had with the build-up.It feels like the movie is a big allegory for movie studio interference and how it can prevent greatness. I like that, even if even comes with the cost of makong the Ford and Ferrari execs feel like cartoon villains, but then again, old-fashioned Hollywood movie.This was a lot fun.",6,1,2,5 December 2019
Saturday Night Fever," Bleaker than you'd expect
","An unusually bleak and harsh movie.It does a fantastic job at making the dance floor look like the only escape from the ugliness of reality.
And when that ugliness surrounds you and follows you everywhere, you gotta dance real good.",8,1,1,20 March 2020
First Man," this movie really damn good.
","Ryan Gosling gives a great if subtle performance and Damien Chazelle's direction is really good. The effects are so great I'm not entirely convinced they didn't actually film in space.If I were to nitpick, I'd say that Justin Hurwitz's score, as great as it is (and it really is great, particularly during the awesome moon-landing sequence) sounds a bit to similar to his love theme from La La Land. It can be a bit distracting.Overall, great movie. I'm glad I finally got to see it.",8,1,1,20 March 2020
Come and See," Not for the faint of heart
","One of the best, most disturbing, harrowing, unnerving and impactful movies I have ever seen.This is a movie that drags you through hell. It's painful.
It's hard to watch.
In the best way possible.This is a movie you don't recover from. It leaves you speechless. It leaves you shaking.This is a masterpiece,
and it's not for the faint of heart.",10,2,2,28 March 2020
Your Name.," Masterpiece
","Moving, beautiful, creative.Gorgeous animation, great music and engaging story.This movie is a masterpiece and I love it with all my heart.",10,0,0,20 March 2020
Deepwater Horizon," The second half makes it all worth it
","The first half is alright. There's some fine moments of levity and some unintentuonally funny moments, like John Malkovich's wonderfully malkovich performance and Kurt Russel's pronunciation of the word 'cement', but it was nothing special.The second half, on the other hand, is absolutely terrifying.
It doesn't depict the disaster as an exciting action set piece, but as a harrowing living nightmare from hell.
It's incredible, immensely disturbing and hard to watch.
It made it all worth it.",7,0,0,15 May 2020
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Pure magic and childhood innocence.
","Probably the most important movie in my life.
I've been watching it ever since I was a little kid.

It," A fun horror film with lovable characters
",Great performances from SkarsgÃ¥rd and all the child actors in a movie that isn't so much scary as it is really fun and cool.,8,0,0,10 September 2019
Hereditary," A horror masterpiece
","We all know that Toni Collette is amazing, but Alex Wolff's performance in this movie is seriously underrated.
Particularly during that scene.The look of pure shock on his face when you know what happens is really impressive, and it's all shown in one long close-up that feels like it lasts an eternity.That whole sequence is easily one of the most terrifying scenes I've seen in a while (again, if you've seen this, you know what I'm talking about).With that said, this is Collette's movie.
She's amazingly good in this movie.
She difinetely should have been nominated for an Oscar for her work here.This whole movie is an absolute nightmare.
I love it.",10,0,1,15 April 2020
In Bruges," Funny and sad
","I don't know whether to laugh or cry.The line between the funny moments and the sad moments is so thin.You can be laughing at a joke and then a second later start to cry because this movie gets seriously emotional.But here's what I know for sure......this movie rules, a bottle is lethal weapon and Ralph Fiennes steals the show",10,1,2,19 March 2020
The Big Lebowski," Everyone is perfect
","My favorite comedy of all time.Jeff Bridges is absolutely perfect in this movie.
So is John Goodman.
And Steve Buscemi.
And Julianne Moore.
Everyone is perfect here.It's also the most quotable movie of all time.
Literally every single line in this movie is insanely quotable.It's incredibly hilarious.
I love this film with all my heart.",10,2,2,19 March 2020
Unbreakable," Shyamalan's best movie suffers from a terrible ending.
","A good movie, but the ending id awful. Not the twist, the twist is fine. The way the movie ends is just terribly lazy and unsatisfying.Still, this is probably Shyamalan's best movie. Make of that what you will",7,0,0,20 March 2020
Akira," Amazing.
","One of the greatest animated movies of all time,
and one of the greatest movies of all time, period.Incredibly animated, full amazing action, brutal violence and great characters.The musical score is one of my favorites,
and Tetsuo is one of my favorite villains. You really can't help but feel bad for the poor kid.",10,0,2,28 March 2020
Citizen Kane," Never boring
","Many old movies that are proclaimed as the some of greatest of all time can be very boring when watched today.
I've had had experiece with many movies.Citizen Kane is not one of those movies.The first time I watched it I was surprised by how entertaining it was. It was fast paced, snappy, full of etremely effective dramatic sequences, dazzling camera work and an incredible performance by Orson Welles.And it' still just as good today.I love it.",10,1,2,19 March 2020
Memento," Nolan struggles, but mostly succedes
","Watching this film unravelling before you is truly great, even if Nolan keeps struggling when it comes to making the characters feel human.",7,0,0,20 March 2020
Captain Marvel," A fun ride that's far better than you've been led to believe
","From all the hate it's been getting, I expected not much mote than an avarge if disposable MCU movie (and to be fair, I that would have fine with that), so while thr movie does have its flaws, I was pleseantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie.
It's biggest problem is that the main characer could've been better developed, as sometimes an emotional moment won't resonate as much as it should because there wasn't enough time dedicated to exploring how she feels about not knowing whi she is; but I could never call her a vad character.
The scructure of the movie, the supporting cast, and the action (even in its overly rapid MCU style of editing) were all great.
What I appreciated the most about this movie however, are the quieter moments; Carol reuniting with Maria and Monica, Carol and Fury talking and even many moments with Talos (one of the most interesting 'villains' in the MCU) and others. I've heard many call this movie slow or boring, and while it certainly is slower than most other MCU movies, I felt it was for the better. It's not one of the MCU's best film, but it's far from being the disaster some would like you to believe. It's a fun romp that takes its time and handles moments that could've easily angered some people (and I imagined some were angered) gracefuly. Definitely better than many viewer say.",7,2,9,9 March 2019
Rang De Basanti," A fine film.
","The performances are great and the film is over all really well directed.
The movie does a fantastic job at presenting a sense of rebelious awakening for its characters that leads to a surprsing turn of events for the third act.
However this turn, as good as it is, feels a bit sudden and drastic.",7,0,0,4 September 2019
The Babadook," This movie revitalised my faith in horror cinema
","This is one of those movie where I will never forget my first time watching it.
It left a big impact.When it seemed like no good horror movies were coming out, this movie revitalised my faith in horror cinema.Such an uncomfortable viewing experience.Essie Davies is incredible.",9,13,16,21 April 2020
The Danish Girl," Not a bad movie by any means, but one that seriously disappointed me.
","Eddie Redmayne and especially Alicia Vikander are so good that they make the unremarkable script mostly worth watching. Mostly.Their performances really carry what's otherwise a pretty underwhelming movie.Maybe I'll like it more on a rewatch, but first I need to want to rewatch it, and I kinda don't, at least not for now.Also, as glad as I am that Vikander won an Oscar for this, it really should have been in the Leading Actress category (and it should have been for Ex Machina, but that's off-topic)",5,1,1,16 June 2020
Terminator Salvation," Could be worse. Could be Genisys
","I don't love it, but I don't hate it.I like its depiction of the future and the effects are really damn good (even the cgi Arnold looks pretty good for 2009).It had some pretty interesting ideas and the actors all did a good job.The movie falls apart thanks to its script and the whole Marcus subplot.It's not a great movie, but after Genisys, I think it has aged better than expected",5,1,2,20 March 2020
Zodiac," The best detective movie ever.
","In my opinion, the greatest detective movie ever made.
The attention to detail is incredible.A technical masterpice where every filmmaking aspect is perfect.
Direction, cinematography,
editing, writing,
acting, visual effects,
music, profuction design,
sound design,
every aspect of this movie comes together to create a fast-paced, snappy and stylish movie where information goes by fast and it sticks with you.Slowly, the movie becomes a harrowing portrayal of frustation turned into obsesion.
And just like with Robert Graysmith, it gets me obsesed with the case as well.",10,6,9,1 April 2020
The Prestige," I don't think I will ever get why Nolan is so loved
","It's a good movie with good performances, but if Nolan thinks I can still take it seriously after he itroduces a goddanm CLONING MACHINE, then I'm sorry.Also, you can't just introduce a cloning machine and think I would still be shocked by a simple twin reveal at the end. That's kinda like revealing than Darth Vader is Luke's father and then following it up by revealing that Yoda was actually on his knees the whole time...",6,1,3,20 March 2020
BlacKkKlansman," Wonderfully angry
","Disturbing and infuriating.Wonderfully acted by John David Washington, Adam Driver and Topher Grace.It gets your blood boiling and makes you wanna do something.It's also full of great comedic moments and one hell of an ending",9,4,6,20 March 2020
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," A mess, but a satisfying one.
","By far the weakest of the original trilogy, it struggles when it focuses on the Ewoks in Endor, but becomes amazing when the focus shifts to Luke, Vader and The Emperor.",7,0,0,20 March 2020
Alien," A master class in suspense, horror and science fiction
","Out of all the movies in the Alien franchise, Ridley Scott's original is arguably the best of them all. The characters are all memorable, the effects hold up, and the Xenomorph remains one of the most iconic and terrifying movie creatures ever put on screen.",10,0,2,15 November 2018
Black Mass," An alright gangster film with a great cast
","Far from being one of the most exciting gangster movies, but it's a worthwhile watch thanks to its excellent cast, especially Joel Edgerton, who is more the protagonist of the film than Johnny Depp to be honest.David Harbour keeps popping up where I least expect it.",6,1,1,15 May 2020
Lost in Translation," So simple and so great
","This is a prefect example of a movie that's not about a plot, but about a mood. A simple story about two lonely people. It captures a sort innocent awkwardness that's both very relatable and really touching.Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson are amazing and work extremely well together. Their chemistry is subtle and awkward, which works perfectly for the tone of the movie.The karaoke scene is probably one of my new favorite movie scenes ever.I love the ending. I love the soundtrack. I love the movie.",9,0,0,7 July 2020
Barry Lyndon," Riveting and entertaining
","If you're not planning to watch this movie because it's a three hour lon period piece, make no mistake, this is one of the most entertaining and emotional movies out there.",10,0,0,20 March 2020
Interstellar," Nolan, just shut up for a second.
","I'm not gonna say that this is a bad movie, because one, I value the safety of me and my family; and two, I really don't think it is a bad movie, I just don't think it is the masterpiece that so many people say it is.The visuals are great and I'm sure the science is very accurate and that's very impressive......but I never enjoyed the characters.I never liked how Cooper completely ignores his son Tom, who he clearly loves less than Murph.I never liked writing.I've always had a problem with how Nolan movies are written.
Full of endless exposition and corny speeches that are meant to be deep, and this is no differenceThe following is and actual conversatiom from the movie:-------------------------------------------------------------
COOPER: All of this, is one little girl's bedroom, every moment! It's infinitely complex! They have access, to infinite time and space, but they're not bound by anything! They can't find a specific place in time, they can't communicate. That's why I'm here. I'm gonna find a way to tell Murph, just like I found this moment.TARS: How, Cooper?COOPER: Love, TARS, love.
-------------------------------------------------------------I don't know. I wanna love this movie, but I just can't.It is technically impressive, but I have no desire to watch it again.",5,0,2,9 July 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," It's a mess and I kinda love it
","Not gonna lie, I kinda had a blast with this movie. It's dumb sometimes and it doesn't always makes sense....but at this point I don't really care.The first act is definitely the messiest part of the movie. It moves too fast and there's too much going on. However, the movie finds is footing surprisingly quickly. It's not a perfect footing, but I enjoyed it.It makes some desicions I didn't like, some desicions I really liked, and some that at first I didn't like but ended up liking them.I suppose the amount of enjoyment you'll get from this will be based on how muh you enjoy Rey as a character. If you think she's an overpowered mary sue (I don't),then this movie wont convince you otherwise, although the nature of her strength is adressed and while I wasn't a big fan of that, I have the suspicion it'll grow on me.Some of the more emotional moment fell rushed and not all plot points are that well explained, but to be honest, on fully emotional level, I was mostly really satisfied.",6,2,8,20 March 2020
Justice League," The most boring movie ever made
","Here it is.
we have found it.
at last, the most boring movie of all time.",1,2,12,19 March 2020
Man of Steel," It's fine
","Henry Cavill does a good job this flawed, yet mostly well made take on Superman that could have been much worse had Zach Snyder not held back on many of his trademark snyderisms, and remains the best pre-Wonder Woman DCEU film",6,1,1,20 March 2020
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," The Best Spider-Man movie ever!
","Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is one of the most beautiful animated movies I've seen and possibly the best looking superhero movie of all time; with its bright neon colors combined with its comic book asthetic, it creates a world unlike anything I've seen since the LEGO Movie.
The characters are all great. Miles Morales is a fantastic protagonist; understandably scared at the prospect of being Spider-Man, but excited to learn. His relationship with his father and Peter Parker are some of the most emotiinal scenes in the movie. Gwen Stacy is also a great supporting character, as are thr rest of the spider people.
The villains are fun and the action is jaw dropping.
It's also tear jerking tribute to Stan Lee.
This is the best Spider-Man movie by far.",10,46,87,21 December 2018
Warrior," Predictable, but effective
","While I could predict most of the time where the film was going, I was constantly moved by the excellent family drama (elevated by great performances from Hardy, Edgerton and Nolte) and the ending was so emotional that I cried.",8,1,1,20 March 2020
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," YES!
","The digital effects in this one somehow hold up better than the practical effects in the original.The action is insane and character development is perfect.All in all, a superior sequel in almost every way.",10,0,1,20 March 2020
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," David Fincher, the modern master
","Rooney Mara is out of this world.
I have a crush on her because of this movie.Such a great and disturbing film.David Fincher is a master at thrillers.
A modern, more hardcore Hitchcock, I might say.Best opening credit sequence of all time?
Yes. Absolutely.",9,0,1,21 April 2020
Face_Off," This is how you do silly.
",This would not have worked had it takes itself seriously.This film has some of the cagiest Nic Cage moments ever. And I love crazy Cage.,7,2,2,20 May 2020
Dunkirk," Well made, but emotionally empty
","In my opinion, one of Christopher Nolan's biggest weakneses has always been his characters.
Dunkirk 'fixes' this problem by almost completely eliminating the concept of characters.On the one hand, it lets Nolan focus on what he's best at: the technicals.The cinematography is stunning, the editing and direction are pretty good (althought the constantly changing aspect ratio is very distracting).
And the music is, once again, Hans Zimmer pressing his whole arm on the keyboard.On the other hand, not having any real character makes many scenes feel like they drag for way too long and makes for a very dull experience.If we knew something about any of these people maybe it would have been different.Overall, it's not a terrible movie, but a very unmemorable one.
Like most Nolan movies, it's technically impressive.The lack of characterization makes it more bearable for me than something like Interstellar,
but it does negatively impact what could have been a very compelling drama, instead of just a series of well shot battle sequences.",6,0,3,7 April 2020
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Not as good as Harry Potter, but it has its charm
","It's not as good as any of the Harry Potter movies, and its plot and twists are not particularly interesting.However, this movie has a lot of its own charm, thanks to its likeable main characters, creative visuals and some touching moments.It's not the most memorable and probably not one I would want to rewatch, but one I enjoyed watching even during its messier moments.",7,1,1,24 April 2020
Spirited Away," This movie is truly special.
","In my opinion, this is the most beautiful movie of all time, both visually and thematically.The train scene ranks among my favorite movie scenes of all time. No words are spoken, the characters don't even move, and it's some of the most emotional pieces of animation I've ever seen.",10,0,0,20 March 2020
Avengers: Endgame," A great conclusion
","Avengers: Endgame is not a perfect movie, but it feels like one. Every character get an end to their arcs, and the film itself is a great conclusion to 11 years of movies, all of which have led up to this. I wont spoil the actual plot for those who haven't seen it (the trailers have been incredible at not revealing anaything), but I will say that it is full of surprises, shocks, laughs and tears. The fact that the film manages to be THIS good more than makes up for its few flaws. The final battle is probably the most fan-pleasing, epic and emotionaly packed action sequence in any superhero movie; it was the culmiation if 11 years of characters we've come to love and care about. This is what superhero movies are all about.",9,26,69,26 April 2019
Gone with the Wind," A classic for a reason
","While there are many and VERY dated aspects of this film than make it kinda hard to love, I find it extremely hard to dislike. The performances, the direction, the cinematography, the grand epic scale. There's a reason it's one of the greatest movies ever made.",9,2,3,26 September 2019
No Country for Old Men," A modern western classic.
","Everyone always talks about how good Javier Bardem is, and rightly so. He is terrifying.
But I wanted to mention just how good this movie is on a technical level.The editing, the sound design, is all masterful.
Roger Deakins cinematography is, of course, gorgeous.
The lack of music is perfect.This movies has possibly my favorite scene transition of all time, in which a shot of coin in the ground disloves almost seamlessly into an establishing shot of the desert.
It makes my jaw drop every time.I could watch this movie all day.
I love eveything about it.",10,1,2,28 March 2020
Climax," Well... that was... intense.
","This is a movie so extreme that the only possible ratings one could give it are either a 1 or a 10. This is insane. Hard to watch, disturbing and suspensful at all times. Beautifully shot, expertly acted. Gaspar Noe is a genius that keeps pushing the boundaries with every single movie. I may not feel like watching this ever again (but who knows, really), but I know that this was something special.",10,4,9,4 September 2019
Lawrence of Arabia," Masterpiece
","An epic masterpiece that shows how war can break even the strongest of men.
Peter O'Toole and Omar Sharif give incredible performances in one of the most beautiful looking and emotionally devastating war epics of all time.
The desert has never looked so beautiful, before or since.",10,1,2,25 September 2019

City of God," A masterpiece

But not for me.A masterpiece.",10,0,0,15 May 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A time bomb ready to blow up.
","The lack of plot forces Tarantino to keep us engaged through his sheer talent as a filmmaker. Thankfully, he has talent to spare. Tarantino makes wait for the bloody conclusion we know he'll give us, making us follow and hang out with the characters as they deal with their everyday life and their own personal issues. Sometimes it may feel like it's going nowhere, until we get there and we discover that the destination is both amazing and surprisingly touching. This is the kind of film that you're not sure what to think of when the credits roll, but the more you think about it, the more you realize that you had way more fun than you thought at first. It's not Tarantino's best, but that's only because we expect certain things from him; we get them, just in a way he's never done it before: detached and restrained. It feels like a ticking bomb; at times he ticking takes so long, it could drive you insane, but when it finally blows up, the damage is unbelievable.",9,18,31,23 August 2019
Schindler's List," Painful, but esential viewing
","I will never forget the first tile I saw tgis movie. Never had I felt such a rush of emotions before.All of the actors give incredible performances.
Spielberg's direction is outstanding.
Janusz Kaminski's cinematography is moody amd beautiful.
John Williams' score can bring anyone to tears.A masterfully made movie in every way.",10,2,3,28 March 2020
The Game," Not one of Fincher's best, but a fun movie nonetheless
","This movie starts very weak, but ends very strong. You just have to accept that the game makes no sense and that it's totally dependant on things no one could possibly predict or control. Once you accept that, it's a lot of fun to just go along with this film.As I mentioned earlier, the first half (and maybe a bit more) isn't the best. Becuase there's apparently only so much you can do with the premise of an alternate reality game gone too far, it becomes pretty repetitive very quickly. However, once Michael Douglass wakes up in Mexico, the film picks up again and becomes better than ever.It's not one of David Fincher's best movies (in fact, I would say it's his weakest film, not counting Alien 3), but his direction is so good and the thrid act so bonkers that I have to reccomend it.",7,0,0,15 June 2020
Mulholland Drive," A Lynchian masterpiece
","A hypnotizing and captivating tale about the beauty of dreams and the ugliness of reality.Naomi Watts is incredible and David Lynch's direction...well, let's just that if you're a fan of Lynch like me, you don't need me to tell you how good it is.This is a masterpiece.Also, the scene when the singer sings 'Llorando' is pure perfection. Such an emotioanl experience.",10,2,4,19 March 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Screw you guys
","We're so used to thinking we know what a Star Wars movie should be like. How the character should act. That good characters would never do evil things like evil character would do good things.I kinda get why it rubbed people the wrong way, but Star Wars was never sacred to me. It was always flawed. And this movie adresses many of those flaws and it's just nice to see Star Wars being a bit more daring.",8,6,24,20 March 2020
Prisoners," A very upsetting and incredibly bleak film
","Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal give some of their best performances.
Roger Deakins' cold cinematography is breathtaking.This was the first Denis Villenueve movie I ever saw, and I have loved everything else I've seen from him, but this is still my favorite of his movies.I wouldn't mind seeing a True Detective style show about detective Loki.",9,1,2,26 April 2020
"Girl, Interrupted"," Amazingly acted
","A harrowing and moving movie with great performances from Winona Ryder, Whoopi Goldberg, and especially Angelina Jolie.A little melodramatic at times, but the performances really hold this film together.Also, is really nice to see a movie set in a mental institution where the doctors and staff actually really care about the patients.",8,3,3,24 April 2020

Pride & Prejudice," I adore this movie
","My experience watching this movie is comparable to that of watching the moon landing in 1969......at least that's what I think, because if I was alive in 1969, I'm not sure I would've enjoyed the moom landing as much as I enjoyed this movie.",10,2,2,20 March 2020
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," special
","Memeories are important to go on in life, even if they are painful.Although let's face it, we all wish we could forget something or someone in our lives.That's what makes this movie such a personal experience.
It makes us confront our own heartaches instead of ignoring them. That's the way to move on.
It's painful, and this movie doesn't hide that fact.This is really special.",9,0,0,19 March 2020
Once Upon a Time in America," Scorsese wishes The Irishman was half as good as this
","It sits alongside the Godfather trilogy amongst one of the greatest, most ambitious gangster epics of all time.
Robert De Niro gives a complex and multi-layered performance (after all, he's an expert at playing gangsters), the cinematography is beautiful, the direction is fantastic and the score by Ennio Morricone is, as always, perfection.
Did I mention this movie is long?
It's nearly four hours long.
Apparently there is a two hour long version that was originally released in theaters, but apparently it's also pretty bad.
If you're intersted in watchig this, watch the longer, true version. It's a masterpiece.",10,3,10,20 March 2020
Frank," An underrated gem
","Jon wants to be a musician; there's only one problem: he sucks at it.
Frank is a musical genius; capable of coming up with a great song in a matter of seconds. He also suffers from a mental illness and always wears a giant paper mache head.Jon really wants to be like him.As someome with practically no musical talent, I completely relate with Jon's frustation and feelings towards Frank. Like a mix of jealousy and admiration.I love how this film explores this feeling I often get, that because I didn't have a tragic past, I somehow don't deserve to be succesful. Like I haven't earned it.Initially, Jon would love to have a tragic past or a mental illness, because that way he feels he will finally succeed as an artist, like Frank.
But as it's so heartbreakingly revealed to him, Frank's condition isn't some cool quirk that made him talented, but a real illness that must be taken seriously, which is something he never did.This movie is a truly underrated gem and features one of Michael Fassbender's best performances, and you almost never see his face.The final scene, when they sing 'I Love You All' is pure perfection and it always makes me feel like crying.",10,1,1,3 June 2020

","I liked this a lot more than I thought I would. It's really moving and full of great songs.Everyone gives great performances (even Russell Crowe with his subpar singning managages to be pretty engaging), especially Anne Hathaway.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Better than the first one
","Practically everything about this is better than the first one.
The character development, the emotions, the villain, the visuals, everything. I was debating whether the soundtrack was better too, and then I remembered this one has 'Mr. Bue Sky' and the first doesn't so yeah, the soundtrack's better too.It's one of my favorite MCU movies.
I know some prefer the first one, but this just works so much better for me.The ending is one of the saddest things Marvel has ever done. Cat Stevens, 'Father and Son' wraps up the movie in the best and most heartbreaking way possible.",9,0,0,15 June 2020

","I really love this movie.Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio have excellent chemestry.Whatever cheesiness this movie may have works in its favor, because it makes the later scenes so much more impactful.I always forget how terrifying and depressign the second half is.That shot of the old couple laying on the bed...
It destroys me every single time.What a wonderful film.",8,0,2,24 April 2020
Die Hard," The most badass movie ever
","Quite possibly the most badass movie ever.
Great action, great hero, great villain, great cast of supporting characters, and a great Christmas film.",10,0,0,20 March 2020
American Made," A lot of fun
","Fast paced, exciting, stylish, entertaining.I love style of this movie.
The fast editing.
The over the top, yet great performances (Domhnal Gleeson steals the show).Similar to The Wolf of Wall Street in that it feels like the movie is constantly on coke, and I love it.",7,1,2,2 May 2020
Steve Jobs," Dialogue as a weapon
","This is one of the few movies I could watch over and over and over again and never gt tired of it.
Which is wierd considering that I honestly didn't like it that much the first time I saw it on theaters.
It was just people talking for two hours.But then, as I rewatched it on DVD, something clicked.
Aaron Sorkin's dialogue.
Michael Fassbender's performace.
Danny Boyle's direction.
Everything suddenly seemed... well, perfect.I had like it more the second time. Surely I couldn't like it even more the thrid time, right?
Right?Well, I did. And I like even more the fourth time.And before I realised, I just kept watching, and watching, and watching this movie, and I just couldn't get enough.
And I still can't.I really, really love this movie.",10,1,1,1 April 2020
Joker," We truly do live in a society
","But in all seriousness, this movie was amazing. A dark and disturbing character piece led by an Oscar worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix.
You really do feel bad for this guy, which makes it all the more heartbreaking when he inevitably becomes the clown prince of crime we all know and love, although we've never seen him like this.
We see him suffer throughout the movie to the point we're almost rooting for himk to become a mass murdering psyco clown, because that at least will make feel better; then it happens and we just wish this could have all just been avoided, because es so messed up. We feel for him and care about him. By the time he's the joker, we wish we could've helped him.
There's a lot of great nods to the greater Batman universe, yet the movie is a self contained character piece.
It had me shaking and disturbed for a long time after I left the cinema, and that can only be the mark of a great movie.",10,1,5,3 October 2019
It Chapter Two," A more than satisfying conclusion.
","While not as tighly constructed as chapter one, the movie is elevated by an excellent cast, creative creature designs, fun scares and real heart.",6,0,1,9 September 2019
Jaws," Great characters
","As tense as it may get, Jaws is ultimately one of the most entertaining and joyful movies out there, thanks to its lovable trio of main characters, their unique personalities and great chemestry.This is something that every Jaws rip-off completely missed.
Jaws is scary, but it isn't the scares that make ot great, it's the lighter moments.
It's the joy that these characters bring.I could see them haging out in the boat, singing, comparing scars and sharing shark stories forever.",10,1,2,2 May 2020
Inception," Good, but honestly overrated (like almost every Nolan movie)
","The first act is pure exposition. Once that's over, the film gets a lot better, even if it never really goes as far with the craziness of the dreamworld as it probably should have.",7,2,2,20 March 2020
Parasite," It deserves all the praise
","So I finally saw Parasite and after weeks and weeks of hearing about how great this movie is, I didn't think it could possibly live up to all that praise.Well, it somehow managed to be even better than I anticipated.
How the hell did Bong Joon-Ho manage that?!This is an incredibly tense, darkly funny, beautifully shot and amazingly acted masterpiece and I loved every minute of it.From now on, I'm staying away from basements",10,1,4,29 February 2020
The Conjuring," Mostly really generic
","It's undoubtably well made, but for all the hype it generated I was very disappointed to find out that The Conjuring is really just a generic haunted house movie that turns into a generic and over the top possesion movie at the end. It's not terrible by any means, but it's just not very interesting",5,1,2,20 March 2020
Marriage Story," Devastating
",Absolutely heartbreaking. I loved every minute of it.Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson give the best performances of their careers. They are so damn good here.Great writing and direction. A beautiful and depressing film.,10,64,74,20 March 2020
Mary and Max," A really emotional experience
","One of the best, most emotional animated movies I've ever seen. It's almost therapeutic.P.S.: The animation is really beautifulP.P.S.: You better believe I cried like a baby.P.P.P.S.: Have you ever been a comunist?",9,0,1,10 September 2019
Mother!," And the guests start coming and they don't stop coming.
","Never thought I'd see the day when the bible was adapted into a horror movie, but here we are.The biblical allegory is pretty obvious. It's got God, the Garden of Eden, the forbidden fruit, Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Jesus and the end of the world. With an environmental message for good measure.You'll find it either very pretentious or really clever. I think the movie is good enough to make up for its more unsubtle moments.The first half is good, but gets pretty dull at times. The second half is absolutely insane and I love it. It's insanely disturbing. I felt like passing out.Love it or hate it, this movie dared to be... whatever the hell it is, and I love it.Don't think I'll be watching it again any time soon. I feel like I need a thousand cold showers to wash off my first viewing.",8,2,5,29 February 2020
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Kind of pathetic
","At least it left an impresion (unlike Justice League which is the cinematic equivalent of watching paint dry), but unfortunatelty is not a very good impression.It has some good ideas and performances, but the execution is poor and the writing doesn't make the actors any favors.There are so many things that WB clearly was too scared to follow up on after the film's critical failure. Like, what was up with that wierd Flash vision Bruce had? What does he mean with Lois Lane being the key? What will happen with Darkseid?I know its cheap to compare the DCEU to Marvel, but imagine if Marvel just decided to drop the whole infinity stones storyline because people didn't like The Dark World.
It's that lack of commitment that turned so many people away from this movies, and it all started here",3,3,6,20 March 2020
Ben-Hur," A great biblical epic
","This is one of the greatest biblical epics of all time.
I love how it combines the story of Jesus (I also love how you never see his face. It gives him more of a godly presence) with Judah's quest for revenge.
The producution values are insane. The cinematography is gorgeous, the sets impressive, and the charriot race is so good my jaw was hanging open throughout ghe whole thing.
Charlton Heston gives a great performance and William Wyler's dorection is incredible.
I'm not a very religious person, but this movie does it right.",10,1,2,26 September 2019
The Deer Hunter," Amazing
","An amazing movie with excellent performances from every actor involved (especially Cristopher Walker), beautiful cinematography and music, filled with gut-wrenching scenes.My favorite thing about it is how much it focuses on the characters just being happy together, which makes everything after they go to war so much more heartbreaking",10,0,0,20 March 2020
Jojo Rabbit," Amazingly moving
",Funny and sweet in that unique Taika Waititi way.Everyone gives fantastic performances in this powerful and suprisingly emotional satire.It also has possibly the greatest F-bomb in a PG-13 movie ever,10,1,1,20 March 2020
Moonrise Kingdom," Wonderful
","A funny, sweet and perfectly crafted story with great visuals (it's Wes Anderson after all), excellent child performances and just the perfect tone.If you're a fan of Wes Anderson, you don't need me to tell you how good this movie is.
If for some reason you haven't seen this or any of Anderson's films, I recommend you do so right now, because it's just wonderful.",9,1,1,28 March 2020
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Very dated, but still wonderfully creppy
","As good as it is, this movie is pretty dated.
The acting, the visuals and especially the music kept this movie from being truly terrifying.However, the film is still a lot of fun.Freddy Krueger is an amazing and really creepy villain, the kills are creative and there's some real sense of danger amd desperation in many scenes.I would have liked if the rules of how Freddy can interact with the real world were clearer.I'm in the minority when I say that I enjoy the 2010 remake.
In fact, there are some aspects of that movie that I prefer over the original.
However, this is definitely a better put together movie, and it's a classic for a reason.",7,0,0,24 April 2020
Casino," Goodfellas 2
","While the 'Goodfellas style' is so prevalent throughout the movie that, looking at it now, it can almost feel like Scorsese made a parody of Scorsese movies, the film's fast pace ensures that it never becomes boring even at three hours long, and the performances are so good that it's impossible not to have your eyes glued to the screen at every moment",8,0,1,20 March 2020
Life," Boring
","A space octopus named Calvin is surprisingly not that scary.The characters are really boring and the one not boring character is the first one to die (although it a was really cool death).
Jake Gyllenhaal in particular is extremely wasted.There's some fine sequences and brutal kills, but is not very interesting.The ending is pretty cool though.",5,0,0,19 March 2020
Green Book," Enjoyable
","Is it the most progressive of movies? NoDid it deserve to win Best Picture? I don't think so.Is it a good movie? I do think so.Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen are great together. They're performances really elevate the material.It's a very likeable movie. The ending is a little corny (the movie itself can be a little corny to be honest) and the film is a little repetitive at times, but overall I really enjoyed it and I'm glad I finally watched it.",7,0,0,29 February 2020
Da 5 Bloods," An entertaining and gripping war drama that like even the most serious Spike Lee movies, has a lot of great comedy.
","Then again, this isn't one of Spike Lee's most serious films, or at least it's one of his less angry films. For all its relevant commentary on racism, this is primarily an adventure film, and a damn good one at that. It is also a great tribute to all black soilders who fought in the Vietnam war. It's a story about unity, which I think it's something we could all use right now.It's full of references to classic movies, some more effective than others.
It's perhaps a bit too similar to The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. Many of its story beats are lifted directly from that film (of course they recreate the 'stinking badges' scene), so having seen that movie did remove a lot of the tension, and made the latter parts of the second half somewhat predictable.That landmine scene however is one of the tensest movie scenes I've seen in a while.Also, I love how no other movie could possibly get away with having the villain straight up wearing a MAGA hat during a shootout. It would be painfully unsubtle if it wasn't such a hilarious visual.",8,10,18,15 June 2020
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," I'm in love
","Elegantly macabre, devilishly sexy and just straight-up badass at times.It loses a bit of steam after Lestat 'dies', but ends on a high note after he comes back at the end.I'm a straight guy... but just look at Lestat. Just look at him! This is the kind of vampire Edward Cullen can only dream of being.",7,3,4,20 March 2020
Jackie Brown," Quentin Tarantino's most underrated movie
","This is one of the more laid-back Tarantino movies.Not as laid-back as Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, but still a surprisingly relaxed viewing for a movie with so much plot; more plot than any other Tarantino movie, in fact (probably because it's not an original screenplay).It's incredibly entertaining.
The cast is amazing and the writing is impeccable.Definitely Tarantino's most underrated film.",8,1,1,29 April 2020
Inside Llewyn Davis," My faavorite movie of all time
","I remember the first time I saw this movie......I didn't like it.I remember the second time I saw this movie......I liked it.I remember the third time I saw this movie......I loved it.It is now my favorite movie of all time.It moved me in a personal way. I saw myself in Llewyn, maybe more than I would like to admit. I felt a connection with this film. Truly magnificient.
Great acting, gorgeous cinematography and beautiful songs.",10,0,0,20 March 2020
Hacksaw Ridge," Well acted, but often silly
","Andrew Garfiels carries this movie just as Desmond Doss carried his wounded brothers.It isn't a bad movie by any means, but the battle sequences that take over the second half are too over the top (and even goofy) to take seriously at times.",6,1,2,20 March 2020
Donnie Darko," And I find it kinda funny. I find it kinda sad. The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had.
","This movie has just right amount of insanity that I love.
Crazy enough to confuse you, yet with enough consistency to let you form a possible explanation.Jake Gyllenhaal is great and the sountrack is absolutely perfect.",8,1,2,28 March 2020
The Pursuit of Happyness," Moving
","The voice-over narration felt a little unnecessary. I kept thinking of ways the movie could've easily conveyed the same information visually and it kinda pulled me out of the movie.Thankfully, Will Smith's strong performance kept pulling me back in.",7,0,0,20 March 2020
The Wizard of Oz," A timeless classic
","I've been watching this movie since I was a little kid, and I have no intention of stoping.The songs, the characters, the world.
Pure magic.The fact that this movie from over eighty years ago can still be enjoyed by kids today is a testament to its brilliance.Margaret Hamilton is absolutely perfect. She gives one of my favorite movie performances.Also, Scarecrow has a gun. Just thought I'd mention that.",10,0,0,15 May 2020
The Martian," I never get tired of this movie.
","The humor,
the soundrtack,
The performances,
the positivy.It just makes me feel really happy.A movie about a man stuck alone on a desert planet could have easily been a depressing downer.
Instead, this is one of the most positive and uplifting movies I've seen.And it has an awesome montage set to David Bowie music, so of course I'm gonna give it ten stars.",10,1,1,1 April 2020
