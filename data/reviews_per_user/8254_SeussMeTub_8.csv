The Avengers," One of The Best Comic Book Movies Ever!
","A culmination of several movie franchises, THE AVENGERS certainly delivers. There could have been many ways that the studios could have screwed this movie up but they chose the right director: Joss Whedon (former helmer of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Firefly on TV as well as an actual comic book writer for Marvel Comics). Whedon knows his stuff and he creates what is probably the most compatible comic book movie ever; the whole film reads as if it was an actual Marvel comic book!Whedon subtly melds the disparate elements from multiple other comic book movies and effortlessly creates an epic storyline that makes sense. The tesseract (known to comic fans as the cosmic cube) that was the focal plot point of CAPTAIN America: THE FIRST AVENGER (2011) has been recovered and being studied closely by the government when Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the villain of the previous THOR (2011) movie appears and takes control of it. In response, Col. Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson, in his usual badass self) decides to form a small but lethal response team: Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Black Widow, Hawkeye and Thor. If they can get along and work together then they might have a chance to save the world.Being the top billed character because of box-office receipts, Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) gets the best lines and almost steals the entire show. His wisecracks upends the traditional leader of the Avengers, Captain America (Chris Evans, playing the straight man to everyone else) and puts the latter character in a disadvantage- the movie's lone weakness is that Cap doesn't get to do much other than act as a foil to the larger than life Tony Stark. Thor (Chris Helmsworth) does shine in the few scenes in which he is at front and center while both Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) give much needed humanity since they are the only members of the team that don't have superpowers. But the one character that makes the most impact of his limited screen time is Mark Ruffalo, who plays the volatile Hulk- Ruffalo plays Bruce Banner as a smoldering Stanley Kowalski, always seemingly in control yet has a temper like nitroglycerine- his Banner is different from the brooding Eric Bana of 2003's HULK or the timid Edward Norton of THE INCREDIBLE HULK (2008); you don't get to see much of Ruffalo compared to the others but his character is the most intriguing of all. Hiddleston is adequate as the pouty, scheming Loki but you can't help but believe that he is simply outgunned with all these powerhouses surrounding him.The movie is almost perfect but does fail to take chances with their characters. Evan's Captain America is a direct copy from the mainstream comic book but you wished he might have been given more of an edge, like the Ultimate Marvel incarnation of Captain America: a slightly racist do-gooder who prefers to smash heads when someone doesn't measure up to his 1930's morality. If only the movie had been longer there might have been more insight into his character but with this film running over 2 ½ hours it might have been a systematic one.In the end though, there is something for everyone in this movie, from the constant action scenes to the quiet ones that add humanity to what would otherwise be cardboard clichés. Highly recommended!",9,2,7,28 April 2012
Wanted," Solid Action But Stock Characters and Story
","Based on the graphic novel by Mark Millar, WANTED is the latest in the long line of the summer onslaught movies based on comic books. But this isn't a movie for the whole family, it's more of like an adult version of JUMPER, which premiered a few months earlier and the simplistic plot is very close to its predecessor.Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) is a nobody- he works as a cubicle drone in a huge, nameless company, his only friend there happens to be having an affair with his girlfriend and his corpulent boss abuses him every chance she can get. No sooner are we introduced to him do we then get into a series of slam-bang action sequences as Wes learns that he is a son of a former high ranking member of a secret order of assassins and is endowed with special gifts: the ability to pump his heart rate faster than normal (which allows him to see everything in slow motion and with a faster response time) and has the ability to make precise shots with pistols by somehow bending the laws of physics that allow bullets to shoot behind obstacles to find their target. Wes is soon joined by his mentor, the deadly assassin Fox (Angelina Jolie) and head man Sloan (Morgan Freeman) who trains him in order to go after a renegade of their order (Thomas Kretschmann) but as the story unfolds, all is not what it seemsThe action sequences are very much MATRIX-like, with slow motion photography that makes each explosion seem like a work of art. Every headshot is graphically shown as each perfectly shot bullet goes through skulls which is why I wouldn't recommend this movie for young kids even though it's supposed to be a comic-book summer blockbuster. With Timur Bekmambetov's expert direction (he was the one who did the NIGHT WATCH series which turned into a smash hit in Russia and gained cult recognition in the West), the action scenes are very well done- it seems that foreign directors might actually be better imitators than the locally grown talent when it comes to creating such wild mayhem. Unfortunately, most of the characters are stock derived and with a movie that focuses on the action, there is very little character development. McAvoy has an acting range that is more versatile than other action stars in his generation (Vin Diesel and the Rock basically play themselves while Orlando Bloom and Hayden Christiansen are absolute bores) but he doesn't have much to do other than to scream when he gets beaten up (and he does get beaten up a lot to the point of sadomasochism in this film) but there may be hope in that he can blossom much further- although being short and wide eyed tends to go against the action hero mold. My problem is that I could not gain any sympathy for his character (other than the underdog symbolism) due to the fact that he was a nobody to begin with. Angelina Jolie is probably the closest character with any sort of background in the film but it tends to get overshadowed by her TOMB RAIDER style of acting and her character seems to have a minor role in the entire story- I would have loved to see the movie focused on her character rather than McAvoy's. Morgan Freeman and Terence Stamp (who plays as a mysterious counterpart to Freeman's character) are both wasted since they get very little to do or say.All in all, I would rate this a 6 out of 10- good solid action sequences but the lack of likable characters is a serious drawback.",6,3,11,27 June 2008
No Country for Old Men," Superb Adaptation of a Master Storyteller
","For years Cormac McCarthy has been a literary sensation. While never achieving the massive success of Stephen King or Tom Clancy when he first began writing novels in the mid 1960's (perhaps because he churns out so few- NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is only his 9th novel) he has been hailed as the literary successor to William Faulkner. I have read only two of his novels so far: the Appalachian Gothic horror novel OUTER DARK and his seminal masterpiece, the revisionist western BLOOD MERIDIAN. His novels sear into your very soul- they are not easily forgotten- and only the best writers can do that.If there are any common themes in all of McCarthy's novels, they all point to a message of social Darwinism. His books are regularly downbeat, representing a world full of violence and despair, peopled by the most evil of men and the intertwining of ordinary folks who try their best to live their lives despite the bleak, unrelenting landscape (McCarthy is the only author I know who makes the land feel like a living, breathing person, just like his characters) that surrounds them.NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is the second adaptation of his works (the first was the pedestrian and forgettable ALL THE PRETTY HORSES which starred Matt Damon) and this time directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, two brothers who have become fixtures in the cult scene (one of their other movies is MILLER'S CROSSING, my favorite gangster movie next to the GODFATHER). While many literary critics regard NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN as one of McCarthy's lesser works, even a lesser McCarthy novel is still light years ahead of most other books in terms of quality. NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is a purely straightforward thriller and in the hands of a lesser director (or in this case, directors) would have been just another movie that would have quietly gone on to the DVD rack (like Matt Damon's movie), but due to the fact that the Coens are great admirers of McCarthy's works, they were able to stay true to the spirit of the book and in a sense, made a masterpiece- this movie should be studied in film schools as to 'How To Make A Proper Book Adaptation To Film And Not Muck It Up 101'.The plot is exceedingly simple: set in the southwest circa 1980, redneck loser Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin in his best role ever) stumbles upon the aftermath of a drug deal gone bad. He decides to take the drug money, but in a moment of conscience, gets identified by both sides who want the money back. In comes the deadly killer Anton Chigurh (ironically pronounced 'sugar' and is played to perfection by Xavier Bardem) who goes on an interstate rampage (one of his most inventive weapons is a compressed air canister) as he sets his sights on the fleeing Moss to get the money back, whatever the cost. Not since Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter has there been a superb and deadly villain to ever come on screen, Bardem can scare you just by looking at you, he doesn't even need to utter a word; and if he doesn't win the Oscar it will be a travesty. The cat and mouse game between Moss and Chigurh is further complicated by the investigations of a local sheriff portrayed by Tommy Lee Jones in his usual stoic attire who tries to make some sense amidst all of the mayhem (but ultimately fails). The movie starts haphazardly and ends abruptly, which is just like McCarthy's books (and just like real life)- if you are looking for a formulaic Hollywood movie with a clear beginning and ending then its best to watch a Disney, a Michael Bay movie or ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS- this one's not for you.The Coen brothers perfectly captures the unrelenting harshness of Cormac McCarthy's world- a world in which the big fish eat the little fish and the bad sleep well at night- McCarthy may be a bit of a downer, but in my view he is right. In the last few years McCarthy has now finally gotten the attention he deserves, his newest novel THE ROAD won the Pulitzer prize and a movie adaptation of it is heading to the big screen soon- let us hope that they get it right just like this one and not make it end up like Matt Damon's movie. Now if only they would also make a faithful literary adaptation of BLOOD MERIDIAN- now that would indeed be a miracle",10,4,10,10 February 2008
The Bourne Legacy," Less Action, More Plot But Just As Good
","Since Matt Damon decided not to reprise his role as Jason Bourne the filmmakers decided to continue the Bourne franchise without him- the result is the Bourne Legacy. Although it has less action than Damon's earlier trilogy it is still quite entertaining and proceeds along a breakneck pace, never slowing down to be boring and is a welcome addition to the Bourne franchise.Jeremy Renner takes over as lead protagonist Aaron Cross but Damon's presence is constantly being reminded to us since the previous supporting cast from the Bourne Ultimatum (Albert Finney, Scott Glenn, David Strathairn and Joan Allen) all make cameos to make sure that we are firmly within the same universe. In fact the whole movie's timeline takes place at roughly the same time as the Bourne Ultimatum and the constant narrative shifts makes one even anticipate a Matt Damon cameo.So what's the story about? Well it seems that Jason Bourne wasn't the only assassin in the Treadstone project but now it is revealed that there were other projects beside that one too. Because of the public fallout with the Jason Bourne expose the powers that be decide to shut down these other projects by killing everyone involved. Naturally Renner survives and with the help of surviving scientist Rachel Weisz tries to make sense of it all before they themselves are killed.Renner's assassin is slightly different than Damon's since he is neither conflicted nor does he have amnesia but is instead addicted to some sort of blue pills that makes him more deadly. Jeremy Renner does an able job filling in for Matt Damon and the plot and action whirls fast enough to satisfy most moviegoers (though a workplace shooting may hit too close to home for some) but the younger crowd might bemoan the lack of constant massive explosions. For everyone else, its good enough to warrant more. The only weakness is that the ending is somewhat abrupt and seems to hint at a sequel due to a number of unresolved plot and character issues.Here's to hoping Matt Damon and Jeremy Renner teams up in the future with another Bourne movie!",8,10,23,8 August 2012
Avengers: Age of Ultron," A Smorgasbord of Characters and Convoluted Action
","The original line-up of the Avengers are back for one last go: Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Hawkeye and Black Widow and a whole bunch of new unofficial heroes in Joss Whedon's final turn in the director's chair for Marvel's ensemble franchise.What's the story about? Well it's pretty simple, in the wake of Loki's attempted invasion of New York City, Tony Stark attempts to create an artificial intelligence whose sole task is to protect Earth against future threats. Of course, this backfires and the Avengers end up creating their deadly enemy, Ultron. The rumors are true: one Avenger will die and it might not be who you expect.Is it worth watching? Well, first the good stuff: the battle between an enraged Hulk and Iron Man in an unnamed African city is the highlight of the movie and it happens around the midpoint. Supporting characters in the first film like Hawkeye, Black Widow and the Hulk finally get center stage though at the expense of old stalwarts like Thor (who becomes an inadvertent comic relief throughout most of the movie) and Captain America (who turns into a one-dimensional boy scout). Iron Man is the Jimmy Neutron of the team- a tortured genius who tries to create a solution to a problem that has yet to exist and ends up creating a Frankenstein monster of sorts- it's not that Tony Stark is the villain but this does tie in nicely with the upcoming Captain America: Civil War movie.This brings into focus the central weakness of the movie: namely too many characters and not enough screen time for each one to be fleshed out. The movie not only serves as an origin story for Ultron as well as new Avengers Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver and the Vision but it ends up making the story a paper thin pastiche of short character building vignettes around huge swirling chaotic battle scenes- many of them too enamored with fast editing to the point that they are almost too quick to follow with the mind's eye. Additional cameos by the Falcon, War Machine and Nick Fury only adds to its ad-hoc nature and myriad narrative.In the end, Avengers Age of Ultron is ultimately satisfying but if you look closer, it seems to be nothing more than a placeholder for future plot lines in the upcoming Marvel Universe movie franchises.",7,21,44,22 April 2015
The Dark Knight," Excellent Sequel to Batman Begins
","One thing's for sure: comic book based movies are here to stay. Once before they were B-movie, red headed stepchildren with very miniscule budgets and low grade actors, now these films regularly attract A-list talent both in front and behind the camera. The latest in this summer comic book slate is THE DARK KNIGHT, the sequel to the well received and awesomely successful Batman reboot BATMAN BEGINS and continues right where it left off.Where the first movie dealt with the origins of how and why Batman came to be, this sequel now moves onto a larger canvas: the storyline now revolves around the consequences of Batman's appearance in a city gripped by crime and hopelessness. With the demise of former mob boss Carmine Falcone's power in Gotham City, the various crime syndicates are now leaderless and trying to reconsolidate as Batman (Christian Bale) AKA billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne continues his relentless assault to restore order. In the first film director Chris Nolan portrayed Gotham as a sort of cross between the slums of Hong Kong and Chicago of the Al Capone era with lots of rain and gloom, now Gotham is depicted as being very similar to New York, with many massive high rises and somewhat sunnier skies, it seems Gotham is literally coming back to life.But even with new fearless district attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart in his best role to date), it seems the city is just a few steps ahead of the rising tide of criminality that is beginning to strike back against its newfound heroes and it manifests itself into a new and powerful adversary called the Joker (Heath Ledger in his final film role). I have always found that the main differences between the main comic book makers Marvel and DC is in the portrayal of their heroes- whereas Marvel superheroes tend to be average guys and gals who are thrust with superpowers and lots of responsibility, DC superheroes tend to be iconic representations of the human condition: Superman is a depiction of the ideals and greatness of mankind while Batman represents vigilantism and revenge. As the plot of the movie unfolds, the forces of law and order, represented by Lt. Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman once again reprises his role and it has been expanded considerably) and Harvey Dent, battle it out on the streets of Gotham city against the forces of criminality with mob bosses Eric Roberts and Michael Jai White (yes, the SPAWN guy is here too) allied with chaos and anarchy which is represented by the Joker with Batman the vigilante smack dab in the middle of it all. Despite Batman being on the side of order, his very methods create a copycat gang of vigilantes who style themselves after him which puts the city even closer to the brink. As all the swirling plot lines culminate into one big showdown, Batman must make his choices carefully as every action he takes creates unintended and sometimes tragic consequences.The last great movie I saw since last year was NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN but I can say that THE DARK KNIGHT finally gives me a satisfaction that I had been missing for over a year now. The acting is superb with many old faces returning- Morgan Freeman is homely as Lucius Fox while Oldman has a larger role and consequently gets to shine even further. Maggie Gyllenhaal as the new Rachel Dawes is an infinitely better actress than her predecessor (though I thought Katie Holmes looked sexier even though she had zero talent) but her role is somewhat subdued and we never got more into her character. Christian Bale is adequate for the role of Batman/Bruce Wayne though he doesn't seem to put in anything new to the character (I still think Micheal Keaton was the best movie Batman). The big question is obviously on Heath Ledger and he delivers a deliciously wicked and sadistic Joker- very similar to Jack Nicholson's take on the character and that's a compliment; my only peeve is that he wasn't given a permanent smile like the previous Jokers in the movie and comic book- slightly different take but still very, very entertaining and fits in well with Nolan's more realistic version of the venerable Bat franchise. It is sad that Ledger will never be able to reprise his role and his makeup seems so similar to that of the equally late Brandon Lee in THE CROW that the parallels are eerie. Unlike the past incarnations of the movie and cartoon Jokers, Ledgers performance has transformed the Joker from a villain with a smile on his face into anarchy incarnate- he is no longer just a bad guy but a force of nature. The big surprise here is Aaron Eckhart's portrayal of Harvey Dent- he steals every scene he is in and watching his fall from grace is like seeing that of an epic Shakespearean tragedy.Terrific action sequences and nail biting suspense adds to an epic sequel: 8 out of 10.",8,8,16,17 July 2008
X-Men: First Class," Meh...
","Bryan Singer needs to stop destroying the X-Men franchise.It's bad enough that this movie throws continuity out the window (well, the previous X-Men movies already did that so it's not like its a new thing...) but what's even worse is that it recycles the EXACT SAME MESSAGE that occurred in the first three X-Men movies: yes, we know mutants are different, yes we know mutants have dangerous powers, yes we know there are good and bad mutants but... ENOUGH ALREADY!!! People are sick and tired of being pounded over the head with the same theme; this one-trick pony has had it's day. If you look at the X-Men comic books they fought a wide variety of villains, each with their own different agenda- unfortunately in this movie every villain has the same agenda just as before- destroy the human race- like, how many times has that been done? Why not just watch the first 3 X-Men movies? Why bother with this? Prof X (James McAvoy) now is younger, can walk and has hair and is a free-loving hipster in the 60's while Magneto (Michael Fassbender) is a suave, James Bond-like assassin. Director Matt Vaughn tries a new retro look for a 60's era reboot of the franchise but unfortunately it falls back to the same clichés that screwed up the franchise in the first place- namely that the movies are totally different than the comic books they are based on. If you look at the best comic book movie adaptations such as Raimi's Spider Man or Nolan's Batman movies they are very faithful to the source material.The X-Men franchise is almost totally different from its roots: with the exception of Beast this X-Men team is completely different from the X-Men's first class of the comic books (Havok is supposed to be Cyclop's younger brother but here it seems he is more like his father and his powers are completely different- and inexplicable and not to mention that his back story is never revealed so you don't even know how he fits in to all of it)- there are even massive logic gaps in continuity (in one scene the entire US government knows about the existence of Xavier and his mutants and towards the ending it seems only one CIA agent is aware of it and in another scene a secret agent spies on a mutant telepath in the other room and the mutant is completely unaware of it even though she's suppose to be able to read minds). With the exception of Xavier, Magneto, Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) and Beast (Nicholas Hoult) all the other characters in the movie are nothing more than plot pieces and exist solely as gimmicks. This points out to another weakness in the franchise: too many mutant characters and not enough script to develop their personalities so this means you hardly notice or care about them if they die.Sure, the 60's retro look set pieces are nice and the special effects are up to par but the rest of it just isn't there.",5,8,25,2 June 2011
Iron Man," Could Have Been Better Average Superhero Movie
","Well looks like it's not even summer yet but already there are superhero movies flying to a theater near you. And after what looks like a string of well made blockbusters that started with Bryan Singer's X-Men, it seems Marvel Comics has begun to run on empty with the recent spate of lousy films like Elektra, Ghostrider and Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer among others.Now comes Iron Man, the heavily-hyped Jon Favreau directed movie starring the newly reformed Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, the billionaire arms dealer who creates a suit of powered armor to escape his captors and predictably becomes a high powered superhero. Downey has been featured on many magazine covers lately as a former drug-addicted Hollywood bad boy who has now turned his life around and was lauded for landing a role as close to his character- in the ULTIMATES comic book version of Iron Man, Tony Stark is an alcoholic with a brain tumor who primarily becomes a superhero for corporate publicity and kicks.So your question would obviously be: is it as good as the hype? Well, not really.This looks to be the first Marvel superhero movie to ditch the opening credit sequence as we get thrust right into the action. In the original comic book, Tony Stark was a POW in Vietnam (hey, the comic was created by Stan Lee in the 60's after all) who created an armored suit to escape from his captors- the movie updates this to Afghanistan as we get rocked in the opening scenes with an IED attack on a military convoy. As Stark struggles with his terrorist captors (who seemingly are equipped with weapons built by his own company) to free himself, he unwittingly uncovers a conspiracy at the highest levels of Stark Industries and his seemingly loyal partner, Obadiah Stane (played with a bald palate and beard by industry veteran Jeff Bridges). With the aid of his trusty military sidekick James Rhodes (Terence Howard of CRASH) and voluptuous secretary Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow- what a name her character has!), Stark goes from right-wing military playboy to a humanitarian liberal after spending a few weeks in a cave.I would think that a good formula for superhero movies would be that you need to have an interesting villain that people can empathize with- Spiderman I and II did this very well with both the Green Goblin and Doctor Octopus (the X-Men's Magneto was also a well-rounded bad guy- he had a noble cause even though he wanted to wipe out non-mutants to fulfill it). The problem with IRON MAN is that Obadiah Stane is just an average, greedy and corrupt run of the mill villain- you get no understanding as to why he does what he does other than just simple greed. Jeff Bridges tries (as Nick Nolte did in Ang Lee's HULK) but there isn't a lot in the writing to work with. Downey comes off as the occasional charmer in Tony Stark but the lack of any real emotion in the script reduces him to stock hero status. Paltrow is wasted as Pepper while Howard seems out of place playing a Colonel in the military. The action sequences are okay for the most part but they are few and far between and get cut short just as they are about to go into overdrive.All in all, this is just an average superhero movie- better than FF: Rise of the Surfer, better than Ghostrider and Elektra, slightly less than the X-Men trilogy but well below the level of Spiderman and Batman Begins.5 out of 10.",5,7,29,2 May 2008
