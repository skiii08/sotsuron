Changeling," Changeling undoubtedly goes to waste, no matter how powerful it may be.
","They say that timing is everything, and while it is certainly a hard thing to imagine many audiences in our current social climate wanting to go see a film as downright dark and confrontational as Changeling, the quality of the feature as a whole remains a statement as to why you might want to give it a try. There's no doubt about it however, Eastwood here delivers a thoughtful and extremely emotive tale that very rarely caters to anyone's desires for uplifting holiday entertainment, and as such, things can get a little overbearing. Nevertheless, despite a severe miscalculation in terms of release, there's still plenty to take away from the experience, even if it does ask that you leave all expectations of personal enjoyment in the lobby; from the top class ensemble of performers to the stark detail present in Straczynski's script, Changeling is a gruelling and oft emotionally demanding tale that bestows a feeling of fulfilment and depth in place of entertainment. For that purpose I can only advise this to the select few willing to subject themselves to a story even more depressing than the world we live in today; and in that regard Changeling undoubtedly goes to waste, no matter how powerful it may be.Telling the true story of Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) and her battle with the LAPD after her son goes missing and is replaced by a fraudulent impostor, Straczynski here delves into territory that he is all too familiar with. This experience in dealing with conspiracy, corruption, politics and personal grievance gives the writer a firm hold on both his characters and plot, all of which are notably out of balance and overly contorted in the film's earlier stages, but come together neatly enough in the end. To his greatest credit however, Straczynski always keep the focus on his characters rather than his overriding themes; Changeling is a story of human perseverance for the cause of justice in a world where the word itself reeks of absurdity. It's a story that continually challenges the viewer and reveals layer after layer of development in both character and plot to the point where all such misgivings regarding the movie's dark nature are soon dispelled. Christine Colins' story certainly isn't one to be taken lightly by any means, but there remains light within the screenplay that glints at some form of hope, even if it does take the form of a shoestring. This acute balance of desperation and the harsh, bitter reality of Colins' predisposition isn't perfect more tears are shed in this movie than the average weepy- but nevertheless fulfils its purpose adequately enough in detailing a powerful struggle with corruption and personal loss.When it comes to the movie's biggest selling point, that is, the performers and the cowboy directing them however, I am of conflicting thoughts; on the one hand the movie for the most part remains coherent and rigorously compelling beginning to end, with little to no missteps from most involved. On the other hand I couldn't help but notice that leading star Angelina Jolie here, although giving a by-the-book Oscar-nod performance, too often reeks of trying too hard. She and director Clint Eastwood shoot Collins as an extremely withered, frail and timid creature prone to weeping at any given chance; sure, there are plenty of moments when this is poignant and warranted to her character, but an abundance of these scenes such as is present here, cheapens her to someone that doesn't feel as human as she ought to be. What's most striking is that given her position, she too often sinks into the background when brought in amongst her co-stars; yes, her character isn't the most photogenic for the big screen, but with so much focus on so little development on the main character herself, the result is more blunt than to the point. With much more convincing and striking performances from the maniacal, slimy Jason Harner and the ever compelling John Malkovich however, Changeling more often than not hits the nail on the head in the performance department. Placed within the terrific production values of the movie which transport you back into 1920's America with absolute ease that never draws attention to itself, Eastwood does fantastically well with the remainder of Straczynski's multi-layered and dynamic script. Yet constantly burdened with a limp sense of focus and direction coupled with an overbearing sense of tragedy that too often milks the audience for all the tears its worth, Changeling is in no way perfect, no matter how convincing its appearance might otherwise have you believe. For all it's worth though, the movie remains as a remarkably solid and well told historically based drama that more often than not gets the job done in conveying the contrast between the light and dark sides of human desire, ambition and power.<ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>",Null,3,8,7 December 2008
Frost_Nixon," Resonates long after the credits have rolled.
","First of all, let's just clear the elephant out of the room; I, being far too young to have even glimpsed at a TV set to catch the original airings of the Frost/Nixon interviews, have no real knowledge on either the Watergate scandal or the presidency of Richard Nixon. Or at least, I didn't before viewing this feature. Indeed, politics or political history isn't anywhere near my forte of special interests; I make no pretence to enjoy either and so met this very movie with a little bit of reservation.Yet, such as so many recent examples (Charlie Wilson's War, W., Che) have in the end won me over despite their political background, Frost/Nixon too manages to overcome its somewhat esoteric history-lesson documentation to move onto a much more compelling drama and character study. The result is a feature which makes an impact on both the intellect and heart- crafting characters that are discernible as human beings and yet not to the point where all factual backing is lost. Historians as far as I can gather, may be ill at ease at the extent to which such facts are toyed with here, yet upon this shift of focus to dramatization, Frost/Nixon transcends beyond mere document and offers a much more personal and human side to perhaps one of the biggest political scandals in the history of the United States.Most importantly however especially for those sharing my ignorant disposition- no real knowledge is required or even expected from audiences in order to enjoy what is on offer here. Sure enough, a little debrief before hand can't hurt, yet the movie is layered in such a manner that both those deeply interested in the scandal and those less knowledgeable can take something from the experience. For what it's worth, Peter Morgan's screenplay (which is based on his play) gives enough of a history lesson, and hands out the necessary facts to make Frost/Nixon as little in the way of perplexing or polarising as he can whilst maintaining historical integrity to his story.The key factor to entirety of the screenplay's ability to move beyond mere banal retelling of facts however exists in its nuances of character and drama that as the script plainly points out towards its conclusion- moves beyond the usual snapshot glimpse that TV and film usually offer. Instead, Frost/Nixon offers viewers a glimpse into both men, who sat opposite one another, with an ostensibly opposing set of convictions as to why they were engaging in conversations soon to be seen all over the world. Yet, more interesting is that at the same time, both found themselves sharing a strange dualism that in the end accommodated and afforded one of history's most important political revelations in the form of a confession. That confession, as obvious and warranted as it was to most of the county's inhabitants, wasn't easy going however, and it was a long ride to get there.Opening with a series of faux-interview's with the movie's actors who are in character as their personas, Morgan's script outlines the reasons as to why Frost, and not anybody else eventually got the job done. The reasoning? Simple; Frost knew TV. He didn't know very much politics and he had never sat opposite such a figure as Nixon in his entire career, yet despite a blundering start, at least managed to engage the former president in a dual of wits which in the end provided American with its long awaited moment of catharsis. These scenes, which are wonderfully constructed by Morgan and loosely based upon actual source material, provide what are essentially the movie's centrepieces alongside a stark, attention grabbing conversation between the two men over a phone line.Both actors, Frank Langella and Michael Sheen who play Nixon and Frost respectively, embody their personas with conviction shaded with emotive human qualities often lost within the average political-aligned feature. Indeed, this shift from mere caricature bio-play to much more rounded, human performances ties in with the feature's main focus upon story rather than fact; crafting a character study that draws upon the heart more so than the intellect, and as a dramatized account rather than documentary, certainly plays out all the better for it.The most important element to which many of the best bio-fics adhere to is that of almost complete, objective neutrality. Of course, when presenting such a feature revolving around a figure as deeply controversial as Richard Nixon, such a balance, or healthy equilibrium is not easy to strike without disgruntling audiences. Yet, much like the interviews themselves, Frost/Nixon does well to present the facts, retrieve the required information from such questioning, whilst all the while staying true to the heart of why such a discussion is taking place in the first place.In the end, Frost/Nixon strikes its firmest parallel to the source material, not from the straight cut facts (such a degree of loyalty would certainly take a lot more hours to deliver) but through its essence, or, reasoning. Through this shift in focus, the movie paints an intellectually rewarding experience coupled with a surprisingly human portrayal of a man endlessly demonised for his faults. This fate, which has been used for many a tragedy inevitably gives Frost/Nixon its biggest punch, and it resonates long after the credits have rolled; it's the moment that gave America what it wanted and it's the same moment here that gives Frost/Nixon is picture perfect climax.<ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>",Null,2,4,27 January 2009
The Young Victoria," Beautiful, memorable but most of all, human.
","The 63 year reign of Queen Victoria is perhaps one of the most documented and popularly known historical reigns in British history. On the one hand, her story lacks the theatrics of earlier royals thanks to a change in social climate and attitudes, and on the other her story is one that perpetuates because it is notably human. Taking on the earlier years of her life where the budding romance between herself and the German Prince Albert was taking forefront, director Jean-Marc Vallée who has only until recently remained in the unbeknownst shadows of the industry here takes Victoria's story and captures that human element so vital to her legacy. It's a story that feels extremely humble considering its exuberant background, and yet that's partly what gives it a distinct edge here that separates it from the usual fare.Taking a very direct and focused approach that centres in on a brief five or so year period between her ascension and marriage to Albert, The Young Victoria does what so little period pieces of this nature offer. Instead of attempting a sprawling encapsulation of such a figure's entire life, Vallée instead opts to show one of the lesser known intricacies of Victoria's early years which are easily overlooked in favour of the more publicly known accolades. The result is a feature that may disgruntle historians thanks to its relatively flippant regards to facts and the like, yet never to let document get in the way of extracting a compelling story, writer Julian Fellowes sticks to his guns and delivers a slightly romanticised yet convincing portrayal. Vallée takes this and runs, making sure to fully capitalise on those elements with enough restraint to maintain integrity in regards to both the history involved and the viewer watching.A major part in the joy of watching The Young Victoria play out however simply lies in the production values granted here that bring early 1800's Regal Britain to life with a vigorous realism so rarely achieved quite so strikingly by genre films. Everything from the costume designs, sets, hair styles, lighting and photography accentuates the grandiose background inherent to Victoria's story without ever over-encumbering it. Indeed, while watching Vallée's interpretation come to life here it is very hard not to be sucked in solely through the aesthetics that permeates the visual element; and then there's the film's score also which works tremendously to further the very elegant yet personal tones that dominate Fellowes' script. Entwining the works of Schubert and Strauss into Victoria and Albert's story not only works as a point of reference for the characters to play with, but also melds to the work with an elegance and refrain that echoes composer Ilan Eshkeri's original work just as well.Yet for all the poignant compositions, lush backdrops and immaculate costumes that punctuate every scene, the single most important factor here—and indeed to most period dramas—are the performances of the cast and how they help bring the world they exist in to life. Thankfully The Young Victoria is blessed with an equally immaculate ensemble of thespians both young and old that do a fantastic job of doing just that. Between the sweet, budding romance of Victoria (Emily Blunt) and Albert (Rupert Friend) and the somewhat antagonistic struggles of her advisors and the like (spearheaded by a terrific Mark Strong and Paul Bettany), the conflicts and warmth so prevalent to Fellowe's screenplay are conveyed perfectly here by all involved which helps keep the movie from being a plastic 'nice to look at but dim underneath' affair so common with these outings.In the end, it's hard to fault a work such as The Young Victoria. It's got a perfectly touching and human sense of affection within its perfectly paced romance, plus some historical significance that plays as an intriguing source of interest for those in the audience keen on such details. Of course, it may not take the cinematic world by storm and there lacks a certain significance to its overall presence that stops it from ever becoming more than just a poignantly restrained romantic period drama; yet in a sense this is what makes it enjoyable. Vallée never seems to be striving for grandeur, nor does he seem content at making a run-of-the-mill escapist piece for aficionados. Somewhere within this gray middle-ground lies The Young Victoria, sure to cater to genre fans and those a little more disillusioned by the usual productions; beautiful, memorable but most of all, human.<ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>",Null,80,100,12 July 2009
The Hangover," The best thing is that you won't wake up the next day and have forgotten all about it.
","'We all do dumb s*** when we're f***ed up' concedes a rather sombre Mike Tyson when reviewing security footage of four random drunkards stealing his tiger and urinating in his pool—and it's at this moment, around two-thirds of the way into the bizarre but infectiously humorous trip that is The Hangover that everything shifts into place. Maybe it's something to do with the fact that if Tyson can sit back and laugh at the absurdities and downright obnoxiously reckless abandon that he witnesses when brought into contact with those guys, then we can too. I seriously doubt it, but the entire expedition that is The Hangover is equally as—if not more-so—dubious than seeing a bearded guy get knocked out by the heavyweight boxer to the tune of Phil Collins' In The Air Tonight, but this in no way makes the feature any less entertaining or downright hilarious. In fact, that's exactly what makes it the romp that it is; it's silly, indulgent and somewhat charred like a barbequed steak mixed with some tough liquor, but with a fine ensemble of tangible characters and a pace that keeps things readily engaging and entertaining, The Hangover is fun, fun, fun—and the best thing is that you won't wake up the next day and have forgotten all about it.Taking place over the course of two days and nights as three best friends attempt to put the jigsaw pieces of their wild night out in Vegas together in order to find their missing friend, The Hangover is a deliciously simple albeit compelling story. Striking right at the heart of modern western society and its tendency to do just as these guys do every now and again, the majority of Todd Phillips' feature here is steeped in infectious pathos that plays into that ever-so tried-and-true method of combining observational humour with broad, situation farce. The result is a story that flows excellently from act to act, keeps the jokes and gags steady throughout whilst developing characters and throwing them around often enough to keep the viewer laughing, intrigued and laughing some more. To be fair, there is a certain lack of substance to the overall arc of the adventure penned here by Lucas and Moore (something that is evident in a large portion of their previous works to date) that inevitably stops the feature from ever becoming more than a light-hearted buddy-comedy, but you probably won't notice thanks to lack of pauses in laughter provoked by the script or the actors.At its heart however, despite the robustly imaginative and complex intertwining of the central characters' journey, it is the characters themselves that make the majority of this hangover such a joy to watch. While the movie ostensibly revolves around four friends, much of the screen time is given to just three of those who share a wonderful chemistry that always feels flesh, edgy and natural. Through the performances of Ed Helms, Bradley Cooper and Zach Galifianakis (who gets much of the movie's laughs as the awkward and weird bearded guy with a baby), the buddy/road-trip story that serves as the centre-piece for all their drunken antics, missing teeth, stolen babies and stun guns to revolve around really hammers home the key narrative that propels things forward and retains the script's distinctly Y-chromosome-centric nature. Sure, there's plenty of material here that the ladies of the audience will be able to latch onto, but there's no denying the overtly boyish tendencies that rule supreme here that will be sure to give male audiences with a thirst for profane, crude comedy the most satisfaction. Sharp dialogue and genuinely exciting plotting makes this one of this year's most remarkable and hilarious comedies.<ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>",7,3,6,25 June 2009
Stop-Loss," This road trip, although mostly rewarding, is unavoidably rough.
","The war movie has never been an easy thing to create, and over the course of history, it's hard to pinpoint any other genre of film that has managed to strike up as much controversy and debate. Stop-Loss is no different from those that reside within its close proximity, yet despite its ability to strike up conversation, to get the mind thinking and to question war itself, an obvious lack of sustainable narrative hurts the film where it matters most. Overlong, poorly focused and incoherent, the storytelling element of Kimberly Peirce's ambitious project here doesn't do as much justice to the themes of the script as she would probably have hoped to. To be fair, there is some hard-hitting material here, and characters along with their respective performers are rounded enough to avoid being mere place holders for ideas, and as such Stop-Loss does manage to retain a strong gasp upon the attention. Yet lumbered with a tedious middle act and an ending that seems ill at ease with itself, the ride, although mostly rewarding, is unavoidably rough.In what is best compared to such war movies as the classic DeNiro and Michael Cimino film The Deer Hunter and Brian De Palma's effort from earlier this year, Redacted, Stop Loss is the kind of war movie that discusses war through its characters rather than the event itself. Negating Iraq to the opening ten minutes, Peirce and crew here adopt more of a road movie layout, detailing the concept of being Stop-Lossed, and the effects it can have on any soldier unlucky enough to be put through such a policy. On the run from his government, friends and fellow soldiers, lead character Brandon King (Ryan Phillippe) spends much of the film coming to terms with how much of his life that he left behind many years ago has disintegrated while he has been away. Isolated and trying to find a way out of his predicament, King is an intriguing character who offers insight into the broken down psyche of an ex-soldier and during certain scenes Phillippe conveys such emotions and states of mind adequately. In this regard King is relatively close to DeNiro's 'Michael', and while Phillippe doesn't necessarily touch on what made Michael such a memorable character, the bare essentials are here and he does a decent job of what is offered to him.Not satisfied with telling just one story however, the script takes its time to flesh out backing characters that grew up and served with King. These additions are welcome yet underused; there is a severe imbalance here between the lead character and his friends, and while one can accept this as part of having a 'lead-character', I couldn't help but notice that Stop-Loss could have worked far more effectively as a character study focusing on more than its central persona. Although King's comrades do get ample screen time, their eventual climaxes and turning points fail to resonate as much as they should, and as a result, the movie's statements and themes never deliver quite as much poignancy as they aim to. Yet again however, the performers themselves do a fine job with what they are given and deliver some sturdy performances that mesh with Phillippe's to create a solid wall of realism to bounce off of.The best war movies it would seem are those that never necessarily take it upon themselves to overtly make statements on war regarding its pros and cons, and instead simply tell the story as it is. Whilst watching Stop-Loss, one gets the sense that director Kimberly Peirce has kept this in mind during the process but then never quite managed to overcome the script's obvious slant towards criticism of the war. Yet if there is a bias here, it is remote and minute; not because the writers chose to sit on the fence but simply through the fact that they tell a character story first and foremost rather than try to create a politically enlightening piece of propaganda. Such is the film's strength and its weakness. On the one hand, the drama is welcome and the performances involved ensure that the best moments are engaging and compelling. On the other hand however, a distinct lack of focus in this area quickly causes the movie's middle act to tread along at an uneven pace which often stutters and fumbles. With a tighter reign on what it is the movie was trying to say, and a deeper, centralised focus on character and the domestic drama involved with the political ramifications that have got them here, Stop-Loss could have been a lot more effective. Yet for what it is, those interested in the subject itself should find something to enjoy here.<ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>",Null,0,2,7 October 2008
Casablanca," An experience you will never forget.
","'Casablanca' is one of those films that you may already know all about even if you haven't seen it. It is widely recognised from critics and movie lovers as being one of the greatest achievements made to date, and not without reason. Although I wouldn't name it as one of my favourite films of all time, there is no denying its brilliance, its mesmerising charm and influential impact it has had on cinema ever since.Last night I was lucky enough to actually catch a special Valentines Day screening of the film at my local cinema, for what was my second time seeing the masterpiece. I have to say, I enjoyed the experience far more than my first, not just because of the quality of the restored version or that wonderful cinematic atmosphere you get when watching old classics, but because I believe 'Casablanca' is a film that gets better every time you watch it; You already know the characters and you already know the plot, and so the whole experience feels like a distant and personal memory that you share with the characters, something that ties in with the nostalgic tone of the film itself.With its captivating photography, soundtrack and long segments of real-time shots, the film is one that engages the viewer and sucks them into its world. The whole experience to me was fantastically surreal; there were moments where I would be totally connected to the movie, where I actually felt like I was back in the 40's. Every now and then my attention would be broke by the usual toilet goers etc., and I would realise where I was and as I said; it was surreal. The reason I mention this however that is it is testament to how immersive 'Casablanca' really is.Undoubtedly the two things that make the film what it is lie in the performances from the whole cast, and the absolutely solid script that was based on the early play 'Everybody Come to Ricks'. First of all, if watching the film for the first time, you will undoubtedly feel like you've seen it before, and this is no coincidence for you've probably heard a lot of the dialogue quoted elsewhere. Many people have claimed 'Casablanca' as having one of the most influential and well-written scripts in film history, and I would be inclined to agree. Throughout you'll bear witness to some of the most famous lines to be shown on the big screen, and also be treated to perhaps the greatest ending monologue ever written for film, which is just as eloquently delivered by Bogart himself. Then there's the absolutely wonderful use of hard-bitten dialogue throughout, mixed with its very classy equivalent, which provides for some intense scenes whether evoking humour, pity, anger or pride; 'Casablanca' manages to achieve it all.I can't remember of the top of my head who once said this but whoever did was clearly getting at Michael Curtiz, under-appreciated director of 'Casablanca'. He said that the greatest directors blend into the fabric of their movies, never making their presence openly obvious; they make the rest of the crew look good. As time has gone on to prove, this is certainly the case here as Curtiz is a director who rarely gets mentioned when discussion on the movie is taking place. When watching the film for a second time however I kept this and mind, and noticed the superb amount of skill that did indeed go into making 'Casablanca' the masterpiece it is, and a lot of that comes down to Curtiz, who does a brilliant job bringing the entire production to life.The people whom he really brings out however are the cast, who unquestionably give some of their greatest performances here, creating characters that are fully dimensional and likable without being submissive to conventional 'hero' stereotypes of the time. Bogart plays 'Rick', the owner of a saloon in Casablanca, outcast from his homeland, and a man with a broken heart, unwilling to 'stick his neck out for nobody' as a consequence. Throughout, Bogart performs expertly, showing his brilliant screen presence that he has become known for, letting his character flow through naturally and with constant emotion. Ingrid Bergman and Paul Henreid play 'Ilsa Lund' and 'Victor Laszlo' respectively, delivering equally emotive and powerful performances that only go to compliment Bogart and the rest of the cast magnificently, creating chemistry that never lets down.I have deliberately avoided going into too much detail in this review merely on the basis that I feel I cannot and could not fully do this film justice by doing so. Instead I merely state what many others have done before me and advise that if you haven't done so already, be sure to watch 'Casablanca' as soon as you can; it's an experience you will never forget and you'll want to come back to again and again.<ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>",Null,2,4,11 October 2008
Star Trek," Star Trek as the bold, exciting and culturally relevant form of entertainment that it could once claim to be.
","Star Trek; it goes without saying that even the slightest mumble of its title is sure to evoke multitudes of images concocted into the mind of anyone with the slightest interest in popular culture. As a form of entertainment, art and cult-culture obsession for fans all over the world, the franchise as it stands represents many things and stands as a modern-day phenomenon not just for the stereotypical 'nerds' usually associated with the series, but to casual fans of TV and movies in general. With so many instalments inherent to the canon of Trek's universe however, the task of building a brand new feature set to welcome in newcomers as well as serve to the long-time admirers, is a task that eventually killed off what was once a dominant feature on household television sets for the best part of two decades.For Star Trek, the adage that familiarity breeds contempt eventually began to ring louder than captain Jean Luc Picard's monologues and the ho-humming of the tired Enterprise and its tepid crew. The stories and settings were the same old hogwash recycled and rebranded—there was a lack of imaginative adventure, and a certain amount of the magic that propelled the original series into the culturally significant icon that it had become, had all but died. So it is with the dawning of a new age of the franchise—after a brief four year absence from screens large and small—that those central ideas inherent to the soul of Star Trek and its ability to entertain whilst maintaining a culturally relevant stance that is both progressive and deeply rooted in humanity; that those ideas must be firmly established in a movie that also walks the often dauntingly fine line between polarising esoteric fan-pandering and daring, new and refreshing up-hauling.And yet, faced with a task that—like Spock's infallibly complex algorithms—is more or less designed without hope of a one-hundred-percent positive outcome, writers Orci and Kurtzman actually pull it off. Sure, the entire premise of the feature is based upon the fact that all history as has been documented by the TV shows is now negated because of time-travel complications and paradoxes which makes the entire procedure one that can be appreciated 'as is' for both new and old fans alike—but the delicacy and amount of detail that is packed in amongst the loosely connected timelines if formidable and works as a singular entity in itself. The result is a time-travel science-fiction story with Romulans and other assorted deformed-forehead aliens that doesn't feel like one, and for all the right reasons.Even with paradoxes, multiple realities and distorted timelines however, some things never change. Thankfully, one of these constants resides within the realm of character for Star Trek which sets about building upon established character traits and relationships known for forty years without succumbing to mere parody. For all intents and purposes, Star Trek as it is portrayed here is essentially a story built as a testament to the legacy of esteemed rebel and starship captain James T. Kirk played by a young, energetic and charismatic Chris Pine. The character is defined here with shades of his former self kept in check consistently with a new-found sense of renegade rebellion and an unflinching, steel-fisted approach to any embodiment of authority. Pine does well to avoid making Kirk a caricature of William Shatner's interpretation from the sixties without diverting away from the same sense of charisma, charm and initiative integral to his rather iconic screen-presence.If Star Trek gets its fast-paced sense of power and hard-assed action from Kirk however, it is somewhat ironic then that much of the movie's heart comes from Spock, the pointy-eared, 'heartless' Vulcan. Conflicted by his Vulcan and Human ancestry which clash at every opportunity between logic and emotion, Spock provides the feature with its most focused source of internal struggle infamously depicted in a few of the TV series' episodes and previous movies. It is this dynamic, coupled with a surprising but perfectly restrained, eloquent and fitting romance subplot that propels Spock beyond Kirk's straight-to-the-point image into a persona that is engulfed by multi-layered moral and interpersonal complexities resulting from emotional confliction.When all the space-dust has settled however—when the last photons are fired, characters are dealt their hands and lives are altered forever, the overwhelming feeling left in Star Trek's wake is one of hope. Ask any fan from the sixties to the naughties and they will more or likely sum up their love for Star Trek in all its bloated entirety as such; hope for the future. While Abrams' vision here at times tends to go off on darker angles that contradict the safe-play nature of Gene Roddenberry's original, such key themes as hope for a brighter future and a better humanity along tow with an overwhelmingly abundant mass of characterisation and compelling drama allows Star Trek to be Star Trek without feeling as tired as it did just half a decade ago. For some viewers, the now infamous 'Space, the Final Frontier' monologue that brings this instalment of Star Trek to a close will function as a device for relief that somehow, somewhere there remains a bridge to their beloved Star Trek of yesteryear. Yet for others, this iconic refrain will be given new light when spoken by Leonard Nimoy as the Enterprise readies itself for new worlds and new civilisations—for many it will signal the return of Star Trek as the bold, exciting and culturally relevant form of entertainment that it could once claim to be. Indeed, the Enterprise and its crew are back, and while they may be venturing into dauntingly unexplored territory for the second time—it's been a long time since that closing line rang as true and as resonating as it does today: 'To boldly go, where no one has gone before.'<ul><li>An edited to 1000 words review by Jamie Robert Ward.

The Birth of a Nation," The Birth of Film-Based Propaganda.
","It is often said that there are two sides to every story and The Birth of a Nation is certainly one of the most extreme examples that can be pointed to in evidence of this case. The film is split into two parts, the first of which covers the brief lead up to, effective dramatisation and culmination of the American Civil War. This part showcases all of Griffith's strongest capabilities as a director for the time in which he served American film-going audiences so early on. Although he tends to use special camera effects more for portraying vast scenes of action rather than intimate, reflective moments of beauty, the director nevertheless draws on works like Dante's Inferno and Calibria for inspiration in this regard. And while not quite as revolutionary as you may be lead to believe by other critics, his style and choice of editing amongst other aspects was at least revolutionary when shown in 1915 on American silver screens. There's no doubt about it, The Birth of a Nation is a well-made film.But then, there's the second part which deals in the aftermath of the Civil War and serves less as a historically-inclined action blockbuster and more of a narrow-minded piece of American culture that unfortunately wasn't just the viewpoint of one man. Indeed, although titled 'Birth of a Nation', one could argue that the film rather serves as the birth of film-based propaganda, purely because of this act. Rather fittingly, the film's second act opens with a disclaimer of sorts that vaguely echoes the now all-too-familiar refrain uttered by closet-bigots of 'I'm not racist, but' before moving on swiftly to do nothing but demonise one skin colour and anglicise the other. But still, it's not as if Griffith suddenly stops making a good film. He just stops making a morally-sound one, and this is where things get tricky.On a personal level, I thought the film was distasteful, but mostly engaging. One could argue that maybe such levels of engagement might not have been present if not for the eye-popping, jaw-dropping content and points of view, but Griffith's skills as a film-maker are nevertheless undoubted. The problem is, as a reviewer, who do you recommend this film to? I'd love to say film enthusiasts, but to be honest, I'm probably never going to watch this film again and feel that all things considered, wouldn't have missed out on that much had I gave it a pass. Also, what is it that makes a film 'good' or 'worth watching' in the first place? This depends upon the individual. For some it's about the stars, others the acting or the plot or the special effects or something else. Many people wonder why The Birth of a Nation is as widely-available and openly praised as an all-time great when at the same time it is as deeply flawed at its moral core as it is. The thing is that critics tend to favour aesthetic and a film being well-made is merely enough to make it worth seeing. That's fine and works for many modern works, but for something as out-of-time as this, it can lead to some problems. Namely that they in-turn end up recommending something vulgar and hateful, racist and bigoted.So while I can appreciate and understand what makes Giffith's work here such a classic and well-made piece of cinema history, I also find it impossible to sit back and merely ignore everything that's wrong with it, which is a hell of a lot. The Birth of a Nation is surely a spectacle and does plenty of things right, but its naivety and narrow- mindedness about its central views trouble it to the point of bringing down the structure that props it up so loftily. Which is a shame, because at its core is a brilliantly executed tour de force that does what American cinema had never done before, and in some regards, thankfully never did again quite so heedlessly.",6,2,4,16 July 2016
Memento," Not as good as it's made out be, sadly.
","I was quite disappointed in Memento, what with all the praise it has had since its release in 2000 and its coveted 27th spot in the IMDb top 250. I have also enjoyed two of Christopher Nolan's other later films, so when it came to watching Memento, it was safe to say my expectations were high.I don't know though, memento just didn't click with me, i found it interesting for the most part and yes it held my attention, but it lacked any feeling. I mean, the main character has lost his wife, he's out trying to get revenge, but do we see any remorse or grievances from him? Nope, nowhere in Memento is it to be found. In fact, there's hardly any emotion at all present with the exception of the odd burst of unconvincing anger. This distinct lack of heart is what kills an otherwise intelligent and well constructed film.The way in which it truly strikes hard at the movie's core is through the characters and their remarkably dull and uninteresting nature. It's not just the writing either, performances were rather mundane and unremarkable throughout with the odd exception here and there from Pantoliano and Tobolowsky. In fact I wasn't interested in any of the characters bar Leonard, but only because I wanted to know who the real killer was. Now when it got to this actual 'climatic' in the story, a lot of people probably loved the twist, but I didn't enjoy it at all and found it terribly anticlimactic. When the credits started rolling, I genuinely felt unfulfilled, which i realise may have been the point regarding how the character eventually feels at this point but I didn't buy it. I felt as if the entire movie had headed towards a solution that was surprising yes, but not all surprises are nice ones. This was a sucker punch and a half.I have to say, I did enjoy the backwards narration of the story. It suited the theme of memory loss well and there is a scene where Leonard questions his wife reading a book that she had read numerous times before that basically gets to the point of why the story is told this way. There was the odd drag in the middle section of the film where scenes were sometimes cut a little too soon and frequently, most notably the ones involving the character 'Dobb'. As a narration style however, it was a completely original and fresh way to tell a tale.As a whole, memento isn't a bad movie, it is actually quite good but that's all. There's nothing genuinely remarkable or memorable except the narration style, but then again maybe that was Nolan's intention.",Null,0,3,27 September 2007
Inglourious Basterds," Cowboys and Nazis.
","Up until this point, it's worth mentioning that in amongst the select few war movies that aren't steeped in sober reflection and grim in their honest portrayals of The Brutality of War, very few are high profile, widely known or least of all critically esteemed. Cue Quentin Tarantino, lover of the Spaghetti Western, A, B, C, D movies infused with absurdity and exploitative traits and even those sombre, epic war movies so adamant in their seriousness. So what then happens then when you combine a love for cinema in its many forms with an even bigger love for tearing it up there on the big screen yourself? Simple; you get a Tarantino film, and this time around it just happens to be Hitler up there on high court in place of The Bride, Vince Vega or Mr. White. It's honest, but plays loose with facts when something more exciting can occur; entertaining and appealing to a wide range of adult audiences, but reverent to cinema as art-form as well as fun entertainment; and perhaps most importantly is that it feels new and cutting edge yet strangely classically informed at the same time—sound familiar? Well like I said; you get a Tarantino film.Told in traditional Tarantino narrative which unfolds under many roofs simultaneously and eventually colliding in a stream of pathos and catharsis, Inglourious Basterds is certainly a long one but whether it's an epic of sorts remains to be seen. This, however, doesn't seem to be on the mind of the director. You see, here Quentin trades in the grime and horror of war for something a little more casual. As is also commonplace in his movies, the violence is still on full throttle here yet isn't overly stylised as has been the case previously and maintains a firm grasp on realism throughout. Yet such instances do not dominate the focus of Inglourious Basterds; this feature which clocks in at just over two and a half hours showcases perhaps just ten minutes of graphic violence cumulatively over its entire duration. For some bizarre reason, Tarantino has been—perhaps a little unfairly—ostracised in Hollywood because of an exaggerated image of being someone who loves to glorify violence in his features. Yet as is the case in most of his films, it just happens to be that the 5% of his features which do revel in blood, pain and torture often make a large impression because of the contrast they so solemnly make against the other, more visceral points of his work.These ostensibly calm and slow moments during the film work on a level a lot more subtle and poignant than the larger, more bombastic sequences. And while there are moments here that echo the long, unwinding dialogue scenes present in Death Proof or Pulp Fiction, like those features there are always cogs turning the background—Tarantino loves to explore characters with these scenes which build and build around the conversations and interchanges between his characters, and here with some instances where his script runs pages and pages with little to no plot development at all, here this directorial staple if you will works to a fine point. Contrasting, but not to the point where the viewer becomes weary or agitated, Inglourious Basterds works at building up moments of violence before they occur. Somewhere in the back of your mind, you expect something bloody to happen—sometimes it happens, most of the time it doesn't, but it's this subtle manipulation that keeps the feature from crumbling under the weight of its many characters, timelines, narratives and least of all plot developments.All across the board, the performers do a stellar job of nailing that Tarantino vibe; the back and forths are spot on, the characters alive and vibrant and thanks to the many arcs that are given to each of them, very few become fodder for the scenery. Instead, Inglourious Basterds utilises its robust runtime efficiently, building characters, their interpersonal quips, what gets them ticking and of course, resolving the conflicts that inevitably arise when a bunch of misfit Yanks in the German-nicknamed Basterds company go head-hunting in France for any Nazi uniforms they can see. Such instances arise in a manner which can be both disturbing and comical at the same time with both Brad Pitt and Christopher Waltz stealing every scene they're in whether Pitt's laughing in the face of danger or Waltz is slithering across the set to poke his nose into someone else's pie.It's absurd and gauche by all means, but never succumbs to facile factitiousness or asinine kitsch, and such is where the movie becomes something entirely different from what you may expect. The result is a war movie that doesn't feel like one, and for all the right reasons. Make no mistake, this isn't Saving Private Ryan or Shindler's List—instead it plays more like Cowboys and Nazis, with an effervescent French femme-fatal Jew stuck in the middle playing (unbeknownst to anyone else) catalyst harbinger of doom reminiscent of the vengeful Bride of yesteryear. Through this somewhat surreal mix of world history with the history of film, Tarantino crafts a feature which is just as exciting as it is eloquently designed—informed, uniquely artistic and downright entertaining in every regard, you get the sense once more right from the movie's opening credits that Quentin is only here to show us all exactly why he loves and what he loves about cinema. Inglourious Basterds not only serves as another chapter in that ode, but also reaffirms the director as one of the most inventive, exciting, artistic and intelligent film-makers out there today.'Y'know This might just be my masterpiece' reflects a satisfied Lt. Aldo Raine at the movie's closing point and, well yeah; he might just be right.<ul><li>Written by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>",Null,2,11,24 August 2009
Coraline," Coated with a bizarre sense of imagination and nightmarish undertones.
","For Coraline Jones—an imaginative, free-spirited young girl burdened with the curse of workaholic, dispassionate and distanced parents—her life up until now can more or less be summed up as a typo; a careless error of mispronunciation or just incompetence. Life it would seem is just a series of misfortunate, boring mistakes that aren't her fault; she's lost within a world of greys and pale-skinned coffee addicts lacking her own shades of vibrancy and lust for adventure. Seeking some sort of escape from her dreary reality, Coraline finds refuge in a distant home that fulfils her every whim and desire. Yet the people who provide this—her parents who are an eerily chirpy polar opposite of their real counterparts—don't offer such a paradise for young Coraline's gratis benefit. No, they want her eyes, the key to the soul and her only way back to the smoggy and bleak landscapes of her totally boring existence.Telling this tale that will be familiar to most audiences, Coraline is a feature that mixes the absurd and artistic with the jarringly authentic to startling effect. In fact, despite the screenplay's tendency to get bogged down by the narrative's overly familiar web of themes and plot devices, the majority of the movie surprisingly transcends the usual ho-hum formula present within too many of today's children's features. Instead Coraline with its cerebrally engaging aesthetic and bizarre sense of reality offers an experience that adults will probably enjoy a little more than their younger counterparts. Yes, it's true that children will still find plenty to latch onto a enjoy here—but the truth is that Henry Selick here twists and spins an experience bursting with thematic subtext, gorgeous imagery and some wacky characters who stay true to established formula without coming off tired and mundane. Existing somewhere between the realms of Nightmare Before Christmas and Pan's Labyrinth lies the dual realities of Coraline Jones in all their mesmerizingly off-key beauty.Taking centre stage for our story is of course Coraline herself, who, despite falling a little flat at times nevertheless gives the feature a subtle sense of overriding intelligence. Indeed, there's a distinctly modern and witty prevalence to Coraline's nature that echoes last year's Juno without stuffing it into the viewer's face. While a key element to the young, adventurous protagonist is in fact her intelligence, it is instead her short-sightedness that provides the movie with its central pulling power. For Coraline, the thought of escaping her drab life on her side of the wall in order to live with her much more loving and caring family who cook her lush meals, compose songs in her name and create vast gardens modelled after her face—the temptation is almost enough to shut the door on her 'other, other Mum and Dad' and instead live in luxury coated with a bizarre sense of imagination and nightmarish undertones.Conveyed wonderfully by a mix of creepy animation, lighting and Bruno Coulais' score however, the world that Coraline escapes to at night often carries with it an ominous, sinister underbelly hidden from clear view. In this world, dreams indeed come true, but rather than play the piano itself; the piano instead plays you. It is during these segments that the feature takes its most compelling form, mixing surreal imagery with awe-inducing set pieces combining otherworldly music with the bizarre, contorted animation style that Selick is distinctly known for. The only problem with such moments however is that they only draw attention to the extremely dry and monotonous nature of Coraline's reality; at the beginning of the movie we see her decree her new home as utterly boring, and yet it isn't until the later parts of the film that we truly emphasise with her. Of course, such a polarising element is a double edged sword that conveys the movie's central themes with poignancy, but perhaps with too much of a vigour (or lack of such).Despite the many instances of jarringly unsettling gloom and doom however, there exists a prevailing sense of whimsy charm to much of Selick's feature here that has been hidden under the floorboards of all his major works. Indeed, while Coraline boasts plenty of scenes that top even the grimmest of horror movies in terms of establishing mood, atmosphere and tension—it is the central character, her struggle and the magical world that she finds herself in that makes that largest impression. Again, children will surely enjoy it on a purely ostensible level but adults will no doubt be able to latch onto the feature's thick subtext and eerie surrealism that provides something notably childish, but placed within the manipulative world of adults. In this vein, Coraline achieves a tone akin to most well known nursery rhymes or bedtime fables—cute, whimsical and told with a melancholic melody in tow; but sinister, broken and deeply rooted in the darker side of the imagination all the same.<ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>",Null,1,3,22 May 2009
The Rocker," Plays a catchy enough beat but at the same time lacks the required harmony to truly connect
","In what is mostly a one man show or, band- The Rocker, which follows in the footsteps of many other films remarkably similar to its own, is very much like the band it fronts; sparkly, catchy but totally transparent and generic. As far as rock-band movies go, there isn't much new or original material here, and anyone who calls themselves an expert on the genre will find little to enjoy outside of the lead character and the shenanigans he gets into. It's this distinct lack of momentum or having anything exciting to say that makes The Rocker feel old and tired, lacking any real edge or character that one would normally associate with the rock and roll lifestyle. No, much like lead character Fish states midway through the feature, this movie comes off more like a spectator experience; lightly amusing at times and sporadically interesting, but lacking any real solid ensemble of character and following too many rules regarding structure and pacing, The Rocker feels more like an opening band that you have to sit through in order to get to who you really came to see; unfortunately however, that band isn't playing tonight.Instead we have A.D.D. fronted by angst-ridden teenage pretty-boy Curtis (Teddy Geiger), a band who play pop-rock el stadio music, that one would think lead character Robert 'Fish' Fisherman (Rainn Wilson) would actively rebel against as much as drum machines. A veteran of the game from twenty years back, Fisherman is reluctant to help out his nephew's band with a little bit of drumming after having been betrayed by his band back in the eighties. Following a little persuasion however it's not long before A.D.D. are out on the road as Fish attempts to live out his dream of being a rock star whilst the rest of his band mates play video games and sulk in their rooms.Herein lies where The Rocker loses most of its steam; although Fish is mostly a stereotypical cartoon character, he nevertheless entertains us whilst too often clashing awkwardly with his downright boorish and mundane band mates. Rainn Wilson plays the character as off-wall as possible, often nailing the comedic elements of his personality down well enough to crack a few smiles, and yet the rest of the ensemble fail to engage anywhere near this level. Sure enough it's a decent statement on the difference in times that these characters come from, and indeed that rock and roll has changed, but on a pure entertainment level, this is still a one-man-band affair that plays a catchy enough beat but at the same time lacks the required harmony to truly connect.Through this distinct difference in character however, The Rocker does establish a fine line of parody regarding classic rockers and rock and roll movies in general; it pokes fun at, and at the same time celebrates the age when rock ruled the world. The majority of this fun of course comes from lead man Wilson who does a great job of impersonating those that have come before him in the genre, whilst keeping a little flavour of his own. People who found Jack Black's performance in the typically similar School of Rock will definitely find something to be amused with here; it's almost the same character transposed a little in regards to exposition. Again, it's a well-enough route to take, but at the expense of ripping off an already established road to success The Rocker rarely does much out of the genre's comfort zone, and with a 12A rating, is given very little room to move in regards to how much rock and roll chaos it can pursue. There's generic and then there's downright formula; The Rocker is akin more to the latter.The bottom message of The Rocker forms a very loose 'rags to riches' story to some degree, detailing a lucky few whose dreams come true and are given a chance of a lifetime. The chances are then that if you have seen any movie from the seemingly endless array of genre examples, that you will have seen this one before. It's not a bad effort by any means, no, but it isn't a remarkable one either. Instead it simply takes a by-the-book approach to telling a lightly engaging, sometimes catchy story that will be sure to make you laugh quite a few times, and in this is The Rocker's greatest strength. Fronted by a character that remains as the only memorable element of the feature, this rock show is standard fare pop-rock; catchy, easy to enjoy and acutely structured but at the same time utterly disposable, overly produced and with little soul to punctuate the rock.<ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>",Null,5,10,28 October 2008
Pirate Radio," Rocks with a passion.
","Rock and roll is a form of artistic expression that may not go quite as far back as the medium of film, but nevertheless shares common goals and reasons for their continued existence. That is, aside from the more obvious ostensible traits that each shares, there are certain under-the-surface qualities that broaden each beyond mere disposable entertainment into a realm of utter significance and profound enlightenment. Yet, this wasn't always the case; at least, not in the eyes of the Powers That Be within the more conservative of governments and states. Rock and Roll, just like its very distant cousin—the amateur film—was seen as a derogatory subsidiary of an art once controlled by the respective powers; put such a form of expression in the hands of hooligans and good-for-nothing layabouts, and your country is booking an advanced flight to hell, it would have seemed. Fortunately however, despite the power that those few 'right-thinking' individuals had garnered through their political endeavours, they were nevertheless in the distinct minority.The Boat that Rocked then, is a story about the underdog majority—a concept not frequently visited upon by anyone but the bravado of rock and roll itself. It's a story about passion and love driven by a love for music and freedom as a whole; indeed there are many times that Phillip Seymour Hoffman could easily be imagined sporting St. Andrews cross across his pained blue face, preaching about the sanctity of not only freedom of speech, but freedom of expression. Most importantly however is that The Boat that Rocked never gets caught up in its themes of such political incline; in fact, the majority of the feature's robust runtime is instead focused upon the characters, and how they begin to find solace within that very ship as they learn to call it home. From that rickety old boat, a select group of radio DJs would not only empower a generation of music lovers who wanted more than a half hour of pop music a night broadcasted by the BBC, but they would find a family and in turn create living memories of laughs, parties, sex and, well; rock and roll. Throughout the course of Radio Rock's voyages of the airwaves, we are compelled to feel for the struggle that these people are going through, but not only because of the freedom they stand up for, but because we also feel their bonds; the government, with their cold-faced callousness in trying to shut down rock and roll radio, are a threat to that family, and the sense of protective empathy that Curtis evokes is palpable.Despite the many ties that bind film and rock music together however, there remains a distinct lack of such movies catering to the subject matter itself, never mind even including a soundtrack aligned to the pop world. Yet as history has proved on a few select occasions, bringing the two together can achieve a profound effect—something magical happens when a human, heart-felt series of images and characters with a story to tell are spliced together with the exact same sense of empowerment through music rather than images. The result is a moving one, creating tangible emotions within the viewer that are brought out almost instantaneously with the simple combination of music and image. Indeed, if there is any sole testament to the importance of a feature such as The Boat that Rocked, it's how it can be used as a tool and example of how music can add multiple dimensions to a story that would otherwise fail to exist. Not only does this boat's music tug at the heart strings; it also invigorates and excites at the right moments whilst also reverberating the same emotions that the actors are portraying. Granted, not all of them work, but most do and do so with a vigour that most films never even get close to.Of course, this brings me on to the performances themselves which quite frankly come nowhere short of being absolutely delightful and charming to watch. Literally speaking, there is no weak link here; the ensemble as a whole not only work terrifically well on their own rights, but also share a bond that strengthens the movie's themes on friendship and simply having a good time. Indeed, it's of no stretch of the imagination to see that the actors had a lot of fun making this thing, and the characters on screen shine as a result. Again, it's hard to single out anyone in particular because it's the kind of feature that works best when taken as a whole, but be sure that all involved give standout performances that really are a joy to watch beginning to end.When it comes down to it though, the entirety of The Boat that Rocks' viewing experience comes down to one of breezy, theatrical entertainment punctuated by the energy of the cast and silly fun balanced with heartache drenched in pathos that slowly develops within the script. It's a story that has everything from laughter and tears, to amusing song-and-dance sequences and empowering balls-out bravado rebellion that makes you want to punch the conformist suits in their stodgy, colourless faces. And yet, without the music itself, such a film wouldn't simply lack a reason to exist, but would also lack a much needed aesthetical limb. The Boat that Rocks is a rare breed of feature that lives and dies on it soundtrack, and that's why it's such a pleasure to affirm that not only does this boat live, but it rocks with a passion. It's fun, it's lively and it's downright hilarious at any given moment with just enough pacing and development of character to keep things emotively engaging all the same—oh, and did I mention the totally awesome soundtrack? - A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)",Null,8,15,7 April 2009
"I Love You, Man"," Entertains thoroughly with only a few minor drawbacks entwined.
","Relationships can be tricky business and cinema has proved itself to be well aware of this all-too-true to life fact. The problem with the transition from reality to the big screen when it comes to relationships however is that it often makes the jump from platonic to sexual, or romantic without so much of a pause for anything otherwise. Yes, over the years there have been a ton of great buddy movies in which two people find a connection not through romantic love, but a bonding that is purely based on companionship; yet not very often do they deal with the sometimes awkward and conflicting areas involved with making the transition from acquaintance to friend that—although obviously not quite as stigmatic as romantic pairings because of typical social convention—sometimes transpires when people, who get desperate, start actively searching for a friend.I Love You, Man, which sets about the better portion of its first half in dealing with this awkward bonding of two guys getting involved in a friendship, or bromance, breaks the mold a little and betrays cinematic convention. Here the guys (or guy) aren't portrayed as easy, cool and flippant about their buddies—rather, the feature makes ease of the friends' romantic interests on the flipside and dishes out the irregularities and pressures often associated with romantic bonding and tags them onto this relationship between two straight guys just looking for a buddy to hang with. The result is a charming, sweet and downright hilarious look at the buddy movie without much pretence to its makeup whatsoever; I Love You, Man even through its apt title establishes that it isn't scared to give a real sense of realism and honesty to its characters and their relationships and that's what makes it work so well.Much of I Love You, Man's ability to reaffirm this constant stream of honesty lies in the performances of its lead stars and to a lesser extent, the minor cast members. Of course, it kind of goes without saying that if you're going to make a romantic comedy that also functions primarily as a buddy movie, you might want to get a few actors with chemistry that can convince the viewer of their bonds and the intertwined conflictions that are likely to ensue as a result of all this emotion and high-spirited discovery that's going on. Thankfully director John Hamburg has two extremely gifted comics who not only know how time a gag perfectly but who can also embody characters who you can actually believe in at the same time; here Paul Rudd and Jason Segel share some great scenes together that are hilarious (many of which come as a result of Rudd's unbearably bumbling and awkward nature contrasted against Segel's straight-guy persona) but most of all, tangible; I Love You, Man is a very funny movie, but it also makes no sacrifice—at least until the final five minutes—to any of the characters' integrity or believability.As far as the romantic subplot of the movie goes which involves Rudd preparing to marry his fiancé played by Rashida Jones (The Office) whilst at the same time trying to sell off Lou Ferrigno's (The Hulk) condo—who, by the way, has some great scenes alongside both Rudd and Segel—being that much of the focus is drawn away from this element, it doesn't work as well as you might expect. Rudd and Jones have lukewarm romantic chemistry, yet there exists a nice rapport between the two that keeps the movie from getting stale. So for something that basically functions as a plot device in order to detail the coming together of the guys, the romance isn't that interesting but at least serves its purpose.For all the good that I Love You, Man does on the basis of its buddy-comedy digressions and breaking-of-the-mold makeup however, there exists a kind of futility about the whole thing that stops it from ever truly taking off. While there are plenty of moments where Hamburg's feature comes off as refreshing and vibrant, there are others where the plot or characters meander in a void of rehashed ideas and jokes that don't flow quite as well as others. With that being said however, such instances as these are far and few between resulting in a movie that entertains thoroughly with only a few minor drawbacks entwined. Indeed, with some great performances, solid laughs throughout and a distinct tone of warmth and honesty throughout, I Love You, Man is definitely worth checking out if buddy movies are your thing, yet still crave something a little different and offbeat.<ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>",Null,1,1,26 September 2009
Superbad," Superawesome
","Seen this for the second time this week tonight and it still held up brilliantly. Both times, I have literally had sore jaws from laughing and smiling so much and tonight I actually laughed more than I did the first time, mainly because the characters are so believably funny and entertaining in the way they have been written. The only thing that bogged down the film for me -and I can't believe it- was that it focused at times, too much on dialogue that failed to move the plot along or the characters. Sometimes it was like watching a conversation going very slowly from start to beginning, but flapping its wings very intensely, so much so that it gets tiresome. This, and just a lack of that special something is what makes the film a high 9 rather than perfect 10.This aside though, Superbad is a fantastic comedy and hails up there amongst the best contemporary comedies to grace the silver screen. I recommend this to everyone... well maybe not everyone, but for anyone looking for a series of relentless laughs on the most touchy of subjects revolving around memorably written characters, this is for you.",Null,1,3,27 September 2007
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," A safe-play X-Men movie that feels like it was made in the nineties.
","When it comes to superhero action flicks, you know you're in for a rough ride when the central character that you are supposed to be invested in, too often becomes as out-of-place and jarringly disconnected as the CGI that tries to hide his lack of dimension. Sure, it's well known that most superhero origin stories are more often that not riddled with mundane exposition material and lame excuses for drama—yet it would seem that X-Men Origins: Wolverine likes to take this to the extreme. And yet, that rabid Wolverine himself, Logan is tepid at best. With perfunctory drama that never convinces of its value to character or plot, plus action that stupefies more than compels, Wolverine as it stands it merely an exercise in extremes. Not only this, but never before has the savage and tortured animal come off as toothless and neutered as he does here; this is a safe-play X-Men movie that feels like it was made in the nineties—not quite the gritty and dark comic book action movie that it should be considering both the lead character the world of superhero movies as they stand today.Telling the story of how Marvel's trademark bad-boy James Howlett a.k.a. Logan, a.k.a Wolverine eventually inherited his superpowers, disdain for life and easily-excited temper, X-Men Origins tells a story that has been told to death. Within this largely ho-hum retelling involving numerous moments of extreme grief for the character, there exists a slowly beating heart of sorts—this is the core of Wolverine's character of course, and his reason for receiving his own film in the first place—but not only is this core only vaguely referenced throughout the course of his latest feature, but when it is called into play, the result is almost always forced and completely disposable. So instead, what writers David Benioff and Skip Woods do is put all the focus largely on the cold-exterior of Logan; on his thirst for revenge against evils that he had left long ago.Sure, Wolverine has his demons, but we don't necessarily see them here. No, we see him growl, we see him gracefully walk from explosions like a true action superhero should (more often than necessary), and yes we hear him talk the talk; but was I at all moved by any of this? Did I find myself edging the man on? Did I want to see his brutal vengeance play out? No, I didn't. Why? Because Hugh Jackman bored me, and so did his character. Now let's get this straight; Jackman isn't a bad actor by any means, but he does have a tendency to suck the life out of every movie he takes part in. Much like the action and CGI that exists within the story of Origins here, the actor is flat and without any sense of conviction whatsoever. Wolverine on the other hand, is a character who does have his fair share of apathetic qualities which can make him hard to penetrate; but there is more to him than just grunts and anger. Benioff and Woods unfortunately, do not give any reason to believe so.The action itself, which comprises of obvious CGI that looks rushed and careless with set pieces as ancient and unsurprising as the sunrise, is dull and repetitious with little in the way of excitement or elements to cling to. You see, without a character to root for and only the occasional sidekick to watch outdo Wolverine at every turn, the various loop-de-loops in action choreography and supposed climaxes are negated to mere distractions only—cut them, shove some music on them and they might provide at least base-level entertainment, yet as they stand provide no such thing. The only thing more disappointing than watching Logan however, is having to try and convince yourself that make-shift excuse for a bad-guy brother-turned-nemesis Sabretooth is in any way a serious threat or reason to care anymore about the fate of our protagonists. No, instead for the brief segments of screen time that they each receive, both Gambit and Cylops give the movie its only real taste of personality and intrigue on a more visceral level.In the end, what X-Men Origins eventually boils down to is one big, ugly, contorted superhero movie cliché that bumbles along minute after minute never doing anything significantly offensive, and yet never doing anything remotely interesting either. Stuck with a 12A certificate that more or less has the same effect of crushing Logan's claws and crotch simultaneously, what director Gavin Hood instead offers here is nothing of remote significance to Marvel fans, comic book fans or even action fans on the broadest of bases. The characters are flat, the action dull and predictable, and the drama (if it can even be called that) is just about the worst element of it all with tired plot devices and derivative contrivances that feel dated to the point of stultifying what could have even been a good fun, gung-ho action flick.<ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>",Null,0,3,18 May 2009
Constantine," Fairly good movie
","Constantine (2005) Going into this movie I had no idea what to expect. I had no background info, no plot briefing of any kind, in fact all I knew was it was based on a popular comic book and that Keanu Reeves was in it. So, seeing as nothing decent was on, Constantine seemed to be a pretty comfortable choice to settle on. And I was right in doing so.First off, the movie is set in what seems to be modern day times and is based around the main Character of John Constantine. Now, at first the movie seems a bit bland, and mediocre... looking to fall into many traps of Religious movie clichés (see Blade Trinity). Although, as the story progresses, the characters begin to form and the plot thickens, the whole world of Constantine becomes enrapturing and the story ceases to get boring.Now I have been reading many other reviews of this movie and it seems Keanu is getting quite a bad reaction. Now, I won't be the first to admit that his acting skills aren't among the greatest in Hollywood at the moment but think I will be among the few in saying that I believe he did well in this movie. Now, seeing as I have never read the actual comic book, I will never know if he did in fact do the part of Constantine any justice, but with that said, I remain confident in my belief that Keanu is slowly getting somewhere with his acting talent. As for the other actors, although many of them didn't receive the time to truly focus deeply on each of their characters, the acting on the whole was great.The only downfall of this movie for me was the overall depth. I believe it could have went much further into the history of the Spear of Destiny (could have been placed at the beginning of the movie after the brief WWII note) and maybe even have took time to demonstrate the facts of what was going on. I would have also like to have seen further character and sub-plot development. Other than that, I will conclude in saying that it seems you will either love or hate this film. I myself found the movie a great escape from realty for 2 hours and advise you go see it in your spare time... but don't rush yourself.Rating: 7/10",Null,0,5,13 March 2005
500 Days of Summer," A bittersweet reminder that boy-meets-girl doesn't always end up as a love story.
","She loves The Smiths. Holy ****.Those are the words that simultaneously grace Tom Hansen's (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) synapses just as they explode into a cacophony of euphoria. Left alone to contemplate the implausibility of such a seemingly coincidental happenstance, Tom knows right there that he's in love; that's who he is—foolhardy and quick to romanticise. What he doesn't know however is that she, Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel) not only doesn't like being someone's girlfriend but that she doesn't believe in love either. Ouch. Like all determined poets however (although, here Tom is a talented aspiring architect rather than some whimsy caricature artist, which is probably for the best), Tom doesn't see how he could fail. Well, he does, but somehow there's just something about Summer that dispels the clouds and offers a ray of hope in return. Ah, poor, naïve Tom. You really can't help but feel for him.You see, right from the opening scene of 500 Days of Summer, the narration quickly gets across that yes, this is story of boy-meets-girl, but that it is certainly not a love story, even if one of the characters tries to make it so. Rather, it's a story about love, and for all the glimmers of sweet romance and blossoming glints of that ever enigmatic force called love, the story is framed in a manner which constantly reinforces and abides by that opening statement. Told in a narrative that jumps back and forth between the beginning of Tom and Zooey's peculiar development as 'friends' and some ten months later when Zooey skips town and leaves Tom hanging, 500 Days is no traditional romantic comedy. Indeed, in place of all the formulaic clichés and see-through characterisation lies a somewhat humble and down to earth portrait of a notably off-beat but nevertheless modern relationship. There's comedy, but it's never predictable or banal; there's drama, and yet it never comes off as contrived or overblown; and there's the romance that is sweet, but not sickly so.So what you get, essentially, is a movie that surprises and yet feels conventional on the exact same page. Normally, framing a love story as something that inevitably fails is bad idea with no questions raised, however this isn't the case here. By opening the audience up to the fact that ten months down the line—or, 300 days of 500—Tom is going to be miserable once all the rushing feelings of happiness and comfort take their leave with the leaves that begin to fall from their branches at the closing of Summer's days; by opening the viewer up to this fact immediately, the audience is left to wonder 'well, what is going to happen that causes that seemingly infallible partnership to wither and die?' Of course, Summer's admission is that it's just life; it's what happens, and it always does—and that is essentially the bitter truth behind much of 500 Days of Summer's first two acts.As the movie progresses however, the central timeline which is told from Day One when Tom meets Summer where he works as a greeting card writer gradually gets closer and closer to the point where that ominous cloud of impending doom is right over Tom's head. From here, much of the story is told in a linear, 'what will happen now?' fashion. Thankfully, the third act stays true to that which comes before in that it stays grounded and realistic without succumbing to predictable Hollywood staples that one expects when going into a romantic comedy. And that's not to say that the movie ends on a down-beaten note either—rather it's even more cathartic and satisfying than your average feature would indulge you with. Again, you're surprised, but at the same time more than comfortable with this change of perspective, and that's key to 500 Days' ability to feel refreshing and poignantly touching.When it comes to casting, director Marc Webb and casting director Belasco hit the nail on the head with his two leads. Zooey Deschanel, who is fast becoming one of my favourite actresses of recent years plays a roll not at all dissimilar to much of her previous works in these genre films, but that's no coincidence at all. There's something about her eyes that just jumps off the screen with every little movement, and Webb capitalises on this at every moment possible, building up the architecture of Tom's inescapable destiny with all but the slightest glimpses in his direction from Summer. Tom Hansen has a much more complex role opposite Zooey in that he goes through many different passages throughout and has to offer the movie warmth that is notably low-key and downplayed in Deschanel's character. For the most part, he pulls it off well, yet it is in his scenes with his co-star that both really shine—so much so that when the movie's romance begins to unravel by the second act, the pity that Webb attempts to emote from the audience is palpable and as effective as it should be.In the end however, the success of 500 Days of Summer largely comes down to the character of Tom and how he goes through one of the most defining points of his life. Refusing to dupe the viewer into a false sense of security, Neustadter and Weber's script indulges in the nuances associated with the often dubious and hopeless endeavours of looking for love with simplicity and heart-felt pathos as a pacemaker. Beating back and forth between The Smiths and Regina Skeptor, and flowing with a subtle restraint and subdued sense of reality imposed by director Marc Webb in his cinematic debut, 500 Days of Summer is a romantic comedy that exists to the viewer as a bittersweet reminder that boy-meets-girl doesn't always end up as a love story, at least, not the way you expect it to be.<ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>",8,1,3,3 September 2009
Yes Man," Heart-warming and more than good for a light hearted chuckle every now and then.
","There are those out there specifically speaking, there are critics out there- who often take it upon themselves to point out that Jim Carrey is an actor who plays the same hand, badly, movie after movie. I, believe it or not, am not one of these people. Growing up as a child, nobody made me laugh half as much as Ace Ventura, and I don't even want to estimate how many times I seen most of Mr. Carrey's movies of the nineties. As far as I was concerned, there was nobody funnier on the big screen.Many years on, I still find at least some joy in watching the man play out familiar routines, but find much greater fun in seeing him stretch out and trying new things. Yes Man is an example of Carrey in mature comedy mode- to some degree. For sure, this isn't The Mask or Dumb and Dumber, and it sure as hell doesn't pull out the laughs as much as those movies, but there's a lot more to be said for the film's value as a substantial, character-driven piece of romantic comedy. I make no pretences, this isn't a masterpiece of any sort; there are numerous flaws to Yes Man's tale, but that doesn't mean that it is without any value. Heart-warming and more than good for a light hearted chuckle every now and then, this is Carrey doing adult, and it's an uplifting, albeit slightly underplayed couple of hours.Taking a rather unconventional approach to storytelling, Yes Man is a feature that, like most feel-good-life-revelation movies, the main focus here is about the main character and how he changes his life for the better. In this happy-go-lucky sphere, there isn't much room for the key ingredient that playwrights will swear by- I'll give you a clue, it begins with c and ends in onflict. As a result, Yes Man can be slow moving I mean, extremely slow moving. Surviving mainly on gags and character-development for the better half of the feature, the writers don't seem too worried that there really isn't much for the viewer to be paying attention for, and yet this is slightly liberating despite its sometimes irksome pacing consequences.In case you didn't know already, Yes Man is a story like this year's The Bucket List, in that our central character realises he must change his life rapidly in order to enjoy it to the fullest. For Carl Allen (Carrey), a meek, always-say-no insurance shark, this comes in form of an organisation or, a more appropriate, but keenly avoided term, cult- that embraces the word 'yes' as their simple but effective mantra. Extremely sceptical at first, it doesn't take long for Carl to realise the benefits of such a philosophy after his first night living by it ends in him sharing a kiss with the lovely freebird Allison (Zooey Deschanel); from here it's just a matter of agreeing to everything that comes his way- which, admittedly can result in some awkward, but hysterically amusing segments.From here on in, the movie moves from gimmicky comedy to focus more on character and romance. This shift in gear helps break Yes Man away from its early amusing, but largely soulless scenes and develop those who inhabit the screen into characters we care for. Carrey, who adopts a tone here that is similar to his work in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (arguably, his finest film to date), manages to establish a mostly plausible mix of genuine warmth and his usual shtick and slapstick; those who appreciate both sides of the actor will get a lot out of it, though one suspects many will only be distracted by the more zany sides of Carl. On the opposite side of the story, Zooey Deschanel plays a role not that dissimilar from her earlier effort from this year in The Happening, but is certainly given a lot more to breathe here. As a love interest, Deschanel is as alluring as she need be, and counterbalances her softer core with a welcome independent edge.Of course, Yes Man isn't all yes, yes, yes; there are problems here, and one cannot help but be somewhat critical towards the unsustainable premise of the feature. Yet despite the pacing issues, and a lack of drama or conflict that feels natural or warranted, there nevertheless remains an enjoyable, heart-warming core to Yes Man's story that is very hard to refute. There will be moments when you may look at your watch, perhaps roll your eyes at the movie's more over-the-top scenes which clash with the adult-orientated segments, but by the time the credits roll, there's little doubt that you'll be feeling uplifted. As far as comedy or romance goes, Yes Man is by no means perfect either; in fact both elements are lukewarm for a large part of the feature, but as a character-drama, the feature remains compelling to watch unfold. For that reason I simply recommend this to those who seek something a little familiar but at the same time, more contemplated and reserved. There are brash moments in Yes Man, yet these are moments of mere background noise contrasted against sweet melody that is played in the foreground.<ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>",Null,1,1,27 December 2008
Milk," Uplifts just as much as it enlightens.
","Since the earliest counterculture movements of the 1960's, America has been a country divided on many issues, the least of which being laws and rights put in place to govern the homosexual communities throughout its states. Like those that would follow in his marches of protest, Harvey Milk is an icon of his generation- or rather the ideas that both him and his immediate crowd believed in. While set around some forty years in the past, residing within a culture that has jumped some hurdles to reach where we are now, there still remains a certain poignancy to Milk's image of personal determination for justice; in fact, he's the perfect cinematic superhero. Such is director Gus Van Sant's strongest pulling point here; rather than sell out a cheap, soulless biopic that sticks to making messages and delivering historical facts, Milk instead plays out as a compelling and at times harrowing tale of passion for equality that takes time out of its political reservations to deliver a potent biographical portrait.Harvey Milk certainly didn't think he'd make it to his fiftieth birthday, so while there's doubt that he might even have survived to the age of ninety is a matter of speculation, but there's certainly no denying his importance within today's society, forty years onward. For the most part, Van Sant stays committed to this truth; the movie starts out at the turning point of Milk's life where he turns forty and relocates to San Francisco in order to find meaning in his life. Met with a large amount of disdain and prejudice he often found in his home state, Milk is soon pushed to make a stand against the thriving bigotry residing within America's conservative states that demean him and those closest to his own lifestyle.Harvey would go on to call them the 'us's'; for Harvey, he saw himself fighting for those suffering the same injustices as himself not just for fellow homosexuals but also for the people who simply did not belong to the key suburban demographic; those left at the sidelines picking at the scraps of the majority. This key theme allows Milk to reach beyond its ostensible politics and touch the hearts of a much more general audience, thus bridging the gap between Harvey's personal afflictions and those of his listeners. It's something the real figure would implement into his speeches when talking to a broader crowd, and it works just as well here, delivering a story that stays true to its cause but not to the point where the result is polarising or esoteric.The rest of Harvey's story, as they say, is history- and Milk does well to detail that story with historical fact without leaving out firm, engaging narrative to boot. Part of what makes Milk as compelling as it is lies in Van Sant's willingness to delve beyond the message of his central character and more into the man himself. Indeed, while there have been biopics in abundant measures over the past few months, none of those can claim a character quite like Harvey himself. Sean Penn's portrayal here is in remarkable in that it warrants recognition but not because it ostensibly reeks of a pandering Academy nature. No, instead Penn becomes a persona immediately discernible from those he has done before in as much of a naturally timid manner to which one can perform as such a recognisable, larger than life figure.Both Penn, and his co-star for the first third of the movie James Franco also deliver a romance that is unfiltered -cinematically speaking- by taboo or restraint; not only does it give the film a warm core to begin Milk's story with, but it also reaffirms the themes of Milk's ideals, that homosexuality should be nothing to be lynched for- Van Sant takes this into account and delivers a series of scenes which for all intents and purposes do not draw attention to themselves in an overt manner. Sure enough, there is relatively potent shock value present within the couple's first on-screen kiss, but such moments aren't played in order to warrant strong reactions; they are soft, dignified, and most importantly, human portrayals- something which homosexuality doesn't see much of when printed onto the big screen.In the end, such moments give Milk its centrepieces and do more to reaffirm Harvey Milk's message more than his broad speeches, marches and political activism could ever achieve; here Van Sant sets out to humanise the dehumanised, and achieves his goal. Indeed, as a tribute to a man that set out on his own to change his country for the better, Milk feels potent and credible but not at the expense of telling a good story. Granted there are a few narrative issues involving the general pacing of the script, yet Milk retains, for the most part, a strong, compelling story to match alongside its ideas and characters. Of course, we've all seen the same thing done over and over again, based upon fact or not, yet this underdog swimming against the current does extremely well in sticking to basics and delivering that final punch line of personal triumph resulting in a feature that uplifts just as much as it enlightens.<ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>",Null,1,3,4 February 2009
Alien," Suspenseful Sci-Fi Classic
","Alien: a true classic for science fiction and cinema in general. Believe it or not but there are reasons behind the recognition that the film has gained, and I'm going to briefly go over just a few of them here as best as I can.The plot of Alien is essentially what a reader back in the 70's summarised as being ''Jaws' in space'. I like to think it's a little more than that, but that's just me. For me, the story of Alien is absolutely flawless, moving along at a near perfect pace from beginning to end, mixing in great twists along the way and finishing off in a memorable set of scenes that send the entire film off in a masterful finale. The script itself is as tight as one could possibly get and although a lot was improvised, the dialogue works in every scene and helps establish, develop and cement characters nicely. Perhaps the very reason why the script works as well as it does it down to the fact that it focuses on just seven characters, taking time to build them up at a balanced rate throughout the course of the film effectively.It is this great sense of character that allows the viewer to get inside the heads of the crew and experience the terror that they eventually face aboard their ship and in their minds. This is extremely important for 'Alien' because the majority of its horror is predominantly psychological, created through a masterful pacing of suspense that is continually being built up from the very beginning of the story. The character of the Alien itself is also dealt with as well as you could ask, making sure not to develop it too fast, always keeping it some sort of a mystery but at the same time always reaffirming the threat it poses to the crew. The mixture of all these elements is what makes 'Alien' the supreme example of refined atmospheric and psychological horror that it is widely recognised for.On a technical level, Alien succeeds just as well. Nearly every shot during the film is visually interesting and aurally intriguing. Throughout the movie we are placed within the clinical, claustrophobic and alienated corridors and rooms of the crew's ship. Not only does this help add to the already mounting atmosphere, but it often has you looking around, fascinated or curious as to where these people are and what their surroundings are in relation to them. Essentially, much like Ridley's other major sci-fi epic 'Blade Runner', 'Alien' has a visual style created through it's photography and lighting that I believe is wonderfully timeless. Sure there are a few visual effects that look a little dated these days, but for the most part everything still works fantastically and probably will do so for quite some time to come.Performances from the cast are perfect too, with no real stand outs from any because I believe all give their absolute best here and it shows and pays off greatly. Oh, and who can forget that absolutely amazing design for the big guy himself, Alien. Back in the day, this was an absolute masterpiece in 'monster' design, and still is today with the help of the film's great lighting and photography.These are just a few brief reasons as to why Alien is one of the best films of all time, but hopefully you can understand from them, a little of why and how it was achieved and why I regard this amongst my most favourites of films. This is required watching for everyone, film buff or casual popcorn enthusiast. Get watching and be amazed!",Null,3,7,1 October 2007
Horrible Bosses," Filthy Fun.
","Psycho. Maneater. Tool. They're horrible bosses, and so they must die. Obviously, right? Okay, maybe not—but we've all been there. He's the guy who makes your fresh coffee seems years older than your mother; the woman who can turn milk sour by staring at it; it's that person you hate to hate; your boss. Well, most of the time anyway. Not so much for Kurt Buckman (Jason Sudeikis) who actually has a boss he loves—until he has a heart attack and is replaced by seminal tool, Bobby Pellit (Colin Farrell), who confesses he only wants to milk his dad's company for the money to presumably feed his cocaine habit and weakness for hookers. The same can't be said for Buckman's two closest friends (played by the ever-straight Jason Bateman and the movie's clown Dale Arbus), who, for better or worse, have had to suffer under their terrible bosses for a little while longer. Bateman's character is perhaps the only one with feasible reason for wanting to murder his boss (having worked for 7 or so years with no advancement); with Arbus merely having to cope with sexual advances from his boss a tantalizing Jennifer Anniston. Aw, poor Arbus.Sure, it's a movie with a plot as thick as rice pudding, but I guess that's not the point. The point here is to make you laugh, not purely from the characters themselves, but from the absurd situations that they are placed in. For this reason, and many others, Horrible Bosses feels familiar, in both a positive and negative manner. Being bred out of the school of Apatow (though he has nothing to do with this project) and The Hangover, Seth Gordon's movie here is fine when put side to side with movie's produced within this niche sub-genre that's blossomed over the past few years, but it's never something that is going to maintain a lasting impression simply because it never strives to have its own voice. It's racy, sure. It's laugh-out-loud funny at times, yes. It's got normal guys acting ridiculous in over-the-top situations that get progressively worse, absolutely. But I saw the same thing a few weeks back—only that one had a smoking monkey, and you know who the prize is going to in that competition.Yet in going over why and how Horrible Bosses isn't as necessary to see as it perhaps should be, it goes without saying that you really can't go wrong if you're only in to laugh and perhaps be shocked a few times. Hey, it's not called Horrible Bosses without reason (though one could easily imagine a more fitting title, not penned by someone from the cast of Little House on the Prairie—seriously, it's a terrible title for such a movie.) Part of what makes the movie so fun, is in watching the fun that the movie's less obvious characters get to have in bringing to life the outrageously broad and ridiculous bosses that make these guy's lives a living hell. Aside from the strangely alluring (a first for me, at least) Anniston, there's the unrecognisable Colin Farrell in a fat suit and comb-over wig, and a scenery chewing Kevin Spacey (Buddy Ackerman, anyone?) who brings so much more to an otherwise cookie cutter script. Indeed, if not for the performances of any of the main cast, Horrible Bosses would be more than horrible, but thankfully these guys (and gals) keep it interesting and amusing start to finish. It's not going to blow you away, but it certainly won't have you groaning either. With enough sass, laughs and decent characterisation, Horrible Bosses is a fun movie to watch, but don't count on it lasting.",Null,0,0,22 July 2011
Captain America: The First Avenger," Not everyone can do a Batman.
","Watching Captain America, it's hard to believe that both the Cap and his fellow crime-fighting hero from a different universe, Batman were produced from the same era. Yet looking back, both share the same kooky, somewhat terribly written, pseudo-patriotic propaganda comic appeal that, at least for comic books' key demographic back in the day—kids—was enough to secure a healthy pay-check at the end of the month. Some sixty or seventy odd years on however, and the political landscape, and the landscape of entertainment itself, has shifted dramatically. So much so that even Batman—the same guy that starred in that super goofy TV series back in the day—has adapted himself into something of a cultural phenomenon, making himself matter once again by switching gears and adapting to that change in the way society views a hero, and in turn, what that means. It's something of great interest then to pop into a cinema hall and sit down to watch Captain America. How would, or could they adapt a guy so plainly written, and so intrinsic to the whole 1940's social paranoia and patriotism thing (and ultimately canned air without) without alienating audiences? Surely something huge would have to change—surely he's not going to have a magic boomerang shield, wear the American flag in bright red, white and blues, and shove everything righteous, holy and great about his country's ideals down our throat like its 1942 all over again? Surely not, right? Well, guess again, chump! You see, sitting down to watch Captain America is like subjecting yourself to two hours of overblown bombast with little to no resonating cues. It's a series of one-liners that fall flat on their back and a movie so into making itself look iconic that it loses all of its steam thirty minutes in. Sure, they try to justify all these pedantic details that do nothing but pander to hardcore comic fans, but in the end you get the idea that maybe Captain America isn't the kind of character you want to invest in at this stage—that not everyone can do a Batman.Taking the form of every other origin superhero story that you've seen thirty times already in the past decade, Joe Johnston's adaptation of the Cap's story is something of a blundering mess rife with heartless melodrama and harmless, neutered action. Aside from the fact that nothing happens here that some other superhero hasn't done before in many different, more interesting ways, there's just something about watching this ridiculous superhero in action that never resonates. To be fair, I guess there isn't much that Johnston could have done with Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely's lightweight, by-the-numbers script, and blame shouldn't squarely be pointed in his direction. Walking into the movie, I at least expected some decent rapport between the cardboard Chris Evans and the somewhat energising Hugo Weaving—but the very most we get from these two is something along the lines of, 'Don't you ever give up?!', to which the ever-quick witted Captain America retorts, 'Nope!' Okay, so he's not Peter Parker, sure, but can't we at least have a little more rebuttal? A little more jazz? A little more, life? Composer Alan Silvestri sure tries, but perhaps too much— punctuating all this nonsense is a bizarrely self-conscious score from 1940's hell. Fight the fight! Save your country! Drink Coca-Cola! This is a super-hero-movie-from-the-seventies score! I guess, in the end, that's the central problem I had when watching The First Avenger; just like those older Golden-Age comics, the general idea here is primarily to make money by being as safe and exploitive as possible—money doesn't require personality, and, well, how else are we going to shift all this popcorn, right? I mean, sure, the movie does have its finer points, yet much of them die alongside Stanley Tucci who plays the only character with any discernible personality traits not soaked in melodrama or silly caricature. Instead, viewers are treated to a romance as tepid as overnight coffee and action written and performed with as much vigour as one would do drinking it. It's the kind of thing that even your average soap or daytime special might do with more feeling and plausibility—indeed, much like the entirety of Cap's origin story, the very idea comes off as a perfunctory afterthought in the wake of something greater—or at least, more profitable—than itself. You see, in the vein of what is actually made watchable in this movie, the concluding ten or so minutes which foreshadow coming events in the upcoming Avengers movie provide what is arguably the only reason the preceding 110 minutes were made (though fail to justify sitting through them, unfortunately.) In the end, despite poor Steve Rogers waking up 70 years later, and despite him not having aged a day, it's a shame that the movie itself feels and looks nothing of the sort; with a character rooted in the forties and movie-making that's stuck in the nineties, Captain America: The First Avenger is a stilted, banal and disappointingly forgettable affair that fails to distinguish itself amidst much more formidable and relevant foes rendering much of the experience entirely forgettable.",Null,2,8,31 July 2011
Burn After Reading," For lovers of classic cinema and mature, edgy character comedy.
","Being the second Coen brothers' movie of this year alone, thirst for more output from them isn't necessarily at a high, yet that won't stop most audiences from getting excited. Thankfully, such excitement won't be without its foundations, as Burn After Reading, although not quite as remarkable as this year's previous effort, is just as effective at managing to deliver what it sets out to do. In stark contrast to the brothers' No Country for Old Men, this outing sees them adopting their much more familiar satirically witty tone throughout, delivering what is perhaps their most comical and sharpest movie to date. Headlined by an all-star cast, and with a multi-layered story that revolves around national security and the personalities of all involved (plus a few Gym employees), there's a rich body of ingredients to take in here, especially on a one-view basis, but while such a movie is best suited to repeat watching, it's not hard to see the raw entertainment value present first time. Hilarious, engaging and always refreshing to watch, Burn After Reading is a cinematic treat of sorts; nice and easy, focused and all about telling a good story with even better characters.As has been the case with the Coens for so many years now, the tone established throughout this feature walks the fine line of satirical comedy mixed with compelling character drama and even a few instances of thriller-orientated action. Through this tricky razor edge narrative, the brothers create a movie that amuses at its peaks but doesn't necessarily flow as fluidly as their more renowned works. Nevertheless, despite some pacing problems, from start to finish, all involved manage to nail the mesh between shtick and drama effectively enough to give you quite a few belly-laughs whilst avoiding degrading the whole experience into a ridiculous, flat-out comedy driven feature. Sure enough, the humour is dark at times, and the satire is thin, but delivered by the cast involved who in turn are portraying their own mix of off-the-wall characters, Burn after Reading does well to get you on its side right from the beginning when Malkovich walks in and begins dropping the f-bomb left, right and centre. Off-put with plenty of drama and thriller tinges, the mix is potent, and the directors do well to keep things in balance so as to keep the majority of the film consistent in tone and focus.Perhaps the single greatest element of the film and indeed, the directors themselves is their ability to bring out the best of their cast, and in turn without resorting to personas that such actors have done in the past. In fact with the odd exception of Malkovich, pretty much all of the lead stars here have roles that go against their grain so to say. George Clooney is probably the biggest example of this here, playing sleazy Harry Pfarrer with utter conviction; there are no sly smiles here that bring on the charm, these smiles have quite a bit of coldness behind them. Brad Pitt too extends himself beyond his regular cool-cat persona and portrays always-eager fitness freak dunderhead Chad Feldheimer in what is possibly the most entertaining performance throughout the feature. Frances McDormand, although regressing back somewhat to her character in Fargo, gets to have fun with eccentric, obsessive and neurotic Linda Litzke, and Malkovich a recently quit C.I.A. agent going through divorce, often finding himself sleeping at midday and drinking at night before losing his head.Sure enough all these names are enough to make any cinephile get excited, yet the result is even more arresting than imagined. Put together, the actors work tremendously and play off each other exactly as is needed to keep on the edge of that razor of thrilling drama and comedy; there are moments of sheer hilarious caricature, but these are also off-put with grounded drama that only supports these instances of comedy insomuch that we see characters getting into these situations; we laugh when they laugh and we laugh when they react a certain way, because in a sense, we know them. As such, this is Burn after Reading's real centrepiece highlight; the characters are entertaining and at the same time compelling thanks to tight, focused direction from the Coens and spot-on performances and chemistry from the highly capable cast.Sure enough, there are elements that conflict in the Coen's script that even they can't seem to work around when it gets to piecing all of their convoluted parts together. As such, pacing and momentum can dip during specific segments, particularly during the opening act. In this respect Burn after Reading distances itself from the picture-perfect flow of similarly toned Fargo, but not by much. It's a low-key effort, and a more than capable one at that, even if fans of this year's No Country for Old Men and the classic Fargo may leave the cinema a little under-whelmed. When it comes to delivering a highly enjoyable two hour ride full of laughs, thrilling plotting and refreshing characters portrayed by top-rate performers however, Burn after Reading certainly does its job. Put simply, this is good cinematic fun with plenty of intelligence behind it all to keep things interesting; for lovers of classic cinema and mature, edgy character comedy but you probably already guessed that just from reading the name Coen.<ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>",Null,4,8,17 October 2008
Watchmen," It was all a joke...
","A prevailing sense of nihilism washes over the bleak and barren landscape of Alan Moore's graphic novel, the pages lined with fragments of doubt, paranoia, anger and mistrust. It's a depiction of humanity that does not spare any dark corner from the revealing rays of sunlight, casted instead into clear vision; stark, undignified and frightening all the same. Dr. Manhattan would have us believe that we as humans reassure ourselves into thinking that we are in control through delusions of pseudo-omnipotence—a vague and callous form of collective megalomania, devoid of universal sympathy, or an ounce of concrete truth. Indeed, he asserts that rather than embrace the truths of our existence, we would prefer to shelter ourselves under blankets of frivolous distractions fit to serve us to our dying days when we finally have to come face to face with the cold bitter reality that we all mush perish. A dead body he says, isn't any different from a live one; at least, not in form; not in its molecular makeup. It's a cold, objective look at life through the lens of a cynical, and yet completely unbiased view.Watchmen, in very many ways is simply an embodiment, or elaboration on Dr. Manhattan—a twisted, contorted form, long distant from its idealistic and human ways, instead embracing an indifferent and foreboding stance. The world that Moore paints isn't pretty, no, but it's far from the pages of fiction; or at least, that overbearing sense of reality that governs its message is, and it's tangible and potent enough to go beyond mere fiction. In this regard, Watchmen exists as a rare breed of film that works just as well off the screen as it does on it—it's a film about ideas, criticisms on our own existence, and questions that beg to be answered amidst the petty babbling and double edged swords of modern semantics. Most of all however, Watchmen is a film that manages to do all this, all the while telling a unique and unforgettable tale that resonates long after the conclusions are drawn, the bombs are dropped and the orchestra begins to pack up their instruments.Without a doubt, Moore's depiction here is an Earth rooted in dystopia—if there was a God, he is nowhere to be seen now, and to a select few this was only a matter of time, even if most of the world have only just caught up to the obituary penned by Nietzsche a century earlier. But these select few, casted out years beforehand as a result of a growing disdain from the public for their seemingly threatening amount of power, The Watchmen as they were once known, no longer serve the people—in fact, most are either dead, insane, or have settled down to live as a regular Joe Hasbeen. Yet with disaster looming in the air, there is a spark somewhere off in the distance, and in that short ray of light comes a small miracle; a glimpse of hope for mankind.Behind this parody and criticism of the commonly accepted superhero mythos, Watchmen details a potent struggle of the hopeless, nihilistic revelations of world gone astray, with the idealistic, somewhat existentialistic hope of a select few with the power to make a difference. Hidden beneath the cracks of Moore's story is an allegory of morality broadened with empathy rather than prevailing omnipotence; it's about a society coming to the brinks of their deaths and then taking one last breath before the final page is slowly turned for the good or bad fortune of mankind.Make no mistake, this is a feature that doesn't suit well to casual viewings taken purely on an ostensible level; it isn't built for passively soaking in to the background ambiance of popcorn crunching and soda slurping—in fact, this is a superhero movie that isn't even about superheroes. It demands attention and patience, something which modern cinema goers have no doubt lost much of over the course of the last decade or so. The 'superheroes' of Watchmen (being no such thing in actuality) exist primarily to offer grander, more exaggerated images, and expressions of our own qualities as human beings, and with that, Moore's story becomes less about what we are watching, and more about what we are feeling.Yet for all its intellectual benefits, emotionally engaging sentiments, and breath taking visuals, it's the story at the heart of Watchmen that makes it what it is. It's a story that manages to connect not just through the intellect, but through the heart, and through the naturally questioning soul that defines us from all other life we know. That story, which defines humanity in one fleeting image after another, exists here on the big screen as relevant and moving as ever, echoing the current social climate with vivid resonance and potency. Our struggle, symbolised simply by a cute, bright-eyed smiley face smeared with a single droplet of blood, forms the redemptive tear of a misguided and squandered race trying desperately to survive against their own tragically savage nature. It's poetic but grounded and sporadically flawed, but Watchmen nevertheless succeeds in continuing the advancement of the superhero movie into a new realm of adult entertainment fit with intellectually rewarding themes and tangible characters with more to them than tight spandex, special effects and clean-cut morals.<ul><li>A (heavily cut to less than 1000 words) review by Jamie Robert Ward.

Little Miss Sunshine," Heartwarming and Original Comedy.
","Little Miss Sunshine is a wonderfully made film that is unique comical and sentimental to the viewer's heart.Perhaps the greatest thing about the movie is its characters that are all developed into fully realistic dynamic people who by the end of the film you feel connected to and care about their eventual outcome. Both the script and the actors collaborate successfully from beginning to end, creating characters that will stay with you for some time, but more importantly will keep your eyes glued to the screen during the film itself.The film's soundtrack is mostly well mixed into the film but there unfortunately were a few moments where it distracted from the film and didn't gel well with the action on screen. As a whole however, the film boasts a great soundtrack and suitably bright photography that brings the story to the senses nicely and with vivid effect.If there is one problem I had with the film it was its central plot. Don't get me wrong, I loved each character's own subplots, but I felt the main feature -although well developed- was a little dry and needed a little more to it in order to bond together with the individual character's stories more successfully. On the other hand, the lack of plot did help bring out character's and allowed a good sense of pace consistent throughout, even if it was a little on the slow side.Overall, Little Miss Sunshine is a great watch and certainly surprised me on many fronts. I can't say it met my expectations regarding all the praise it is has had from critics, but it was an enjoyable ride for what it was worth.",Null,1,3,7 October 2007
Knowing," Do the numbers add up? Well, no, they really don't.
","Teetering between genuinely thought-provoking science-fiction and largely innocuous disaster movie pomp and circumstance, Knowing, which comes from director Alex Proyas (The Crow and I, Robot) is an irksome and mostly disjointed affair. Dealing with characters, situations and plot lines that go a little beyond the usual scope of cinema while offering viewers an experience with the potential to thrill and surprise, this outing for Proyas inevitably crumbles under the weight of its own ambition which is disappointing. Indeed, while the script for the most part portrays its lead character in shades of sheer lunacy and insanity, the movie as a whole can be seen as being just as schizophrenic, if not more-so. It's indulgent, overlong and padded to the brim with needless contrivances, puzzling u-turns and banal digressions that have little or nothing to do with the central theme at hand. The result is a feature that sporadically entertains and even raises interesting questions and ideas from time to time, yet too often falls victim to its own verbose, directionless prophecy babble to the extent where all focus and engagement is lost. Knowing certainly has potential, and this is evident in several startling scenes visceral and sensual, but such potential is never truly tapped or expanded upon. So the viewer is left to squander amongst the ruins of half-finished ideas, disjointed themes and a lacklustre, unconvincing narrative that binds it all together with a sense of bemusement at everything that transpires—sure, it's pretty unnerving and it's definitely got a sense of audacity about it that Nicholas Cage seems to seep out of everything he touches these days, but as a whole is it any good? Do the numbers add up? Well, no, they really don't.For all intents and purposes, despite the movie's attempts to fool the viewer during the first two acts, Knowing is first and foremost a disaster movie. Taking place in our current day, some six months down the line after a astrophysicist named John (Nicholas Cage) comes into possession of a series of numbers written down and placed in a time capsule by a crazy kid fifty years prior which predict disasters from that date onwards, Knowing is a disaster movie in every sense. What perhaps could have made the feature a little more convincing and interesting on a visceral or cerebral level however was if it spent as much time expanding upon the ideas of determinism, causality and the eventual allegorical outcome that permeates the whole of the film in retrospect. Instead however, much of the movie resorts to mundane fabrications set up for the sake of giving the audience those big disaster movie CG shots—train wrecks, plane crashes, you know what the deal is. To be fair, Knowing pulls off these moments as good as anything else out there today, but in the end they all feel like inconsequential distractions or derailments from what the script is really trying to say.Taking the theme of predestination and running with it to the extent where Stan Lee's infamous 'with great power comes great responsibility' came running through my head, the character of John reveals why Nicholas Cage was picked for the job. For the better part of the middle section, John takes it upon himself to try and solve this mystery of numbers predicting dates, numbers of people dead and locations in order to prevent the inevitable. At one point he even estimates that had he been granted this 'window into the future' sooner, he could have prevented his wife's death (and in turn also killed one of the movie's biggest clichés next to the distant family, lone, gifted son and the mysterious Strangers in the Woods) without giving one second of thought to the complete stupidity of such a concept and irrevocable implications involved with determinism that he flaunts so glibly during the movie's opening act. Sure, you can't blame a guy for getting a little crazy when faced with a possible End-of-the-World scenario, but at the same time you also have to seriously question the plausibility to all that goes on in the twisted world of Knowing when it so obviously and excessively wants you to believe in its tale.The problem however, is that the script is a meandering mess devoid of any sense of compelling pace, or interesting elaboration on anything that it raises in the wreckage that it so ceaselessly creates. The resulting world isn't one that feels like ours, and so the whole disaster element of the movie feels contrived and irrelevant. Furthermore, there isn't much else to say for the ensemble of performances here outside of the fact that they downright stink. Cage, who to be fair isn't known for his humanist shades, is wooden and largely uninteresting as the movie's protagonist-trying-to-save-the-day-whilst-being-a-single-dad cutout. His co-stars are just as blasé and awkward, echoing last year's similar—but much more effective and stylistically distant—disaster romp The Happening in a way that only goes to further the movie's schizophrenic, somewhat alien nature. So in the end we come down to the most tired and truest of cinematic criticisms—if I can't relate to these people, if I can't believe in their plight then what else do I have but some nice looking photographs and a loose form of narrative tying it all together? For some, this will be enough. The fact that the movie takes the whole disaster thing and runs with it to the very end in a coherent fashion is one of the only saving graces here, yet science fiction fans and people just a little tired of these overlong, over-produced distractions will find no real joy here.<ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>",Null,1,3,22 September 2009
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa," Fun, yes, but largely unremarkable all the same.
","There are movies that, to be fair, never quite do anything remotely significant or innovative; they lack purpose for their existence. When it comes to sequels, this factor comes into play even more so. Madagascar 2 by all means shouldn't have been made for any other reason other than that which gave it life in the first place. To be frank, there was no real reason for it to be made outside the fact that the first movie, although routinely mediocre, at least pulled in the green. Yet much like its predecessor, this second, mostly superfluous entry into the animated movie you never thought would turn into a franchise 2 years ago, at least has some intelligent and heart-felt design to back up its pointless endeavours. Fans of the original movie will love it; all the characters are back, and the humour remains in the same vein as instalment one, but even such customers will leave feeling a little underwhelmed by what is achieved here. Its fluffy entertainment aimed at families for holiday viewing, and in all honesty that is all it amounts to; fun, yes, but largely unremarkable all the same.This time around, the story attempts to fill in gaps from before the first movie, and then continue on from where that one left off. Leaving Madagascar in a dodgy, penguin-manned airplane, the four best friends fly off into the sunset hoping that they reach the U.S.A. once more. Such is the consequence of trusting a penguin however; all aboard soon find themselves in Africa after a very funny crash landing. From here on the movie branches off into numerous plot lines, some being larger than others. The most dominant of these centers around Alex once more as he finds out he has long lost relatives in his native land. Struggling to fit in with his more traditional friends and family, Alex is soon alienated from those around him in a touching and emotive manner.If there is one major fault with Escape 2 Africa's strict however, it's that it relies far too heavily on this type of melodrama to pull its story along. There's a fair amount of humor too, but I often found myself sulking in my seat rather than chuckling. Is this a bad thing? For Madagascar, yes. This imbalance towards drawing out tears means that the writers must invest more in drama and character, which this movie simply does not have enough of. That's not to say that such moments aren't welcome, because they are, but there's just too much here to keep things evenly entertaining.A much greater and well constructed element of Escape 2 Africa is its structure and sense of pacing in each individual plot line. Of course, much of these clash towards the climax of the movie, and the result is satisfying and well choreographed to blend together. Without bogging down the feature with weighty exposition and mundane setup, the writers manage to tie all the elements together in ways that feel natural to the story and characters; there were times where I was genuinely surprised to find minute details from earlier scenes playing larger parts in later ones; not only is it clever, but it serves the direction of the movie well and keeps things moving at a decent pace. I'm rarely one to be caught off guard by such a movie, but Madagascar 2 did it quite a few times.Visually and aurally, Escape 2 Africa is impressive insofar as most animated movies go. In terms of animation quality and design, the movie pulls out all the stops in making this one grander and more visually entertaining than the first. Character animations are crisp and full of life with backdrops and environments being just as, if not even more interesting to gaze upon. The performances from the central cast also bring with them an extra dimension of life; for the most part, this is strictly sequel material, and all actors stick to their roles as closely as they did for the first, but that's not entirely a bad thing. A common misstep with such features is that the voice actors feel distant and uninvolved with their animated selves, but such is not the case here with many often being echoed in the mannerisms of their animals in many humorous ways.So yes, there's no denying that Madagascar 2 is a pretty film, but is it one of substance? To some degree, yes, it is, but only in respect to the average animated fare. With the evolution and ever growing maturity of the genre however, one has to wonder whether Escape 2 Africa is anything new or refreshing. To be fair, there's a good mix of everything here from drawing out the laughs from children and adults to making them both feel a little something too -which is no small task-, so it at least provides it primary functions. Yet despite its pleasing design and well constructed façade, there nevertheless remains the irrevocable fact that much of what takes place here feels perfunctory for the sake of simply making another unnecessary movie. In that vein, Madagascar 2 loses some value, but not much. Fans of the original movie, plus those looking for a bit of family fluff for the holidays could do much worse than what is present here; Escape 2 Africa is fun and has its heart in the right place, even if it is all a little indistinguishable from its brethren at the end of the day.<ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>",Null,3,7,24 December 2008
Monsters vs. Aliens," A banal and flat affair.
","Every once in a while, a children's animated film will come out that is tailored towards children, and yet written from an adult frame of mind—like the best works of Roald Dahl, such works usually incorporate both the younger and older audiences into their respective appeal. More often than not however, the animation genre is one flooded with tired clichés, dry, disconnected vocal performances and mundane writing fit only for the minds of those unaccustomed to the more substantive forms of entertainment. It's the kind of writing that is not only targeted at children, but consistently feels like it was written by them; unsurprisingly, the little ones will get some kick out of it all, but for everyone else (and I include some of the more discerning of children in this exception), Monsters Vs. Aliens will instead only mildly distract with its pretty pictures and sporadically amusing farce.What's most surprising about the extremely derivative writing present within the movie's script however, is that it comes directly from chaps involved with quite a few of the genre's most enjoyable and original outings. Yet constantly burdened with lame plotting, contrived moments of three-dimensional dazzle, and jokes that grow calluses on their proverbial faces after the first act, Monsters Vs. Aliens is a remarkably dumb, forgettable affair that is sure to induce more yawns than laughter. Of course, it's rather unfair to judge a children's movie purely on an adult perspective, and so I must concede that younger viewers will inevitably enjoy the experience quite a bit more than adult counterparts; but not by much.You see, part of what makes a good animated film the nice breath of fresh air for adults, and the sweet piece of candy it is for children, is usually reliant upon one thing; the characters. It's disappointing then that Monsters Vs. Aliens lacks any definable, or memorable personas within its ensemble. Sure enough, there's B.O.B., the gelatinous blue blob who inherits Seth Rogen's signature dumb-ass laugh (which still isn't getting old, believe it or not), and even a surprising addition of Stephen Colbert as an obnoxious United States President (go figure), but even these two mildly amusing additions never truly come off the screen. Not only is it frustrating to be forced to artificially root for a protagonist we're never really given a chance to care about (that's Susan by the way, played by a bland Reese Witherspoon), but there is also a distinct lack of comic relief to the whole thing—in fact, the best parts to Monsters Vs. Aliens aside from Colbert's brief appearances, are all the cool space shots and action sequences.This of course, brings us to the primary reason many people will be seeing the feature in the first place; the 3D. As a separate medium, or movement on its own, the three-dimensional movie has yet to truly take off, but with frequent glimpses into what the technology can do over the past few years (and with many in line for this year alone), there's no denying that those images at least do tend to take the breath away. Seen through comfortable glasses, Monsters Vs. Aliens can be a wonderful treat for the eyes. There's the beautiful exterior shots, and the close-quarters actions sequences which all flow terrifically and jump out at you in ways that aren't always contrived for the sake of milking the technology. Yet for the good that it does for the movie's aesthetic appeal however, the overall impression is that without such an artificial distraction, Monsters Vs. Aliens would be a banal and flat affair.The problem is that despite the awe-inducing animation and sometimes amusing performances, the majority of the feature is actually devoid of any life. The story, which I have neglected to give a synopsis of, simply because I have deemed it largely unnecessary (okay, so aliens come to take over Earth, and monsters have to stop them), is so predictable and formulated that it will literally take a child who has seen no more than five movies to not see everything that's coming. Furthermore, there's also the complete lack of character, humour and heart that are key to delivering an enjoyable and memorable experience fit for both the children, and the adults who have accompanied them. Children will find B.O.B. funny, and they will laugh whenever his buddy Missing Link (Will Arnett) bangs his head on something, but that's about it—ask them who their favourite character was and they'll probably just say 'the blue guy'. Why? Because he's silly and brainless, much like the script in which he resides; and yet he is the highlight of the feature so what does that say? - A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)",Null,4,10,3 April 2009
Being John Malkovich," Witty Satire
","How would I describe Being John Malcovich? Strangely normal. However, given the same question regarding Jonze and Kaufman's work, I'd say the exact same thing. Having only just seen the film for a second time this evening I can't say that I fully understand the movie at this point but nevertheless can appreciate the work as a piece of film rather than interpretive art.I enjoyed almost everything about the film from its surreal plot, its dark humour and its gorgeous photography. The actors also give absolutely wonderful performances, injecting unforgettable energy into their characters, brining them to life effectively throughout. Perhaps what works best in the film's advantage is its originality and imagination, which combine right from the beginning to create a world that always feels familiar yet also remains fantastical.The only real problem I have with the film is its sometimes slow pace that gets the story caught up in unimportant scenes with little importance. Fortunately however, Being John Malcovich for the majority of the time, never lets the attention go and will have you in its grasp long after it ends.",9,1,2,22 October 2007
Face_Off," Escapist entertainment at its purist.
","Out of all the movie genres available today, none please me more when pulled off correctly than the too often lame and castrated action movie. Face/Off, a feature that knows action and pulls it off eloquently, does more to get the adrenaline pumping than most of the genre's more standard fare, and while it certainly doesn't do much if anything- remarkably new, there's enough done extremely well to satisfy anyone's thirst for stylised, balls-to-the-wall action. It also represents peaks in both lead stars careers, which both have arguably failed to revisit upon subsequent tours of the genre; sure it's not Shakespeare and it's not Oscar nominee material, but that's all part of Woo's otherworldly charm here. Face/Off is more science-fiction than drama, but with a healthy dose of intellectually informed subtext and some brilliant character dynamics, the movie manages to grip from beginning to end, providing a healthy dose of escapist entertainment at its purist.Telling the undeniably hammy story of Sean Archer and Caster Troy two arch nemesis types on the opposite ends of the law- where both end up swapping faces and in turn identities, Face/Off at base level is certainly cut from the same cloth as The Wizard of Oz in terms of its fantastic nature, but that doesn't mean that it loses its value as entertainment; rather, it reinforces it. Of course this is a story that seems perfect for your average sixties Star Trek episode, but again, that is all part of the charm. Not only is the premise an interesting one in itself, but Woo and his writers capitalise fully on the setup consistently, playing out the dynamics of the two characters' convoluted predicament with some juicy focus on character and the dualism of good and evil. It's the kind of movie that has to be taken further through the mind than face value, because, while Woo does well to give his movie a nice, comfortable balance between fantasy and reality, it's the ideas and nuances of this shift in character and themes that gives the movie its edge.To say that Face/Off exists as a fine testament to both Travolta and Cage's skills as actors would be something of an understatement. To be sure, both play as Woo's puppets in his exaggerated, over the top world where people accentuate their shadings of black or white, but they do it so well that the caricature style becomes one with the movie itself. Furthermore, the dynamics that are involved here, from switching between personalities and in effect playing each other, the actors are given work here that extents far beyond the asking price of your average action thriller. As a duo, the two work well together as well as on their own; from the snarly façade of Castor Troy to the tormented psyche of Sean Archer, both actors embody both personalities as best as they can and often give life to moments that would easy to be glossed over if not played through Woo's absurdly glamorized and in turn engrossing style.But let's not fall under any pretence here; Face/Off is first and foremost, an action movie. Yes, there are some great characters, touching drama and intellectually rewarding themes on dualism and metaphysical questions on personality and psychology, but all of this is given the bench to what Woo has arguably always been best at. This direct focus on huge, ridiculously potent action full to the brim with explosions, gunfire, violence and people flying through the air, forms what is quite possibly all that is best about the Hollywood action movie. With a distinct lack of shaky-cam syndrome and a larger desire to show how grand his images are, Woo delivers a visual and aural spectacle which is best to be taken on pure entertainment terms. One can easily point holes in nearly every aspect of the movie's plot, character and action, but it's hard to be so cynical when you're given masterfully executed shots that put so many other so-called action movies to shame.When it comes to speaking for the action genre, one can't remain positive without thinking of how bloated and derivative it has become over the recent years. Yet looking back almost decade and watching Face/Off, it's somewhat uplifting to see that many years after its inception, there's still people out there capable of delivering the no-frills, no-nonsense excitement that made the genre such a formidable audience pleaser in the first place. Yes, this is by no means a cinematic classic, but its one of those movies that will likely be kept alongside such movies as Die Hard and Con Air, ready to be watched time and time again just for the sheer fun of it. Cinema, as much as it would like to deceive us, rarely does manage to deliver the true essence of fun; Face/Off is an excellent reminder that such movies don't always have to end up being mundane and formulaic.<ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>",Null,1,1,22 December 2008
Tropic Thunder," A successful but not entirely memorable production.
","The all-star cast comedy has become somewhat of a relic over the past decade, and yet despite the reasons for this dwindling output, it would seem that Tropic Thunder, long-lost brainchild of lead star Ben Stiller, in turn adopts both the positives and negatives of such movies. Featuring a wide array of talents and styles, as well as an explosive mix of action, comedy, satire and ironic drama, Stiller has done well to create an extremely silly, but strangely effective comedy blockbuster of sorts that, well, rocks. However, too many cooks it is said, spoils the broth, and that's more than evident here. Spending too much time driving the plot forward rather than devoting much needed time to each of the main characters, Tropic Thunder feels stunted and rather disappointing in regards to the opportunity that it had at its feet. Although we have an array of talented actors, who all give wonderfully original performances of their own, nobody sticks out and all feel underused. Despite this major misstep in the writing process however, the majority of the feature remains entertaining, thrilling and fun to watch; given a little extra padding and depth (not to mention a little more Coogan) to pad out the flamboyant story, Stiller could have created a stellar piece of comedy, but instead ends with a successful but not entirely memorable production.Taking place mostly in the woodlands of Vietnam, just outside of a movie-set in which four big-name stars are shooting an epic war movie, Tropic Thunder tells the story of how these four actors end up in a hilarious battle for their lives that some believe is all part of the movie they are shooting. At its core, the satirical edge of Stiller's script isn't subtle; poking fun at Hollywood throughout the entire proceedings, watching Tropic Thunder is essentially a two hour tour-de-irony in which the movie industry is taken as lightly as can be. From the pampered movie stars to the passively aggressive producers and inept, meek director, there's hardly a stone left unturned here, and there's plenty to laugh at if you love and in turn love to laugh at the industry. This is not to say that there isn't a story present here; weary of their uncertain predicament, the actors turned soldiers find themselves on the end of gunfire and conflict not just from local druglords, but from within their own group. Driven by ego, the big shot actors don't necessarily enjoy each others company, and as such some of the movie's most comical moments occur when this rivalry boils to the brink. There's never anything remotely shocking or new present here, but it's evenly paced and of decent enough quality to satisfy any need for silly entertainment.Although the plotting and thick crust of satire is potent however, the sense of character and the personalities which deliver all the moments of conflict and irony aren't quite as well rounded. Being portrayed by a fine cast of actors, who incidentally are playing actors, the main cast are great to watch interact with each other, yet their own individual selves are never given any real moments to truly shine. As a whole, each of the individuals feels more like a gimmicky façade; a caricature that never gets to play around with what makes him inherently comical or interesting. Sure enough each character has his own thing, and each gets to play with it a couple of times, but in attempting to focus on all five leads plus a few extras, Stiller too often neglects his palette and forgets to take advantage of what he has in front of him. Nevertheless, on pure face value, Tropic Thunder can at least be said to have some naturally amusing caricature characters; Black is Black as overweight crack-addict gross-out comedy star Jeff Portnoy; Stiller is Stiller as cocky and obnoxious action-hero star Tugg Speedman; and Downey Jr. is perhaps the most entertaining as Oscar-monger Kirk Lazarus who went as far as to change the pigment of his skin to fit his role for the shoot.With supporting members such as Steve Coogan, Brandon T. Jackson and an almost unrecognisable Tom Cruise, the mix of Hollywood names here is potent enough to dispel the sour taste left by the underwritten nature of their respective characters. In the end however you get the feeling that all of this could have merely been a small piece of a much larger pie; Tropic Thunder is loud, dumb and indulgently ironic, plus it has enough big names to pull in the audiences, yet it also feels a little underwhelming. Such is the problem with all-star cast movies in general, if it's not the severe imbalance of pace and characterisation against plotting that a director may have trouble with then it's the hype that is garnered prior to the screening. To be fair, all involved do a brilliant job here, and the performances are lively enough to sustain the script's sometimes lumbering pace, yet lacking somewhat in the rich characterisation that such a film requires in order to satisfy, Tropic Thunder isn't quite as impressive as it could have been. Regardless of its flaws however, there is no denying the simple entertainment value inherent in the movie; fun, abrasive and downright hilarious on quite a few occasions, Tropic Thunder may not be the best comedy of the year, but it's certainly worthy of your attention.<ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>",Null,1,4,6 October 2008
The Duchess," Too hard to get into, and all too easy to walk out of.
","The period drama never has been a genre that has offered cinema attendees high octane thrills and pacing, instead opting for a much more subdued, elegant formula to tell whatever historically placed story it may be willing to explore. To say that much of the genre as a result is usually unfairly deemed as dry to the point of uselessness would be somewhat of an understatement; in fact the vast majority of such films, although slow and exceedingly dry, usually make up for their blandness in story with well rounded, memorable and exciting characters. The Duchess however, is not one of these films. No, this is dry turkey with an ostensible glaze created by superficial juice. Going through the motions at every turn, director Saul Dibb fails to create anything worth noting here; it's an extremely straight-forward, standardised period drama with little to no interesting characters whatsoever. So not only do you have to sit through a soap opera plot that feels about as fresh and exciting as seeing Keira Knightley in another period costume, but you have to do so with inane personas that never do anything but pamper about in their big mansions, shouting at their servants. Dull, dreary and utterly disposable, The Duchess is as boring as the genre gets, and while there are some good elements present, they fail to mesh coherently to disguise the fact that the script has no intrinsic value inherent in its thin, formulaic design.To discuss the premise of the movie is almost futile; if you have seen any movies from the genre, you have pretty much seen The Duchess. Revolving around yet another privileged woman who in turn marries a man of prestige and obviously finds out he is interested in her only for the chance to birth an heir, the twists and turns that take place here are stunted and all too obvious. Throw in the ambitious dreamer that whisks the duchess to her dream fantasy land where the sex is just so much better because, well, he's rugged and a little more emotionally viable, and you can see that not much out of the ordinary is set to take place over the next couple of hours. At this point in discussing the story I would normally diverge onto something that works a little better, and yet I can find no opposing tangent to bring up here. Aside from the happy error of making the film's quietened antagonist more empathetic and compelling than the lead woman, The Duchess is straight forward, no risks involved, period drama; all the staples are here and yet never before have they all felt so lifeless, tired and irrelevant.Indeed, in order for such a film to work, one must bridge the massive gap that separates the culture of today with that on the screen. Many of the most memorable movies residing within the genre have managed to do this, but The Duchess never does. Sure enough, the script does well to put character and themes of love and regret in the forefront of focus in order to tell a story of humanity rather than history, yet in direct contrast with this year's much more engaging The Other Boleyn Girl, this outing feels emotionally mundane. Lead actress Keira Knightley is no stranger to these types of features, but unfortunately her whole performance this time feels perfunctory and useless; her character is ruled by emotion to that the point that she is perceived as weak and without reasoning. When you have a central character who asks for sympathy in every scene without doing anything to warrant such a thing, you have a troublesome predicament. As a personality The Duchess of Devonshire is banal and the antithesis of compelling. She never surprises and shows less personality than in her ridiculously fake beauty spot that she sports in one scene. During this sequence I was enraptured by this giant obstruction on Keira's face, and then I remembered where I was. To scream irony at this point would have been befitting.To be sure, there are audiences out there who will eat up this sort of thing for what it is; cheap, seen-it-all-before drama that demands little and offers not much more in exchange. Behind me sat two older women, both of whom I deemed aficionados of the genre going by their hoots and wails during certain scenes that tickled their fancy. Sure enough, I would guess that they at least were entertained, yet I was not. Again, I blame culture difference. And yet with major worldwide successes this year from the likes of Iron Man, Indiana Jones and Batman, one wonders if the period drama will ever manage to draw in the demographic that such movies have thus far managed to do. Going by The Duchess however, which prompts one to believe that things are only getting worse for a genre that is by now churning out the same story time and time again, this potentiality seems unlikely. Perhaps if the historical setting and themes present here were delivered with more poignancy and an overall conviction or sense of modern relevancy, The Duchess could have at least dispelled my apathy towards the genre by the likes of The Other Boleyn Girl. Unfortunately this is not the case; esoteric and emotionally stunted, this movie is too hard to get into, and all too easy to walk out of; only for those who haven't seen a period drama in the last five years.<ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>",Null,17,36,8 October 2008
Quantum of Solace," A James Bond movie for James Bond fans.
","They say that old dogs can't learn new tricks, and although there are registers of people who are fine and dandy with their old pets and their old, familiar tricks (such audiences will be those who also disagree with the latest live action Indiana Jones and Star Wars features); for those who crave innovation, new ideas and refreshing scenery, the idea of revisiting something from a slightly different angle fails to get the senses aroused. The James Bond series has been with cinema goers for decades now, spawning movies well into the double digit territory, and yet despite having years to refine, adjust and possibly evolve, little has actually happened since Bond's first outing. Sure enough the explosions have gotten grander, the series has taken on a notoriously darker tone with each rendition, and our own sense of nostalgic comfort when going into a screen and watching the newest offering has grown with each release; yet despite all of this, the actual advancement that matters that of story, continuity and characterisation- has often taken a back seat in all the high-speed car chases Bond finds himself in.Quantum of Solace, the latest offering for Bond fanatics is everything that the series has so far established itself to be, offering all the action, cars, women and gadgets that one could expect. The biggest problem with this however is that it all feels rather inconsequential and perfunctory. This isn't necessarily Bond's greatest two hours; it's simply just another story. Following on directly from the box office hit Casino Royale, the story here is similar but far less dramatised than it was a couple of years ago. With a much larger focus on action, blood-thirsty revenge and getting rid of corrupt antagonists, Quantum of Solace is a high-octane, thrilling experience, and as such requires minimal input from the viewer. Such an alignment will be sure to please those looking for exactly that; another no-frills Bond story. If however, you are possibly seeking more; more character, more personality, more drama, then this isn't going to be the most thrilling of rides, in spite of all the bullets whizzing by your ears.Nevertheless if action is your game then you'll certainly be at home here. With countless sequences which range from cars, boats, aeroplanes and rooftops, director Marc Forster takes Martin Campbell's sense of fast-paced, relentless and convoluted action and takes it up a level, delivering plenty of explosions and moments of sensory awe to take you aback. The problem here however is that despite Forster's unprecedented talent for crafting interesting, well sequenced sequences of action, he nevertheless can't find a way to transition in between these segments and the straighter forward, dramatic ones, leading to a disjointed feeling of repetitiveness inherent in the film's structure. Essentially consisting of ten minutes of dialogue followed by another ten of stunts throughout, Quantum of Solace certainly packs a punch, and moves at an entertaining pace, but you also get the feeling that too much is done here and in too little time; it's amusing sure, but it certainly isn't as engaging as it could be.The movie's sense of progression as I have stated, is obviously stunted here; characterisation follows the same basic flow of the previous movie as Bond goes on his own path regardless of what M suggests, even to the point of being charged with murder. As far as character goes, this is nothing the most casual of watchers will be surprised with. If Quantum does one thing remotely correct in this department however it is in the latest villain of the series, Dominic Greene played by a smarmy Mathieu Amalric. While his character is notably underdeveloped and frustratingly cut off from his nemesis, Greene is nevertheless compelling enough to root against, and takes on a tone that sees him as a threat, but only because of his power. Amalric is picture perfect here, hitting all the right notes and pressing enough buttons to keep his character ominous without resorting to cheap cliché or caricature. Both he and Daniel Craig obviously steal the show, but what's disappointing is that they hardly get any time together. There is promise in their sense of conflict which inevitably boils out near the end, but a distinct lack of focus on their personal pasts, and an exploration of such hurts the final payoff; it's satisfying but doesn't resonate as much as it should.Much like I reiterated throughout my review of the latest Saw movie however, whether or not you get the most out of Quantum of Solace or not solely rests upon whether you have enjoyed those that have come before. While this rendition of Bond is certainly a lot more willing to please the general audience than the Saw series, those who crave the action that comes along with the name should be pleased most with what is offered here. With a distinctive lack of development and momentum in terms of characterisation and story though, this latest instalment sees Bond get a little slower, despite all the running he does. For casual audiences this won't serve as much of a problem (this is popcorn material after all) but for those looking for a little bit more, I would suggest leaving such hopes at the door. Essentially a James Bond movie for James Bond fans, Quantum of Solace is simply another taste of a long-time favourite dish. With enough action, girls, corrupt villains, weapons, stunts, explosions and vehicles moving at tremendous speeds, James Bond is back, and he's still not taking any names; just don't expect him, or anyone else to open up after all, he is a secret agent.<ul><li>Written by Jamie Robert Ward (http://ww.invocus.net)</li></ul>",Null,3,9,31 October 2008
District 9," Humanity?
","What do we mean when we refer to our humanity as a virtue? When criminals, races, societies or anyone remotely different from the cultural norm are deemed 'inhumane' in their thoughts, actions or behaviours, we see them as monsters and entities quite separate from us—they are them, and we are us, and to the grand majority of those pointing fingers and segregating the minority this is human. In the world of District 9 then, which occupies a reality where extra-terrestrial beings (colloquially known as 'prawns' because of their resemblance) have been habiting the Earth for close to 20 years in slums devised to keep them alive—if only barely and out of the way of the general human populace—this black and white cross-sectioning of what is human and what is alien becomes a literal source of conflict.Like all great science-fiction, the heart of this story is not the ostensible plot lines involving devices like alien weaponry, government cover-ups or the aliens themselves rendered in masterful CG, but rather that allegorical subtext that drives the whole thing home. Sure enough, the aforementioned aspects are just as cohesive and compelling as that very substance that lies underneath and certainly shouldn't be ignored—but after countless 'science-fiction' movies of the past decade merely concerned with cool effects and other-worldly exploit for the sake of it, it's the intelligence that subsides within the channels of District 9's subversive tale that defines it as its own work and brings it intro largely unexplored territory.So what does it mean to be human? Many would claim that it's to have compassion, to be consciously driven by thought and free-will rather than impulses or reptilian habits of our less evolved ancestors. No matter how you look at it through the lens of District 9 however, there's a notable lack of such qualities in much of the movie's scenes involving us. Instead, there's a predominant sense of the opposite; of the barbaric, unfeeling, somewhat logical and cold side of our overwhelming naivety and obnoxious pride as a species; fearing becoming one of them, but at the same time wanting the greater parts of those we alienate (some going to more drastic means than others), humanity finds itself defending an empty shell of a concept.This in turn, brings us to the protagonist of District 9's story, who comes in the form of Wikus Merwe, a representative and paper-pusher of an agency that deals with all alien affairs. Wikus is neither a good-guy or a bad-guy, he's just a guy. In the initial stages of the feature, the man is painted to a bit of a meek bureaucrat who takes no pleasure in killing the 'prawns' akin to the battalion of hot-headed soldiers that looks after him on away missions, but certainly isn't one to question the morality of his job either which involves keeping the aliens under control through any means possible. As the movie progresses however and Wikus becomes more and more entwined within the fabric of the alien plight, his character takes on a startling transformation that is powerfully done, but not overly so. In this vein, District 9 rather rapidly tilts towards the action-survival side of things, and it's so expertly done that you really question when a movie made you feel this engaged and enthralled at the same time.Much of the success of this character however has very little to do with all the social commentary, subtexts, plot-developments and special effects but rather through the tremendous performance by Sharlto Copley. Let it be known that this isn't a performance likely to be considered for an Oscar Nomination in that it doesn't demand intricacies and subtleties so lauded by the Academy, but instead asks for something completely human and so damn convincing that you feel this man's pain and the horror that he goes through; you believe in the entire world of District 9 because in more ways than one, he is essentially the sole heart of the movie that beats with any sort of resemblance to what we term humanity.So what about the action? Well thankfully, I make claim without qualm that not only is the movie one of the smartest sci-fi movies to come out in recent years, but I can also testify that it's certainly amongst the biggest, loudest and most downright good-looking too. The action, which is saved mostly for the final act is riveting—the effects, never dominating the screen or drawing attention to themselves in an adverse fashion, work in ways that only the best of movies that employ them do so. There's explosions, futuristic weaponry, giant mechanoids, but most pleasing of all is that the aliens themselves look absolutely convincing and utterly fantastic in their animation and rendering details. Make no mistake; this one's smart and pretty.So just what does this awkward mix of brains and brawn mean exactly? Well, it means you have one very compelling movie worthy of some serious praise and recognition. You see, only very rarely does this clashing of art, idea and cinematic excitement come together so eloquently and natural that you're simultaneously engaged in this fantastical world so far beyond your own imagination but at the same time brought crashing home to your own through use of allegory. This mixture gives District 9 its central motif of sorts in that with the prerequisite composition of humanity itself comes the good, the bad, and you guessed it, the ugly. Embodying this theme not just in subtext, but through the use of survival-action which brings out such shades of human nature explicitly, District 9 is undoubtedly a science-fiction masterpiece sure to be revered long after it closes on box offices and enters the pages of cinematic history. It's got adrenaline, but it's got heart and head too—the foundations of our humanity, and therefore the very foundations of film itself.<ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>",Null,3,7,4 September 2009
Batman Begins," A Promising Start.
","If there's one superhero figure out there who has been tossed around and re-imagined just as much as ever-so bloated Superman it's his fellow DC Comics star Batman. From his original dark conception in the forties on paper, to his campy popularity surge in the sixties with Adam West, the bat-man is a figure that has been a consistently present in American pop culture. As is usually the case with franchises however, such popularity usually gets the better of the product, quality declines and years will go by with little to no interest in what was once in such demand. Such has been the case with Batman, and up until 2005, the superhero had been on the backburner for a good eight years. Enter Batman Begins, Christopher Nolan's much anticipated re-imagining of countless other re-imaginings, and from the opening scene it's evident that Batman may just finally be getting the respect he deserves as a formidable and mature superhero; his audiences have grown older and so has he. By no means is the movie the classic it could have been, but it's a fine effort nevertheless and delivers a compelling and welcome look back at how it all began for the dark knight.The story rather suitably starts at the very beginning, detailing the rise of Batman and the fall of Bruce Wayne. Thankfully Nolan devotes the majority of the focus of Begins on such development; crafting a protagonist that is strong of will, but doesn't always have things going his way. There's plenty of the grit and the darkness that played such a major role in the establishment of the comic book's character, and while at times as Scarecrow states- the film can take itself just a little too seriously for its own good, the consistency and strength that resides within the ominous tone is fitting in order to fulfil the main character's motivations. Still fuelled by the resentment and guilt over his parent's death as a young boy, Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) seeks to rid the city of Gotham of its criminal infestation by injecting fear into those who pray upon the fearful. Through this exposition we are treated to significantly more detail and important characterisation than cinema audiences have thus far only been thrown in sporadic scraps in between all the campy action in previous instalments. To be sure, Begins is most reminiscent of the original Batman directed by Tim Burton in its murky, cynical viewpoint of criminal justice and moral ambiguity, but the key advantage that Nolan has over Burton here is a much more solid script with plenty more character to invest in. This is why, acts one and two are the movie's key parts, where focus is primarily on these characters and their relationships not only to each other but to their personal anxieties and conflicts.All this extra padding makes for some interesting and at times, utterly compelling drama that involves suspense and action. Unfortunately however, a distinct lack of focus in the antagonists' lair and a throwaway, tedious romantic subplot hinder complete engagement with the feature. As villains, Tom Wilkonson, Liam Neeson and Cillian Murphey are a little too blasé, and put far too back into the mixture of things to be as threatening as the director seems to presume they are. In contrast to the brilliant, multi-textured relationship between Wayne and butler Alfred (Michael Caine), and even the downplayed, rather short-lived rivalry between Wayne and his parent's killer (which carries the greatest amount of emotional resonance within the film), the chemistry and hero/villain conflict here is perfunctory and little more than merely satisfactory. As a unit, the villains fulfil their roles as sources of personal torment for the bat-man, but only according to how the rules state they should be; there are no original, memorable qualities outside of Murphey's sometimes zany psychosis, and the sense of threat is limited to formula and plot only. As for the romantic interest that resides within childhood friend Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes), the chemistry is even worse here, and Nolan once again shows that he is all dazzle when it comes to character's inner struggles, but shows very little skills in the ways of producing outward relations that touch the heart as much as they should.It's of no surprise then that the final act of the movie, which focuses largely on delivering the explosions that most of the budget goes to pay for, is notably (and ironically) dim in comparison. The action is fine and dandy sure, but context is given the back seat and of course, with very little personal threat attached the whole ordeal thanks to underdeveloped villains and love interests, suspense is extremely limited. Sure enough, we care for Bruce, and we will surely find ourselves cheering on for a happy ending just out of habit, but in the end the outcome and eventual climax feels obvious and underwhelming. It makes for good popcorn munching entertainment sure, but after eighty minutes of solid drama with subtle shades of action, the final act is one that can grow tedious quickly. As a whole however, one can't complain; the structure, although lopsided when it comes to balancing out drama and action, is nevertheless straight forward enough to maintain interest and engagement. Most characters are given ample time to at least reach some level of respectability, and the action, although a little over the top for the sake of spectacle, is fitting enough for a blockbuster action movie. It has its low points and its high points, but thankfully the majority is of a great standard; enough to at least satisfy those looking for a much more modern and mature adventure for Batman. Add this to the fact that Bale delivers what is without a doubt the finest, most realistic rendition of Bruce Wayne to date, and you have yourself a more than competent outing to indulge in that is likely to please audiences old and young.<ul><li>Jamie Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>",Null,2,2,5 October 2008
Twilight," Driven by heart rather than fangs.
","The vampire sub genre of the much broader class of horror film is one that is very rarely taken as a serious means of delivering drama or characterisation, never mind palpable romance. Twilight, the first of what is set to be a series of films based upon the popular books of the same name, counteracts this popular trend successfully, establishing a world that retains its otherworldly charm and yet still manages to deliver a story that most of us humans will be able to digest. It's a feature that is bound to polarise viewers; those attracted to the vampire complex will undoubtedly be let down by the lack of focus on such, and those repelled by the genre will most likely be the ones to enjoy it. In this vein I wasn't particularly looking forward to my viewing of Twilight vampire movies have only very rarely managed to entertain or engage me in the past- but I was pleased to find the experience rewarding, intelligent and fittingly driven by heart rather than fangs.Focusing around teenage misfit of sorts Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) as she moves to her father's cold and inhospitable town whilst her mother goes on a state-wide roadtrip with her new boyfriend, Twilight is first and foremost a character story. Not only is it such, but it directs its attention on a personality that isn't driven by the desire to feast. No doubt, Twilight wouldn't be much of a movie if it didn't feature vampires, but it does well to get the balance right in terms of focus. Where the key involvement between Bella and the cold ones comes into play however isn't through danger or a series of spooky 'boo' moments, but rather through subdued teenage-tinged romance. This key shift in momentum makes director Catherine Hardwicke's movie a much more subtle and slow moving feature than one might expect, and the result is potent in its ability to draw the mind and heart within its tale. Those looking for campy, rudimentary fun best look away; Twilight strives to be a little more than such.What's most interesting about the feature however lies in its unconventional mix of action, drama and romance. Very rarely is it seen that movies with any degree of fantastical or action-orientated elements plays them in the background to the attention-demanding elements inherent within drama and romance. In this respect, Twilight achieves a tone and pacing quite unlike most examples out there; sure enough, the movie would undoubtedly be better off with even less of a focus on the thrills and chills or vampiredom, but one can at least attest to the fact that this small risk for the most part plays off in a refreshing manner that feels natural to the story that it tells.So who exactly are these vampires and what do they want? Well, one group particularly the Cullens- simply chose to ignore their impulses to feed on human blood, and live together outside of town where they respectfully live on a 'diet' of animal blood instead. One of these comes in the form of Edward Cullen (Robert Pattison), an attractive figure of mystique and animosity to his peers, who, by chance ends up falling for Bella in a strange way. This passion that Edward experiences for Bella plays out as a dualism consisting of lustful temptation and protective love; conflicted by his overwhelming desire to feed upon her, and at the same time convince her of his love, Edward is for the most part the tale's major source of character interest. Bella herself is straight forward, and plays as the catalyst for Edward's eventual conflict, but as a pair the two share a wonderful dynamism that often leaps from the screen in wistful, whimsy and romantic flares of imagery.Part of what makes such moments as powerful as they are aside from the performances of those involved- is the potent sense of atmosphere that is created from the meshing of Hardwicke's romantic, otherworldly style and the similarly themed score penned by Carter Burwell. Echoing the dynamism and refreshing qualities of Melissa Rosenberg's screenplay, Burwell's music creates layers of different atmospheres that always propel the feature forward into a realm of its own. There's a distinct prominence of ambiance here too, that brings in less than traditional movie-score instruments to pull the job off and the effect is always interesting to behold. Furthermore, while not quite as daring as one would hope, the photography of Elliot Davis too adds much needed dimensions to the film's body, complementing all other elements with coherency and relevancy to what is being explored within the characters.Granted, there are more than a few missteps that take place within the boundaries of what is for the most part a surprisingly effective anti-genre movie, but one can't help but be slightly distracted when they do come along. Kristen Stewart, although doing a fine job in much of the movie's less emotionally demanding scenes, too often falls pray to a lack of heart; the romance as a result during the middle section of the film feels a little underwhelming and disempowering. This and a slight dive in momentum and focus during the movie's final more action-driven- act constitute what are the only real major drawbacks of the film. Other than this, Twilight is a real treat. Intelligent but emotionally driven with a tone that is at times surreal and yet distinctly human, Twilight achieves what most dramas with less of a fantastical nature only wish they could; sure this isn't high-culture stuff, but that's part of its graceful charm. If there is one reason to see it, it isn't for the macabre themes, the fantasy or the vampires, but rather for the dark romance; Twilight is a rare breed of such that successfully mixes all of the required ingredients in a palpable, character-driven tale of warm sentiment.<ul><li>Written by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>",7,1,6,26 December 2008
Revolutionary Road," The Great American Nightmare.
","Reminisce with me to a simpler time in cinema, back when such a day out was an entirely different experience; a celluloid landscape sculpted with the most obtuse of films, a large quantity of which belong to the science-fiction genre with all its low- budgetary images of horror and paranoia gorging itself unto viewers of all ages from coast to coast in America's theatres. Much of these outings proved to be good fun for the family and dates, and yet something sinister was always prevalent to them- something a little more subliminal and ominous. It was the middle of the 20th century, around about the same time our story begins here.Truth be told, science-fiction is a genre that couldn't be any further from the tale that director Sam Mendes presents to us here, but in another sense it couldn't be any closer to the truth. In what is essentially a two hour character and relation study of a 1950's American Dream marriage, Mendes paints an eerily numb existence fortified by loneliness and bewildering emptiness. Indeed, it's the same kind of world that Aliens From Mars! would portray as uncomfortably alien in an effort to contrast how well America supposedly had it in contrast to their eastern, vodka drinking red-shirt counterparts. The irony of course being that such audiences need look no further than their own bedrooms (as opposed to under the bed itself) to find such horrific scenes of conformity, lost dreams and social imprisonment.Revolutionary Road comes from the director of beloved cult-classic American Beauty, which for all intents and purposes set out to decipher the same ideas of social frustration inherent to modern western philosophical values (or lack thereof) and short-sighted ambition. As a follow up, this outing feels both poignant and relative but not without its inherent drawbacks as a direct result of blooming in the shadow of such a renowned and similar output. Indeed, the most consistent of the film's low points simply come from the fact that Mendes seems to be at times- repeating himself. This isn't all bad of course; American Beauty isn't exactly a poor choice of film to trace ideas from- yet there still remain degrees of déjà-vu and needlessness to Revolutionary Road's model that detracts from the experience.That being said however, Mendes does well to stay clear of the 'hopeless emptiness' that dominates its screenplay's narrative; resisting the trappings of merely cloning an accepted form. Rather, Revolutionary Road is feisty and alive; we sit and watch closely as characters slowly wither away and yet we continue to feel for them in their struggle against a tide overwhelming their own personal desires for freedom. Through this shift to emotive engagement Mendes informs but also avoids overtly preaching to the point where connection to character is lost to cold, paper-based ideas. This attention to the emotive core of the couple's rather tragic deterioration allows the film to branch off into directions hinted at throughout American Beauty but never fully explored. Where Mendes' first output focused primarily on many different characters and how they related to one central persona's midlife crisis, Revolutionary Road instead details one relationship between two people lost in a cage that they accidentally stumbled into. It's a relatively small shift in direction, but the movie is certainly all the better for it.A good few years down the line from their whimsical change of scenery and it would seem that all hope is lost for the Wheelers. Frank (DiCaprio) and April (Winslet) over the years of settling down to raise children in a comfortable corner of suburbia, initially found themselves content and perhaps even happy in their new home only to realise later on that it was a cage destined to kill the love that brought them there in the first place. The result? Explosive. Through years of building frustration with a directionless existence burdened and yet constructed upon the necessity of a normal, socially viable living, the pent up anger eventually comes loose in a series of startling scenes aptly performed by all involved. Indeed, Mendes' doesn't even elect to make obvious distinctions between the script's jumps in time- we can tell from the characters' attitude to each other as where we are in their story.During these sequences of particular upset however, we experience fully the emotional baggage that each carries as a result of their embittered lifestyle with DiCaprio with Winslet selling it from beginning to end with utter conviction- there is hardly any doubting either's commitment to their role and partnership; this is top of the line stuff that gives a movie such as this its real value. Granted there are moments when Haythe's script borders on absurdity with dialogue plainly written solely to voice themes, yet even such instances carry their own weight in establishing the feature's ideas and criticisms central to the plot.Rather than paint a picture filled with black and whites, Revolutionary Road instead brushes the canvas with light, albeit detailed strokes of subtle drama shaded with layers of compelling humanity. For what it's worth, the tale it sets out to tell retains a certain degree of romance inherent to its derailing, but not in the windswept manner to which DiCaprio and Winslet met ten years prior. Instead, Mendes offers a tragedy built upon regret and personal affliction rather than an outside, unshakable force- for the Wheelers, their iceberg it would seem comes in the form of a cosy little house overlooking quiet suburbia in all its apathetic, dreamless wonder- and yet you get the feeling that a shipwreck would somehow be a welcome change of scenery for both. For us onlookers however, Revolutionary Road provides safe, over-the-fence peak at the nightmare through a coherent, wonderfully dark, satirical, grounded and well constructed criticism of the picket-fence fantasy.<ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>",Null,0,1,30 January 2009
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Half and half.
","Between Thor and Captain America, the usual superhero staples to receive the perfunctory origin story, somewhat bewilderingly stands yet another attempted revival of cult fiction in the form of Rise of the Planet of the Apes, a movie that for all intents and purposes is exactly that—an origin movie, made after a handful of sequels and a hackneyed remake a decade prior. Of course, ten years is a long time, and enough to forget the mistakes made by Hollywood from those years, but questions nevertheless remain. It's curious to me that any movie producer would even see a further venture into the ten-year deceased series as a potential money maker, but even more perplexing that someone actually sat down and decided that fleshing out the mysterious events prior to the 1968 classic would be somehow necessary or even entertaining to a modern audience who more than likely don't even know who Charlton Heston is. Thankfully however, this isn't 2001 all over again—Rise of the Planet of Apes is an apt exposition of a now infamous story that does well to provide a somewhat humble and in-depth look at two of the central characters involved in the eventual downfall of humankind. The same cannot be said, however, of the entirely of the movie's narrative which is almost devoid of a third act. Sure, it's a story all about origin, but didn't The Green Goblin take his leave in 2002? I think so. Unfortunately then, what Rise of the Planet of the Apes succumbs to is the word-for-word definition of anti-climax. We know how it will all end (or at least, I thought I did), and for the most part the majority of the movie and its advertising campaign will lead you to believe that it's building, building, building up to—you know, a rising of a planet filled with apes, butYeah, it just doesn't happen. There are hints post-credits, sure, but aside from the potentiality of a sequel in the books, Rupert Wyatt's crash-landing in ape-land ends up being something of another huge let- down in comparison to the story that he is presumably giving life support to. And in a way, it's ironic because both the screenwriters and Wyatt himself do their jobs so well in developing some elements of the story that conflicts of interest begin to the enter the playing field. Jaffa and Silver acknowledge the central struggle between good and evil (human and ape, presumably) in their story and attempt to rectify it by playing on the fence with an alternate mythos involving a virus instead of all-out warfare, but such moments at footnotes next to the overwhelming character study of gifted ape Caesar and his 'father', Will Rodman. At its core, and on its own merits, the central device used here as a means to provide some emotional tangents to the otherwise stoic backstory of Planet of the Apes is more than convincing to say the least. Brought to life by a terrific motion-capture performance by Andy Serkis, the somewhat tragic tale of the world's first truly intelligent ape is captivating and hugely engaging. It's a shame then that much of this is sent to the shredder when the movie suddenly and begrudgingly decides to simply stop. It's not like the drama, or the characters, or the plot stops for a moment just to let other elements breathe—the whole thing just decides to end, just as Luke Skywalker decides he's going take down the Deathstar. Roll credits.One can see why the film-makers opted to leave the story hanging where it does—it avoids the obvious conflictions between human and ape to the point where Caeser (who the movie builds up to be obviously without his own faults) is never turned into a monster that wants to destroy all mankind and his master with him. Nope, instead we're offered a hint that things turn sour for us humans in a different way and that our ancestors form a society of their own through their own peaceful accord. It's not a bad fix-around by any means, but it's not the movie that the two acts of setup would have you believe; it's a movie of two halves—one a captivating and cathartic look at inter-species intolerance and segregation; the other a wink and a nod to a non-existent plot somewhat dubiously hinting at another sequel or dare I say, reboot.",Null,0,2,15 August 2011
City of God," As real as it gets
","City of God is a fantastically made film filled with memorable characters all mixed into a story that will hold your attention from beginning to end. There's seriously not much wrong with this movie at all and has some of the best performances I've seen to date in modern cinema. Fernando Meirelles certainly makes his mark here, creating a realistically brutal rendition of a true story based around a violent neighbourhood of Rio de Janeiro in the 60's and 70's.I don't know if such ties have been mentioned before but this movie reminded me very much of The Godfather movies, filled with violence, crime, drugs and money with each gang trying to survive or gain a bigger slice of the pie. The one major difference between this and the Godfather however is that the main theme here is simply that these people have been made to live like this. It is their conditioning, and usually not always is it a choice for such people to make such choices. This theme is recurrent throughout the film and is poignantly displayed with great effect with every bullet that is fired.Although obviously not as grand as such movies, City of God nevertheless does its job brilliantly, building up characters with a perfect pace and balancing the plot all the while so that things don't slow down beyond interest. Perhaps what the film does best however is depict the nature of disorder and corruption to a degree only someone with direct experience could do. Throughout the film I did feel like I was watching real events take place, never feeling like I was watching a scripted movie, and I have to say, every few films achieve this with me. This is probably why I have so little to say about the movie! I also have another theory that the best movies need fewer lines to review than the bad ones.

Bolt," A welcome eye opener to where the animated film industry may be headed.
","It's getting to the point now where, introducing the latest three-dimensional feature with an introductory paragraph relating to the history and general makeup of the 3D movie is becoming redundant. In today's cinematic climate, it is quickly becoming common to see 3D glasses being handed out every month or so; for those of us who have shared in the gimmick up until now, it's not exactly a promising sign, but it's a product of change we must accept nevertheless. Yet there are reasons as to why I always discuss the similarities between such features before going into details and that is simply because, like many other subgenres such as the 'J-horror', the 3D movie usually sticks to traits which work as a deterrent to entertainment. Sure, the images are stark and glossy- they pop out at us and briefly take us aback, but then we slowly begin to realise that everything behind all this glitter is ironically flat. Of course, there have been rare exceptions to this general rule of thumb, and yet most seem to the stick to the same adage of your average 3D attraction at theme parks; distract first- tell a 'story' second.Then there's Bolt; Disney's latest animated feature touting anthropomorphised melodrama aimed at kids but not completely useless for adults. They're been doing it for a while now, but not necessarily in 'true 3D'. As a somewhat sophomoric experiment for Disney, one would expect Bolt to be hard pressed in finding its feet, and yet this is thankfully not the case. Instead, those guys from the Magic Kingdom have delivered a 3D experience that although suffering from many defects- at least doesn't pander to the technology that drives it. Indeed, rather than tell a story that feels weak and formulated for the sake of dazzling, Bolt dazzles through its characters and story which although comes off as tiresomely derivative and predictable at its worst moments, at least delivers on something other than cheap sparkle distractions. The result is a heart-warming experience that engages for the most part in a traditional manner whilst providing some awesome sequences for the eyeballs to chew up all the same. It certainly isn't perfect, no, but it's a fine effort nevertheless and a welcome eye opener to where the animated film industry may be headed.For all intents and purposes however, it 's certainly worth noting that while Bolt certainly does offer a breathtaking and very impressive tour de force of animation technology, the spectacle of the movie could still be just as effective in regular two-dimensional rendering. The movie's plot which centres around a brainwashed dog who goes astray in the real world only to find out he's not what he thought he was, is the first and foremost attraction to what is on offer here. Following a sweet, albeit overly familiar Buzz Lightyear complex of realizing your disillusions have been brought on by outside forces (here, they are represented by the special effects of Hollywood), Bolt tells a story that works on a literal and very touching, emotive manner for those less occupied with the intellect; granted, the pacing is irregular throughout act two which mostly follows a mundanely formulated animal-buddies-road-trip structure, but bookends one and three deliver many punches that never feel as cheap as those moments within the middle. Most importantly however, children will love it; it's sweet, funny, thrilling, slapstick and emotionally rewarding.For all the more reserved of viewers however, perhaps escorting the little ones to the cinema selflessly, Bolt isn't a misfire by any means. Sure, around half of the aforementioned qualities won't do much to invigorate the senses, yet the movie does well to work in a simple, albeit welcome allegory of disillusionment caused by the glitter and glare of TV screens, movies and celebrity magazines. In a sense I was taken aback when I was suddenly thinking about Fight Club in all its counterculture, frustration-and-disappointment-through-false-expectation thematic material, but pleased all the same. That's not to say that Bolt in any way starts overtly preaching or giving lessons on the crushing realities of life in the manner to which Fincher did ten years back; no, here the moral is closer to that of The Wizard of Oz than Jack's gloomy existentialist nightmare, yet it's this fine blend of intellectual substance loosely tying together a soft, sugary story that makes Bolt a much more rewarding experience than your average tepid animated fare.As previously mentioned, the aesthetics present here are wonderful; in fact, I feel no unease at claiming Bolt to be the best looking 3D animated film to date. Sure, it's a niche market at this point in time, but that doesn't detract from some of the movie's breathtakingly crisp action sequences that test the medium to its capabilities. The performers do a fine job too; it's nothing as remarkable as everything that surrounds them, but most do a fine job with what they are given and never succumb to the distant numbness sometimes associated with big stars playing polygon puppets.Conclusively I must reiterate that while Bolt does have its fair share of wonderful moments, a distinct lack of such during the movie's middle act inevitably hurts the momentum and overall impact of its greater parts. Nevertheless, those looking for a heart-driven tale filled with sweet characters, thrilling action and some genuinely laugh out loud gags, could certainly do a whole lot worse than taking a trip to catch Bolt. That being said, it's also a testament to the movie that I didn't grumble on and on about the evils of that often flat third dimension; Bolt showcases the idea that 3D can be more than a cheap gimmick to sell tickets. Instead it offers such technology as a well intended after-thought that only adds rather than detracts to the real reasons we as audiences sit down to watch movies in the first place.<ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>",Null,3,5,6 February 2009
Schindler's List," Underdeveloped
","Schindler's List is a movie whose technical aspects on the whole cannot be faulted, but at the same time this perfection inevitably becomes a weakness in the film's heart. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie and certainly regard it as the most brutal and realistic depictions of the holocaust that I've seen. Whether or not it works as a movie however, is a whole different question. After watching for the first time I don't regard Schindler's List as perfect, but still regard it as an important piece of film because of the history it depicts so powerfully, regardless of its few faults as a movie.On an aesthetic side, the film is perfect. The soundtrack fits the themes and action on screen perfectly and memorably, creating an atmosphere suiting to the film's focus. The performances from the cast are all very well done also, with only a few problems every now and again. The photography also is flawless, using black and white with mixes of colour effectively and with astonishing results often not thought possible with the limitations of the style.The writing itself is sharp and well done, managing to recreate a dark period in human history as though it was outside our windows, ready to be filmed. My problem however lies in the writing of the tragedy and the obvious unbalanced focus on characters. You see the film does manage to convey a completely disgusting, repelling and shocking world ruled by oppressors following orders with little compassion for an entire race of people. It does this by repeatedly showing unjustified and casual killings of innocent civilians, carried out by the Nazis. I'm not saying these scenes were not well done, in fact when viewing them I was firmly on the film's side, taken in by its honesty and gruesome realism. However as the film dragged on I began to notice that these people who were dying were people I didn't know of nor really cared about (Please note at this point that I am reviewing a movie, not history). This occurs because I felt Schindler's List devoted far too much screen time developing its oppressors rather than showing more of the oppressed. So when it comes to yet another execution, I am predictably enraged and disgusted with the executioner, but am I sad or guided to feel anything for the poor person who's now lying dead? Not really. I mean, yes I find it horrifying and tragic, but show any killing on screen and you're probably going to react in this way. Here in lies where Schindler's List is brought down from superior cinema to a sentimentally bankrupt historical movie: The film is extremely powerful and emotional throughout, but unfortunately it is always in a negative manner.I also found the ending to the film completely unconvincing and detracting to the events that take place beforehand. I refer here to both Schindler breaking down and fretting over how many more prisoners he could have saved, and the modern day footage of the survivors visiting Schindler's grave. Both ordeals come off as extremely misplaced, emotionally contrived and absurdly mawkish. They left me with an unfortunate sour taste after a solid couple of hours of well intentioned film.Please recognise however that despite these problems, I did find the film a good watch albeit quite a taxing one. If there is one thing I can give the film absolute praise for it is that it has opened my eyes a great deal to the suffering and injustice that the Jewish people went under whilst under the control of the Nazis during World War II. It is a film that will stay with me forever no doubt, leaving images that probably should never be forgotten.",Null,2,5,13 October 2007
Cars 2," For the kids.
","At this time in their illustrious careers as animators and storytellers, Pixar Studios are by no means strangers to the connotations of success. In fact, pretty much singlehandedly shifting the mainstream public's attention from hand-drawn animation to digital 3D during the late 90's, the studio is responsible not just for a whole mainstream movement in film, but also for providing audiences with the pinnacle of those very movies every summer. Eventually however, even the mighty must fall, and despite the initial disappointment of 2006's predecessor, the studio have went ahead and made this year's focus that of the same crazy, zany world of Cars—something unexpected, sure, but not entirely unquestioned.Upon viewing Cars 2 however, you see clearly why. While far off from being something of a disaster, this project from director John Lassater (the man behind the first movie, and also some of the studio's better works) is nevertheless a true successor to the original in that it too fails to meet the high expectations usually derived from the Pixar name, and plods along seemingly out primarily to please itself. Much like Cars, but to a larger extent here, Cars 2 comes across as being overly indulgent in all the wrong areas—it's a movie which can be funny, but only sporadically and seemingly by happenstance; it's s a plaything of Lasster's that never truly reaches beyond the screen and grabs you; but worst of all is that it's routinely dumb—something that Pixar with intelligent movies such as WALL-E and the touching tales of Finding Nemo and UP! tend to stray away from.Nevertheless, Cars 2 feels more like an upper-tier episode of, say, Handy Manny mixed with iCarly. There are fart jokes and oil jokes, and an abundance of contrived character conflicts and Learning From Your Vanity moral taglines—it's the kind of thing that will please the younger audience, but hey, who the hell is going to deny enjoying Toy Story or The Incredibles, even at the ripe old age of 80? And I guess, that's where the problem lies; there's a split here that is very rarely present in the studio's work—something that lesser companies fall prey to every year for the sake that being cookie-cutter straight and safe is far easier to back as less of a risk than say, the first half-hour of WALL-E which has no dialogue. So in saying that, if by some leap of logic, you're reading this and happen to still be able to count your years with your 10 stubby digits, by all means stop; you'll enjoy this regardless.For everyone else however, Cars 2 will no doubt disappoint. Partly because of its unapologetic focus on a central character who is thick as pudding (which would be fine, if it didn't infect the rest of the mind- numbingly simplistic plot and character development), but mostly because the writing itself is entirely unengaging and disconnected from any semblance of emotion or intelligence. Taking at least half the movie's meagre runtime to finally provide some back-story to the antagonist plot against our returning heroes Lightning McQueen and Mater, the movie simply feels uninvolving, boring and even just unfunny. To it's credit, the voice acting is top quality as per, as are the visuals, but such consolations just don't cut it when this kind of lazy writing drives the cogs underneath. Kids will still love it, sure, but don't expect to find yourself buying the DVD for yourself under the guise of 'it's for the kids.' This time, despite that Pixar name on the cover, it will be for the kids.",Null,2,5,25 July 2011
Gran Torino," A rewarding, emotively resonant and distinct piece of tough-love.
","Life and death are common themes within the realm of film, with each having their respective nuances and larger than life images transported onto the big screen with a frequency that often leads one to forget such basic, but compelling ideas and thoughts. Yet for Gran Torino which takes for itself a slice of life's pie which isn't the most glamorous, nor the most loving of that very essence of life, does not –at least for the most part- neglect to touch upon such themes with a timid sense of grandeur. Indeed, for all its grand statements shrouded in simple characterisation and complex psychological analysis, the real treat for viewers here isn't gained from the intellect, but from the senses and the heart. Gran Torino may tickle the head's curiosity for discussion on life, people, cultural tolerance and our relationships with these people on screen, but in the end it is the heart-felt, emotionally tangible experience itself that is accumulated over its abundant runtime that provides the most rewarding sense of catharsis.Taking the forefront of this rather heavy-handed tour-de-force of character drama and analysis is war-veteran and all around disgruntled and overbearing Walter Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) who not only feels alienated from a world long gone from his younger years, but also from those closest to him. Having just lost his wife, Walter comes to the bitter realisation that the world as a whole just doesn't seem to have any heart left—no soul, no respect and no values inherent to its core. It saddens Walter perhaps, maybe a little—but it sure as hell pisses him off more. Make no mistake though, this guy isn't a saint; in fact, he would make no qualms with telling one to get off his back and quit with the fairy-act. To make matters worse for old-man Walter however, between the bumbling yuppies and their spoiled kids to the decaying neighbourhood long overrun with Hmong immigrants, Kowalski ends up in the middle of a physical dispute that resides within both a racial and domestic arena. Of course, at first he couldn't care less—'Just get off my lawn!' is his retort to praises of heroism after scaring off a local gang with a war-tested rifle, but it's not long before Walter begins to find solace in life through an unlikely companion.From here the story of Gran Torino takes a turn to the left and never looks back. While the character of Kowalski never quite lets go of his deep-rooted cynicism and embittered attitude towards those he has to put up with day in day out, the brief rays of sunshine that trickle through the character's arc over the second act pave way to a much more fleshed out and rewarding portrayal. Eastwood, who embodies Kowalski with a mean-spirited refrain typical of his most famous personas to date, establishes a personality that manages to convey a wide and varying sense of emotion; one moment you'll be rattled by Walter's unclenching disdain for untraditional values, and then you'll be laughing and rooting for him the next. Not only is it a compelling and distinct performance cemented by multi-layered and rich writing—but this over-riding sense of dynamism to the story's central character goes on to echo the script's central themes on the nature of life and death itself. Of course, there is plenty of Dirty Harry to mean old-coot vigilante Walter—perhaps too much at times—but it all comes together surpassingly well; emotionally, intellectually and even entertainingly.If there is one cataclysmic failing of the feature however, it lies in the sometimes overdone and contorted nature of its final act. The conclusion to the entirety of the feature—although apt in its emotional derailing of the viewer thanks to a poignant final five minutes—nevertheless takes too long to reach said destination, and does so without any clear sense of direction. Following on from two absolutely solid acts filled to the brim with unique characterisation, poignant, tangible thematic analysis and of course a sense of heart which is definitely not neglected throughout the entirety of the feature; Gran Torino may not be perfect, but it sure as hell kicks quite a punch despite its slow-moving and unassuming façade. Behind this old dog of a feature lies an assertive sense of conviction and compelling heart—of course, it has its fair share of sour moments here and there too, but thanks to the presence of Eastwood both on and off camera, Torino ends up succeeding as a rewarding, emotively resonant and distinct piece of tough-love in amongst the generic electric-shaver mobiles of modern day cinema.<ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>",Null,1,9,27 April 2009
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," A whimsy and eloquent dance on life, beautiful and tragic whilst human and fantastic.
","Fairy tales and fables come in all sorts of different forms, the least of which certainly not being the film, and while the novel may have came first, there still remains a certain extra-dimensional beauty to seeing a good piece of fantastical fiction being pulled off up on that giant silver screen. At risk of over-romanticising what is nevertheless a fairytale grounded deeply in the human spirit and heart, I submit that The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is exactly that; it's a rare example of an eloquent dance synchronised along to the melancholic keys of a piano played within a rustic bar on the edge of New Orleans. It's tangible, real, and yet ethereal and poignantly larger than life at the same time. Yet there remains one key aspect to Benjamin's story here that most fables fail to resolve - that is that a key theme, in fact, the absolute idea behind his story is the idea of the entirety of life, death and everything between; not just the happy parts, or the struggles, but the whole of that journey in all its details. Of course, Benjamin's case isn't exactly what you'd call 'normal', and yet despite its somewhat fantastical façade and makeup, there is still plenty of humanity on show here that always plays first and foremost to the backing of Mr. Button's curious, but harrowing tale.For director David Fincher, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button represents a dive further into long, grand pieces of character-driven work largely dominated by larger than life statements. Indeed, as was a somewhat unfortunate flaw within Fincher's previous work Zodiac, the only problem prevalent here is that his feature tends to get overwhelmed by the size, scale and scope of the story to which he is trying to tell. Granted, telling eighty years of mans life, and doing so backwards -in a sense-, is no easy thing to do, but it remains a testament to the ambitious director and indeed the movie itself that much of the scrawling runtime is paced evenly enough to avoid any major disjointedness. Despite this sporadically distracting flaw, Benjamin Button showcases Fincher's ability to draw human characters out of surreal situations to the point where emotional response is consistently drawn from the audience without resorting to cheap ploys and devices. Instead the feature builds characters, and relations which transpire within a somewhat meagre plot, telling their stories in an eloquent, refined and subtle manner; this, in contrast to Benjamin's unique disposition in that he ages backwards, provides a fairytale that caters to the viewer's romantic and realist sides in ways that only the best of art can claim to do.Like the best of fairy tales however, there remains a poignant mix of styles to Benjamin's story that reaches beyond just plain character drama and romance. There's action, comedy, even a little bittersweet lust for life in there too, and while much of this would be easy to misplace and in turn spoil the coherency of the story, Fincher does well to keep things consistently engaging regardless. Most of this of course lies for the most part- outside of Fincher's direct control however, in the form of Brad Pit who portrays Mr. Button here in what is undoubtedly a career defining performance. He, his co-stars and his romantic interest played by Cate Blanchett reflect the majestic nature of Benjamin's story without loosing touch of their distinct human qualities. Sure enough there remains some degree of ill-fated dissonance to Benjamin and Daisy's romance as a direct result of their tragic dispositions, but despite a somewhat anti-climactic uniting of the couple of during the movie's middle act, the movie retains its whimsy, airy charm throughout. It's not a perfectly constructed romance by any means, and this again is a detrimental result of the movie's extremely large scope at trying to tell a fleeting romance within such a large time scale, but the emotive power of the story is not without its impact during the first and last hours.While it would be presumptuous to walk from a showing of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button with the rose-tinted view that it represents cinema and storytelling in perfection, such an occasion is only rarely and briefly awarded to cinema goers. Yet, despite the fact that Fincher here delivers a film that has quite a few failings that more discerning viewers will be disgruntled with, there is nevertheless no denying the simple power of Benjamin's Forest Gump ¬tinged biographical story. What it represents is a whimsy and eloquent dance on life, beautiful and tragic whilst human and fantastic. Indeed, by the time the curtain closes on Mr. Button's curious case, the impact of his story remains with you long after the credits stop rolling; it's the kind of film that is imperfect but not at the expense of making a statement so poignant and hard hitting that the movie as a whole succeeds in being irrefutably futile to resist in its warm embrace. Most importantly and somewhat ironically however is that Benjamin's story provides an almost ageless and unforgettable tale that simply uplifts and emotionally resonates without overly romanticising the small nuances of life. Reflected during one of the movie's strongest sequences, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button takes to heart that life is a strange series of events, ostensibly random and yet poetically beautiful; indeed, somewhere between the chaos theory and that of predestination lies Benjamin Button- and sure, it can be a bumpy ride, unpredictable and seemingly cruel in design, but Benjamin ascertains that that's just life, and that's exactly what Fincher and Roth deliver here.<ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>",Null,2,4,9 February 2009
Pi," Analytical Art
","A personal favourite director, and certainly in my books as one of the most talented and important directors of our modern age, Aronofsky here delivers a film for the mind, powerful to all the senses and absolutely interesting in every respect.I have to confess to being a patterns and numbers enthusiast myself, although not as obsessed as Pi's main character Max, I do find the science and philosophy of mathematics to be highly intriguing. So when I heard of this film after seeing the brilliant 'Requiem for a Dream', I decided I would have to see it soon. So tonight was that time, and I have to say, I was right! I loved the movie from beginning to end and was taken into Max's world as if it was my own, with all the parallels intact.Not only this, but I love black and white photography and sure enough, it does look gorgeous in Pi. However I couldn't help but draw comparisons from this choice of shooting by Aronofsky, to the actual themes of the movie itself. In a way, the black and white photography enhances the themes throughout, representing the strict system of shade and movement of light in a way we don't normally see through our eyes. At one point in the film Max describes being blinded by the sun and for a small moment actually seeing things as they are and being to understand them.Performances from the entire cast were fantastic with special mention to Gullette: someone whom I have undeservedly not heard of at all. And as always, Aronofsky directs and writes to an amazingly high standard, creating interesting fleshed-out characters and a highly intelligent, thought provoking story that just begs to be re-watched over and over.Admittedly, this film is not for everyone. However, if you are a fan of the director, mathematics or any philosophical films made for thought- this one is a must-see. As for me, I absolutely adored it: It was definitely an instant favourite and a film that will stay with me for quite some time.",Null,1,4,5 October 2007
Event Horizon," Akin to a 1950's exploitation genre movie with superb visual effects.
","Science-fiction and horror are genres that go way back to the very origins of film itself as a means of entertainment with very little in the way of 'art'. It is no surprise then that both have had their fair share of encounters in the past in an attempt by studios to bring the bucks of monsters and alien fans all in the one take. The sad reality of this however is that much of the time this usually results in a story that is tepid and ultimately see-through in its exploitative nature. In fact, up until Alien which came out in the late 1970's, the horror sci-fi flick was one plagued with dead-pan or over the top acting, formulaic plots and dialogue fit to be spoken only by pieces of furniture. The reasoning behind this is simple; to get the balance between such polarising genres fit enough to overcome the hard-sell nature of each, such a movie's script needs to be intricately developed and picked apart in order to nail that fine line between crass genre movie and entertaining crossover romp.Event Horizon which seeks to tread down the path Ridley Scott paved two decades earlier is an example of new ideas meshing with old ones; Anderson's film is a whole lot less cerebral and frightening that either of the first two alien pictures, but it is nevertheless interesting in its own light. Most of the feature takes place on board a mysterious ship that has the capability of creating black holes in order to travel vast distances of space and time in a fraction of the standard rate. The problem however is that instead of taking the ship across the galaxy or even to the other side of the universe, the Event Horizon instead creates a link to another dimension—loosely described and referred to through as 'hell'. Of course, the term is entirely ambiguous (and thankfully so), but the connotations are not left hanging in the imagination. Event Horizon takes blood, guts, torture and pain to high levels here, fully getting across what awaits the crew at the other side of that portal, and such moments are usually what give the film its real source of vibrancy and zest.What doesn't work quite as well however is the clashing of science-fiction (read: spaceships, technological babble and futuristic settings) and horror which too often seem far too overt and biased towards the horror side of things. To be fair, much of the feature's greatest moments come when we as viewers are subjected to moments of rapidly quick flashes of gore and horror, but there are certain scenes laced throughout that never quite work as well. Particularly irksome are the many cliché, 'what's that behind you' moments quickly followed by a cheap explosion of sound punctuated by Michael Kamen's bombastic score (which, you know, would have been fine for another Die Hard movie, but just consistently feels out of place and detractive here). This, in tow with an ending as anti-climactic, predictable and utterly un-engaging as you could possibly imagine, ends up turning an otherwise decent and claustrophobic Alien wannabe into something akin to a 1950's exploitation genre movie with superb visual effects.To screenwriter Philip Eisner's credit, there are numerous highlights inherent to Event Horizon's story (most notably being the characters who—although a tad derivative at times—nevertheless help flesh the movie out past its 2D plotting), but a distinct lack of conviction or subtlety to the overarching plot of the proceedings inevitably hurts the production as a whole. The result is a sporadically interesting and compelling feature with stretches of ten or so minutes at a time that are practically flawless—and yet the material that binds such moments together is weak and overly bland. If there is one thing that will taken from the experience however it is the memory of its horror and fantastic visuals (captured by Adrian Biddle, who unsurprisingly enough, did the same thing for Aliens in 1986) which consistently use the elaborate sets and visual effects to convey the ideas and themes of Eisner's script aptly. So it's not terrible by any means, but for anyone but the aficionados of the horror science-fiction movie, should still be taken with a grain of scepticism.<ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>",Null,0,1,2 June 2009
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," An intelligent and heart-felt family film.
","Very rarely does a film take it upon itself to detail the horrific facts of the holocaust during World War II whilst simultaneously trying to maintain a child-friendly approach. The Boy in Striped Pyjamas is one of these few, and while it's insistence on at times painting the era in children's colours (for the sake of conveying how the main character sees his innocent life in the midst of all the evil that is going on around him) can distract from the real emotional and thematic core of the story, there's enough heart and intelligence present here to manage a story with integrity as one would expect. Detailing such themes as anti-Semitism, war, death and domestic abuse, Mark Herman certainly doesn't make a mockery of his audience and history here, despite the inconsistent tones that he uses to paint such a melancholic, bleak portrait. Stark in its message and touching in its emotional core, The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas is a powerful, albeit slightly unfocused criticism of one of the cruellest acts in the recent history of man; and it does so through the eyes of an eight year old boy.This boy isn't the one mentioned in the title however, that would be an imprisoned Jew, living in a labour camp not far from our main character's new home. Bruno (Asa Butterfield), a boy of eight and son of an important Nazi soldier, has recently left his home in Berlin to live with his father, sister and mother in their new home which incidentally is near a concentration camp. Mistaking the imprisoned Jews for local farmers, what follows from this opening premise is a story of childhood bewilderment at how the adults of his world treat each other. Told through the eyes of Bruno, the movie can at times take on a light-hearted tone, throwing in small glints of humour and airy whimsy, and while these moments have their importance to contrasting the reality of Bruno's world and those around him with his own bright-eyed existence, their presence always seems perfunctory. Director Mark Herman shows that he knows how to contrast, but when the script demands that he try and blend the two natures of his world, problems arise.Working far more effectively are the scenes in which Bruno is faced with the harsh reality of his situation, even though he never quite grasps what is going on. Confused and always questioning his superiors and elders, Bruno gives way to many criticisms of the holocaust, without relying on any deep, thought-out questioning. This child-like approach to such a heavy topic can at times wear thin when the script relies on it exclusively to grasp at the heart of what is going on, but there are plenty of moments which work far more effectively, despite the abundance in which they reside. What propels the story even further however isn't within Bruno's interactions with his family and tutors, but with his new friend; the boy in the striped pyjamas, Shmuel (Jack Scanlon). Through their friendship, the movie achieves its most poignant message of how pointless and absurd the holocaust actually was. Bruno and Shmuel may never have any real time to bond and become close friends, but through their mutual isolation they find solace in each other, regardless of the electric fencing between them and whatever race of people they may be descendant from.Both child actors Butterfield and Scanlon do very well in their positions, and although they suffer from a distinct lack of true connection to the historical setting in which they find themselves, their inherent sense of ignorance brings the film a much needed air of innocence. As actors, both often avoid the usual awkwardness which usually afflicts thespians of their age and responsibility. The remainder of the cast hold their own just as well, with Vera Farmiga and David Thewlis providing some domestic dynamism as Bruno's mother and father adequately with enough resonance to further their son's personal story.In the end however, it was indeed the film's final ten minutes which won me over. As I mentioned previously, this may be a 12A film, and it may have been made with younger audiences in mind, yet in addition to the film's heavy themes and less than flowery characterisation, the film also closes on an extremely ballsy note. There's no doubt that the director could have copped out and went for something a little more pleasing, and it's actually surprising that even the studio let it slide given it's wide-demographic, yet when an ending like this arises one has to sit back and admire such a move. In essence, there is no other way that the movie could come to a close without losing its thematic and emotional core's poignancy to the less than successful whimsy façade, so while such a closer feels surprising, it also feels completely welcome. Hard-hitting at its greatest moments and amusing in its lighter ones, The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas is an intelligent and heart-felt family film that is too often at odds with itself in terms of its tone, but in the end does enough good to achieve an air of significance amidst the bloated genre.<ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>",Null,3,5,4 October 2008
Taken," Something for the aficionados.
","As a critic, to draw comparisons between Taken and the James Bond series would be like taking a gun and shooting yourself in your foot, and so I must continue on with this review in a limp. While this latest effort from director Pierre Morel isn't exactly as compelling or engaging as most of Mr. Bond's movies, what it does have in common is a riveting mix of action that runs on adrenaline and kicks with personality; of course, Liam Neeson is hardly a James Bond type, and quite frankly, neither is his character, but the trials and tribulations that Bryan goes through here share the same sense of personal conflict that often occurs during the best Spy-Thrillers. This isn't a movie riddled with politics, evil villains looking for world domination or fancy gadgets. No, instead Morel adopts a much more grounded, everyday threat to work with here, and as such achieves a good sense of focus and pacing that drives the feature forward. Unfortunately, despite this keen eye for bringing action that we care about to the screen, the script's lack of just about anything else hinders the movie's ability to work anything but the brain. It can be touching, but only momentarily; Taken is fine for a couple of hours of thrilling mystery, but if you crave more than a six-pack, you're probably best waiting for a martini.Telling the story of an ex-spy and father Bryan, who is on the hunt for his daughter's kidnappers in France, Taken takes a much more domestic, heart-driven source of narrative to drive itself forward. Compelled only to find his enemies for the sake of saving her daughter within a contrived timeline before she gets sent somewhere out of his reach and knowledge, Bryan makes for a cold, unrelenting character to follow. Throughout the feature, Neeson proves he has what it takes to fulfil such shoes, conveying the abrasive, goal-driven attitude of his character with enough conviction to maintain our own interest in his story. Of course, when it comes to showing how he feels outside of a piece of combat however, both Neeson and his persona fall a little short.Bryan is a regretful father, who in the past neglected his ex-wife and daughter in order to be good at his job. Yet realising how much bonding time he lost in doing so, decided to quit his job in order to move closer, and spend time with his daughter. In this arc there is genuine sympathy to be felt for Bryan, and Neeson does enough to get this across, even if he is far more compelling when firing off a weapon and breaking people's bones. The closing sequences are where the majority of all this development does finally pay off however, in an emotive climax that provides adequate catharsis involving the two central characters. However compelling such moments are though, there is no denying that the majority of Taken is driven by pure logic and visceral action; moments involving the heart are sporadic and almost immediately forgotten, and as such, the movie's tone can get a little erratic at times.As a whole, the feature isn't as remarkable as it could have been, but it is in no way disappointing either. Instead Taken takes a much more focused route, and delivers a spy-thriller that delivers on all the elements needed to create tension, conflict and does so with a character that is convincing in his role as a source of unrelenting pain for those who have crossed him. Those looking for a taste for the genre before Bond comes out should find themselves at home here, and while Taken is certainly a lot darker, more grounded and at the same time, less charismatic than cinematic icon 007, there's enough action and plot here to justify a watch. Perhaps with a little deeper characterisation the production as a whole could have been stronger, but for what it is, Taken is pretty much standard for the genre; no too remarkable but not too disposable either; something for the aficionados.<ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>",Null,2,5,20 October 2008
This Is Spinal Tap," Hilarious and yet completely believable.
","I'll always remember the first time I caught This is Spinal Tap running early in the morning on the BBC, over a decade ago when I was still in my early teens. Looking back, the movie left an entirely different impression; not knowing what exactly I was watching, I was convinced that I was viewing a genuine documentary on a big band I had never heard of. The dysfunction, the quarrelling, the pathetic accidents and complaining and the delusion all seemed completely real- there was something humorous about it, sure, but I didn't laugh. It wasn't until I saw it again many years later after hearing about the movie naturally because I was going through my initiation to heavy metal in general. The descriptions from friends were clear enough to know that that was what I had seen all those years ago; but wait, 'It's a comedy?' I said, unbeknownst of my impending doom. 'Of course it is, you idiot! It's hilarious! I guess you probably thought it was a real documentary too!' Sure enough, I decided to keep that one quiet lest I be subjected to more heckling. Nevertheless, such an embarrassing piece of personal history (and indeed, for many real-life performers who did the exact same thing) remains a testament to both the quality of the film, and indeed its humour, which can easily be misinterpreted as something other than what it actually is; which is, of course, a very thick helping of satire-heavy parody. This style, which was at that point in time rather original and daring, implements a documentary approach that aims to accentuate real human dialogue and dynamics between the stereotypical rock and roll band with its usual clashing of titan egos. As a result, This is Spinal Tap becomes a feature that feels genuine and truly engrossing in its deconstruction of such a lifestyle, but certainly not to the point where all humour is lost. Indeed, there lies a fine line between stupid, and clever, and while director Rob Reiner certainly allows for that line to become blurred during Spinal Tap's final moments of glory, it is done with enough tact and balance to ensure that each element of the feature (humour and character) is maintained with conviction.Despite my history with the film during the last decade of my life however, I sat down and watched it for the third time tonight (which, is actually quite a lot for myself) and found myself laughing out loud for the entire duration. Gone was the quiet awkwardness I felt from that first time, and accentuated was the comical timing of these moments to which brings out that awkwardness but not at expense of killing a joke. Granted, Spinal Tap were still the same whiny pampered rock band I became engrossed with a decade before, but with a little more of an eye for dark wit and satire, This is Spinal Tap opened up and revealed itself as a hilarious and yet completely believable take on superstardom in all its deluded pretence and downright hysterical eccentricities.Part of what makes the experience such a joy in the first place however is through the performances of the main cast and their commitment to making a feature which up until that point, had only been flirted with. Ten years earlier, This is Spinal Tap had me convinced that I had just seen a real documentary; the same cannot be said after my most recent viewing, but this is only because of prior knowledge. Aesthetically, Spinal Tap would lay the ground work for many similar mockumentary movies and TV shows hoping to use the style as an ultra-realist way of portraying the petty nuances of human relations for humorous effect. The ensemble, who essentially took notes from a script and ad-libbed the rest, nail the balance between being convincing and grounded without losing their naïve rock-star appeal and stature; this style in turn elicits a strong comical presence within the actors' performances whilst making them compelling, dynamic individuals able to reaffirm the movie's mockumentary approach. Not only does it allow for Spinal Tap to engross in its story/document, but it creates characters that feel alive, and thus, we too feel their embarrassment and ridicule.To go into any real depth as to why Reiner's movie strikes the chords that it does, seems at least a little disconnected and arbitrary to the actual experience of watching the film itself however. That being said, taken from a purely analytical and critical viewpoint, This is Spinal Tap nevertheless stands firmly as a mostly flawless, concise hour and a half of comedy with real personality and distinction. Yet a movie such as this shouldn't and couldn't be digested properly under the illusion that you're watching for a perfect, fulfilling experience filled with the highest calibre of drama or writing. No, instead, This is Spinal Tap exists as a tribute to cinema that feels natural, gets the job done, and does it without resorting to tired clichés and dull, repeated ideas. It's a masterpiece in its own rights, providing laughter with memorable characters and situations that leave you laughing long after the punch lines have evaporated. Most of all however, is that it's just downright fun and yet strangely human; indeed, just as you think that you've heard a beautiful, heart-felt melody inspired by works of masters, you'll soon be enlightened to know it's actually a piece by Mach, entitled Lick my Love Pump.That, ladies and gentlemen, is Spinal Tarp direct from hell.<ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>",Null,0,3,19 February 2009
Super 8," Induces awe as well as humbles the heart.
","So I'm sitting in the theatre, about thirty minutes into J.J. Abrams latest sci-fi blockbuster when I suddenly think to myself; I haven't seen a movie quite like this in a while. In fact, it's a style which owes very much to the film-maker that Abrams too often gets himself compared to, and to whom produced his latest here; the somewhat misleadingly titled Super 8. Set in the eighties and very much influenced by eighties film-making such as The Goonies and E.T., Super 8 is like taking a day-trip back in time whilst carrying a camera phone to capture it all with a different voice. Filtered through the modern capabilities of Abrams, the movie is big, loud and certainly no stranger to broad strokes of action and suspense, but filtered through well- developed characters and drama, Super 8 feels (if you'll excuse the pun) down to Earth in ways that Spielberg made his name in doing; it's human fantasy, and rather than feeling like a cheap throwback to simpler times, allows itself enough room to breathe in the modern arena to feel both refreshing and vibrant on our big fancy digital, modern displays.Without giving too much away (which is considerable when you take into account that the biggest plot point of the movie comes into focus only half-way in), Super 8 which is Abrams' first venture in writing a blockbuster entirely on his lonesome, is half monster and half family drama, coming of age, buddy movie. Opting to spend the majority of the feature's opening act on the latter rather than the former, one could easily be convinced that the monster might never rear its tentacles as the breadth and depth that Abrams spends developing and focusing on his characters is considerable. But the movie is far better off because of it, and in turn that latter focus on the monster works to a greater extent as a result. Indeed, parallelling what is perhaps his own experiences with making features and working in TV, the central group of friends here who are budding film-makers of their own, understand the basic principle of drama—to create people and relationships that the audience can latch onto and care about. Without that, well, it's just some guy in a costume dancing with some other guy.Thankfully however, Abrams gets this and allows his audience not just the thrill of this spectacle of events that transpires on the screen, but the thrill of being along for the ride with the people whom this is happening to. Sure enough, the drama never reaches the point of anything morose or academy award winning, but it doesn't have to in order to get its point across. There's comedy, there's fear, there's love, loss and regret—all of which come across the vast boundaries of the screen without stumbling or being too involved in themselves to even bother. Instead Abrams delivers a story which induces awe as well as humbles the heart through both sufficient narrative and his usual near-flawless grasp of the beats of movie action. In scenes which are as loud as Michael Bay's typical output but with the crash bang wallop timed perfectly to the point where each one makes you flinch, the action in Super 8 is loud, abrasive and certainly doesn't hold any punches—except of course when it comes to revealing the monster.It's perhaps the movie's only real flaw which resides within a form of movie-making that usually works for the better. Allowing the audience to fill in the gaps that he leaves out of his shots for the majority of the film, Abram implies more than he shows, and while this works for the earlier segments of the film it can at times come off as overly contrived to the point of tedium. When the curtain is lifted however, we kind of see why—the monster isn't what we're interested in so much as what he's doing, why he's doing it and how this affects our human characters. In the end we find that there are no obtuse 'parts' or genres to the movie at all; that's it's not a monster movie insomuch as it's a story about being understood in a cruel environment which we can't always control. Set against the wistful imaginations and ambitions of a group of kids soon to enter the world of adulthood, this makes the perfect backdrop for such themes. It's the kind of thing Spielberg did so well when bicycles and the Walkman were all the rage, and you could argue hasn't been done with as such spirit since—Well, at least until now.",Null,0,1,5 August 2011
Up," A humble and affecting expansion on the tried and true formula so far developed.
","When it comes to Pixar movies, one can usually flaunter into a box office, casually ask for the ticket and dip one's hand into one's wallet without fear of regret two hours after said event. One might not feel comfortable treating oneself to a single ticket to a children's animated movie, but then again, you could just pretend you're on the other side of the world for a moment and revel in this momentary state of consumerist bliss. This state of ease that is accompanied with the now annual event of catching the latest Pixar movie is one that has taken over a decade to emblaze upon the cinematic landscape, but it's a trait that has been well earned and deserved nonetheless. You see, in amongst the remainder of the year's children's movies, animated and so forth, consistently significant and memorable are those penned by the guys behind Wall-E, Toy Story and Finding Nemo. In fact, to say that such films are in a league of themselves—no, another ball game entirely is not too much of an overstatement if any. This almost universally accepted truth is so obvious; so accepted as the norm that it has this critic questioning why he's devoted so much space to restating it.But you see, there's a reason that I and many other film-lovers, critics and casual fans will so often draw focus onto the fact that Pixar above all others, stand a fair distance above those that challenge them. The reasoning is simply that when one does take that ticket stub and takes a seat in return, two hours later, you'll no doubt leave knowing that what you saw was:1. Worth your money. 2. Not a children's movie at all. 3. Definitely made by Pixar.Up, which is the latest in the long list of movies now made by the studio, may not be their best work, but it's got the same consistency and lovable charm about it that one associates with such movies. Sure, the kids will love it, but best of all is that you yourself won't suffer the consequences of falling asleep mid-way through. Instead, directors Pete Docter and Bob Peterson deliver something akin to the studio's work last year (Wall-E) and give audiences a tale that will bring a spring to your step as well as make you think, feel and care for its characters. Indeed, if you had to pinpoint the sole area where Pixar so often excel where other children's animated adventures fail, it would be in this sense of character and humanity. Rather than bludgeon the screen with flat caricatures and cliché jokes that reek of kitsch (although there are a few notable, disappointing throwbacks to these stapes in Up), Docter and Peterson give ample screen time to their characters which allows them to breathe and feel human—the movie's first act, which acts as an extremely poignant and sweet fifteen minute ode to love and the passing of time, most strongly achieves this and so early on too.If there is one drawback to the feature as a whole then, it would be the middle act which follows in the path of such a sombre, reflective and highly emotive opening. Placed within the confines of your average movie, such shenanigans and slapstick adventures would probably exist as the feature's highlight, but here the inclusion of certain elements (such as talking dogs—yeah, yeah, I know it has to please the children too, but c'mon) only work against the grander, more refined areas of the story. Yet for every talking dog and lame antagonist ploy in general, there exists a counter-weight in favour of imaginative story-telling and awe-inducing imagery that will have you mesmerised by all the colours, vivid details and lifelike quality to the otherwise very stylised and cartoonish animation. Audiences who shelf out a little extra for some 3D glasses will probably enjoy the visuals a little more but not by much—to its credit, Up uses the third dimension sparingly and without awkward 'Omygoditscomingatme!' contrivances; it's nice to see everything so crisp in three dimensions, but it certainly isn't mandatory in order to have a fun experience either.When it comes to pure storytelling, Up's screenwriters played their game basic, but not without some distinct charm and originality. While the general arc is very much the same as most animated films and Pixar's movies in general (get lost in an adventure, which in turn allows the characters to become more human and closer to each other), the writers spread enough character work entwined with some genuinely thrilling segments throughout to make the experience something of its own, albeit not quite as refreshing as earlier works. This small truth is something of a tagline price to the renowned and admired stature briefly touched upon in the opening paragraph; Up certainly is a Pixar movie—and a great one at that sure to please those who enjoy the studio's work thus far—yet it's not something to get overly excited about. Instead the movie works as a humble and affecting expansion on the tried and true formula so far developed from within. If that sounds a little underwhelming, don't let it deflate your balloons; Up nevertheless does what it sets out to do and does so whilst retaining that signature charm that audiences have warmed themselves up to for over a decade now; this is cinematic comfort food for sure, and as long as Pixar up the ante following this somewhat refrained piece, one can remain optimistic the next time your wallet is taxed for a movie with the name Pixar alongside side its credentials.<ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>",Null,0,0,21 October 2009
A Clockwork Orange," Memorably off the wall
","I think I may have just found my new favourite director.Stanley Kubrick outstrips himself yet again with a fantastic piece of film based upon the novel 'A Clockwork Orange' written by Anthony Burgess. Filled with superb acting, direction, dialogue and absolutely timeless photography; Clockwork Orange is a true masterpiece, often defining at every moment exactly why we watch movies.Throughout we are treated a whole ensemble of fantastic and sometimes zany performances from the whole cast, with special mention to McDowell in the lead role as the ever deranged and sadistic Alex DeLarge. This is perhaps my favourite feature of the movie and is indeed an absolute treat from beginning to end to watch McDowell go through nearly every emotion imaginable with uttermost believability and conviction. Not only this but there are some characters I will never forget because of the their seemingly surreal and disorientated nature that defies all reality or even normality, if there is even such a thing in Kubrick's directorial palette. This is quite a bit to do with their actual dialogue actually, often showcasing very proper and old English grammar, which contrasts the very nature of the scenes it is being used in to grand effect.This is also why I often found myself chuckling during quite a few scenes in the film. Whether it was seeing DeLarge bending over to have his anus inspected or the over-the-top nature of the officer in charge of his cell-block (whom often reminded me of John Cleese of Monty Python fame of all things), I loved the odd breaks in drama for a bit of tongue in cheek, dark witty humour often left out of such films.This however is probably not why A Clockwork Orange is hailed as the classic it is today. Instead it is the completely believable and realistic portrayal of torture and violence born in a very bleak and not so distant dystopian society. The whole affair is brought to life accordingly and very successfully through the main characters and their distinctive obsessions of mindless violence and rape. It is these themes and many others present during the film that makes it one of the most thought provoking and emotionally startling films ever made to date. With his previous film Kubrick sought to provoke the mind, but with Clockwork, he goes mainly for the heart and strikes emotions that are very rarely or only mildly touched on by any other movies.Another couple of things before I wrap this up: the camera work and photography are again beautiful and Kubrick's unique vision comes across vividly in the film, creating a world not easily forgettable. Furthermore -and another trademark of his- is the perfect use of classical music where it is needed, creating a brilliant soundtrack instantly recognisable from all others.So there you have it, just a few reasons why this movie will more than likely having you gripped, with your eyes unable to move away from the screen, whether you like it or not. And yes, you'll probably walk away quite a different person than you were when you sat down. That's the mark of a great film, and that is exactly what Stanley Kubrick does with A Clockwork Orange, showing why he was one of the finest directors of modern cinema.",9,4,7,2 October 2007
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," The cacophony of nothingness.
","When watching a movie such as Transformers 2, it is undoubtedly hard not to be bedazzled by all the glitter that flies at you every fifteen minutes. Whether it's the pristine CGI work that glistens with a glisten only glistening diamonds could pay for, or the high-name actors, director, writers and just about everything else involved in a production bigger and grander than your wildest imagination—well, sort of. You see, despite the fact that a single cluster of pixels within a single frame of Rise of the Fallen's two and a half hour tour de force of computer generated action, explosion and all abound balls to the wall ruckus fest is probably worth more than the car you drove to see the thing—despite this overarching sense of Hollywood spectacle, glamour and Event phenomena that so often surrounds major productions such as this, the overall effect is akin to finding a very large pastry that has taken the form of a succulent meat pie... without the meat.Yet following in the footsteps of an original feature that just about stunk to the high heavens in spite of its major budget and fancy effects, even the most optimistic of primes wouldn't be at fault for suspecting foul play at hand here. Even more unsurprising however is that Transformers 2 isn't by any means an improvement on its predecessor; sure enough, it makes everything bigger, blows more stuff up and achieves being a landmark in terms of cinematic effects, but is it any good? No, it's not. Following on almost directly from the previous feature, this follow up reintroduces the familiar faces of Optimus Prime, Megatron and Sam Witwicky and brings a few more into the game just to 'freshen' things up a little. The story, which takes about the length of a regular film to actually get moving, is slow, plodding and completely uninvolving. As usual, the basic threat is that the evil robots want to destroy the Earth and humanity along with it, and all the humans, good robots with senses of humour and a Kid With A Destiny attempt to kick all those party pooper robots back to where they came from. Ho-hum, right? Well yes, but then again a lot of action blockbusters take on the same basic premise and make it work. So what makes Transformers 2 the flat pancake of ideas that it is? Simple; there are no real characters here, the plot takes far too long to develop beyond anything rudimentary, and the special effects—although dazzling—take up far too much screen time away from those characters and story-lines that we should be paying attention to.As much as I like to play the characterisation horn however, there remains the question of how, if even possible, these men and women that occupy an adventure story so grand as Rise of the Fallen could ever truly steal the screen away from those fancy pixels. Well, the answer lies not too far away with writers Orci and Kurtzman's earlier blockbuster hit of the summer, Star Trek. Although far from perfect, Trek was an example of action done at the whim of character and plot rather than the other way around. Sure, it might not be quite as dazzling as Bay's outing here, yet Abrams also stood on firm ground by revolving his tension and climaxes around character conflict and tangible action. With Transformers there's an unsettling amount of irreverent inconsequence inherent to its lack of will; the pieces on the board move around on their own, change shape and have it out with each other, and yet there is little emotion or thrill to all the gun fights and flying shards of scrap metal. The characters—if you can even call them such—are just as useless.Yet it could be argued that each franchise stands on its own separate ground. With Transformers you have Bay and Megan Fox and in Star Trek you have Kirk and Abrams. When Fox struggles most of the movie to make more of an impression than her CGI backgrounds (and rather ironically too often looks even less realistic than most of them thanks to her excessive makeup fit for a circus clown) and the many feigned attempts at romance between her and co-star LaBeouf feel overly stilted and blasé, it isn't hard to see that the very palette that the film-makers have to work with here is very different. But then again, Fox in a way perfectly embodies the movie perfectly—nice to look at sure, as long as you avoid the suntanned puffer fish clown face and the whole, personality thing that's missing underneath. When it comes down to it, Rise of the Fallen is certainly this year's biggest movie, but it's also one of the most disappointingly trivial. Between expansive fight scenes and wise-cracking robots, the landscape portrayed by mega-star director Michael Bay here is lifeless and completely uninteresting. Those who crave nothing more than CGI robot kung-fu will lap this popcorn-fest up with vigour while the rest of us will simply have to sit back and try to ignore all that cash going down the proverbial drain. Yet that is, surprisingly, Transformers 2's biggest success—the comedy. Again, Orci and Kurtzman provide an amusing amount of comedic relief for audiences to breathe within throughout, giving the movie lighter, much more engaging side. Yet even so, the biggest pun here unfortunately is the cacophony of nothingness that is Rise of the Fallen with its endlessly pointless and forgettable drivel that permeates this multi-million polygonal excuse for a movie.<ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>",Null,1,5,7 July 2009
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," A fun, heartfelt and memorable contemporary romance with plenty of charm.
","Indie music and indie cinema; ostensibly, both make the perfect couple, like the jock and the prom queen- as ironic as that analogy may appear to be- both share common principles; basic instrumental accompaniment to heart-felt reflections on life in quirky yet considerably human ways; low-fi characters with small ideas but strangely larger than life philosophies on life's most simplistic qualms; and of course, a certain degree of pretension. Like it or not, both have common pros and cons that define what they are and who they indeed do or do not attract.While Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist cannot rightly be called an indie picture because of its production values, at its core lays a very simple, true-to-heart depiction of love within the big apple; youthful, neurotic, impulsive and warm to the touch. In this regard, director Peter Sollett crafts a picture that strikes on the same homebrew chords that your average independent record or movie usually hits, and does so with enough conviction to make an enjoyable ninety minutes out of it. Granted the movie's insistence upon the more youthful, contemporary teenage romance will no doubt shun away those disconnected to such 'crowds', but like the music itself, Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist serves to satisfy those who are drawn to the twangs and echoes of a troubled heart in search for company and does so aware and confident in that assertion.In many ways, Sollett's feature here can be directly compared to last year's similarly themed modern romantic comedy In Search of a Midnight Kiss. Set over the course of one eventful night in New York City, Nick & Norah is a tale of two people losing themselves in a midst of love, lust and romantic confusion. Of course, the movie doesn't set out to detail Nick (Michael Cera) and Norah (Kat Dennings) doing this together for the entirety of the movie; as most romantic comedies go, both characters must first realise that what they had before was nothing compared to what they have found in each other. Rather predictably, the ending will be no surprise to anyone, but for what it's worth, the story is compelling enough, funny enough and touching enough to sustain the attention for the short but sweet ninety minute runtime.It's this simplicity and small scope that gives Nick & Norah its real zest, portraying a night out in search for a mystery concert by each of the character's mutual favourite band -whilst also hunting down their drunken companions- in a concise and fleeting manner that reflects the movie's central themes. Like Midnight Kiss, Sollett manages to create a romantic, whimsy air about one seemingly insignificant day, so that by the time the credits role there is catharsis that resonates through its simple design. It's a tale that always feels natural and down to earth without succumbing to the much more mundane aspects of every day coming and goings; that is, of course, because this night is a special night for both Nick and Norah, as they both find what they have really been searching for all along.As far as this on-screen romance goes between Cera and Dennings, the result is compelling, but not entirely believable. Cera, who played alongside Ellen Page in last year's quirky teenage rom-com Juno, doesn't quite recapture the same emotional commitment that he had for Juno. Dennings too always feels natural and sure enough fits her character extremely well, but when put together with Cera, the result is mostly always lukewarm at best. In the end, the romantic aspect of Nick & Norah ends up being better in concept than in what eventually results on-screen, but that's not to say that such tinges of roses and happily-ever-afters are without their potency. The conclusion, which, as mentioned above, will surprise nobody, at least carries with it a firm sense of pathos that draws once again upon the movie's theme of wistful love born out of unsuspecting moments we normally wouldn't look twice upon.Cinema, much like its musical counterpart, has its own little niches, flavours, genres, scenes and crowds, all of which are dictated by taste. Nick & Norah is a feature that not only adopts this truth through its essence and themes, but also through the characters that make up its story. Each, you could argue, has their own 'songs', some of which carry on through others, and thus bonds and divisions are made from nowhere. It goes without saying then that while Nick & Norah certainly plays a well constructed song sure to attract those drawn to those particular sounds detailed above; those less inclined will be hard pressed to be converted. Yet with an airy, somewhat hypnotic and compelling story that has some great moments of laughter and romance, Nick & Norah provides a teenage rom-com that will no doubt please its niche crowd willingly and without compromise; a fun, heartfelt and memorable contemporary romance with plenty of charm.<ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>",Null,0,0,12 February 2009
The Green Mile," Touching Drama
","The Green Mile is a very touching film that creates memorable characters and takes care of them throughout its life, never neglecting nor smothering them. Darabront does well to bring all these characters into the big screen whilst balancing them perfectly with wonderful side stories along the way. Of course, Stephen King is the creative force behind the plot, and he does well here, delivering a story that is both captivating and mesmerising to watch.Performances from the cast are all exceptional and I mean all. Tom Hanks has always been a favourite actor of mines as his warmth and real sense of humanity always connect with me and pull me in to his characters. With the Green Mile, Hanks does a wonderful job yet again. Duncan and Jeter also caught my eye quite a lot, portraying their sympathetic characters with complete accuracy.David Tattersall also does what he does best by delivering wonderful cinematography that is simple yet undeniably interesting to look at from beginning to end. Overall, I loved this film and was in tears by the end. Definitely recommended to anyone and everyone.",8,0,2,22 October 2007
The Reader," Dubious and unremarkable.
","There's a rule in cinema that pretty much defines whether or not a story that centres on romance or love manages to engage its viewers in the manner in which it hopes. The best examples of such movies carefully warm us up to the individual characters and then slowly bring them closer and closer until we can't take it anymore; we will them on to find happiness within each other. The Reader, which ostensibly for the first half at the very least- can be described as a romantic drama, can be compelling watching, but only outside of its romantic interests. Hindered with lukewarm chemistry between the two leads and divulging in the obvious facets of a relationship with acute abrasiveness to the point where all subtle nuances are lost, the movie fails to establish its core with any resonance beyond its more obvious façade. As such, The Reader exists as a mostly dubious and unremarkable affair that only ever mildly engages, preferring instead to bore through laborious and dry characterisation than to compel through dynamism and chemistry needed to establish the central theme of love.For all intents and purposes, Bernhard Schlink's story (upon which David Hare's screenplay is based) is a tale divided into three distinct movements or, acts. Of course, most stories are of this design, yet the problem here is that Schlink, or rather, Hare makes his divisions all too obvious and fragmented to watch unfold. The seam that ties these three stories together are in place- two lovers and their tale of fleeting romance that lasted but a summer- yet the lines that separate them draw far too much attention to themselves than need be. The result is a story that can draw you in, only to perplex you moments later when you are whisked off to a different point in time. Furthermore, as is usually the case, there are acts here that are obviously stronger than others, and one can't help but feel that maybe there was a decent enough story to tell in just the first of the three. Yet indulging in a tale that transverses a series of decades, The Reader feels jarring in its approach, telling a story that has the potential to be gripping and moving, and yet never takes off thanks to its jittering and turbulent structure.Despite the feature's many technical problems that detract from the entirety of the experience however, there nevertheless remains a select array of elements that succeed in drawing you in. The first and foremost of these lies in the movie's aesthetics department, utilising soft, complementary photography that gives the film a sense of otherworldly realism that is always interesting to watch. Playing along beautifully in the background is the score penned by Nico Muhly, who up until this point has stuck mostly in Hollywood's back garden, so to speak. Muhly's score often complements the visuals in ways that echo the tranquil moments and the much more dissonant scenes built upon tension and conflict with much needed depth. It's a shame then that much of this inevitably goes to waste on a script that fails to establish character and performers who although delivering by the book renderings worthy of a look in for those interested in Oscar noodling- never come off the screen, failing to go beyond their caricature personas and truly touch the viewer.Taken as a whole, The Reader can be seen as a simple, lukewarm attempt at telling a story of love in all its complications- it also doesn't help that one of them was a guard for the SS. In this context, the movie can charm, but only with a timid sense of poignancy hinted at every half hour or so. The remainder of the feature then can't help but cave under the weight of such contrived pretensions from the director and his cast; we are told there is love here, and we can smell it somewhere off in the distance, but unfortunately that small glint of romance never reaches full climax, crescendo or even resonant motif. Instead The Reader bumbles along for the good part of two hours, middling in and out of mawkish clichés to the point where we honestly don't care where the characters go. Too much scope, with very little development or focus on the smaller aspects of what makes a love story compelling in the first place, The Reader is a troublesome, albeit slightly interesting story (historically speaking) that simply doesn't do enough to make it anything worth remembering.<ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>",Null,11,27,8 January 2009
The Wrestler," An unforgettable and powerful tale of personal triumph.
","They say that only two things in the world sell anything worth counting: sex, and violence. The former has been a well established industry tailed to sharks for near on centuries, whether it's been on the streets or on camera. The same principles can be said for the latter, but not for quite as long. When it comes to violence, there are a few examples of such that draw in the crowds, and certainly none do quite as much money and business today as the wrestling world. Back in the eighties however, it was different. The money was less grandiose, the fame limited to the fans inside the arena and the health care less than hospitable. The Wrestler which in turn takes it upon itself to document both sides of life's biggest cash cows, tells such a tale of hardship not often documented- about people who gave so much and received little but the select admiration from people heckling in the crowds- but it also tells a compelling character story to boot. The result is an often compelling, eye opening and heart wrenching experience that always feel real, human and dignified, despite its central character's sometime dubious outlook on such qualities within himself.While The Wrestler believe it or not- tells a story largely centred on a professional wrestler, now working his way through the harsh climate of independent organisations, the movie isn't as polarising or esoteric as you might imagine. Aronofsky, who, up until this movie has proved himself to be a director capable of telling grand stories, has always excelled in telling smaller ones revolving around human beings rather than obtuse ideas. Taking a step back from his previous effort which was a little on the robust side of things, the director here strips things down to a minimalistic character study with an under-riding story that delivers upon the theme of finding where you belong in life- who you are, and what you mean to the world. This shift in focus will certainly help ease in viewers who know nothing about professional wrestling, but that's not to say that Aronofsky neglects to detail the real hardship involved within the business.The Wrestler, while spending a lot of time inside the squared circle, makes such instances play second batter to the real core of the story which comes in the form of battered, bruised but still livid and 'dangerous' Randy 'The Ram' Robinson (Mickey Rourke). Through 'The Ram' the movie fleshes out the idea of wrestling as a spectacle, and the idea of a man as a burnt out but not entirely forgotten icon. Throughout the feature Robinson is put through tables, glass and barbed wire, but this is nothing it seems to the ordeals that happen outside the ropes. The script, which details Randy's domestic problems, is where the real substance of the character's personal story lies; there's his troublesome, unrequited affection for stripper Cassidy (Marisa Tomei) and his understatedly nonexistent relationship with estranged daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood), all of which comes crashing into perspective following an after-match heart-attack. Both stories share common themes; Randy wants them to find a place for him within their lives, but neither seem able to accommodate such an unstable commodity. For Cassidy, 'The Ram' is just a friendly customer who brings a smile with his money, and for Stephanie, her father is simply a screw-up who never showed any interest in her until his accident. At times, the script can get a little overbearing, and the ideas of such drama play out better than they do on screen, but both do plenty of justice to the eventual climax of the film which plays out with a coherent sense of realist poignancy fitting to the proceeding elements building up to that point. It's a stark, gutsy move by Aronofsky, but I could think of no better way to pull the curtain.If there is one element that such moments of drama really bring out within The Wrestler however, it is within the performances from the central cast. Rourke, who spends much of the feature as a man at odds with himself and unsure of where he truly belongs, consistently encapsulates the psyche and body language of such a figure. It's an understated performance, and the movie is all the better because of it. Yet when Aronosky calls for larger moments, Rourke accommodates such instances with just as much ease, never coming across as stunted or out of place. His co-stars Tomei and Wood always play second place to the leading man, but do fine jobs in their own rights. Tomei in particular gives an equally understated performance that capitalises on the script's multi-layered approach to her character; Cassidy is found bare from the waist up for a lot of the movie's runtime, but that's not to say that her character is anything as such. There's plenty of dynamism here, and Rourke and Tomei do a good job of bringing it to life without slipping into mawkish melodrama.And that, in turn, is what makes The Wrestler such a gripping, enthralling experience in the first place. With a mixture of three-dimensional drama and characterisation fluent with a well paced story that documents an under-documented side of the entertainment industry, The Wrestler can be a bloody mess at times, but only because that's how the lead character feels inside. It's a movie that tells a story fit for fables and legends, and yet it does so with an elegant refrain- and contrasted with the more viscerally compelling scenes of violence and personal struggle within a ring that feels more like home than his run-down trailer in the middle of nowhere, Randy 'The Ram' Robinson's story- much like himself- is an unforgettable and powerful tale of personal triumph; an eighties heavy metal classic fit to bang your head to and salute with a thousand lighters at the same time.<ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>",Null,1,3,19 January 2009
Defiance," Lacking the much needed emotional and visceral punch to propel it off the screen.
","Oppression, human injustice, cruelty, war and rebellion are themes that director Edward Zwick is now more than at home with. With Defiance which sets about to combine most elements from the director's previous works into a somewhat epic, somewhat dramatised account of a true story from the second World War, Zwick strives for greatness yet never achieves anything as such. The problem isn't that Defiance is a bad movie by any means—no, the flaw inherent to much of Defiance's downfall is simply that it neglects to evoke the emotion and attention required of the viewer. It seems throughout that the director simply assumes rather than depicts his story's self-importance. Of course by its very nature, Defiance is a hearty tale built around the overwhelming good that can come of a collective passion for facing adversity with courage and virtue—yet Zwick instead of portraying anything remotely likened to these attributes instead submits a work that feels half-baked and lacking the much needed emotional and visceral punch to propel it off the screen where it unfortunately suffers from a distinct lack of focus on its greater parts. Indeed, while Zwick may be at home with such bitter ingredients of humanity's condition, one has to wonder whether he has gotten too comfortable to be able to truly express them on-screen.If there is one dominant highlight to Defiance however, it is not through the movie's most overt examples of struggle in the many over-the-top action sequences and gun fights, but simply though the drama that permits a grim shadow to overtake all other elements of the feature. As a result, Defiance often struggles to stay afloat in spite of its heavy-handed themes, yet when deeply involving in developing and allowing moments to envelop the viewer, the movie regains its sense of conviction even if it soon dissipates not long after. This focus on human survival and spirit often comes in the form of leader Tuvia Bielski's (Daniel Craig) legion of Jewish non-combatant refuges rescued from the oppression of Germany's invasion of Eastern Europe. While Craig himself is notably off-key here with many moments that border on jarringly appalling, the remainder of the cast more often than not manage to bring with them the sense of humanity and passion that the screenplay sadly lacks. Zwick, at times, neglects to fully capitalise on these attributes and instead shifts the direction of the movie towards more obvious forms of struggle, yet there remains a key motif present within the feature to keep it above water.The action scenes as they stand, despite their insistence on irksomely showing up at all the wrong times, are nevertheless solid and exactly what you would come to expect from director Zwick. Echoing his previous features which range from being overtly action-based to a much more Defiance¬-like 'drama with action' stories, this outing for the film-maker pulls out all the stops in crafting somewhat exciting depictions of gunfights and air raids that never take things too far into the glamorised Hollywood domain. Remaining true to the script's realistic, gritty nature based upon actual events, Defiance will more than likely please those looking for a war movie with a little depth rather than vice versa—indeed, the excitement too often overshadows any emotions evoked by other segments within the movie, but only ever distractingly so.When the final credits roll, despite several moments of compelling character drama or action—despite the many stark and breath-taking images that Zwick inflicts upon you—despite such moments, Defiance can't quite escape the fact that it lacks any drive or momentum. The result is a feature that looks like its doing plenty, sounds like its saying a lot and moves exactly as such; but simply does not feel quite as invigorating. To say that Zwick's work here failed to compel me as much as it should have considering its premise and source material would be a grave understatement—Defiance tells an important, true-to-life account of a dark period in recent humanity's struggle to live with itself brimming with gritty realisations of these themes. Yet with a script that fails to give its performers anything of substantive quality to work with, an overlong, overbearing runtime and a barrage of undercooked characters and establishments of atmosphere or tone other than solid grey bleak abandonment; Defiance is too grim for its own good and eventually crumbles under the weight of its own ambition. For what should be an uplifting and revitalising tale steeped in pathos, Defiance is instead only sporadically engaging and lacking in the required heart or passion needed to truly convey the core of its own message.<ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>",Null,6,11,16 May 2009
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Alive, vibrant and emotionally resonant.
","Woody Allen is a filmmaker known for his somewhat counter-culturist views upon romance, love and the modern relationship in all their nuances and tiny, overlooked details that elude the consciousness of your average audience member. As a result, Woody has never quite achieved global acclaim from audiences world over, and has, to this day, stuck largely to the shadows of movie-as-art cultists and to the pages and pages of film reviews penned by adoring film critics.Vicky Cristina Barcelona, which unmistakably sees the director returning to a form that has been rather murky in his latest works, is no real change of pace for the artist, sculpting an anti-romance of sorts that reaffirms tragic, romantic love in ways of truth and transient beauty rather than cliché and formula. This blatant disregard for cinema, and indeed society's views upon what love is, should be and should not ever thrive for, is sure to grate on the more reserved viewer's willingness to attach to a world stripped of its façade and safe, cosy pretensions. If anything, Vicky Cristina Barcelona, despite its minor faults here and there, attains a sense of coherency and fulfilling social catharsis that propelled the director to stardom decades ago, all the while without tiresomely repeating himself.Of course, one of the ways in which Allen immediately distances himself from both his previous works, and the very idea of traditional, American-filtered romance is by shifting the location from skyscrapers and hot dog stands to villas and small markets. Taking place entirely on location within Barcelona itself, Vicky Cristina Barcelona manages to strike a tone that is both romantic and yet without whimsy pretence; for sure, there are elements to Woody's story here that border on breaking the illusion of passion that he is adamant to create, but such instances are too often overshadowed by the director's keen eye for beauty kept in check with a distinct key of realism.This extra blend of unpolluted truth and introspection into love comes sharply into focus with the movie's central male character who comes in the form of bohemian artist and lover of life in all its bitter cruelties and tragic delights, Juan Antonio Gonzalo (Javier Bardem). Juan, at times, can be a little overwhelming, not just for those on screen, but for those watching it all unfold; his very outlook on life isn't the accepted standard for romantic films of this kind, and yet this is his very pulling power. It's not long then that the two female (American tourist) love interests of Juan soon come to see that not only is Juan something quite unlike anyone they have met before, but that his very presence unsettles their preconceived ideas and plans that they thought beforehand- were perfect.It is this element of Vicky Cristina Barcelona that gives it its real zest and subtle form of vibrancy if you will, establishing a formless, boundless, counter-viewpoint on love, romance and sexual relations. As such as Juan's bohemian mind state often dictates, Allen reflects the ideas of said lifestyle in his portrayal that goes beyond his characters' development and at times even seeps into the narration and artistic deliverance of his feature. From the beautiful, elegant on-location photography that complements the script's themes poignantly to a score that establishes a romantic, foreign overtone to everything that is played underneath, Vicky Cristina Barcelona provides a romantic film experience that does not pander to the expectations of its immediate audience, instead giving a sharp, focused, and all the more convincing and compelling portrayal of romance that questions the very reasons we fall in love in the first place.Most Hollywood features refuse to ask such questions however, and it would seem that a large majority of audiences would rather not be presented with the answers either. Yet as has been the case with Woody for many decades now, such under-the-rug apathy never did interest either him or his admirers, and in that vein at least, Vicky Cristina Barcelona satisfies by telling a story sure to adored by anyone ready for art that speaks in its own whimsical, neurotic yet safely grounded and human, honest and beautifully poetic way. Granted, there are some problems inherent to the overall experience that Mr. Allen paints us here (one of which simply being that I wanted more), yet cushioned with four flawless performances, chemistry that leaps off the screen and a screenplay that consistently breaks boundaries without resorting to stultifying disregard for narrative, Vicky Cristina Barcelona most importantly feels alive, vibrant and emotionally resonant.<ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>",Null,2,6,18 February 2009
Pineapple Express," Pineapple Express is good for many things, but the thing that it does best is in making you laugh.
","There's no doubt about it, Pineapple Express is a relentlessly funny stoner movie, start to finish with little in the way of compromise; telling the story of two stoners, who end up entangled within a drug conspiracy plot that threatens their lives while smoking plenty of pot along the way, this year's latest instalment to the genre is the finest example of dumb -but well delivered- comedy yet. One discrepancy against it's classification as a stoner comedy however lies in that even if you're not high yourself; even if you've never even been high in your life, there's still lots of fun to be had here as the jokes are broad enough in their design to apply to any ridiculous situation. So while the plant obviously makes a starring role here, the focus is not primarily on it, and the movie is better off as a result.So far this year we have been treated to an unusually high dosage of stoner comedies, with Pineapple Express being a late third behind the too-dumb-for-it's-own-good Strange Wilderness and the dumb-but-fun Harold & Kumar. However, despite coming in late to the game, the old expression of 'saving the best 'till last' seems applicable here. Where previous instalments from this year combined the dumb with surreal through incoherent situations obviously dreamt up from people who were under the influence at the time, Pineapple Express feels silly, but not the extent where the entire feature boils down to caricature comedy. Here the writers take two characters, start them off one place and take them on an adventure not just through crime, car-chases, comical fight scenes and little personal squabbles, but through themselves. It's a combination which could have had a disastrously polarising effect, but the writers get it spot on here.Main characters Dale Denton (Seth Rogan) and Saul Silver (James Franco) may have alliterative names akin to comic book heroes, but they're certainly not of that kind. Instead, they deal with drugs; Saul is Dale's supplier, and as much as Saul would like to think of Dale as a buddy, Dale wants nothing else to do with him outside of the service he provides. However, after Dale witnesses a murder involving some drug-dealer crimelords, the two are forced to embark on a journey that will have them at odds with each other whether they like it or not. What results of this is a story of friendship, and while the unlikely premise of these guys not exactly getting along does seem a bit shifty, the chemistry between Rogan and Franco is superb enough to allow their characters plenty of growing. To be sure, this isn't a hallmark drama, there are no grandeur statements and no tears are provoked from director David Gordon Green but that's what makes it lovable; it's a story about two regular guys, who get into crazy shenanigans, smoke weed and crack some jokes. It's not enlightening per se, but it's entertaining, and down to earth.This is where Pineapple Express begins to take the lead in front of its predecessors, as it actually attempts to tell a compelling story with an undoubtedly overblown amount of action, but with grounded drama to bear the weight of its fabrications. Through this fusion of solid characterisation with a ridiculous but conceivable action-packed plot, the film succeeds in creating an engagingly entertaining experience that doesn't just provide excitement and memorable characters, but also manages to tickle the funny bone just as frequently.Coming from the three guys who last year blessed the screen with the hilarious Superbad, Pineapple Express is a riot start to finish, combining lots of blunt dialogue with slapstick and farce to great effect in ways which made the aforementioned creation as funny as it was. It has to be said that this time around, the pacing isn't quite as tight, and the script's insistence on some scenes' ability to sustain laughter is a little off, and this in turn leads to the movie's only real technical fault. In such moments, jokes will be drawn out for long stretches of time, losing momentum, yet thankfully such scenes are far and few between, and with the pace heightening the more film reaches the conclusion; the frequency sharply decreases with time. Nevertheless, if you don't mind profane dialogue, blunt jokes and plenty of passive violence used mainly for comic effect, then Pineapple Express should please any desire for laughter that you may have.And that's all it basically comes down to, but what else were you expecting? As a movie, Pineaple Express is an entertaining and at times sweet take on friendship based around two very down to earth characters that most people should be able to relate to in some way or another. As a duo, Rogan and Franco are extremely well matched, with the interplay between the two coming off as naturally comical and aptly delivered to the point of satisfying the movie's biggest pulling point and focus. With some great action scenes tinged with plenty of comedy, all revolving around some memorable characters portrayed by enthusiastic, suitably cast performers who end up within a plot which is admittedly hammy, but fun all the same; Pineapple Express is good for many things, but the thing that it does best is in making you laugh, and it does so with enough frequency to make this one of this year's greater comedies.<ul><li>Written by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>",Null,28,50,10 September 2008
Slumdog Millionaire," There just isn't enough to invest in.
","For films such as Slumdog Millionaire, it can oft be hard to distinguish just what the director behind the project was intending to provoke from their audience. On the one hand, Slumdog tells a compelling and mostly interesting rags-to-riches story topped off with a sugar coated ending with extra sprinkles that- while notably hammy- doesn't cross over into absurdity. Yet it also tries to tell another tale alongside it, this time revolving around a romance that never quite takes off in the way that director Danny Boyle wishes it to. Boyle, who up to this point is known for his sensually driven works, surprisingly hasn't touched upon romance at least in the quantity and focus as to which Slumdog Millionaire implies; unfortunately, this lack of experience on his part shows throughout. So although the majority of the feature remains as a somewhat uplifting and compelling drama on base level, a distinct lack of focus in characterisation and chemistry stops the movie from ever going beyond its ostensible ideas and generic façade. In the end I found myself moved more by what Slumdog wanted to say rather than what it did say.Taking place largely in flashback mode, Slumdog Millionaire tells the story of Jamal Malik (Dev Patel, Ayush Mahesh Khedekar, Tanay Chheda), a- well- 'slumdog'. Born in the slums and raised for the most part as an orphan, Jamal is a quiet, well-intentioned boy with a big heart and even bigger eyes for opportunity and beauty. It isn't long before he spots Latika (Freida Pinto, Rubiana Ali, Tanvi Ganesh Lonkar) and from here on in it would seem the story writes itself. From here the script moves in and out of telling a mystery thriller seeped in slow paced drama, and diverging upon a romance which feels forced and laboured.A much more compelling element within Slumdog's narrative however lies in the way in which the story is framed within a retelling of the protagonist's chance of lifetime on game show Who Wants to be a Millionaire?. This otherwise gauche framing device serves as a surprisingly effective way in which to chop up Jamal's childhood and teenage life into its most digestible pieces without seeming too contrived, whilst also paving way for the movie's big finale which makes the most out of the slow building momentum of the first two acts. The result of this clashing between engaging drama and forgettable romance is jarring however; there are times when Slumdog soars and times when it gets downright irksome.One thing that usually remains as something to look forward to within a Danny Boyle feature however lies within its aesthetics. Taking place entirely within the impoverished areas of India, the movie establishes strong images and motifs throughout which in turn further the film's emotional and psychological connections with the viewer. From the patched, duct-taped, second-hand nature of everything, the world of Slumdog Millionaire entices ideas of existentialism not just through its protagonist's story but through the environment in which he exists. This, coupled with a magnificent score and soundtrack which more often than not gives the movie its biggest and most memorable sequences, provide a sensual experience that one now comes to expect when greeted by the name Danny Boyle.I couldn't help but wish that such ideas and care were taken with the remainder of the feature however; especially concerning the romance played out by the lead performers. Boyle, who is inexperienced to some degree in handling such dynamics, doesn't do much to provide any interest in the protagonist's love interest- it's clear that youthful, whimsical love is certainly implied within the constructs of this average romance and yet it is never truly shown. This generic approach to storytelling inevitably hurts Slumdog to the point that many of its sequences which draw heavily upon this much needed chemistry fall on their face. The actors themselves are fine and able- and provide excellent performances in all other respects- but as a pair, there just isn't enough to invest in.This in turn brings me to my final conclusion on what is essentially a mixed bag of engaging drama and tepid fairytale; Slumdog Millionaire is a fine picture- it provides a heart-warming story with all its intentions in the right places, and yet it doesn't ever convince in its ability to connect with the viewer. What results is a lukewarm, temporal pleaser, but certainly not one to be cherished for years to come.<ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>",Null,2,4,24 January 2009
Valkyrie," Swap the name Hitler with Lex Luthor and you have yourself a thrilling ride.
","When it comes to World War II, there are undoubtedly a myriad of different stories to be told, whether from the front-lines of the war itself or from those left back home. It goes without saying then that such an entertainment industry which thrives upon compelling situations thriving with drama and action would be foolish not to capitalise on such a historical, iconic and memorable piece of history which was, regrettably, brimming with such qualities. Such has been Hollywood's claim for many a year now, throwing out broad examples of tales from the front-lines of war, some which do justice to the horrors of those years, some of which only seem to belittle.Valkyrie then, with its stars and creators rooted in popcorn fodder action movies at first comes off more aligned to the latter. It's sophomoric in its historical significance; facile, kitsch and watered down for the sake of telling a thrilling story and yet if taken strictly on a fictional base, at least does so formidably. On this ground I feel somewhat divided; on the one hand Valkyrie uses it's 'true story' to evoke feelings from the audience that a film dealing with fabricated events (although, one could argue McQuarrie & Alexander's script to be more a work of fairytale than fact) would have to establish from the ground up; and yet there's also the undeniable truth that Singer and co do a brilliant job of telling a compelling and well constructed story full of high tension action and suspense. In the end, I had to let go my reservations for Valyrie's attempt at providing a historical account set to enlighten and instead imagine I was watching Mission Impossible set in 1940's Germany.Whether or not this evokes any reaction from audiences is a matter of speculation only on the part of myself, but I really can't see it irking much more viewers any more than it did myself. Granted, during the first act of the feature I was troubled with Tom Cruise and his über-Americano stature- which in turn negates any sense of engrossment within the story's supposed deep rooted truth- yet as the movie goes on and things begin to be put in place, Valkyrie moves on from caricature impressionism into an engaging form of entertainment; the historical backing in turn becomes redundant, and sure, this spoils the aforementioned pre-connection to the story itself, but swap the name Hitler with Lex Luthor and you have yourself a thrilling ride regardless of all the uniforms and salutes.So who then is our Superman- our Ethan Hunt perhaps? Well of course that comes in form of Tom Cruise under the guise of Claus von Stauffenberg, a colonel disillusioned by Hitler's war. Opening the feature with perhaps its only reel of German dialogue, Stauffenberg ridicules Hitler's war and demeans it to the point of embarrassment; there's no denying that this colonel isn't alone, and that's exactly what Valkyrie sets out to explore. From here the movie attempts to convey the idea that not all Germans were saluting national socialists bending to the whim of their Führer; indeed, there were many who directly opposed his reign and wanted him stripped of control- to free Germany of Hitler would mean freeing his people of absolute disaster in the eyes of their opposed forces. It's no surprise then that much of Valkyrie dabbles in and out of the building cascade of rebellion from those initiating the now infamous 'Valkyrie' operation, detailing the intrinsic planning and implementation required to pull such an attempt to assassinate and cut off the head of Germany's war machine.For the most part, particularly throughout the movie's latter acts, Valkyrie tells a compelling and rigorous story of espionage and political plotting; the tension riding high during the movie's biggest scenes- some of which providing excellent visuals complementing the bubbling suspense underneath. Granted, there are many instances which only work to belittle both Singer's movie and the facts it is based upon themselves, but such moments are far and few between the greater, more viscerally adoptive ones. Cruise, who admittedly feels out of place within the feature's opening sequences, does well to transform as he does in his greatest roles, disappearing completely behind his persona to great effect. The same unfortunately cannot be said for a few supporting cast members, yet with such a large ensemble, this doesn't prove too much to put up with.Conclusively, despite a few reservations about the movie's willingness for you to submit to the script's supposed foothold in fact, Valkyrie at the very least provides a decently paced and constructed story that will disgruntle historians but please those looking for a good story. Of course there are a myriad of problems, most of which occur during the film's opening, stultifying act, but if taken with a grain of forgiveness, Cruise, Singer and co do well to keep you firmly in your seat to see where it all goes wrong for Stauffenberg and his ever hopeful rebels with a cause. More Mission Impossible than Der Untergang or Saving Private Ryan, Valkyrie is a fine and riveting effort plagued by the very historical setting to which it subscribes to; World War II it seems is a playground for film-makers with ideas of grandeur and yet Singer here constantly feels like he should stick to the pages of comic books rather than those of solidified history.<ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>",Null,2,3,5 February 2009
