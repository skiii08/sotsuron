Miracle," I'm a Believer!
","Being a hard core hockey fan, I viewed this movie with some skepticism. It didn't take long, however to make me a believer in miracles. Kurt Russell nailed the part. The hockey player/actors were totally convincing in their first foray into acting. The music, sets, costumes and interlacing of current events perfectly captured the 'feeling' of the time. The piece de resistance was the action sequences which put the viewer right there on the ice in the middle of all the plays. I think this was an incredible piece of movie making. As for the fans who commented on the 'mistake' showing 4 periods on the score board, according the Olympic Hockey Rules, Once into the medal round at the Olympics, if a game is tied after three periods the teams play 10 minutes of overtime and, if still tied, the game is decided on a shootout. For the gold medal game, it is 20 minutes of OT before the shootout. Hence the '4th period', which in this case, was unnecessary.",Null,1,1,24 May 2004
Lost in Translation," This is one movie that should stay lost in the bargain bin.
","I've read the comments for and against this movie and am amazed at the wide disparity of viewpoints. I personally found little of interest in this mundane effort. Sure, the Tokyo scenes were amazing and the cultural differences were amusing, but the main reason I saw this movie was to experience the scenes of the interaction between the two leading characters.Well, they put me to sleep. In fact the entire premise was absurd. There was just no depth unlike other relationship movies such as My Life as a House, or The Ice Storm, which imbues its characters with such humanity. Might I also mention the gratuitous use of the opening butt scene and the strip club scene to obtain an R rating. This appeared like an afterthought, rather than a skillfully crafted part of the storyline. Gratefully, this movie's length was mercifully brief. I think, as other users have suggested, that the critical acclaim showered upon Ms. Coppola has more to do with lineage than talent.",Null,1,3,17 May 2004
