The Longest Yard," Something for everyone here,a brilliant family film.
","This was a family birthday treat for me,our group had 2 adults and 4 children ages 15,13,8. I knew it was in some way a spin off from the film Burt Reynolds had been in several years ago(loved it!),but to be perfectly honest the big attraction for us seeing this particular film was Adam Sandler...We love every film that amazing fella has been in,he rocks!! what a fabulously entertaining film this is too...The sound track was right up my son's street, to be honest i don't really like that sorta music,but, on this occasion it was brilliant.. Every single one of us enjoyed every single minute,and we were still having a good laugh on the way home at the one liners and other hilarious scene's that tickled us pink...What a treat this film was for all of us.Can't wait to buy it on DVD. FANTASTIC...Don't really care what anyone else thought...we loved it.. Yes there were sexual references, innuendo,swearing, but it was nothing that most kids don't hear somewhere these days. The world seems to be a very violent, broadminded and uncontrollable place. This film was viewed by our children under adult guidance an we didn't find it offensive in the slightest,very tongue in cheek in parts. Still a very well deserved 10/10",10,1,3,2 October 2005
