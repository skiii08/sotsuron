The Blair Witch Project," Succeeds on its own terms but let's hope it's not the wave of the future.
","When a film comes along with this much pre-release buzz it's difficult to go into the theatre without SOME kind of preconceived notion about what it is and what it's supposed to do. After seeing it, my feeling is that it was a very good film, using a concept that hasn't been done to death and one that served the filmmakers well. Let's hope, however, that this will not now become the cinematic wave of the future. We don't need every bunch of amateurs in the world running around with camcorders doing pseudo-cinema verite documentaries and foisting them on the public!The appeal of 'BWP' to me was not as The World's Scariest Movie but rather as an examination of what stress and fear can do do people in adverse and extraordinary circumstances. Looking at it this way I think it succeeded admirably. One of my favorite moments in the film comes when the two young men almost get hysterical when they find they've been tramping through the woods all day and have arrived at the place they started. Heather, the filmmaker, repeatedly assures them that they haven't, then out of their hearing breaks down crying, confessing to herself that in fact they are back where they began.The idea to suggest frightening sights rather than to show them was a good one that works well. There was one point, though, when Heather was running in fear and screams 'What the **** is that!' that I thought they could have at least shown a shadowy suggestion of SOMETHING. But I can't criticize the direction the filmmakers took, because it worked. I think they made the film they set out to do. A masterful job was done of building suspense throughout the entire movie and the climax occurs right at the very last moment, like the best Edgar Allan Poe stories. Hype and expectations aside, I thought 'The Blair Witch Project' succeeded on its own terms.",8,1,2,11 August 1999
Love and Death," One of Woody's (or anybody's) funniest.
","Which movie of Woody's was it in which he talked to aliens who expressed a liking for his 'early, funny' movies? In any case this is perhaps his funniest. His lampooning of the great Russian dramas are hilarious to those who have even a passing familiarity with them, and even if you don't, the jokes come so fast and furious that it literally is a laugh a minute--at least! Woody and Diane Keaton were a great comedy team. They were really at the top of their game when they made this one. I'll resist the urge to repeat laugh lines here and just recommend that fans of good comedy see it.",10,23,29,20 May 1999
Malcolm X," Epic film does justice to its subject.
","Spike Lee struggled mightily to get 'Malcolm X' made, financially and artistically. But when all was said and done, he produced an epic blockbuster and a definite treatment of the man's life.There's great differences between the two as well, but to me Lee has many things in common with Oliver Stone. Both of them seem to have been born to make films. Both of them are uncompromising in bringing their artistic (and moral) vision to the screen, and neither will try to seduce the public by catering to their tastes. Both present their own interpretation of facts without apology. (For example, from what I've read it's not certain that Malcolm's father was actually killed by Klansmen. But Lee isn't in the same league as Stone when it comes to playing fast and loose with the 'truth.') Stone even ends his movie 'Nixon' in a similar way to 'Malcolm X,' with footage of real-life figures blended in, though I'm not accusing Stone of imitation.This movie has an epic sweep and scope and as a director Lee is up to the challenge. He is served well by being able to direct in several styles, one of which is almost cartoonish: witness the scene where Malcolm (Denzel Washington) and Shorty (played by Lee himself) go stepping out at the Roseland Ballroom, resplendent in their zoot suits. Some comic relief is welcome at times because otherwise the serious, heavy message of the picture might be overwhelming. For instance, the movie opens with a full-screen shot of an American flag while we hear a voice-over of one of Malcolm's most rousing, or inflammatory speeches, depending on how you look at it ('I accuse the white man of being the greatest murderer on the planet!') The flag begins to burn and eventually forms a flaming 'X' as the fiery rhetoric continues. But if you haven't been scared away, the next scene shows the young man Malcolm Little in a funny situation, having his hair straightened by a concoction that threatens to burn off his scalp.Denzel Washington has won beaucoups of rightly-deserved accolades for his amazing performance in the title role. If you've ever heard or seen Malcolm X's speaking, you will be astounded at the similarities in tone and cadence. The illusion is so real one may not recognize that real archival footage of Malcolm is used late in the film. But this is not a case of style over substance here. Between Washington's talent and Lee's directing and screenwriting, an unforgettable character emerges. The film boasts other fine performances by Al Freeman, Jr. (especially good as Elijah Muhammad, a controversial figure in society, and eventually to Malcolm himself), Delroy Lindo, Albert Hall, Kate Vernon, Ernest Thomas and many others in its large cast.It's clear that Lee doesn't care for the Motion Picture Academy and they don't particularly care for him. But the snubbing he and his picture got at Oscar time would be comparable to Richard Attenborough and 'Ghandi' not being nominated the year that film was made. Ordinarily, one would think this film is the kind of production Hollywood loves to honor. But Academy Award nominations or not, the film 'Malcolm X' is like the man himself: impossible to ignore.",10,103,137,19 June 1999
Lost in Translation," The reverse 'Gigli?'
","Being an 'art-house' kind of guy, I was really looking forward to this picture, having seen the previews half-a-dozen times and taking in all the stellar reviews. So I was somewhat disappointed to find that when I actually saw the film, I spent a good bit of the time a little, well...bored. I'd give it a thumbs-up over a thumbs-down, certainly, but it wouldn't be an enthusiastic one.The big problem for me was the relationship between the two main characters. It just didn't click the way it should have. The character of Charlotte in particular seemed to me to be a little weakly drawn, and though Scarlett Johansson is definitely appealing, as an actress she doesn't look to me to be capable of turning in an outstanding performance yet. (Addendum: I was quickly disabused of this notion soon after when I saw 'Girl with a Pearl Earring!') Bill Murray's Bob Harris fares a lot better, but admit it, for all the praise he receives he isn't one of our greatest actors either. I found the 'evening out' scene to be interminable--I knew it would be difficult if not impossible for the film to redeem itself totally after being so discomfited by it.I found Sofia Coppola's script to be far more the bigger problem here than her directing. Besides the characters and the relationship not really jelling for me, I was too often distracted by her minimalist (for lack of a better word) style that frequently cropped up. Too many scenes had scant dialog, music or even background noise for a film that was not profound enough to justify it.Having trashed 'LIT' pretty well, let me point out some of the good things in it, and there are a number. As intimated before, Coppola's direction is very nice in many places. The Japanese locale is not just a convenient exotic backdrop, it's an integral, indispensable part of the film. Her presentation of the country is wonderful. She captures the not only the marvelous sights so well, but also the country's culture, both the pure and the Western hybrid varieties. Oftentimes, to great effect, we see some odd happening going on and it's not explained to us. We stay just as bewildered as the characters, and this works very well indeed. And Murray's humor is made excellent use of also, whether he's tossing of the 'ring-a-ding-ding' one-liners or, in the movie's funniest scene, trying to get rid of a gift of a Japanese role-playing hooker. Another great moment comes when Bob Harris is flipping channels trying to find something comprehensible on Japanese TV when he comes across his own image with dubbed-in voice--it's actually a clip of Murray from an old 'Saturday Night' show. Nice.It seems to me that this film might be a sort of reverse 'Gigli' for 2003: everyone seems as willing to believe the rave reviews about it as they were to accept unquestioningly all the bad things said about the Affleck/Lopez film. 'Lost in Translation' is an OK movie, certainly more good than bad, but don't feel like you have to act like it's a work of genius just because so many others say it is. You're not alone in your lesser opinion of it.",6,0,0,17 October 2003
Barry Lyndon," More confirmation of Kubrick's extraordinary genius.
","I think that 'Barry Lyndon' is the film that really cements Stanley Kubrick's reputation into place among his most devoted fans. If he'd only made '2001' he'd still be considered a genius. Since he followed that with 'A Clockwork Orange' he moved up a notch to approach immortal status. But after making another 180 degree turn, taking on the historical novel/costume drama, and coming up with something this brilliant and stunning, well then, now was the time for deification. Has any director ever made three masterpieces in a row that were as different and as totally unique as these three?One of the most beautifully photographed of all movies, the film canvases Kubrick creates are glorious, interiors and exteriors alike. It almost seems then to be an embarrassment of riches for the film to have such an engrossing story and vivid characters as well. As is usually the case in the man's films, the movie itself is the star and the actors, no matter how well they perform, tend to be subordinate. In another director's hands, 'Barry Lyndon' might have been a star vehicle for Ryan O'Neal and Marisa Berenson. Certainly they both do adequate jobs here in the best roles of their careers, but they can't help but be a little overwhelmed by the whole. Good performances in the supporting roles often get overlooked as well, for example those by Leon Vitali and Hardy Kruger, to name just two.Many have heard about the miracle Kubrick performed by filming this movie using only natural light or candlelight, but knowing or not knowing that wouldn't increase or decrease the viewer's enjoyment of this film one bit. Though he made two more excellent films after this one (with one more still to come!), 'Barry Lyndon' to me stands as Stanley Kubrick's last undisputed work of genius. Well... maybe 'The Shining.'",10,1,2,25 May 1999
Dog Day Afternoon," Pacino and Lumet at their best!
","Al Pacino has portrayed some memorable characters in some classic movies like 'Serpico,' 'Scent of a Woman,' 'Donnie Brasco' and the three 'Godfather' Films. 'Dog Day Afternoon' and Sonny Wortzik belong high on that list.As the movie opens, Sonny and his two-man gang are nervously waiting outside a Brooklyn bank which they intend to rob. Sonny has a plan all worked out, but after the robbery begins, it quickly unravels. Not the least dismaying development is that the bank is almost out of cash. Shortly after this revelation, police begin to arrive in numbers that would be able to lay siege to a small country (Wyoming, maybe?) This sets up a hostage situation that lasts the afternoon and late into the night.One might think this setting might make things a little claustrophobic but director Sidney Lumet has handled this problem before; witness his film 'Twelve Angry Men.' The goings-on in the bank itself are fascinating as the moods and relationships of the hostages and their captors develop and change over the course of the long day. Out on the street the crime scene immediately turns into a circus with thousands of onlookers straining at police lines, news media doing everything they can to get close to the story, and a new busload of police arriving every few minutes.Great performances are all over the place here. This is a tour-de-force for Pacino, even by his standards, as the bungling crook who has instantly become the biggest media star in the city. Sonny may have blown the first role, but he shines in the second. One of Pacino's 'Godfather' brothers, John Cazale is excellent is the less-flashy role as Sonny's partner Sal, definitely not the brains of this operation. Events are soon beyond Sal's comprehension and his subtle performance is wonderful. Charles Durning is super as police lieutenant Moretti who works as hard as he can to keep the situation from spinning totally out of control. He's juggling desperate fugitives in the bank, a crowd growing crazier and crazier, aggressive newspeople, and some of his own cops who are ready to end this thing with a bang. When the FBI shows up, the agent in charge (James Broderick) doesn't even say hello to Moretti. He cooly assesses the situation and decides their plan of action, and from that moment on there is a grim air of fatalism hanging over Sonny and Sal.There are more twists and turns we won't go into here. This is a great work by Pacino, Lumet, and most of the other actors in the film. I loved it.",10,69,82,1 June 1999
The Last Emperor," Glorious epic of 20th century China told through a man's life.
","They speak English in 'The Last Emperor,' but when one begins watching it, he or she might feel as if they'd been placed in an alien culture with little understanding of what is going on. Things get more Anglo-friendly with the addition of a character played by Peter O'Toole and the longer you watch, the more you will enjoy, even with the 3-hour, 39-minute version. The wonderful ending alone would make it worth watching that long.'Epic' is the operative word here in this Bernardo Bertolucci film about the history of one man and the growth of a nation. The film follows the life of Pu Yi, the last in the line of 2,000 years worth of royal emperors, crowned when he was but three years old. We see him unknowingly abdicate his throne as a boy, held virtual prisoner among the greatest opulence as a teenager, then seduced by the warlike Japanese as a young man, who return him to the throne as a puppet over Manchuria, which they've conquered. This narrative is intercut with his imprisonment and 're-education' as a war criminal during the time of Mao-Tse Tung. There's not a great deal of what we normally term as 'action,' but there is an intriguing story and plenty of glorious sites to see. This panoramic film is as big as China and deserves to be seen. John Lone and Joan Chen star.",8,3,4,2 September 1999
2001: A Space Odyssey," ( A top 10 film) It can change your life.
","What made '2001...' such a memorable moviegoing experience for this young person back in the late 60's was the realization that the filmmaker required you to THINK for YOURSELF, a rarity then, before or after. So many films lead you by the nose to an obvious conclusion, then congratulate you for doing it. Kubrick challenged his audience and showed confidence in them. Many people complain that the meaning is too obscure for them to understand, and I admit I wasn't all clear on it until I read Arthur C. Clarke's novel. Watching the movie it is easy to miss some crucial information. But the experience was still overwhelming to me anyway, even when I wasn't fully sure of what I'd seen. A viewer shouldn't feel thick-headed because everything is not revealed to him or her at once. The movie has plenty of rewards anyway.To those who have grown up in the post-'Star Wars' era, the movie might seem especially slow and even dull. Indeed, when I saw it again around 1980 it seemed that way to me. But further perspective has once again placed it on its lofty pedestal. A young viewer today should try to keep in mind that in its time, it was showing off state-of-the art techniques.It's beyond my meager ability to give any comprehensive or definitive look at a phenomenon the magnitude of '2001'. All I can say is it showed me that a work of art, in this case a movie, could truly be mind-expanding, and as such actually change one's life.",10,0,2,22 April 1999
This Is Spinal Tap," Rockumentary is a mockumentary
","This is FANTASTIC! Writers Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer in collaboration with director Rob Reiner have created a satire so dead-on its target that it might be scary if it wasn't so hilarious.Filmmaker Marty DiBergi, taking a break from dog food commercials, is determined to capture the sights, sounds and smells of his favorite rock group, the legendary Spinal Tap, on their latest U.S. tour. They're a 20-year old heavy metal outfit from England centering around lead singer David St. Hubbins (McKean), lead guitarist Nigel Tufnel (Guest) and bass guitarist Derek Smalls (Shearer).  The rest of the band is a revolving door of personnel including a series of unlucky drummers who have met with bizarre demises. The new tour is the first the band has made of America in years, and unfortunately the they seem to have lost about as many fans as they've lost brain cells. When asked if the smaller venues that the band is playing on this tour means they are losing popularity, manager Ian Faith (Tony Hendra) quickly dismisses the idea. The band's fans are just becoming more 'selective,' he says.Still, the group is received well at their initial shows--that is if the gig hasn't been canceled, if their balky stage props don't malfunction, and if the band can find its way to the stage from their dressing rooms. But the tour is one disaster following another. Fans don't show up for autograph sessions at record stores. Radio stations play their oldies and ask, 'where are they now?' To top things off, David's girlfriend Jeanine (June Chadwick), the band's Yoko Ono, arrives. She soon starts contributing her ideas, such as having the band dress in fantasy creature costumes and recording their music 'in Dubly.'Even with all this trouble, the band feels things will pick up if they can just get their new album released. But Polymer Records refuses to distribute 'Smell the Glove' with its lurid cover art. Eventually it's released with a solid black record sleeve, with nary a word or picture on it. This turns out to be a reverse image of the Beatles' white album in appearance, artistic success and sales. The band sinks so low as to be billed second to a puppet show at a theme park. The pressures are just too much and as the tour limps to a close the long life of Spinal Tap seems at an end. But rock & roll is a funny business...Throughout we're treated to the band's rock & roll wisdom and philosophy. For instance, Nigel lets Marty in on one of the reasons for their success--loud amplifiers. While the volume settings on other bands' equipment might just go to 10, theirs goes to 11! Asked if there's really a difference, Nigel replies, 'Yeah, well it's like... one louder, innit?'There are tons of cameos by all sorts of people, including some funny portrayals of PR flacks by Fran Drescher and Paul Shaffer. This is a brilliant comedy that, despite all the parody, loves its subject. Treat yourself to it.",10,60,85,28 May 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," The disappointment of a lifetime.
","I don't think I ever anticipated a film so much in my life, seeing as how I think Kubrick is the greatest of all directors and it had been twelve long years since his last feature. Imagine my surprise--make that shock--after two-and-a-half hours in a dark theatre, stunned to find out that 'Eyes Wide Shut' was not only a disappointment, but a total failure as a film.What's more, the depth and breadth of this fiasco is amazing. Virtually none of the elements that made Kubrick's films such a joy to watch in the past are present here. In his greatest films, almost every shot gave the viewer something glorious, or at least interesting, to watch. There's none of that in this film. Kubrick's use of music in his other movies has always been smart, and sometimes even revolutionary. Here it's just one more mediocre element in an at best mundane production, epitomized by the single, hammered piano note that is so ineffectively used in scenes to supposedly denote tension. The slow, deliberate pace of his movies that had served him so well before just invites boredom here.The most offending elements, though, are the story and script.  Perhaps Arthur Schnitzler's story 'Traumnovelle' said something relevant to its audience earlier in the century; I don't know, I haven't read it. But this adaptation doesn't have much relevance at all to an audience at the end of that century. What's worse is the script, co-written by the great man himself. The dialog here is so trite and mediocre at times that I believe most first-year film students would have rejected it as just too hackneyed. ('You must leave at once! You are in great danger!' Did I really hear that?)Trouble signs appeared to me early on. After the party scene where a suddenly inebriated Nicloe Kidman inexplicably almost falls for some man about 30 years older than her using hoary pick-up lines, she and husband Tom Cruise go home and have a conversation/argument about jealousy, desire and fidelity. She tells him dramatically about how she almost threw away her marriage and family just to satisfy a momentary lust. By the time these two scenes are over we've been listening to Kidman drawl out her lines for about 45 minutes and I came to the awful realization that this confessional was supposed to be the impetus for the rest of the action. This scene also contains an embarrassingly phony laughing fit by Kidman. I would accuse her of bad acting, but given the knowledge of the way Kubrick worked, this must be the way he wanted the scene to go.Driven by a jealous vision of his wife making love to another man, Cruise sets out on an 'odyssey' that takes him all over New York for a series of meaningless encounters with various characters in which virtually nothing happens. If there was a point to all this empty activity, that would have been one thing, but this story is too weak to support any kind of a moral. A reference to HIV which comes late in the movie is jarring, because it has some relation to the real world which, up to that point, had been almost totally lacking. Of course, there was no danger of anyone contracting it, since there is little sex or passion in this film about sexual obsession. Even the notorious 'orgy' scene (for lack of a better word) will not raise an eyebrow of most viewers in 1999, a sign that Kubrick was out of touch with his audience and their level of sophistication after being isolated for so many years. In his defense, it may be that the scene would have been more effective if it had been shown the way he originally shot it.So what happened? Well, as just noted, perhaps Kubrick had simply been away from filmmaking too long and his instincts weren't sharp anymore. Also it's doubtful that anyone would suggest to this acknowledged genius that something just wasn't working this time around. Whatever the reason I found this a sad ending to a brilliant career, but one that won't tarnish the overall legacy of the man. It's often been said that if Kubrick had only directed '2001: A Space Odyssey,' he'd still be remembered as a genius. Now I believe it can be said that Stanley Kubrick was a filmmaking genius even though he directed 'Eyes Wide Shut.'",2,8,13,20 August 1999
Paths of Glory," Kubrick--a fully-formed genius in 1957.
","At only 29 years of age and in only his second major studio release, Stanley Kubrick showed the world that he was a force to be reckoned with. By the time he died 42 years later his films were epochal events waited for breathlessly by his large band of devotees who considered him a director without equal. He seldom disappointed them.This movie is set in World War I amidst the incredibly destructive and futile trench warfare between France and Germany. Kirk Douglas plays Frenchman Colonel Dax, who is ordered to make an impossible assault on a heavily-fortified enemy position. The only reason this charge is being made is that his commanding general, played by George Macready, believes that capturing the position will earn him a promotion. When the assault does not go forward under heavy enemy bombardment, the general is infuriated and demands that three men be arbitrarily chosen to stand trial for cowardice, an offense punishable by death. Col. Dax defends these men at their court-martial.The battle and trial scenes are about as good as have ever been filmed and the high level of tension is sustained throughout the movie. After the film's climax has occurred, Col. Dax goes looking for his troops and finds them relaxing at a cafe. What he and the viewer witness there is possibly the most affecting scene I've ever seen on screen.Looking at this film in perspective, it's easy to see Kubrick's trademarks even at this early stage of his career. The attention to the composition of his shots reflects his background as a still photographer and foreshadows his other great films to come. I find myself most impressed today with the way he could handle a dramatic story like this one without any innovative techniques or unusual special effects to hide behind, then turn around and make such totally different films like '2001...' and 'Dr. Strangelove...' Other films like 'The Shining' and 'Barry Lyndon' combined a strong story line with breakthrough film techniques. His versatility astonishes me.Adolphe Menjou also stars as the general who convinces Dax's superior officer to risk the ill-fated charge. Ralph Meeker, Timothy Carey and Joe Turkel give strong performances as the men on trial. Turkel turns up 23 years later in another Kubrick film, 'The Shining,' playing the bartender.You can take your pick: 'Paths of Glory' can rightly be described as one of the greatest war movies of all, or one of the great anti-war films, or as one of Kubrick's best. Or simply one of the best, period.",10,211,228,7 July 1999
The Breakfast Club," John Hughes' finest.
","John Hughes has been responsible for many entertaining movies but none better than this one, in my opinion. It works well as a teen comedy but there are a few curves thrown in that take it to another level.When a group of five disparate students arrives at their high school on a Saturday morning for an all-day detention session they represent five archetypes, one of which almost any viewer can personally relate to. There's Claire (Molly Ringwald), the high school princess who can't believe she's actually to be included in this motley crew. Andrew (Emelio Estevez) is a jock who's traveling down the straight and narrow path that athletics takes him, a path prescribed by his father. Brian (Anthony Michael Hall) is one of the school's brains. His very intelligence is the thing that diminishes in the eyes of others. John Bender (Judd Nelson) comes swaggering in like the top con in the yard. This is his turf. He works hard as portraying himself as an outlaw and an outsider but he's desperate for understanding and attention just like anyone else. Finally Allison (Ally Sheedy) comes scurrying in looking like a junior bag lady-in-training. She sits in the back, hiding behind her hair, apparently terrified to speak or to be spoken to.It promises to be a dull day but Bender will have none of that, as he seeks to make everyone as uncomfortable as possible. Over the course of the next several hours he leads the group on a series of adventures right under the nose of their principal, played by Paul Gleason in the film's only other substantial role. (One is required to suspend reality here to believe they get away with some of the stuff they do.)The first big surprise for me came when Bender pulled out his stash of marijuana and convinces the others, after initial reluctance, to join him in smoking some. Coming as the movie did in the middle of the Reagan years, one expects the kids to just say no. It's a brave stance for the movie to take, but it's also a completely believable turn of events.The real surprise, and the segment that makes the movie great, is when the five youngsters settle down on the floor and discuss who they are and how they came to this point. Andrew reveals he's in detention for pulling some horseplay only because he thought it was expected of him by his father. On the verge of tears he tells of the relentless pressure put on him to succeed. When he says of his dad,'God, I f*****g hate him!', the viewer is shocked, not by the language, but by the sudden seriousness the film has acquired. This leads to a series of cathartic confessions and confrontations among the group that are angry, tearful and emotionally draining, but in the end it leads to a bond between the five that just a few hours earlier they never would have expected could be forged.This movie is best seen on cassette or on a premium channel, as the broadcast version cuts out all references to pot-smoking and also prudishly censors the dialog to a ridiculous extent. For example, 'Oh my God!' is dubbed to become, 'Oh my lord!' But if you're a real fan you might want to see this TV version since it contains a minute or two of action not included in the theatrical release.",10,1,2,21 May 1999
