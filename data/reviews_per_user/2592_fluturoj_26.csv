The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Quite
","The real-life lessons: well there was not a particular point or idea that I picked on. There wasn't anything that I thought 'well this could be used in real life as well'. Plausibility: because of the gender of the movie talking about plausibility is not what one would expect but there are two things that I would emphasise-what they did good and what they did bad. What they did good in my opinion was the plausibility in terms of how you can motivate others to follow you-real emotion, past experience that they remember and a song (strangely quite powerful), i think they were right into believing that you need a person to be a symbol. What they did wrong is that it takes more than a show (marketing)-yes the song, the symbol, the speeches- to start a revolution. As I said those are necessary to get attention and followers but to start a revolution you need to do much more than that. Its not a reality show or marketing campaign. But maybe that's left for the second part. Acting: I have never seen an actress that transmits emotions that truly touch you as strongly as Jennifer Lawrence. I loved her performance.",6,0,1,18 August 2016
Point Break," Entertaining
","The movie is about beliefs and how far someone is willing to go to honour those beliefs. Real-life link-since this is an action movie I will not judge if all the actions are possible or not because it is understandable that most of them will be exaggerated for entertainment purposes. Where I found the link to be true is that it is quite common to do some of the most extraordinary actions in order to accomplish what you believe is important. Finding your path. That was highlighted. It was implied that if you find your path you find your purpose and when you find your purpose its then when you are happy. And I do believe that accomplishments lead to happiness. We can just imply that Bodhi died happy but we were never shown it. Also a good life lesson try by stressing that we are only possible for our own path, actions and choices. But is that true? Is that true when you also are the encouragement of someones actions like Utah was for his friend? Encouraging someone to follow you is also an action that had tragic consequences. Should you not be responsible for that? Character analysis: Utah was a very poor developed character. A confusing character. I never quite understood what were his motives for joining the FBI. Why did he want to become a part of the FBI so bad? Body on the other hand was way better developed. He had more depth and a clear aim, path, vision that was ready to do anything to accomplish what he believed was his purpose.The movie had a good plot however the development of the movie was weak in many points. For example, they failed (with the exception of the climbing scene) to show us that the tasks were as extreme as they say they are. For example, if competing the task when they fly was so difficult, how come all of them (including Utah that was some kind of a amateur) completed it? It did not come across how difficult the tasks were. They looked easy. Also, the fact that Utah finds the group so easily and immediately without challenges, shows a weakness of this movie.In general however, the movie is quite entertaining. It starts interesting, keeps you interested when Utah blows his cover and just when you think that that was the highpoint of the movie there comes the scene with the climbing. When you think that that was it and that Bodhi died there you have the final scene where he dies after completing is path. What I thought was gonna happen is that after Bodhi died, Utah went to accomplish the water task in Bodhi's and others honour but I was wrong and the ending so was quite a surprise for me.",6,0,1,27 July 2016
Knocked Up," Misrepresentative
","One thing that I did not like about this movie is that it portraits men as the weaker partner in a relationship. Why do they have to obey their wives all the time? Why do they have to be the ones that have to change? They are not valued and that does not drive them away instead it makes them want these women even more. For example, the scene when Debbie accuses Pete for not caring about the offenders in the neighbour. She treats him quite bad and he just takes it. Or when she does not respect Pete's need for alone time. I do understand that the men were maybe in the wrong and were acting irresponsible but my point is why are men portrait as irresponsible and woman as the know-all and always in the rights in the first place? It's like men were the kids and woman the parents. And because of that men needed to change and beg the woman to take them back. I just think that real life relationships are not like this. Woman are not always the more mature partner and therefore should not always get their way because sometimes they are wrong. But because people see movies like this, they create this idea that men should always be the ones to change or beg to get back together. Just not real life.",5,0,0,2 July 2016
Suicide Squad," Surprisingly-romantic
","It was a surprise to me how much this movie was based on romance and on true mad love. I'll get to that later but as I said, I would have not expected a movie like this to be based on romance which I am not saying is bad thing, just that surprising which kind of makes the movie warm and stand out. The real-life link: let's get back to this idea of romance in the movie. Is there a love so strong that one would risk fighting a witch and see the end of the world just to save the other half, like Lieutenant GQ Edwards did for June Moone? Or is there a love so strong like Harley Quinn's love for the Joker so that one would go insane, get rid of humanity and sanity just to be accepted from the one one loves? Is there a love this strong in real life?The storytelling: Great. An interesting beginning by which all the characters are introduced. An enemy that makes the interesting idea come alive, a setback that prepares you for the grand finale and the grand finale. The story moves fast, is interesting and leaves no space for boredom. The character development: poor. The only character that shows a slight development is that of Headshot but considering that he was never the bad guy, the softness in him due to his daughter and his leadership do not come as a surprise, are bot touching and do not go far. With joker's believed death, there was space for Harley Quinn's character to develop-either become better or worse. How is it plausible that someone who loves so much as Harley does, is so less affected by the death of the one she loves. I think the movie tried to save El Diablo as the one character who develops in the end and touches the audience-poorly done since his story was exactly as expected. One major factor when it comes to characters is how there was no reasonable situation that created a bond between the squad. There was nothing that made the squad a team and yet someone how in the end they became friends. Why? In general an interesting action movie, but it does not go beyond that.",6,1,3,26 December 2016
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Evolving
","The real-life lessons: again with these kind of movies there is not much to this area, besides maybe the trending topic that you have to think by yourself because everyone else might have their own agenda. Character development: strangely enough there was not much depth and development in main characters. Alexander Pierce strangely enough was the one that developed to an extend in the end. He gave reasons why he supported what he supported but why those reasons were his in the first place, was not explained. There was a failed attempt in my opinion, in developing Steve Rogers character by the dilemma he was having about how to fit in the new world at the beginning. But that dimmer somehow just seemed to disappear and was not deep enough. And it was bot well presented how he managed to escape it. Storytelling: very well done in my opinion. It had its twists and surprises and was never quite enough and without action. It kept you interested and engaged. It evolved quite nicely and made time pass by quite quickly. One more thing I liked about this movie- Steve and Natasha. They were a quite delightful duo.",7,0,2,25 August 2016
Tangled," Dreamy
","This was so adorable. Quite enjoyable to watch and leaves you in a very good mood. The real-life lessons: Don't be afraid to go after your dreams, you'll never know what happens. This sounds quite cliché but it is so true. If Rapunzel was scared to go after the dream, if she preferred to stay where was comfortable and she thought was safe, she would have never fallen in love, seen that the world is not scared and realise that she is the lost princess. Just proves that you never know for sure what is a the best for you, it may not be what you believe and as in this case what you believe is good is actually the only bad thing in your life (Rapunzel so called mother). So courage to go after your dreams. and also a very good representation that once you have accomplished a dream, you find a another one. Just wondering after Rapunzel and Flynn Rider got each other (they were each other dreams) what will their next dream be? Another lesson is that things are not always what they seem and so don't assume the worse (even when it really looks like that). Flynn Rider did not leave with the crown as they made Rapunzel believe since it looked quite so. But then again, if things are not what they seem, the person that is being bad represented will do anything to let you know its not what it seemed (Flynn coming back to Rapunzel) (if they can of course because if he was hanged and not saved he would never be able to let Rapunzel know he did not leave her and she would for always believe that). So go after your dreams and don't assumes the worse. Plausibility: this is a fairytale talking about plausibility is not plausible (see what I did there). Character analysis: just want to say that I never knew that a course could ever be my favourite character but I just fell in love with Maximus. He was so so so adorable. Mother Gothel was a smart weak woman. She used intrigue and lies to get her way. She made Rapunzel believe that she loved her and wanted her safe so that she would agree in starting in. She did not use evilness, she just manipulated a you woman. She was lets say a modern evil woman. The leads I will not discuss since they were the perfect character with all the right values (implausible but a necessity for movies like this that have a young audience). Storytelling: I liked that the movie was not evil, Rapunzel saw the lights, the mother only intervened after. It gives you a very warm feeling it does not fill you with anger (as it would for example if Rapunzel did see the lights because of her mother). So very warm and a good watch.",7,2,2,13 August 2016
Doctor Strange," The worse movie in the series so far because it wants you to believe that magic on earth is the most natural thing and every human being is cable of practising it.
","One major problem with this film: why is your world plausible and what makes Doctor Strange the chosen one. Are you telling me that everyone that walked in that temple could have learned magic like that? Captain America and Hulk are products of science, Iron Man of Money, Thor of his alieness and goddess but what about Doctor Strange? He is suborn, arrogant and ambitious and that's why he is the chosen one? Well so are at least 5 million other people in planet earth. The magic had no back up here, its Earth why should there be magic? Are you expected to be childish and believe it just like that? Nope. Real-life link: Everyone has a reason for his/her action. Kaecilius believes he is saving the world because he has been lied by his teacher. Of course he is going to question everything she has taught him. Trust was betrayed. A villain with not a villain aim, just a greedy one. Plausibility: The worse part of this movie. For a movie like this it is crucial that you back up your fantasy world. Why is magic possible on Earth? Every normal human being can practice magic if it enters that temple now and can see the spirit out of body? This is just ridiculous. The worse part was when Strange's spirit talks to Christine like it is the most natural thing ever for humans. Hated that. If that magic was possible because of the infinity stone that would make the movie awesome but no, it just expects us to believe that every human can do magic and magic is the most natural thing on earth. Villain: Strong. Double Villain. The former student turned bad and the overall villain of all the Marvel Movies. They can't beat either of them and that is what makes them strong. Kaecilius could only be beaten because Dormammu takes him and Dormammu can not be beaten at all, he only accepts a deal that sets him free and that's how the earth is saved. Storytelling: Strong. Keeps you interested. Starts with the life of Strange, the accident and his pursue to get his old life back. He learning magic seems a bit rushed (he is a natural dah) but the end is unpredictable and surprises you, you don't know how they will safe the earth. A great surprise is to learn that Kaecilius was actually right and the perfect accent one is not so perfect since she draws energy from the dark dimension, the same dimension she fights. Character development: Strange learns that there are many ways to safe the world. At the end of the day he looses nothing. All the control he had as being the best doctor, that is not multiplied by millions since he is now saving the world. Arrogance still there I'd say. Acting/Casting: Benedict Cumberbatch is an excellent choice. Makes an arrogant character likable. Overall, the worse Marvel movie so far, not because of its story or characters but because it wants you to believe that magic on earth is the most natural thing and every human being is cable of practising it.",5,1,2,16 April 2017
Ant-Man," Gross-attimes
","The movie was funny and interesting. Quite enjoyable. However, all those ants grossed me out. Also, the idea is a bit absurd and at times it comes across as such. But in the end during the final fight the movie becomes better. It becomes that super hero movie that everyone expects even though at the begging as I said comes across as quite absurd and childish. It is quite a risky plot in my opinion that started bad and saves itself at the end. Casting: I don't usually have any criticism when it comes to casting in marvels movies but in this one I just think that Paul Rudd was the right choice. He comes across as quite cold and any attempt to make its character funny fails. So poor performance from Rudd. Storytelling: very interesting story and very well developed. Its a straight forward story that has a beginning, a middle and an end. The end is anticipated and as expected things don't go as planned but it is not so easy to anticipate what will go wrong which made the movie interesting.",6,0,1,27 August 2016
American Hustle," Eye-opening
","I found the movie to be a very good reflection of real life in terms of complexity of personalities. The real-life lessons: don't ever believe someone so easily just because they say so. It it incredible how fast characters in this movie believed the others just because they said so. They believed false characters as for example they believed the actor was the lawyer or the sheikh just because someone said they are. They believed someone had connections to London just because they said they did. They believed someone was telling the truth about an investment opportunity just because they said they knew someone in their neighbourhood. We, in real life also do this every single day. It is quite frightening to see how easily we could be scared, lied, investigated. It reminds you that there are people out there that know this and take advantage of your trust. It is very easy to say to someone I am this and this person. If you do it, they can't easily verify that and if they do it you can't verify that. Another thing, don't touch crime. If you don't touch it you don't leave evidence no matter what you say. An example that actions speak louder than words even when it comes to justice processes (even though you get sentences even for just speaking as we saw). And finally, the small fishes are always the first to be caught and the first to go and sometimes the only ones. And also Richie DiMaso's failed attempt to get on papers and be huge shows that when you get blinded by goal so that you become cruel (blackmailing people into working for you, beating your boss) to achieve it, you get humbly reminded by karma that that is not the way to get itCharacter development: amazed. The characters are externally strong all grey not just white or black with the exception of the mayor that came across as so innocent and white that was ready to commit crimes so that his community develops.",6,0,2,4 September 2016
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Great story development
","Real-life link: Surprisingly, I can't think of anything that during the movie made me think 'Hmm would be good to remember this if I get into similar situations'. So no real life links from this one that I can take away. Plausibility: a bit low on this category as well. I find it a bit implausible that a young and inexperienced hobbit would volunteer to go to one of the most frightening places when even the most braves leaders of all middle earth refuse to go. I also find it a bit implausible Froddos friends would volunteer to go with him to these dangerous places given that the movie does not provide any reason for us to believe that their friendship is that strong. Storytelling: this is the strength of the movie. You won't get bored watching this. The story moves fast and progresses so gratefully. One event leads to the other in a great manner. Character development: Characters are also another strength of the movie. They all embark a development joinery. We are given enough background of the main ones so that it makes us curious to see how they will develop and act when they are confronted with difficult decisions and events. Overall, great development of story and an interesting movie.",7,1,1,14 May 2017
Man of Steel," Fast
","This movie had a brilliant development and speed of story. I must say that being a fan of Smallville I found the development of events to be a bit strange even more since Lex was never shown. But I have never read the comics so I can't say which one deviates more from the originals. Story telling: I found this amazing. At times I thought that it was moving too fast, that it did not give time for example to create connection between characters because of that but eventually this speed of developments kept the movie very interesting without a dull moment. The enemy was strong enough to make you root for Superman and the special effects, fight scenes were all very impressive. There was an attempt to make the movie funny by recognising how cringy calm Clark Superman may be and they did this well. But I think there was more room for funny moments since at the end of the day you have airlines on Earth that are far stronger than anything men kind has critter and in a cute way think will save them against these super beings-there is plenty of room for funny moments just from this nativity (as it is usually portrayed).So overall, a great movie that moves fast and has an interesting story.",7,1,2,28 August 2016
Captain America: Civil War," Great
","The movie is awesome. I enjoyed it very much and liked it a lot. At the beginning having just watched Batman v Superman I thought that the idea that the superhero should be held accountable for the consequences of their fights on innocent people to be similar to that of Batman v Superman but unlike Batman v Superman this movie developed and brings this dilemma to new level. The title civil war is made justice three times. First, when the war stays between humans and superhero (no aliens or infinity stones). Secondly, during the epic fight between all the avengers on the airport and finally between Tony and Steve (epic ending). The fight scenes are incredible, fast and just great. When Winter Solder steals a driving motorcycle and possesses it in the air that was one of the wow moments. Just as it was the one when Steve defeats Tony and gives up the shield. Characters are all well done, well developed and very complete. What made an impression on me and made me love Captain America was how is childhood friend was more important than anything and anyone. He was not ready to give up on him. He is the last connection to the world as he knew it, to the world he called home. And we saw how in age of ultron he struggled to find home in the current age. This did not allow him to give up on this last link to that world. Unlikely for superhero movies this movie made me think about real-life lessons. I liked how Captain America foresaw what it meant to sign a contract and I especially liked when he pointed out that they will lose freedom to people with agendas. This is something to think about. Storytelling: great done, it starts with action, slows down enough to develop the story that leads to the high point of the fight and then it has the surprise element that leads to the real and final fight. So an active intro, a strong active middle and an surprise elemented active and morally strong ending. Another thing I loved about this is the humour. The characters are all very sympathetic and humour is skilfully done in the right times and places. A very well done movie. Looking forward to other parts and the last two infinity stones to show up.",7,3,11,31 August 2016
Gone Girl," Interesting
","The movie and real life:The movie is about marriage. It takes the problems that most marriages face such as 'trying to change each other, resent each other and only cause more pain' and applies them to a couple that is extraordinary trying to pass them as acceptable and present even then, trying to pass them as 'normal'.Amy Dunne is exceptional. Extremely smart as smart as to get Harvard and Yale degrees and make up crime scenes and achieve to pass them as believable. She is a perfectionist. She looked for a perfect husband and when she realised that perfect does not exist (at least in her partner) she tried to change him. This was too much for Nick Dunne and it drove him away. He cheated, broke Amy's heart and triggered her craziness. She was in love. And one might say when you are in love you are bound to do crazy things, jealousy makes you irrational.Amy however went too far. She planned Nicks penalty death and killed Desi Collings. Even for a crazy person in love there must be a line and not everything (as killings) is justified with 'I did it for love'. While Nick Dunne might appear as the rational victim he is not all well either. His desire to be with Amy even after he know everything she had done and even killed does not speak well for him. It makes you believe that maybe what Amy said is true. That maybe he liked himself best when he tried to become the perfect person that a perfectionist as Amy would like. Is that love? Absolutely not. That's a self-love triggered from outside. Dependence on someone else liking you so that you can love yourself. A weak character. But love? No. Was Amy in love? Not really. She was in love with perfectionism. As soon as she had hope that Nick was not a lost case and that she still can turn him into the perfect husband she wanted (when she saw him on TV) she went back. She went back to work on her perfect life. To work on making her husband fit into that. So actually, unconditional, real love is no where to be seen. Begs the question, is that real life? Is unconditional and real love non existent? Is that real marriage but in a slightly less crazy notch? I don't know. The scenario of the couple's life in Amy's diary has no resemblance with real life. Why would someone that has a wife that is actually as cool as Amy (not nagging, understandable, we are the most important thing everything else is background noise) not be happy with her and cheat on her. It's irrational. So if the couple from diary was real they would actually be happy and the husband would not cheat (usually the husband cheats when he feels emotionally not good in a relationship). But that couple was't real and I happy that I could tell that something is wrong with Amy's story and we haven't heard Nick's side yet. So overall real life message would probably be: don't be someone you are not and don't try to change people (cliche right?). But as it can be seen from this movie as well it only leads to unhappiness and sooner our latter you are exposed. As for the production: acting is good (Rosamund Pike much better than Ben Affleck tho). The movie is long but interesting so it makes the time go fast. A very good development of characters can be seen. The character are very real life like. So overall I would recommend this movie to anyone who has 2 and half hours. It is interesting and makes you think about marriage.",7,1,3,21 July 2016
Drive," Good action movie with some good points that make you think but lacks character depth.
","Real- life lesson: Get yourself away from dangerous men. Irene and most importantly her son were at risk for life and violence because they were the family of a criminal and same story again when they became the most important things to the driver which again is a criminal. Stay away from criminals because sooner or later you'll end dead like Shannon did or you'll be the target of their anger like Cook was. And lastly, even if you are a mafia like Nino you can't be protected 24 hours and enemies will find you and kill you. Even if you are a mafia like Nino you are no more then a human being when your arms and troops are no where to be seen. Plausibility: good. Only good because we don't know anything about the driver to judge if he could actually be that good and fearless. Plausible that a mafia can be beaten by a single man if this men waits for the right moments and circumstances. Storytelling: a bit slow at the beginning but takes off very well after the robbery. Everything connects very well and has its interesting moments. Something that is done excellently when the story is told is how they show as that the driver is good at not blinking for a long time, then they show us that Bernie is very good in killing with one stab so then when Bernie stabs the driver and he does not blink we don't know if its because he is good at not blinking or because he is dead. A powerful scene that have never seen before (or at least don't remember). The ending is an enigma too. The driver is not home when Irene knocks on his door which makes you think did he drive away for good or was he coming back? Character development: poor. The driver does not develop a bit. We don't know why he is so good at driving, we don't know why he gets involved in robbery, we don't know any of his motives. All we know is that he cares about Irene and Shannon and the kid. We don't know why he is so cold and why he kills so merciless. Acting/ Casting: Ryan Gosling is great. Makes you like a cold character, a criminal. Carey Mulligan is also good as Irene. The chemistry between Ryan and Carey is great and makes you like the couple. Overall, a good action movie with some good points that make you think but lacks character depth.",6,0,0,17 April 2017
22 Jump Street," Bromantic
","This movie has great dialogues that saves it from the mediocre plot. And you just got to love all the bromance that goes on on this movie. The real-life lessons: none. I tried to pick up something on that they say you have to click with someone to have a great relationship but sometimes that is just not enough? Well I don't really believe that. If you click with someone, you don't get bored so easily. So superficially and wrong shown that can not be highlighted. Plausibility: very low and poor. He gets a bullet in his arm and is still able to climb a helicopter. I understand that this is an action movie but that was just too too much. It seemed ridiculous and like those producing the movie had never seen an action/comedy movie before. Acting: I think acting was OK from the leads but nothing so impressive. The movie has its funny moments though. It is like with anything that the critics or the audience could have used to make fun of the movie or rate it down, they did it themselves first which is quite smart since it does not leave any room for those comments really. Its like they recognised anything that could go wrong with the sequels and took that made fun of that but then did it anyway but since they made fun of that, no one else could anymore. Smart. And the dialogues as I said are pretty smart too and the best thing about this movie.",5,1,5,7 August 2016
The Imitation Game," Captivating
","It was like watching a more serious version of Sheldon Cooper and I totally loved it. The movie is very well executed. It has an interestingly developing plot that keeps you engaged, great cast with Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley acting marvellously and it evokes curiosity about a true event and makes you wonder 'did this actually happen'. And not to forget it is emotional at times which makes the movie even more likable. The real-life lessons: One lesson that can be identified and is quite important is that you need friends to achieve what you want to. You need other helps, team work not matter how smart you are. Alan Turing only really had a chance to build the machine and crack the code when he received the support and help of his colleagues. It pays off to be nice. Secondly, being sociable and talking to people is crucial even for the workplace work. Alan Turing only got the idea of how to solve the code during a random conversation with a stranger that he met a bar that he otherwise wouldn't be in if it wasn't for him having made friends.",7,2,3,2 August 2016
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Moving
","I felt that there was a disconnection with the other parts. For example, Thor's return is never shown not in this and not in Thor's movies. We learn that he has seen Jane after coming but we are not shown that, seems as parts are missing. Also we are not shown how the avengers got contacted and got together. We learn from the Winter Solder movie that they have to destroy the centres of Hydra but that was just Steve and Natasha, they never mentioned that they will call the others or keep the avengers alive. This is also feels like a part missing. Their get together. I am not gonna talk about life lessons or plausibility because its a super hero movie and those are pretty obvious how they are in these movies. I must say however that this part was more concerned with characters dilemmas, their fears. It is an attempt to develop them, let the audience understand them better. A missed target here because firstly, as I said its an super hero movie, the characters are super heroes and no matter their dilemmas because of that they will always come back to the same ending and secondly, they did it poorly and shortly and it just took a lot of movies time without making any impact. The story line is impressive however and that's what a movie like this should have, more wow moments and twists and surprises than character's dilemmas. They story is well told with action scenes and fast development and the feeling that you don't know if they all are gonna make it which was new. What I like most about the story is how the story keeps developing through all these series and you can sense that it is going to build into something quite exciting. Makes you more curious about the other parts.",7,0,1,26 August 2016
Up," Adorable
","As an adult watching this movie I can understand why kids would find this very funny, adorable and quite enjoyable. Colourful balloons, talking dogs, colourful bird and many more. It has quite a positive and optimistic tune and lifts your mood because of that. Also what I liked about the movie is the interconnection between element since some of them keep appearing regularly like the club symbol. I liked the implication that adventure comes in many forms. For Carl Fredricksen what adventure looked like was this wild exploration of South Africa. For Ellie a life with the love of her life was adventurous enough. But since Carl only saw the wild as adventurous he always thought that Ellie never lived the adventure she wanted. But she did and Carl understands it when he looks at her adventure book in more details. Commitment to promise is something else highlighted here and I am glad to see it since I think is an important virtues to have.",5,0,2,1 July 2016
Edge of Tomorrow," Interesting
","One thing first: how did Rita know that if you get blood into your veins you will loose the power, I mean shouldn't she have died and not woken up again to realise that? How did she know? Other than this the movie was great. Real-life lessons:poor in this regard. The only think that I could pick up is that practice makes you great whatever that is. Everything can be mastered when practised and once you get used to the idea. Cage, a hysterical coward scared of war, becomes the best soldier because he trains everyday and goes through the experience a lot of times. Plausibility: I liked that they implied that Rita had become the angel of that previous battle because she had the power to reset the day. She was great because she got to the same thing over and over again so a lot of practice. A kind of cheating method, she wasn't this born great warrior. She became this warrior because she could rest time and do the same things hundreds of times. This gives it great points to plausibility. Character development: Cage develops slightly but i think it could have gone further and the same with Rita. We don't know Rita's motives for volunteering and we know very little about her.Acting/ Casting: both leads are great. I was pleasantly surprised by Emily Blunt. Storytelling: Brilliantly done. It makes the movie very interesting. I loved how some scenes were happening for the fist time and some had happened a hundred times before maybe but you just never knew which was which. Twists and surprises in the storyline were also done great. Humour mainly in Cage's character at the beginning was amusing and done to the right extent. Overall, great movie.",7,0,0,1 September 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Slow-actionless
","Well this was a good disappointment. I liked Man of Steel and I expected something similar with this one since it should be its follow-up but boy was I let down. There were a lot of things that I didn't like about this movie that I will mention below. Story-telling: extremely bad. Awful. The story is told slowly, there are a lot of unnecessary things that slow the story such as Batman's dreams. If you want to have his dreams as warnings OK but why make them so long. The whole story is unnecessarily overloaded with details that make it heavy and complicated. There is a lot of conspiracies, lies, intrigues its like watching a crime TV show and not an action movie. Batman's story is almost not explained at all (just that his parents got killed and Wonder Woman's not at all). In my opinion there should have been a movie about Batman and one about Wonder Woman before this part. They should watch Marvel's movies and take notes. Characters: they all seem to be black and white only. There is attempt to make to explain where Lex is coming from with his actions but all we get is 'I am doing this because my dad was violent when I was a kid, so I lost confidence in god and now I want to prove you are not god'. Not powerful,not powerful at all. Then there is Batman. How come they have portrayed Batman as a complete fool that falls for Lex's traps so easily. His line of thought is 'Superman is more powerful than me so I must stop him because I can't control him or scare him or make him do that I want m'. Well Batman looks like a nice guy right? Let's not mention how awful the fight scenes were. Batman moves slower than I do. And those cliché scenes where all there of them stand together facing the monster. No humour or funny moments. A huge disappointment.",5,1,2,29 August 2016
Thor: The Dark World," Fantasy
","The movie was more comical than I expected, in a very good way. I just love when Thor comes to earth and I just loved Loki's sarcasm in this move. He nearly became my favourite character. And I also love how parts of different sequels are all linked and connected. Makes me feel like I am watching a huge TV show, only that is in movie parts and extremely better done. Oh was I glad that someone (Jane herself) actually mentioned how all that was Jane's fault. I was starting to get frustrated how no one was bringing that up. It was like a huge elephant in the room and I just couldn't bear. The real-life lessons: didn't find many instances that made me think that that could be a useful lesson in real life. Plausibility: at the beginning I was thinking that it is totally impossible that from everyone in the plant Jane was the one that found the Aether, but I was happy that the movie justified this by giving a believable explanation- she found it because she was looking for Thor and following the signals by having some of the most advanced devices and not to forget the anomalies that made this all possible since all the worlds aligned. So logically, no one was looking harder and with more advanced equipment then Jane so the odds of her being the one finding it were pretty good. Character development: I liked how Loki's character stayed true. He helped Thor but he still had his own agenda. Not the totally bed guy with greed and ambition that can't let him be called honours and good. Storytelling: this is where I didn't like the movie so much. The story got a bit boring and was moving slow and you could expect the ending. You thought that Thor's plan would succeed and he alone would be the one to bring an end to it all and that's exactly what happens. No twists. I think Loki's survival was supposed to be a surprise but somehow that was also expect able. It would have been more interesting if he actually died (even tough I'd hate that).",6,0,1,24 August 2016
Flight," Melancholic
","This movie was a bit slow for me but I must say it does show very well the life, emotions of an addict. The real-life lessons-people won't help you unless you are willing to help yourself and change your behaviour. People around us if we are luck they will try and help us but not if they sense that you won't change in anyway. Nicole tried to help Whip by telling him she was worried and that he should get help but what Whip did was verbally abuse her while trying to protect himself from reality, then he acted as his drinking was not a problem taking as a joke and making false promises(which could be called by the lack of him taking the whole situation seriously) that will go to a clinic as soon as they had gone far away. Nicole at this moment walked away. She realised he had no intention to change since he had still not accepted the reality and reflected to learn that his actions where keeping people away. As expected she came back when he learned from his mistakes, and realised he was the one in the wrong. You can't help someone that won't accept help. You just can't. No matter how much you want to help them. You can only help them once they realised they need help. Until they do that, you have to walk away. Plausibility: well its is a very plausible story. It was new to me the suggestion that an addict won't consider his circumstances and that the addition will win even in situations when you might go to jail for life because of that. I can't comment on the plausibility of that but it is quite convincing. Charakter analysis:Whip- not a bad men, an addict that was not ready to receive help until he convinced himself that he needed help. A good man because he could not say that a person who possibility died because she helped a kid, drunk while on duty and had an alcohol problem. Nicole- smart. I thought at the beginning that she gave up on Whip pretty quickly after he helped her time of need but now I think that she was smart for realising that someone can't be helped if they don't think they need help.Acting: all I can say is that Denzel Washington is as amazing as always. There is no need to say more. Plot/ Stortline/Storytelling: slow. I got bored pretty quick after the crash, things just didn't seem to get moving. But in the end it did pick up peace so It made slightly up for that. Overall, a great movie that actually shows (not tells) the life of an addict and how addiction impacts his/her happiness and relationships.",5,0,2,8 August 2016
Deadpool," Non-organic
","Real-life link: A movie about love I'd say. It shows that when someone truly loves you, they are ready to sacrifice themselves and do anything for that person. And if someone loves you, the looks won't matter (this however can only be believed if that person is already in love with you and your looks changes after because I personally find it hard to believe that in the beginning looks like dead pool's wouldn't be repulsive).Character analysis: characters are not deep enough. Even Wade is shallow. It is like he is two characters, the one who sees everything as fun when he is in the costume and the angry one out of the costume. The character is just not believable. Wade should have had a better sense of humour when not wearing the mask, if they wanted to make him seem as one and not two characters. What ruined this movie for me, despite having a good storyline and plot, is Wade's constant talk to the audience (however I did like the scene when he said 'it's like the studio couldn't afford more than than two x-mens). It just didn't feel organic and natural even though the aim was to make it funny.",6,3,10,29 July 2016
The Martian," Moderate
","I expected way more from this movie so I was a bit let down. The real-life link: I am not familiar with all the scientific reasoning that this movie shows so I can not comment if it is possible in real life or not or if they did a good job in bringing the movie as close to reality as possible. Character analysis: Mark Watney's positivism and humour get him alive. While is hard to believe that someone in those conditions would be as calm and as humorous as Mark Watney was, it is good to see that the movie shows that with those two virtues you can survive even in a foreign planet. There is not much more depth to the characters as this. The movie missed those exciting turning points, those moments when you don't know if the lead is going to survive or not and if he does how is he going to do that. I felt that from the beginning it was pretty clear that Mark was going to be saved. For a men alone in Mars his stay was pretty comfortable. There was only one instance when things get complicated for Mark ( when he looses his corps) everything else goes exactly as planned. There was only the scene almost after 2 hours that gets slightly exciting (when Melissa Lewis catches Mark) everything else is slow and non action not to say boring.",5,1,3,24 July 2016
V for Vendetta," Old story. Government gone evil and a hero that wants to save the nation from ti-just that the hero is not heroic but rather vindictive.
","Real life lessons: I know this is supposed to be profound and make you reflect on life quite a lot but I must say I did not encounter a moment in this movie that made me think ' I better remember that'. Plausibility: Weakish. The idea that a biologically created monster seeks revenge is OK and that the government created a virus to tyronise its nation but how come a single person with a mask on a TV convinces all those people to go to parliament square and face their death in attempt to change something. Can that be done is a year? By a person who no one knows who he is? Would a father and a mother risk the safety of their family just because a masked man on telly tells them to do so? Don't really think so. What safes the movie a bit is the scene when a finger men kills a child for wearing the mask. That is something that would make a nation revolt if it is already poked. So a medium plausibility here. Villain: The government, a dictator. This could have been strange and the supreme chancellor appearing only on a screen makes him seem as powerful, unreachable. But he is easily beaten when his security betrays him and brings him to V and that is the worse way to totally weaken the villain in a movie. If your villain is strong it should not be beaten so easily. Storytelling: Starts well. Tells the story of Evey first then that of Vendetta. Then moves to the story beyond them that concerns them all and the common villain that needs to be beaten and this all occurs within one year which is clearly stated in the beginning of the movie. Two problems with this movie: they mention that all the events in the movie connect but I did not see that happening. And second, you know that the big event is going to happen on the 5th of November 1 year from the first year in the movie. It starts amazing with interesting scene when the old baily is blown up but the ending was not good, you would expect exactly that ending. Envey falling in love with V is expected but makes no sense, they never had a connection. Character development: the stronger development here is without no doubt that of Envey. She beats her fear and takes leadership at the end. Vendetta seeks revenge and never do you see him reflecting if he is indeed doing the right thing. I mean killing people like the doctor at the end even though she confess she had no idea what was going on. She said 'I hoped to change the world; and he replies 'I have not come here for what you hoped to do but for what you did' That my friend is monstrous and has no regards of others feelings and motives. Stop and think V for once, stop and think. Acting/Casting: I can only say one thing here-Natalie Portman is brilliant. Overall, it is an old story. Government gone evil and a hero that wants to save the nation from ti- just that the hero is not heroic but rather vindictive.",5,4,9,16 April 2017
Furious 7," Emotional
","Being a fan of Paul, the end was quite emotional and touching and I must say they have done an amazing job of not letting his absence be felt in the movie. A goodbye well done and well handled.In general now I expected more from the movie. The only thing that I like about it was the storyline and telling. It has a great development of events so hats off to the writers. Characters however, are not done so great. They lack depth or character dilemmas. I think Deckard Shaw will develop more in the next part so maybe thats why in this one it was so hallow. Some of the fight scenes were done great such as that between Toretto and Shaw in the end, and some were done poorly like the fighting scene at the beginning between Toretto and Hobbs. I felt that the tried too hard to make it 'cool' and used too many 'catch' phrases in the attempt. They said out loud what should have been implied and left to said in the minds of the audience. When you do that you risk in not showing the audience what you want but telling them which is always poor. There were scenes that just are cringy and don't make sense like Toretto waking up from the dead just because Letty says she remembers everything. Or that Ramsey will help them without thinking twice. Because they are loyal to each other? What if they were loyal but used all the good that comes with that for evil reasons? She has no motive to believe or help them at all. And while we are talking about her who is she? All we know about her is that she is good with computers. The shallowest character I have ever seen. So a lot of things that I dint like but it has a solid story (a substory wishing a greater story) which I liked and which made the movie interesting enough. Some of the action scenes were also well done that make the movie quite enjoyable.",6,0,17,2 September 2016
