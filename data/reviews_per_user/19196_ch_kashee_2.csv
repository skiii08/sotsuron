The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," why they didn't use condoms on honeymoon??????
","i didn't review movies,, my first review was on twilight eclipse,,,which was like this,, i like the first movie of this series, but for me this was a very horrible experience,, i saw the whole movie in just 70min, i did not want to spend any bucks to see this movie thats why i downloaded it, and the size was only 400 MB,, 1 thing i like in this movie was the honey moon place they chose, now the direction was very poor, the lamest scene was when wolves speak to each other, > i didn't understand 1 thing,, if they know they had this risk of monstrous child if she will get pregnant ,, why they did not use condoms???? > CGI was very poor, wolves look totally fakeit was a total waste of time",2,8,10,23 June 2012
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," total crap
","i recommend twilight franchise that plz stop making its sequels,i beg u........... they even don'not know how to make a good movie i see this movie only coz of Jacob i see this only in 1 hour then i realize that i have wasted my 1 hour It's just a plain awful movie and there is nothing good about it. i want my 1 hour back who give me that????????????????? The whole love triangle had no chemistry. Would anyone actually act like this in real life? Because I'm sure that if Bella pranced off to kiss Jacob when her BOYFRIEND was but a mere 10 feet away, he'd go kick some major arse...but no. No fighting, no arguments, and no real mention of the subject. Which is really just downright unbelievable. The dialogue between the three was also tense, and I found I cringed more than once.its just i wanted 2 say",2,11,17,23 August 2010
