Blade Runner 2049," why would you give a robot slave an apartment and a girlfriend?
","i'm reviewing this film on its own merits, not comparing to the first film at all.I do not get it. If you are building robots to do jobs that humans do not want to do, or like Wallace says, expanding civilization on the backs of slaves... why would you give them the ability to drink alcohol and have girlfriends? it makes about as much sense as a welding robot that drinks and lives in the suburbs and commutes to work. what ? i'm supposed to connect to a robot protagonist. but why ? K is a bad character. K kills off innocent robots who are not doing anything wrong except existing. K is the bad guy, doing bad guy work.explain to me how you can walk into a police department , kill the coroner, steal robot bones, leave, come back and kill the police captain, and get away with all of this? as Wallace's hench girl does.i was not impressed by the cinematography. instead of a real world it just feels like a few foggy sets. too many closeups of detective K.Hans zimmer just needs to stop. whoever is mixing films with his music turned to loud volumes while all of the characters whisper, it is getting annoying and tedious.riveting dialog. extremely quotable lines that one will remember for a generation. such as 'what is that smell?' 'garlic, you want some' 'no'. or 'where is he?'.acting i thought was passable. gosling was fine, robot girlfriend good, hench girl had a bit of bite, leto was cut again from the film and only had one scene? even ford does better in this film than his last decade of work, although probably because he only has a few minutes of screen time.plot / pacing? no plot to speak of. a detective is sent on a job, and an old man is reunited with his daughter. i felt like there was no urgency or tension at all. the blackout they constantly talk about sounded more interesting than this whole film. plot problems are possibly due to the filmmakers splitting up the film and putting clips out as marketing instead of part of the film???? pacing didn't bother me although i understand the frustration some people have with the lingering shots. there are a lot of lingering meandering shots.characters? none to speak of with no emotions at all. all characters are robots except deckard and the police captain and Wallace, who get about 20 minutes screen time combined. WALL-E had more emotion! and that was a kids film! the only emotional part of this film came when they played a clip from the 1982 blade runner. which made ford's character cry. if your only emotional scene is playing a clip from a previous film i think its time to quit.as a sequel its 0/10 for me. about as worthless as the 'happy ending' ending to the first film. maybe it will be saved by editing later with a final cut? one can only hope. there are many unanswered questions in the film , the unanswered questions do not affect my rating. if they ever make a sequel to this, i hope they do not answer the questions because i'm afraid ridley Scott would just make up terrible answers as he did with Prometheus and alien covenant.one interesting thing this movie made me think about is if deckard is a replicant then i will stop liking blade runner 1982. because those scenes of him eating and drinking would annoy me to no end. robots do not need to eat food.",1,5,8,17 November 2017
