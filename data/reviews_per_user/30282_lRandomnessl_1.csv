Iron Man 3," It made sense, & I love it for that.
","The movie relates deeply with the previous 3 (including the Avengers) and the psychological state of Tony Stark in the whole movie made sense and gave a fair share of events! Can't really complain of anything, the originality in the development of the plot as an extension of what it followed tops everything else. The humor was there, the love moments were there, the action was there and on top *spoiler* Bruce Banner was there :D Gotta love these two together, glad Marvel is feeling the same way. Really really really excited to see how his return will be played out for Iron Man 4 or The Avengers 2, I have complete faith in there brilliancy with writing. Good work Marvel.",10,19,31,12 October 2013
