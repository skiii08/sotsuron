Miracle," Outstanding
","As a life-long hockey player, I felt this film was long overdue. It was well done, and the acting was outstanding, especially Kurt Russell (who deserves an Oscar nomination), and all of the hockey players.The choreography was incredible considering how tough it is to recreate hockey. It is too bad many of the shots used in the movie are impossible in real hockey games.I do wish I new how much was genuine and how much was dramatized to fit 6 months into 2 hours. The director's commentary helps out with that to a large degree, but more information would have been great. For those interested in the DVD, the behind the scenes features are pretty interesting.",9,1,1,24 August 2004
