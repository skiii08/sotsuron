Ali," excellent acting,despite fair screenplay
","The acting makes the movie. Some scenes were too long and meaningless. The movie tried to be a documentary. I would like the Olympic Gold Medal at least mentioned in the movie. Will Smith,Jon Voight and Mario Van Peeples were excellent playing people familiar to most of us. The fight sequences were well staged.",6,0,0,30 December 2001
The Mummy Returns," great special effects,highly entertaining
","This movie had an uneven,highly improbable plot but it was great to watch, never a dull moment. The special effects were first class. The action sequences which Brendan Frasier was in,it was difficult to determine if it was him or a double or stunt man. Unlike most blockbuster movies,this movie did cast many minorities.",7,0,0,18 November 2001
