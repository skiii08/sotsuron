The Blair Witch Project," Scary, after a while
","Interesting movie that I didn't really find scary or disturbing... until about 3 hours after I saw it.  I realized that the final 5 minutes of the movie were really a lot more creepy than I thought while I watched.  I know it's been said, but the image in the room at the end of the film was truly chilling.  Oddly enough, I think this movie may be even better on video, in the dark and private confines of your living room, letting your imagination play without the disruption of bag candy and popcorn eating.  Really enjoyed the fact that the movie let you use your imagination instead of having the movie be your imagination.",8,2,3,2 August 1999
Fight Club," Wasn't impressed
","After reading through some of the reviews, it's obvious I'm in the severe minority.  I waited for this movie.  I even looked forward to it.  I've really liked Edward Norton's performances lately, but Brad has been missing big time.  Since Kalifornia has been my favorite Brad movie so far, I was hoping he would recapture some of the full characterization he gave in his acting in that movie.  Alas, I still see no power in Brad's acting ability. Edward Norton was good, but was limited by the character.  Didn't have as much punch as I was hoping.  Kind of intriguing and kind of silly.  Not my favorite movie of the year.",6,0,2,16 November 1999
Shakespeare in Love," Entertaining but certainly not GREAT
","I finally saw this movie (and yes, I did enjoy it) after overcoming my outrage that this film beat out Saving Private Ryan as Best Picture of the year.  WHAT???!!!  I thought that maybe it was crafted better as a film; nope.  Maybe the characters were more interesting; nope.  Maybe the acting was better; nope.  I'm sorry, but it seems so obvious that the studio heads obviously BOUGHT the Oscars this film received, especially Best Picture. Yes, I was entertained by this movie, but I was MOVED by Private Ryan. This film is not in the same class.  I'm still outraged.",Null,1,2,23 August 1999
The Mummy," Indiana Jones meets The Mummy
","This was a great escape.  Let it go and have fun.  It's full of cliches, but it's ok.  The great scope of the action, interesting story line, and great special effects (I feel like I'm going to be saying that a lot more as time goes on) made this really a lot of fun.  Don't analyze, just enjoy.",7,0,0,18 May 1999
L.A. Confidential," better the second time 'round
","I just saw this movie for the second time the other night, and enjoyed it MUCH more than the first time.  There were plot and character subtleties that were much easier to appreciate, without having to concentrate as much on what was going on (following the film noir guideline of having a complicated story line).  This movie successfully avoided stereotypical characters; each character had many motivations, some sympathetic, some not. Loved Kevin Spacey's performance (not unusual), and Guy Pearce was really good as Exley.  The thing that most surprised me, however, was finding that James Cromwell who so wonderfully played the heavy, Dudley Smith, is the same James Cromwell that played the wonderful farmer Hoggett in 'Babe'. Talk about different characters.",7,4,7,18 January 1999
Predator," Blood, guts, and testosterone
","What a great action flick!  Special effects are very cool and the cast is MUCHO MACHO.  Guns, blood, guts, aliens, and great 'screaming while shooting' scenes.  Good to be able to see what at least one of our governors was up to in 1987.  What a blast.",8,1,2,3 January 2000
Notting Hill," Charming and funny
","I guess sometimes I'm a sucker for a really good romantic comedy.  Hugh Grant has such a great screen persona (at least in this kind of role). Extremely charming and amusing, he is.  Rhys Ifans comes as close to stealing a film as a supporting actor can, he was perfect.  Gee, did I mention Julia Roberts?  I'm not really a fan, but I thought she was very appealing in the role. The ensemble cast was also very well put together, the writing fresh and very funny.  Go ahead and see it, you'll like it.",8,6,6,28 June 1999
Armageddon," Formula pap
","I don't think I've ever seen a movie that reeked so much of being put together by someone's simple minded idea of a formula. Let's see, the wise cracking but good hearted hero (Willis), the handsome young trooper that will save the day (Affleck), the love interest (Tyler), etc. etc.  Reducing and limiting Steve Buscemi to a series of wise cracks is a complete waste of his talent.  There were so many 'dramatic', 'tear jerking', and 'heroic' scenes, it was ridiculous.  Hey, I've seen some really good action movies can at least hold your interest.  This movie is REALLY lame.",4,0,1,10 January 2000
American Beauty," Much ado about not that much
","Just like last year, when 'Shakespeare in Love' won best picture, I asked myself 'why?'.  This year, when 'American Beauty' wins best picture, I ask myself 'why?'.  This was indeed a good movie, but proclaiming it one of the best American movies ever is completely absurd.  I really really like Kevin Spacey, but sometimes he seems like he's playing, well, Kevin Spacey. Annette Bening was TERRIFIC.  Interesting, but leaves you wanting.  Hate to say anything negative about Kevin Spacey, but in my opinion, Richard Farnesworth's performance in 'The Straight Story' should have hands down won him the Academy Award for best actor.",8,0,0,1 June 2000
Being John Malkovich," Fabulously original and funny
","I looked at the timer on the VCR.  It was at 14 minutes.  I had just stopped laughing virtually continuously from the beginning of the movie (took a breather, then laughed some more). This is hands down one of the most original and hysterical movies I've ever seen.  From the seven and a half floor (what an idea), to Dr. Lester's secretary, I barely survived the first half hour, then it just got better. IF YOU ARE A MOVIE FAN YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE!!!  Can't go on about it enough.",10,0,1,4 May 2000
Dark City," Truly fascinating
","This one started a little slowly for me, I actually almost lost interest because the movie almost didn't hold together for me for the first 15 minutes or so.  I found the character development to be very slow, but I think this was appropriate because of the nature of the plot.  I'm glad I hung in.  I found the story line to be TRULY fascinating (I don't see too many really good sci-fi movies anymore).  Special effects were outstanding (the complete change of the cityscape was great and the aliens were really well done).  This is one that needs to be seen more than once because of the intricacy of the story (i.e. who/what are we really?).",8,0,1,5 October 1998
The Exorcist," Frightening and disturbing
","Time seems to blunt the effectiveness of some horror movies, but The Exorcist isn't one of them.  The real day-to-day feel of the movie (i.e. we're not in outer space or something) only feeds the fear.  If you're a religious person, or were brought up Catholic, there are definite religious overtones that can definitely get under your skin (the quick shot of the defiled Virgin Mary really got under mine).  The visual effects are stunning and repulsive, but what I noticed this time around (again) is how important the sound track is in setting the horrifying mood of the movie.  Got to see the DVD 25th anniversary edition, which has some extra scenes (I know it has a second subliminal vision of the scary-as-hell face of one the demon).  No ordinary movie, watch it if you dare (seriously).",10,1,1,14 February 2000
American History X," Powerful, will leave you thinking.
","I first have to say how great Edward Norton's performance is.  Powerfully angry and touching, he does an incredible job.  I also have to say that Edward Furlong also did an excellent job portraying the younger brother.  I found myself thinking about this movie the next day.  The black&white/color aspect was interesting.  It both served as a divider between the past and the present, but I believe it also served as a metaphor for the closed mind Derek had in the black and white footage and the enlightened mind he had in the color footage.  Pretty deep, huh? Definitely left an impact.",8,0,0,20 April 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Most powerful movie I've ever seen
","My father was in WWII in the Pacific, and at least two of my uncles were in the European theatre (both were at the Battle of the Bulge, one was a medic).  I saw this movie, not to see a war movie, but to be able to in some way understand the experiences of those who went through the war.  I thought this was an incredibly powerful and emotional movie which did help me understand why my father NEVER spoke of the war, as I know many veterans do not or cannot.  My wife and I remained in our seats several minutes after the movie ended, we were both deeply affected.  I recommend that everyone see this movie to get a realistic taste of the futility of war.",10,0,0,25 September 1998
There's Something About Mary," a little crass, a little tasteless, VERY funny
","I was screaming laughing at so many things in this movie, it made me tired. I didn't realize the directors also did Dumb and Dumber, whose complete stupidity made me turn if off half way through.  Well, this is different because it's stupid AND funny. Really enjoyed Ben Stiller's performance.",8,0,0,8 February 1999
Life Is Beautiful," Just wonderful
","For the first half of the movie, I felt like I was watching a comedy from the 30's or 40's.  We get to see a little slapstick, and a lot of warm, lovable characters.  Interesting how Benigni can change the tone of the film so quickly, yet with so much subtlety.  I've heard this movie criticized for its depiction of concentration camp life, but COME ON!  The father's need to protect his child from his surroundings was truly touching. I loved the little boy.  It seems that Hollywood is always casting fairly obnoxious child characters.  This kid was so sweet, just looking at his face was worth the price of admission.  A movie obviously done with respect and affection.",9,1,2,16 November 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Fascinating and visually stunning
","I read many bad reviews before seeing this movie, but I had to see it because of the simple fact that it is a Stanley Kubrick movie.  First of all, it should go without saying that the movie was visually stunning.  The contrasts of the reds/oranges and deep blues were noticeable throughout the entire movie.  Sets were 'perfect'.  My real surprise came when I found myself involved and interested in the story.  I think that the 10 minute segment when Nicole smoked the joint and didn't get exactly happy was one of the most dead-on accurate portrayals of how married life can be, the scene was absolutely fabulous.  Strange plot, but, what else is new?",Null,0,0,25 April 2000
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Powerful, funny, dramatic, inspiring; what more can I say
","Just saw this movie again after having not seen it for years.  It's a great reminder of how lucky I've been to see Jack Nicholson act in movies.  He embodied his character completely with an incredible performance.  I think I actually had to wipe the frost off of my TV screen when Louise Fletcher appeared, her performance of the freezing cold Nurse Ratched was also memorable.  Supporting cast was also excellent, especially Sydney Lassick as the overly neurotic Cheswick.  Interesting early performances by Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd.  A definite MUST SEE.",9,1,3,6 April 1999
The Waterboy," Stupid and funny
","I have to admit this is my first Adam Sandler movie.  I wasn't sure if I could make it through the first 10 minutes with his 12-year-old's elocution, but I stuck it out.  Yeah, most of it was stuff I've pretty much seen before, but I was laughing out loud for a good portion of the movie.  Some good physical comedy, and I know it was really stupid, but I loved the Cajun coach.",6,2,3,17 March 1999
Tombstone," Fun, action-packed western
","Yeah, it was a great time.  Just saw it again after a number of years and still liked it.  The main thing I remembered from the film was Val Kilmer's performance as Doc Holliday, which was equally as great the second time around.    Tough good guys (Kurt Russell, Sam 'coolest moustache' Elliott and Kilmer). Really bad bad guys, Curly Bill (Powers Boothe) and Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehne) come immediately to mind.  Very entertaining.  See it if you like action/westerns.",6,0,3,12 July 1999
The Deer Hunter," Uncomfortably powerful
","Another movie I saw years ago and just revisited.  What a rich and powerful movie!  The portions of the movie that dealt with life in a Pennsylvania steel town were rich in character interaction, as well as setting (I could feel the cold of the town).  However, what really grabbed me the first time AND this time I saw it, was the depiction of the insanity that occurred in Vietnam.  This was the first movie that I ever saw that began to open my eyes as to the true horror and insanity of war. I say the movie was uncomfortably powerful because I found myself to be very tense throughout the war scenes of the movie.  Honestly, I wasn't able to imagine scenes as horrible until they were shown to me.  Once again, it gave me a new respect for those that have fought and withstood the horrors of any war.  The whole cast of the movie was excellent, with my own special kudos to DeNiro and Walken, who were incredible.",9,0,0,28 April 1999
The Truman Show," Fascinating premise
","With the myriad of movies out there that are strictly 'formulated', this was an incredibly refreshing movie.  I thought that the plot line was very original and imaginative.  What really got to me in this movie was not the technology, but Truman's relationship with his 'friends', and how sad I thought it was that even his 'best friend' was anything but.  Lots of deeper meanings meandering beneath the surface, one is the coldness which people inflict upon one another using the excuse that it is 'professional' or OK because everyone else is doing it.  Jim Carrey puts in a very touching performance.  Ed Harris was excellent as his own god.  Highly recommended.",8,0,0,19 January 1999
