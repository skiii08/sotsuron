Hereditary," Ridiculously stupid
","The raves over Hereditary inspired us to watch it. I love smart, visually arresting horror films; this is one of the _stupidest_ films that I have ever seen, and a most calculating and slick attempt at 'serious horror' (major fail). As far as the cinematography and set design go, the film looks good, but, man, are we all expected to put our brains to sleep? Some of the dialogue had us cracking up (the mother's explanation of her attempt to burn the daughter's sketch book; her first appearance at the therapy group...and I could go on). We would have gotten kicked out of our local Alamo Drafthouse for laughing, at the film. Early on, we thought that it might be an intentional horror-comedy, but nope. Wasted actors; story lines that go nowhere, because they are really about the nifty set design (the mother's miniature dioramas); _absurdly_ non-sensical plot details (yes, take your kid sister with life-threatening peanut allergies and for whom we cannot be bothered to carry an Epipen to your teenage party!)--and then it really goes off the rails. Just disgraceful, and insultingly stupid--and worst of all, _not scary_.",1,5,11,21 December 2018
The Irishman," Tedious and empty
","I love many Scorsese films, but...The Irishman is an overly long nostalgia piece: the gangsters are ruthless; the women are mere bystanders and funeral attendees (why hire Anna Paquin just to glower?); the make-up and computer manipulated faces are distracting. Seeing Pesci, Pacino and DeNiro together again is enjoyable for a while, but the film just feels soulless and empty to me. No ideas, no message--just a fraternal reunion of some acting pals. Not satisfying.",4,24,45,30 November 2019
