Blade Runner 2049," People Falling Asleep
","I was so looking forward to this movie. The ratings here are so far off I'm not sure what to think. Usually they are more accurate, not this time though. This movie is about 2 hours to long, people started to fall asleep beside us. Even my husband was nodding off. I love slow paced movies as long as it's building a story but the only thing that kept me awake was the extremely loud blowing of horns in the sound track every 15 minutes or so. I don't ever walk out of movies but this one I came so close so many times. Harrison Ford only comes in during the last hour and that is when some of the action and story come to life. But the first two hours are brutal. Just an awful movie.",4,15,33,8 October 2017
1917," It's an ok movie
","We don't really know anything about the star of the movie and so there is no investment in him. Yes we want him to make the journey to warn the troops and we go along the run with him, but really that's it. It's an empty movie, by the time he finds the brother for his friend you have forgotten all about his friend and know nothing about him so you really don't care. Such a shame...",5,5,13,12 January 2020
It Chapter Two," So much more then the trailer
","Wow.. This movie is probably the best movie I've seen in the last two years at the movie theater. The movie theater has been turning out garbage for a while now. People are staying home and watching HBO, ShowTime, NetFlix, Hulu, etc. I would rather stay home and watch good tv then spend money going to the movies with the crap they have been playing but my 77 year old Father still loves going to the movies and keeps holding out that one day when we go they will play a good movie like the good old days. I've told him that time has come and gone. So today I didn't hold out any hope that he would stay awake, since he sleeps thru or parchal almost every movie I take him to. But this more than 2 hour movie he stayed awake for and was engaged with questions. Even if he got a shushe from me ;) I hate the political stance that King has taken, I think he's lost a lot of fans, but being a movie fan and historian I was very excited to see him do a camo for more than 3 minutes. It was awesome. I will be going to see this again. This time with my son and catching all of the details I missed the first time around. GREAT MOVIE...",10,11,20,7 September 2019
