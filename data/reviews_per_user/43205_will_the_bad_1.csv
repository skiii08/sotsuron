Scarface," Excellent
","After watching cribs on mtv i noticed that nearly all the rappers, basketball players and other American celebs, all raved about this film 'scarface'. so i was intrigued to find out what it was all about. Luckily the special ed DVD was released soon after, so i bought it. And the film was immense. If you've seen the film i don't need to tell you how good it is, if you haven't seen it, get a copy, borrow beg or steal, see it.there are so many memorable moments, especially one of the last scenes in the film. 'say hello to my little friends' - classic. Al Pacino is a movie god. Amazing film.",10,1,2,9 July 2004
