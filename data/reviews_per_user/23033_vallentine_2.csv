Catch Me If You Can," loved it. So funny, Leo is really good
","Just saw Catch me if you Can. After laughing my head off through the book I was reluctant to see the film. I was expecting the movie to be scant and painfully shallow, as many cinematic recreations are. This was a total surprise. Leonardo was so good as the conflicted con man but the best performance by far was from Christopher Walken. His crying scene in the restaurant was superb. You can see why he was Oscar nominated for this one, and you can see why he won one for The Deer Hunter. Tom Hanks was good. Always watchable and pretty likeable, but back to Leo. When I first heard he was cast I was disappointed. I thought Robert Downey would have been the better choice. Frank Abagnale was 16 who looked 26. Leo is 26 who looks 16, but somehow he pulls it off. I have never seen an actor change so comprehensively via a haircut. His change of looks are very convincing and carries the role perfectly. His charm and wit are excellent for the role and the cat and mouse themes from the book are perfectly represented in the film. See it. It's great.",Null,0,1,26 March 2003
Barry Lyndon," I keep coming back to Barry Lyndon. It is magnificent.
","I keep coming back to Barry Lyndon as my favourite, all-time film. It is magnificent in every department. The pacing is superb, the humour is subtle, the story is engrossing, the performances are understated yet brilliant, the art direction is impeccable, the music is sublime, the cinematography is faultless and the overall result is an epic masterpiece that gets better with each viewing. For these reasons the film is lost on many a film lover. It is an intellectual piece and I'm so glad he made it such. (People who find it boring, stale and unintelligible should quietly retire to Video Ezy and rent out Die Hard, buy some popcorn and coke, invite a view buddies over and enjoy a rowdy night in.) Any way, back to Barry Lyndon. Stanley Kubrick never repeated himself, which even the greatest directors do some of the time. All of his films, which he had artistic and financial control over bear, a strikingly original note. Compare the uniqueness of Dr Strangelove to Lolita, or Clockwork Orange to The Shining, or Full Metal Jacket to Eyes Wide Shut. The differences in subject matter and content are vast yet a similar vehicle is visited in four of his films. The military is used in Paths of Glory, Dr. Strangelove, Barry Lyndon and Full Metal Jacket. This military theme in his films seems to throw some light on man's proclivities towards violence and human debasement. There are a further 176 comments made about this film. Not many other films on IMDb have that many comments. Testimony to the stature of the film. Barry Lyndon's kindred spirits are Radiohead, Mozart, Picasso, and Cormac McCarthy.",Null,1,2,14 October 2004
