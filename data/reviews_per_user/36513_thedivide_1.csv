Blade Runner 2049," Happy I saw it but the original was the masterpiece *spoilers*
","I am a huge fan of the original but I liked this movie as well. It didn't have the heart rending scenes of the original, Roy and Pris's last scenes, or the interesting love story of Deckard and Rachel, but it tried. I think what this movie was really trying to do was set up for more sequels. That said, seeing the old Deckard see the remade replicant of Rachel brought a mist to my eyes. I guess I liked this movie because I loved the first one. I wanted more. More info on Jared Ledo's character and Luv for example. Why did she cry every time she killed for one. I wanted more out of this film than it gave, but I still think it's worth seeing.",7,0,1,15 October 2017
