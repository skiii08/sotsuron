Raiders of the Lost Ark," Worst movie of the top 50 movies on IMDb
","Just watched it and I must say I'm not impressed. I totally respect the fact that it is made in 1981. and some graphic parts are stunning for that age, but it just has to much flaws, nonsense in the plot and lame character development. I mean, Germans are presented like stupid robots. They don't even have the ability to move when they are in danger or something, they just wait to die. Most of the scenes and character decisions are really unlikely to happen in real life, that's something i can't forgive even in the fantasy/adventure movie. I really like the car chase scene, though. 7/10. I expected far more intelligent movie, because of the love it got over the years, not some nonsense action with really poor character development.",7,1,6,12 February 2015
