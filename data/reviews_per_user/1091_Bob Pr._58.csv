The King's Speech," Informative, entertaining, uplifting, memorable
","Stars Colin Firth (as Bertie/King George VI), Helena Bonham Carter (as his wife), Geoffrey Rush (as Lionel Logue, his speech therapist), Guy Pearce (as his older brother, David/King Edward VIII/Duke of Windsor).The narrative imagines the private and public lives of British royalty and behind the scenes British government in the 1920s-1940s era. Some events and situations are public knowledge: that King George V died, that he was briefly followed by his eldest son ('David,' Edward VIII) who then abdicated within a year to marry a divorced American commoner, Wallis Simpson, 'the woman I love,' who was then succeeded by his next younger brother, Bertie/George VI, who had long standing speech problems (stuttering/stammering). And that an Australian speech therapist, Lionel Logue, helped him largely overcome that to the extent the King was able to effectively address his empire through the trying times of WW II.The movie takes some relatively minor (IMO) liberties with historical accuracy for the sake of spinning a more interesting story. It imagines and presumes much of the private lives and motivations of the royal family and presents them sympathetically. The growing wedge between Bertie (+ the rest of the royal family and government) and David uses little imagination and many known facts. The success of Logue's speech therapy is very clear from pre- and post-treatment newsreels of that era. BUT that it was achieved by Logue being so provocatively teasing and taunting of Bertie seems to have been wholly invented in this movie to spice up and dramatize their therapy relationship; e.g., it's not in Logue's grandson's book about Logue and his relationship with the royal family (based on Logue's own notes!)--or any other reports about their relationship I've seen.But, that aside, TKS is a great movie, weaving together history, crisis, family, the slow development of an effective therapeutic relationship and the growth it fostered. Many people describe the film as being very uplifting and I agree.Surely it's a very strong candidate for best picture (& best actor & best supporting actor) in this year's Oscars as well as very deserving of a lasting place among IMDb's all-time best 250 films ever, even without a single chase, sex, or battle scene--or the spilling of blood!",10,2,4,18 January 2011
Moneyball," Fascinating bio: both for human interest & its inside look at baseball
","(This film is based on the true-life book of the same name by Michael Lewis.)Billy Beane, the General Manager of the Oakland A's, is wrestling with trying to put together a winning baseball team when his budget is the lowest of any major league team. Whenever his team does well, the more affluent teams hire away all his best players. How to win?--or even survive?Beane (Brad Pitt) turns to the work of Bill James, who invented a variety of new statistical ways ('sabermetrics') for evaluating major league baseball players and what it takes to win ball games. Billy finds a statistical nerd & baseball addict, Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), a recent Yale economics graduate, who understands how to apply Sabermetrics to identify and hopefully acquire those low cost players who would be the biggest help to the team's winning. Billy makes Brand his team's assistant GM and risks everything, daring to walk a plank -- either leading to an abyss or across a bridge to success.In part, the film shows the conflict between the old, time honored style of largely intuitive evaluations by baseball scouts and coaches versus this use of strange, new, statistical evaluations. In recent media interviews, baseball insiders say this film really captures the feel and scenes inside club houses, BB meetings, negotiations, etc. But it also has touching, human elements (e.g., between Beane and his daughter). The book/film, based on true events, is only slightly prettified. (Quite a bit more about James & Sabermetrics is described in Wikipedia; search it for: 'Will James Sabermetrics'. And/or google 'Paul DePodesta,' the actual assistant GM for Beane, on which the film character of Peter Brand was based.)",9,0,2,26 September 2011
Black Swan," Compelling, interesting for 90%--but not enjoyable for 10%
","A young ballerina ('Nina'/Natalie Portman) is held in an imprisoning relationship with her single mother (Barbara Hershey) who, herself, had been an aspiring ballerina until.... It's never explicitly stated but it's easily inferred that the mother's career ended when she became pregnant with Nina after an affair with her ballet master and that she's trying to fulfill her own thwarted ambitions through guiding Nina. What we see in Nina is a young woman with a reliance on her mother more typical of a 9-11 year old girl (and with a similar stunted personal maturity), trying to fulfill mother's desire to be the perfect ballerina her mother wished to be and avoid any romantic relationships (which could interfere with reaching that goal as it had for her mother).Nina suddenly has a chance to dance the role of the Swan Queen (the white swan) in 'Swan Lake' but must also dance (as standard for this ballet) her nemesis' role, a look-alike black swan. As the virtuous White Swan, Nina's perfect but her ballet master (who aims to have sex with Nina) keeps badgering her to be sexier, more seducing as the non-virtuous Black Swan. This, of course, clashes with Nina's mother's upbringing of Nina.This clash provokes a developing psychotic reaction which Nina does not recognize--and, for awhile, neither do we, the film's viewers: we react to some scenes as actual experiences of Nina only to find out later that those episodes were the stuff of Nina's psychosis. And we leave the theater very unsure of how much of what we saw of Nina's experiences were real or her hallucinations. I'm sure our fascination with this uncertainty and trying to unravel the tangle of reality from insanity contributes much to what drives many viewers to be fascinated with this movie. (E.g., look at the questions and debates on IMDb's Message Board for this film.)IMO, the pathological relation between Nina and her mother that sets up what follows was exceptionally well done by Portman and Hershey. There's enough similarity in their facial features that we easily see them as mother and adult child. All the other cast members ('Lily'/Mila Kunis as a real world seductive Black Swan and rival; Vincent Cassel as the preying ballet master) seemed perfectly chosen and gave excellent performances. My movie companion (who took ballet for years) said the scenes of ballet practices were authentic.IMO some of those therapists experienced in treating personality & psychotic disorders (especially including the various schizophrenias) may be among those having quibbles with 'Black Swan.' E.g., the clash between Nina's internalized aims of her mother vs. those of her ballet master would certainly provoke a massive conflict within Nina. But a depressive reaction would be far more likely and, if a psychotic reaction did occur, there'd surely be noticeable disorganization between her episodes of hallucinations (i.e., she'd not be able to function or dance normally between those psychotic episodes). But captivating narratives have never had to strictly follow reality to make them enjoyable--e.g., 'Alice in Wonderland,' 'Kiki's Delivery Service,' 'Star Wars,' 'Harry Potter,' the 'Twilight' vampire series, and hundreds of others. 'Black Swan' is an entertaining, psycho-fictional, horror movie--it's NOT a realistic case study or documentary.I think IMDb's current rating of 8.7 of 10 stars and Ebert's rating of 3.5 of 4 stars are both representative of how most of the general public will react to this film.I think a 4 or 5 of 10 (or even less) could be more typical by some of my shrink brethren with much mental health experience dealing with psychoses as well as from those offended by the lesbian sexual content or the gore.",8,1,4,29 December 2010
Howl's Moving Castle," Mainstream Miyazaki/StudioGhibli -- stunning artwork
","American title: 'Howl's Moving Castle'Anyone familiar with previous films from this group will find the development and maturation of a young woman (in this case, Sofi) familiar territory. What changes in this compared with previous movies are the challenges she must face, the self-doubts she must overcome on her way to eventual triumph.I hadn't realized the movie was loosely adapted from an English novel in which it was made clear that the name 'Howl' is a contraction of 'Howell'. I found reading the IMDb Message Board comments on this film to be enormously helpful in my understanding of the movie and would have appreciated seeing the movie even more with the knowledge that gave.For instance, I didn't realize Sofi was also a witch with magical powers or that her sudden old age was partially a result of her own self-doubts about her appearance and vitality. Nor did I sufficiently realize how much Howl was sometimes less than honorable, trustworthy, and dependable.But even without that, the movie was satisfying and enjoyable. The artwork was the best ever (IMO) by Miyazaki/Studio Ghibli and was visually stunning.",9,0,1,7 May 2008
Walk the Line," Great psychologically; Great musically.
","I'm a retired clinical psychologist and family therapist and get annoyed when psychological and family dynamics are inaccurately portrayed; I was not annoyed. I do NOT normally like country music.Movies, with their time and development constraints, can only explicate one (maybe one and a half) characters. In this case, they did a great job on Johnny. His early closeness with his brother, the effects of his alcoholic father and his complex, changing relationship with him, his burdens and attempts to escape from those, are quite realistically portrayed in the film.What there was not time enough to portray was what motivated June Carter Cash. In a way, she seems the more remarkable person.GREAT movie!! LOVED the music!! The performance of Joachim Phoenix was absolutely at the highest while that of Reese Witherspoon was maybe slightly above that. Great chemistry between them.This HAS to be an Oscar winner.",10,1,2,12 December 2005
Casablanca," truly great, truly satisfying
","Ingrid Bergman & Humprey Bogart co-star in this drama of early WW-II intrigue that was nominated for 8 Oscars (& won 3: best picture, screenplay, actor). Its supporting cast was magnificent and huge (Claude Rains, Paul Henreid, Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, S.Z. Sakall, Dooley Wilson). 'Casablanca,' at this moment, ranks #16 of IMDb's All Time Best 250 films and it's also on Roger Ebert's list of Great Movies.It's a tale pitting those who are (or have been) active in resistance to the Nazis mixing with those who are just trying to survive by hook or crook AND officials of Nazi Germany as well as those French officials with mixed loyalties to occupied vs. unoccupied France. Rick (Bogart) was active in the French resistance to the Nazis during which time he met and fell in love with Ilsa (Bergman). Hurriedly fleeing the Nazi occupation of Paris but feeling unexpectedly deserted by Ilsa's failure to accompany him, Rick's moved into a 'survivalist' mode in French Morocco. Ilsa has a husband (Henreid) with whom she's reunited after believing him to be dead; the couple show up unintentionally, unexpectedly, in Rick's café, searching for passage to a safer place. Claude Rains' performance, in his role as the head of French military/ security forces in Casblanca, gives THE most pivotal of all performances in elevating this film into its stellar level in the opinion of some (see comments to this effect in the Message Board for this film). After reading and reflecting on this, I fully agree.IMO, Ebert's review is VERY worthwhile & helpful (see IMDb's 'External Reviews' of this film, then click on Chicago Sun-Times/Ebert's). In that, among other things, we learn the narrative/dialog wasn't written until they filmed it so Bergman (& others) didn't know the outcome until it was actually shot.Also, IMDb's Bio on Dooley Wilson ('Sam, the piano player'--see IMDb's 'Cast'/'bio') shows us that his career took off after this movie. Sam's music in the café was seamlessly integrated into the narrative and becomes, essentially, a great, additional, supporting cast member. I don't recall Bergman ever being so lovely--but how in the world did women of that time pack and travel with those hats?",10,2,3,2 December 2010
Erin Brockovich," Star power, snappy 1-liners, 'T&A', & the hassles of poor, single Moms meet 'A Civil Action'
","Inevitably, EB will be compared to 'A Civil Action' since it's based on true David v. Goliath stories; one (of several) is of a small law firm taking on a giant corporation over an issue of toxic waste -- and winning.  But the movie gives a little less than that in some ways and a great deal more in others.The courtroom side and many of the legal machinations are less emphasized and of more prominence we see: (1) the battle for respect between the lawyer (Masry/Finney) and the single Mom (EB/Roberts), (2) the difficulties of being a poor single Mom (or her kids) (3) the struggle to balance the present needs of children against what performance in this job could do for their future, (4) if children are to be adequately cared for, who's the SOMEone who makes what sacrifice, (5) the battle between being one's self (even if unconventional) vs. what the corporate world demands, (6) the conflict between responsibility to one's family vs. responsibility for the plight of others, (7) how much should we get involved with fighting the system?All worthwhile themes to explore.For some of us, it might have been a better movie if the EB character was played by a star less prominent than Roberts.  While it's her best job and most complex role so far (in her view, mine, and many others), I never lost the feeling of watching JR, the star, play this part (at least not in the way I do when seeing Robert Duvall, or Daniel Day-Lewis, -- but that asks too much).  And I suspect that her millions of fans wouldn't want to lose that much sight of her.  So, fortunately, this movie -- showing so much of JR's T&A and laced with zingy repartee -- will draw in far more people and get millions more thinking about some really worthwhile issues than with any other actor in the EB role, no matter how good they might have been.The film does make some into caricatures as short cuts (e.g., a suited female attorney) but no one expects accurate characterizations of _all_ dramatis persona (after all, even The Bard used buffoons for spice). Finney is superb opposite JR and the interplay between the two is great. All the supporting roles are well-cast and played -- JR's biker boyfriend is especially good.While it's easy to see PG&E as an 'evil empire,' I found myself thinking (1) isn't it fortunate we have such a well-developed legal system in the US? Similar things happen in Russia, or perhaps Indonesia or Mexico, e.g., and what recourse do people have?  And (2) will this movie inspire those of us who work for the PG&Es of this world to thread our way between the demands of our personal security, on the one hand (to not jeopardize our promotion, retirement, mortgages, paying for our kids' college, the profit of PG&E's shareholders, etc.) vs. doing right by the people our own PG&E might have injured on the other hand?I hope so -- wouldn't that be great?",Null,0,0,20 March 2000
Citizen Kane," The more I've learned about this film, the more I've enjoyed it
","If you see this movie without any advance knowledge, it's a good story with good acting. But the more I've learned about its background and history, the more fascinating it's become.Orson Welles (OW) was only 25, famous for his radio acting group, but with no previous movie experience when given carte blanche to make a film completely on his own with all editing at his discretion. OW and the writer Herb Mankiewicz (HM) discussed using several notable contemporary characters (e.g., Howard Hughs) as take-offs for the main character to be portrayed in flashbacks. They settled on newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst, possibly because HM had been friends with Hearst & his mistress, movie star Marion Davies, until HM's always getting drunk at their parties led to their excluding him (which ticked off HM).The film's principal character of 'Charles Foster Kane' (CFK) is an amalgam of fantasy plus some features of Hearst as well as others, (including OW's huge ego, OW's huge temper, OW's being orphaned and brought up by a non-relative). CFK's promotion of his 2nd wife, 'Susan Alexander,' as an opera star was based very closely on the otherwise unrelated actions of a (real life) contemporary Chicago tycoon, Harold McCormick, with his 2nd wife.When Hearst learned of CFK's resemblance to him, he ordered his publishing empire (28 metropolitan USA newspapers + many radio stations) to make NO mention, carry NO advertising AT ALL of this film. That quashed its reception in the USA in all but a few metro areas. It was only after 1955, when RKO sold its film library to TV, that 'Citizen Kane' ('CK') began being widely seen and appreciated. French 'New Wave' directors were also extolling 'CK's' innovative greatness.'CK' made a number of breakthroughs. Previously: -- film narratives had been told sequentially and from only one point of view. In 'CK', CFK dies at the beginning and the rest of the film is a series of flashbacks; a reporter seeks out CFK's life and several characters give contrasting views; -- cinematography had filmed scenes in residences horizontally, as if viewing a theater set; CK's cinematographer excavated holes in the floor to make some shots from unique levels; -- a dining table was incrementally lengthened in repeated scenes of CFK with his 1st wife to enhance the growing distance between them; -- plus many, many other innovations.Probably due to Hearst's restrictive measures against the film, 'CK' did not make money for RKO. Since its resurgence, many experts have called it the greatest American film ever (or, sometimes, greatest film ever).I saw it several months ago in a KU faculty alum film series and, just again, in another monthly film series. While it was enjoyable the first time, it became more so the second time because I knew and attended to more.For those interested in these areas, I highly commend the Wikipedia article on 'Citizen Kane' (as well as theirs on 'Orson Welles'). Wiki's article on 'CK' (IMO) seems fairly balanced (while some books/articles on 'CK' are not) -- & as a bonus, you'll learn which part of whose anatomy that 'Rosebud' was a euphemism for!",9,1,2,10 December 2011
Monster," Wow! Excellent!!
","While this is not always a comfortable movie to watch, it is extremely satisfying and -- IMO, great.Theron's performance is fully deserving of all the honors she's already won and any (e.g., the Oscar) for which she's nominated.  This is far beyond acting -- Theron IS the character.I haven't seen any of the documentaries on Aileen W. and do not doubt that there are alternative perspectives on her life that could be held.  This particular view is sympathetic to Aileen, showing her as an abused child, seriously crippled in her fight to survive, and starved for and unfamiliar with a caring relationship in any form.      Her gradual slide into serial killing as a way to maintain her new found relationship and love with Selby (Ricci) struck me (a retired therapist) as believable and convincingly plausible and true to life. 
Ricci does an excellent, convincing job as Selby, Aileen's teenage lover although the film doesn't develop her character as much as Aileen's.Certainly this is one of the very best movies of 2003.  Theron's performance is probably the best of a decade.",10,0,0,3 February 2004
Amistad," Extremely worthwhile for the historical perspective, IMO
","This tells the story of potential African slaves, the cargo on 'Amistad,' a Spanish sailing ship, who revolted (1839) and ended up in American jails and courts. -- Will they be hung for killing their captors? -- Or 'property' that will be returned to their purchasers? The film traces their journey from Africa through various US courts and their outcomes that often intermixed with the looming domestic political issue, a sleeping gorilla: that of 1840s pre-Civil War slavery in the U.S. south.The scenes in Africa and shipboard of the treatment of captured slaves have some unsettling ('R' rated) cruelty. But 'Amistad' is largely a drama of historical courtroom events (IMO, grossly accurate with exceptions that will be minor to many, major to a few).Hopkins (as a lawyer, the former president, John Quincy Adams) got a deserved Oscar nomination for his supporting role. Freeman plays quite well a wholly invented, minor role (as a former slave & successful businessman in the 1840s North--who you trying to kid, Spielberg?!?!). McConaughey does a great job as the initial lawyer representing the Africans. Hounsu, as the captive African chief, is also very good.This film provides a fascinating U.S. history lesson brought very much alive. Wikipedia has several articles pertinent to this: see both 'Amistad' (for the film, related places, writings, actual events, etc.) and also 'Tecora' (the Portuguese slave ship which took the Africans to Cuba); these help those who are interested to distinguish much of who, where & when this film captures or distorts historical truths. See also the 'Did You Know?' section on IMDb's 'Amistad' main page; this covers some points not in the Wikipedia articles.I was extremely glad I saw this film for the knowledge gained despite its sometimes dramatized departures from utter truths.",8,0,2,21 July 2012
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Enjoyable to fans of Lewis, Chronicles, and fairy tales
","This is not a movie I especially wanted to see but my companion did because she'd read it while being a teacher's aide.It's a 'pretty' movie -- pretty scenes fitting for a fairy tale. The children are all quite handsome, too (and excellent actors).I've not read any of the Chronicles. (Years ago, I'd read Lewis's Screwtape, Mere Xianity, Great Divorce, etc.) From reviews, I understood that Lewis intended the Chronicles to introduce children to some important concepts in Christianity -- Aslan stands for Jesus and His sacrifice (e.g., note the similarity of his death to that of Jesus, complete with the 2 mourning women); the witch stands for the devil, evil and the hurtful pride, selfishness, ambition, pettiness, etc., that turns people from the divine. The seduction of Edmond by the witch (appealing to his desire for power over his older sibs) very strongly reminded me of the tactics recommended to Screwtape by Wormwood in Lewis's 'The Screwtape Letters.' I found the battle scene overly long and very reminiscent of the final movie in the Lord of the Rings series complete with orcs. (I think it's a little too much for young children.) All the special effects were extremely well done -- e.g., Aslan speaking, expressions and postures expressing different moods, etc.Most fans of Lewis, the Chronicles, and fairy tales will especially enjoy this movie.",8,0,0,23 February 2006
Coffee and Cigarettes," Interesting; different; somewhat worthwhile
","This collection of eleven pieces is related primarily in that cigarettes and coffee are involved in each more or less prominently. 
The pieces all have the quality of being improvisations (although certainly the one in which Cate Blanchett plays the 2 characters must've been more fully scripted).  The significance of the pieces, IMO, is in showing that within the smallest and most conventional of circumstances, sometimes profound truths, expositions of human traits, (or tantalizing mysteries) can be revealed or evoked.They strike me as a series of études or experiments by the director and actors in reaching for those effects.  Some, of course, succeed more than others and we viewers will not always agree on which ones are the winners.I found it very interesting to see how much can be accomplished with such minimums of plot or preceding build up.  I suspect the more you are a student of movies, especially their plots and narrative qualities (as well as acting to bring it to life), the more you'll find this of interest.",7,0,1,1 August 2004
Black Book," Unique, perceptive eye for various reactions in war
","The film credits say that the film was based on a 'true story.' But I'm sure that the plural -- 'stories' -- is more accurate. The coalescing, condensation of actual events onto a few central characters -- while the events are no doubt true -- is almost more than anyone could endure.The film operates at 2 levels.On the first, there's an action film as compelling as anything with Indiana Jones, which propels you through the 148 minutes as on a roller coaster. I had to ask my companions shortly after we saw it, 'did this have subtitles?' because the velocity was so high I wasn't sure.On the second level, there's a profound commentary on the human race.I'm sure Americans are not alone in tending to polarize views between the good guys and the bad guys; those who are good are ALL good, those who are bad are ALL bad.The film presents some as holding tightly to their principles and ideals, some as fudging just a little as needed to insure survival, some as looking to take personal advantage of situations. People come in all sorts and wartime conditions display that variety (and this film captures that).I don't doubt that Americans are very similar to the people portrayed in this film. But I do doubt that such a critically perceptive film could be made in the USA about the American people. Kudos to those Dutch who have accepted and applauded this film.I thought the casting and acting was superb. All were great but Carice van Houten was outstanding.(After having posted this, I read many responses in the Message Board. AFTER YOU SEE THE FILM, I recommend you read hendrik-rood's reply in the thread, 'muntzen, too nice?' http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0389557/board/thread/66978556 This gives a great amount of the factual material on which the movie was based. ETA: Sorry, this thread is no longer on the Message Board. Too bad. As I remember it, much of this film's events happened to a variety of Dutch people--which he named--but were condensed onto the main characters.)",10,8,11,10 June 2007
Hot Fuzz," A parody of movie/TV shows about cops & bad guys
","The 'Inspector Morse' or Helen Mirren's series on PBS is about as far as I go in this police genre but 'Hot Fuzz' is a good parody of all cop films, clashes between the cops and bad guys. Having seen few of them, I missed the many scene quotes but could readily believe there were hundreds. The film is like a Saturday Night Live or Monty Python view of the genre.As others have mentioned, the first third sets up the viewer for the following two-thirds.While there is considerable violence, it's so over the top it creates no flinching. Guns blaze, hundreds of rounds of ammo are fired, and no one drops.I enjoyed the subtle(?) twitting of a particular social group about their desire to have everything 'nice and in good taste' so it's a cardinal sin to depart from that. That segment of English society has no monopoly on such a view, of course, but here they represent that attitude in cultures other than just the UK.Good fun.",8,1,3,10 May 2007
Brokeback Mountain," Fascinating 'Forbidden/Unattainable Love' story
","I read the story shortly after seeing the movie. (It's in the Oct. 13, 1997, issue of 'The New Yorker' which most libraries will have; BTW, that same issue has a fascinating article on Truman Capote.) Reading the story (for me) added to my appreciation of the film. The film was remarkably faithful to the short story. I voted it an '8' shortly after seeing it but changed it to a '10' for its remarkable capturing of painful human dilemmas.My view of BBM is shaped by my 35 years as a psychotherapist working with many people, straight and gay (closeted and out), families, etc.Most people see BBM as a tragic love story in which Jack and Ennis could have lived happily ever after if only Ennis had been able to let himself do that.But my experience is that almost always, to be capable of loving -- of giving and accepting being loved -- a person needs to experience lots of that as a child with one, and usually both parents (or parent surrogates). Ennis didn't have that and if Jack got even a little of it, it sure wasn't from both parents. So both of them grew up yearning for something either they never received or got far too little of. And when that happens, the less common result is to to seal off emotions (as Ennis usually did to blunt the pain) or, far more frequently, to be like the sad clown who keeps reaching to the floor to grab something he wants very much but whose foot always kicks it away just before it's grasped. IMO, Ennis could function with his wife, Alma, mainly when they played out conventional 1920s-50s gender stereotypes or roles. (Men on top, women submit, mothers (not fathers) feed their children, etc.)But love with Jack? -- Ennis could express lust and some resemblance of love only as long as the barriers remained (barriers of distance and time in between his meetings with Jack). And he could become most fully aware of his yearning for Jack only after Jack's death -- death, the ultimate, permanent barrier. So I saw it as a story about a common human tragedy that many people experience -- males and females, regardless of sexual orientation. Because when, as a child, we don't get something extremely important to us (e.g., love,affection, feeling of self-worth, etc.), while we often spend the rest of our lives pursuing it, we also find myriad ways of defeating ourselves -- e.g., by choosing the wrong partners, by ill-chosen reactions or decisions to drive away any partner who could be right, etc, etc., etc..IF Ennis HAD been able to let himself go live with Jack, their relation (IMO) could not have lasted, in part because neither would any longer have the stereotypical gender roles to guide them, in part because of Ennis's inability to talk things out, his blocking of empathy, but most of all because of the 'danger' both would feel in ever actually getting a forbidden goal. Their relationship could last as long as it did because it was a forbidden fruit that the two could only briefly taste between long periods of separation.Acting in BBM was absolutely superb as was the casting. Films usually delineate one character very well, maybe another fairly well, and all others only briefly. While that was true here, the Ennis character was exceptionally well brought to full life; Jack's only slightly less so. And the marvelous quality of this movie is the extent to which ALL of the other characters -- Ennis's wife, Alma, and oldest daughter; Jack's wife, Lureen, and her father; Jack's parents -- all contributed to an integrated, totally believable, totally human, totally realistic picture. And I've thought that ALWAYS a film will be less detailed than the story from which it's adapted. This is an EXCEEDINGLY RARE exception; it is far more detailed, more nuanced than the short story on which it's based while remaining absolutely true to it. Many kudos to the director, screen writers, and their human behavior consultants. The photography was also superb -- some shots looked as if they could be framed and hung in art museums.",10,13,20,25 January 2006
My Neighbor Totoro," Delightful 'slice of life' film
","Miyazaki's animé films differ considerably from the usual (Disney) animated films both in art form and narrative: -- The art work in many animated films is similar to that in Mickey Mouse cartoons: outlines or features that are colored/shaded in; some movements are exaggerated for dramatic effect; almost all stories have adversaries or problems that the hero/heroine defeats near the conclusion. -- In Miyazaki's animé films, the backgrounds (landscapes, skies, interiors of homes, etc.)are beautifully, naturally rendered: e.g., weathered planks of wood have the texture and color of the real thing; clouds look very realistic. But while the actions, reactions, emotions and movements of people are very realistic, the visual, artistic rendering of people (& animals & fantasy creatures) is more cartoonish; the animals and fantasy creatures frequently move in ways not possible for people. But, while these human figures are cartoon-like, their reactions, emotions, motives, etc., are VERY realistic. Many of Miyazaki's films have a 'slice of life' quality--there's no big conflict and climax of resolution; his films show life.Also, Miyazaki's films often mix objects (cars, phones, radios) from different time frames and some of that occurs here with telephones from the '30s, and a radio and 3 wheeled motorcycle van from the '40s. This video clip shows some of this quality: http://w w w.imdb.com/video/screenplay/vi477103897/ (copy link & remove spaces between w w w to activate.)In 'My Neighbor Totoro,' the two principle characters are sisters: Mei, 4 years old, who is sometimes too spunky and daring and her older sister, Satseki, about 8-10 years old, who cares for Mei when she's home from school. The movie opens with the 2 girls and their father moving to a home in the country which will permit them to be closer to the girls' mother who is recuperating in a hospital.The old house they move into is said to be haunted (the sisters DO see some soot sprites). In a nearby forest, they find a large, somewhat pear-shaped, friendly magical forest creature they name Totoro and two much smaller similar creatures.The movie deals with their adventures in their new home, with Satseki's school, with adventures while waiting for their mother to recover, etc.Lovely to watch. The capturing of the girls' interactions between themselves and with others is remarkably well observed and captured.",10,2,4,11 January 2011
Midnight in Paris," Delightful travel through time with a message
","It's hard to write a review of this without giving away some secrets.Gil (Owen Wilson) is a successful, young Hollywood screen writer but he yearns to be a respected author and is writing (& rewriting) a novel. He's engaged to Inez (McAdams), the daughter of wealthy California parents who bring Inez and Gil along on their business trip to Paris. Gil is fascinated to see the bistros frequented by Hemingway, the Fitzgeralds, Picasso, etc., while Inez is more interested in shopping for items for the home they'll soon make back in California. She wants Gil to just stick with his so-far successful and lucrative career rather than aspire to greater literary worth; Gil seriously proposes they live in Paris awhile (hoping its ambiance will improve his writing?) but Inez will visit only as a tourist.Late one night, after several drinks, they go their separate ways for the evening--Inez off with mutual friends, Gil walking back to their hotel. As the clock strikes 12, a '20s Peugot taxicab careens to a stop beside Gil; it contains Scott & Zelda Fitzgerald and they invite Gil to hop in and party with them and their friends. Gil does so, and on following midnights he continues to meet and socialize with them and their friends: the writers, artists, and famous denizens of that 1920s/30s Paris 'golden age' era: Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates) & Toklas, Hemingway, Picasso, 'Tom' (T.S.) Eliot, Josephine Baker, Luis Bunuel, Cole Porter, Dali, etc., all of whom vanish each dawn.IMO, Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams were each excellent in their roles discovering their different values.Hearing earlier reviews of this film, I was a little leery of seeing it fearing I'd miss too much since I wasn't deeply familiar with the writings of Hemingway, Fitzgerald, etc. Not a problem; a rough understanding of those two adds a lot of enjoyment. Knowing something of famous artists & cultural figures of that period adds more.I'm sure Woody enjoyed tinkering with time travel a great deal. He did NOT have Eliot say he'd been 'walking on a beach with his trousers rolled' (famous lines from Eliot's 'The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock') but he sprinkled similar, more clever things, such as having Gil suggest to Luis Bunuel, the film director, the unique plot of one of Bunuel's later, famous movies ('Exterminating Angel').Gil's not the only time traveler--a friend in that '20s era to whom Gil's become quite attracted prefers the earlier 'La Belle Epoch' and, in the visit to that period he makes with her, he (& we) get a glimpse of Toulouse-Lautrec, Degas, Gauguin, and Paris night life that delivers the film's message to both Gil and us.This may be a 6/10 for some who like Woody Allen movies but are unacquainted with the prominent cultural icons of that period. But for most of those somewhat familiar with them, it'll be much higher.Not a GREAT film but a VERY delightful, tasty confection.",9,4,9,25 June 2011
Hotel Rwanda," WOW!! A Must-See docudrama
","This film is almost beyond words.It's obviously a docudrama of the genocide in Rwanda -- and the response (and lack of response) of the rest of the world to the 'people who are not me.' (It's obviously also a wakeup call to be aware of other parallel situations.) This film garnered many awards from many groups, including top picture at the Toronto Film Festival. (That's made me highly value the TFF over the Academy Awards.) If you'll GOOGLE the name of the central character, 'Paul R____'(?), you'll find many stories that expand and elaborate on the film and ALL of which confirm ALL the premises of the film. I found http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/574/574554p1.html to be one of the best although all carried the same central message -- adherence to the central truth of the story.This film does two things.It clearly faces us with the worldwide responsibility we all face with the consequences of ignoring 'man's inhumanity to man' wherever and to whomever it occurs. '.... Therefore, never send to ask for whom the bell doth toll; it tolls for thee.'It also confronts each of us with what -- as individuals -- we could do, would do, when faced with moral situations.Excellent film. IMPORTANT film. Very well done. Superb acting. Faithful story telling.11 of 10.",Null,4,6,2 March 2005
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Deserves its reputation as a classic
","After the special posse of experts is finally formed and is pursuing them too well, Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman) and the Sundance Kid (Robert Redford) move their bank robbing business to South America accompanied by the Kid's girlfriend, Etta (Katharine Ross).This was the breakout role for Robert Redford's movie career (Redford named the 'Sundance Institute' and the annual 'Sundance Film Festival' that he founded in honor of this effect). While some respected critics, e.g., Roger Ebert & many others (see the 50% ratings of 'rotten' by 'top critics' reviews of this film on 'Rotten Tomatoes') regard this movie as overdone or only 'so-so,' or 'not western enough,' most viewers find it still greatly entertaining and interesting. I agree with the majority: it remains remarkably fresh and fun. There's so much clever banter throughout between the two stars, it borders on comedy (so much we become oblivious to the scores of people we see killed during the story's unfolding). Its Oscar winning screenplay very much draws on actual people and events (but please see Wikipedia's article on Butch Cassidy for how closely the movie mirrors reality). The actual lives and activities of Butch & the Sundance Kid are almost over the top--and so is this movie, too.",9,5,6,22 August 2012
Crash," Excellent, powerful, thought provoking, unique
","This movie is unlike any other movie I've seen and probably that'll be true for most viewers.There are approximately 9 important couple relationships (husband-wife, child-parent, working partners, etc.) somewhat explored as they interact with each other as well as many others. Our appreciation of these couple relationships is deepened by seeing the variety of forms they can take. E.g., a child protecting a parent (or vice-versa) is presented in several iterations and the contrasts between them deepens the impact of each (probably implicitly, without even our awareness that the film is doing that). They come from a variety of racial and ethnic backgrounds -- black, oriental, Latino, white, Middle Eastern, etc.The lives of these various people collide in accidental but natural and seemingly inevitable ways. In each collision people make quick judgments about each other often based on racial or ethnic stereotypes, especially when people are fearful or hurt. It's part of the power of this film that as viewers we find ourselves doing the same thing, too. Another power is that it demonstrates people are far more complex than putting a person in the box of a stereotype allows.Although all the accidental encounters between these couples COULD seem contrived, everything flows realistically, naturally -- including all the dialog. The casting is great; the acting superb. The snippets presented of the lives of these 17 or so people are interwoven to form an overarching, coherent, powerful narrative.This is not a movie that will change many lives, especially among those who treasure holding their ethnic biases. It will appeal most to those who grieve that we all so easily form and hold such stereotypes.Rated 'R' for some natural, adult emotional language and a sexual scene. AFTER you view the movie, your appreciation will be furthered by visiting the IMDb message board and reading the discussion on this film there.",9,1,8,1 June 2005
Pan's Labyrinth," Beautifully told, half fairy tale, half tragic reality
","The fairy tale aspects of 'Pan's Labyrinth' resemble somewhat Lewis's 'The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe' in that there is a fantasy world one steps into and out of from a 'real' world. But the film of '...the Wardrobe's' book was not the work of CS Lewis but of a translator (into film). IMO 'Pan's Labyrinth' has FAR more power and I suspect much of that comes because it is the director's (del Toro) fairy tale and his conception and realization was always in the grammar and syntax of film. Probably, for that reason, it is an EXTREMELY powerful, unforgettable presentation. Some will despise it while many others will value it, often for similar reasons: there is not a single message or a single point of view. The film can be viewed from almost equally valid contrasting positions -- one, that the fairy tale aspects are a young girl's fantasy life boat she creates to escape a harsh, uncomfortable world. The other is that her fantasy world DOES have a reality and life of its own. There is ample evidence distributed throughout for both points of view.HELPFUL HISTORICAL POINTS: The time is 1944, shortly after the end (1939) of the last Spanish Civil War which was won by the fascist dictator, Gen. Francisco Franco, head of the Spanish army in Spanish Morocco. His fight and rise to power was supported by many factions: the Catholic church, many wealthy Spaniards, and other factions. Franco's bloc was opposed by the existing government (a republic) and a coalition of other factions with opposing agendas (such as decreasing the strong influences of the Catholic Church and the wealthy upper class, etc.). Several autocratic regimes gave Franco support: Hitler and Mussolini sent tanks, dive bombers, and troops, flouting League of Nations efforts to keep others from intervening. Spain became Hitler's laboratory for his later Wermacht tactics. Socialists, communists, and anti-fascists in many countries provided volunteer soldiers to help the republic; the Abraham Lincoln brigade was composed of Americans who volunteered to fight fascism.Franco's forces made deliberate efforts to crush equally all opposition and non-supporters by brutality, coercion, atrocities. The actions in this film deal with residual rebel forces unwilling to concede defeat.I have no idea how representative Capitan Vidal's actions and attitudes would be for Spain in 1944, five years after the Civil war's end but they are symbolic of the approach used by Franco forces during the war (and possibly also by many of those who opposed him, maybe in retaliation? or maybe not?). The photography, music, visualizations, directing, casting and acting are superb. It's said at Cannes the film received a 22 minute ovation; IMO every second was deserved.There are some scenes of graphic torture that I could not bear to see and had to position my hands in front of my eyes so I could still read the subtitles while blocking the rest of the screen.THIS IS NOT A FILM FOR CHILDREN. It is both a history lesson and a fairy tale for adults.The preteen girl in the part of Ofelia is outstanding and carries a film that needs no carrying. The other main characters were also excellent -- Capitan Vidal, Carmen (his new wife), Mercedes (house manager & rebel), the doctor, and the Faun/Pale Man.IF you can appreciate ambiguity in the dividing line between fantasy and reality -- and competing interpretations, IF you can tolerate holding up your hands to block acts of cruelty from your eyes, SEE IT -- it's destined to be an iconic classic. BUT IF that sort of thing isn't your cup of tea, save your time and money, see something else -- and don't diss this for being something it isn't.FWIW/FYI: at this time, with 19,000+ votes, over 85% rated 'PL' as a 10, 9, or 8; fewer than 5% rated it 5 or lower.",10,8,15,6 February 2007
Taxi Driver," Great character development film
","Starring Robert DeNiro, Jodie Foster, Cybill Shepherd, Harvey Keitel. We gradually realize a Vietnam war veteran (Travis/DeNiro) is becoming increasingly mentally unstable (& with what now might be called PTSD?). Travis is a night-time taxi driver in New York City. The flagrant prostitution and other decadence he sees around him feeds his urge to violently lash out & he attempts to rescue a young teenage prostitute (Iris/Foster) in his reactive process. In addition to being in IMDb's top 250, it's also a Roger Ebert 'Great Movie.' He said, '(it's)....one of the best and most powerful of all films....(and it) does not grow dated or over-familiar'IMO, all its psychological dynamics are absolutely true to life. The ending has two possible interpretations--one literal, the other's just the last fancy of the injured or dying central character. Scorsese intended the literal view but probably more viewers (as I do) favor the second. Your choice.There's much of interest we never see--e.g., why Travis developed as he did--but that only increases our fascination. Was he also only a tad mentally unstable as a teenager but his combat experience/PTSD exacerbated this? Or did he seem completely normal and this is the onset of a schizophrenic reaction which typically emerges in this age range? What were his parents and upbringing and teenage socializing like? Etc., etc. The narrative we follow comfortably fits a number of very plausible preceding possibilities.Most people can read in advance Roger Ebert's reviews of this film and not ruin their enjoyment at all (and may even add to it as it did for me; (of his 3 reviews, I most like the last one he did for his 'Great Movies').",10,0,0,26 June 2012
Lost in Translation," A very satisfying slice of life
","This movie appeals on several levels.  It gives a vicarious travelogue of Tokyo, Japan, and Japanese culture.  It captures that sense of careening one can feel in a foreign culture, just barely in touch with a few who barely understand one's language. And the narrative tells the story of a relationship across generations, often with small humorous and poignant touches.Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) is a recent Yale graduate who's been married two years to a successful fashion photographer who's involved in his own career and less than appreciative of her erudition and knowledge.  She's still unemployed, tagging along on this trip, having not yet 'found herself,' and not yet sure of what she can do, or if or how she can validate herself.    Bob (Bill Murray) is an aging movie star cashing in on his celebrity by doing some Japanese whiskey commercials.  Bob faces parallel problems with his own personal life -- his wife of twenty-five years and their children are involved with each other but they have little emotional room for him.So for each, their personal lives -- which one always hopes will be a haven from other stresses -- is the source of major stresses.  And they're in the same Tokyo hotel.  With much spare time on their hands.They accidentally find each other and there's a gradual unfolding, a discovery, so the other becomes a source of emotional comfort, of understanding, and closeness despite their generational age differences. 
How much will their closeness develop?  How far will it go? That's what the movie is about.Murray and Johansson give absolutely charming, superb performances.",9,0,0,19 October 2003
The Grapes of Wrath," Excellent view of hard times; book/movie very influential in effects
","The 'Grapes of Wrath' film is a somewhat simplified version of Steinbeck's Pulitzer Prize winning book about an Oklahoma tenant farmer family in the Dust Bowl days. After being evicted from the land they'd farmed for generations, they join many other Okie families migrating to California seeking opportunities to work. In California the Okies were often taken advantage of by affluent land owners who promised fair wages but then paid half what they promised. Those migrants who resisted exploitation were sometimes viewed (and treated) as 'reds'; local police (or private security agents) were too often used to intimidate or quell resistance. Steinbeck's criticism of such exploitation of workers led to banning the book in some places although it became quite popular through most of the US and led to reforms. Henry Fonda's role as Tom Joad earned his stardom; Jane Darwell (as Ma Joad) won a deserved Oscar for best supporting actress as did John Ford for directing.Steinbeck was very critical of an economic system that allowed such mistreatment of sharecroppers and tenant farmers by wealthy land owners, bankers, etc., (supported by local officials wherever the owners/bankers resided). But while the movie piles worst case on worst case, IMO it's a fair view of how bad things sometimes got in the Great Depression era (1929-40). I spent 2 summers (1949, 1950) in the Bootheel of Missouri working in communities of former sharecroppers who'd been evicted from their jobs and their shack homes in circumstances parallel to that of the Okie families. These evictions happened when the owners of the cotton plantations, after receiving federal agricultural subsidies for NOT growing cotton, decided to keep all the money for themselves by evicting their farm families (January, 1939), making thousands homeless.The tenant farmer/sharecropper system was based on the land owners providing substandard housing to farm families plus advancing them credit (in their company stores) for food, clothing, and seed. In return the farm families planted, tilled, and picked the cotton. But their share of return from the cotton harvest was never sufficient to get out of debt to the store. The system made the farm families, in essence, indentured servants. Until they were kicked out.While the motivations (land owners' greed, farm families' struggles to survive in extreme circumstances) and conflicts were very similar to what the Okies experienced, the resolution of this Bootheel crisis became far more uplifting and inspiring than the struggles without victors presented in the 'Grapes of Wrath.' But almost certainly, the popularity of this book and movie helped lead to such a different outcome in the Bootheel only a few years later.This video describes the Bootheel situation: http://www1.teachertube.com/viewVideo.php?video_id=148227By Googling 'Sharecroppers Strike' and 'Cotton Patch Moses' you'll find a number of links that describe this Bootheel crisis, its conflicts, significant people, and outcomes.",10,1,1,7 April 2011
Corpse Bride," Another chapter/episode from Brother Burton's Fairy tales
","The decision to see this film was made by a friend; since it was in celebration of her birthday, she chose both our restaurant and movie.I think many(most?) of Burton's films can be considered as modern editions of fairy tales -- more technologically advanced versions of that which -- earlier -- the Brothers Grimm and many others have collected, revised and published. These all capture recognizable human urges and conflicts followed by choices which can lead one way or the other. When the tale is finished it becomes obvious which choices have taken the higher moral road and lead to ultimately more satisfying conclusions -- and often those which would not.While my own personal enjoyment of the film was probably around a 6 or 7 level, I rated this at an 8 because I think it will become a timeless classic. My companion would have rated it a 9 or 10 which made it quite satisfying to give as a birthday package. The music by Danny Elfman was great and deserves listening to many times. The claymation (or whatever) characters were 'over the top' caricatures but fit their roles. And the voices also matched the images quite well.IMO, this is a movie which many future generations of girls shortly before and after the cusp of puberty will replay many times and rate as a 10.",8,2,4,11 October 2005
Hugo," A film to be appreciated at multiple levels
","At face level, this is the thrilling narrative of (fictional) young, newly orphaned Hugo Cabret's attempt to complete the automaton/robot his recently deceased father was restoring and how that brings Hugo's life and that of (real person) Georges Méliès, the French giant of early movie-making, into more and more conflict--but eventually satisfying contact with each other.'Movies are like dreams that interweave fantasies with realities.'At a deeper level, 'Hugo' is Scorsese's homage and paeans to Méliès (actual episodes of many of Méliès' restored films are shown along with Scorsese's view of their making)--AND to ALL of movie-making. (Wikipedia's article on Georges Méliès helps define where Scorsese's version is surprisingly true to life and the few places it isn't; knowing this before seeing the film will increase its enjoyment for most viewers.) 'Movies are like dreams that interweave fantasies with realities.'The more familiarity viewers have with movies across the past 110+ years, the more they'll be gratified by Scorsese's references to their power plus reminiscences of bygone actors and scenes; he interweaves these allusions into the face value narrative. As examples-- --several bits hint at the boy-girl romances in many movies: will this station security master & flower girl get together? --In a similar vignette, the man who gets a dog to win a lady's interest is a lookalike double of S.Z.('Cuddles') Sakall who played many feel-good bit parts in '40s-'50s movies. --One scene has Hugo reprising silent film's Harold Lloyd ('Safety Last') hanging on the hand of a clock far above a city's street. --Etc., etc. 'Movies are like dreams that interweave fantasies with realities.'At its deeper levels, 'Hugo' is Scorsese's reminder of how important motion pictures have become in our lives.My rating, 8.5 of 10, may be revised up. :)",9,4,8,5 December 2011
American Beauty," An ALMOST great movie with a HUGE psychological flaw of reality
","All of the actors were great in their roles, the photography was beautiful, the pace just right. It's a good movie, it could have been far better. What bothered me was the characterization of Ricky Fits: his character and condition is the fulcrum around which everything else pivots. The actor did a marvelous job of portraying him as written. But to me (a clinical psychologist who's worked with adolescents, pot smokers, personality disorders, & schizophrenics, &c.), the character as written was just unbelievable. It was as if the writer(s) of the screen play went through the Diagnostic & Statistical Manual (the guide delineating symptom clusters and their official diagnoses), clipped out various symptoms from various diagnostic categories, and then pasted a collage together. The screen play characterization of Ricky puts together TOO many qualities that are typically incompatible. WHEN would you EVER see: continuing pot smoking from a young age with very successful adolescent entrepreneurship?; being a long established & practiced voyeur with a sudden capacity for somewhat warm relating?; severity of mental disorder/weirdness of perception with non-distorted perceptions of people and warm relating?; etc., etc. These writers either have to have been from another planet, smoking something illegal, or grossly unaware of mental illnesses.All other psychological dynamics portrayed were acceptable or believable enough (given that this is a movie and its story must be told within a certain frame and limits). But the character of Ricky Fits doesn't fit at all and giving him THAT last name ('Fits') doesn't make a sufficient bridge to reality: there are plenty of people with mental conditions--these deserve compassion, and they have an almost infinite variety of symptoms--but one like Ricky Fits NEVER, EVER exists.",6,0,0,3 October 1999
Being John Malkovich," REVISED REVIEW: A tour de force at 2 different levels
","This revises my previous review (14Nov99; #54 in the Comments Index)Few who see this movie can ever forget it, it's so original and creative, so well acted by a marvelous cast, and it's so funny.But this is a movie that needs to be seen a second time. In a first viewing, you're so busy hanging on to the roller coaster -- sort of like an action film (e.g., 'Romancing the Stone' minus the threats of danger to the characters) -- that you miss its deeper meaning. The two levels complement each other and make each the richer.At the first, most obvious level, this movie is for enjoying rather than stating philosophical issues. But along the way, while it provides few satisfactory answers, it does raise some intriguing questions: -- do we feel that we'd be more fulfilled as someone else, maybe someone famous, than as ourselves? -- what's the difference and what's appealing, between men and women's sexual experience?; would some women enjoy or envy men's faster arousal? -- would some men like their sexual experience feminized? -- what's it like to be a movie star? -- what's the source of those various conflicting urges we sometimes feel within us; could we say they come from the prompting of others voices/urges within us? But the most insistent question for most of the characters is how they can feel most self-actualized and they try to find an answer, not in being really themselves, but rather as puppeteers who pull someone else's strings.And at this first level, the characters' quests are just material for the fun plot. But don't look for thorough consistencies (e.g., Maxine's early frank sexual opportunism/ predation vs. her later stance; or aspects of the Craig & Lotte relationship in its earlier vs. later stages). And don't look for deep answers; just enjoy the most original, creative ride in movies for some years.The second, deeper level becomes clearer with a second viewing. In a sense it's very much an insiders' joke about directors, directing, and making movies. The beautiful, stunning scenes we see (early in the film) of lifeless, wooden puppets becoming so brimming with life, movement, and feeling, these state Spike Jonze's love and homage to his craft -- who wouldn't want to do this (these scenes ask) and make ideas and people come so alive? The film director is, metaphorically, a puppeteer who brings out of his/her marionette/actors new lives into new roles. It's the high from this experience that Lotte craves when she announces she wants a sex change operation; the sex of the first level is a metaphor for creativity at this second level. And, after making a film is over, after the high of making a vision come alive, it's like being dumped into the banal, the prosaic, the commonplace -- almost like being dropped beside the New Jersey Turnpike after having lived in the magic of Oz.But there are problems that any director/ puppeteer faces. Being creative and talented is no fun unless there's an appreciative audience; that makes fame and 'box office' valuable and worth pursuing because it gives more avenues and freedom. And while a puppeteer has the advantage of owning the 'actors' (the marionettes), any one director has many competitors wanting to occupy the chosen actors and invest them with his/her vision. And there's always another director/ puppeteer waiting to grab them.And the role of Maxine, I think I understand how this fits with the various people involved with making films -- but you'll want something to also figure out at this second level, don't you?I very much appreciate Robert Lesser's review (#51 in the Comments Index, q.v.); we share similar views and seeing his comments supported the thinking expressed here.",10,0,1,26 November 1999
The Intouchables," An inspirational, feel good 'fairy tale'
","Plot: A petty thief (Omar Sy) from 'the projects' in Paris goes through the motions of applying for a job caring for a VERY wealthy man who's paralyzed from the neck down (Francois Cluzet); this is to satisfy a requirement to keep getting his unemployment benefits that he really is looking for work. To his surprise (and initial disappointment), he gets the job and then -- things change for both him and his new employer.This is a marvelous, inspirational, feel good 'fairy tale' of how two men, each very handicapped in different ways, can transform each other. Based loosely on the lives of two actual people, the writers-directors have taken abundant liberties and created a comedy much appreciated in Europe and sure also to be around the globe. They condensed the action from 10 years to 1, changed many outcomes, invented many scenes. No matter--these actors, Omar Sy & Francois Cluzet, are SO great, they make us believe.My ratings: 9.5 of 10 stars as an entertaining movie (-- but 3.5 of 10 as quasi-realistic biographies).The principal characters of this movie have each written books which give FAR more realistic views than this movie of their lives and actions before and after meeting (they're still friends). If interested, read Phillipe Pozzo di Borgo's 'A Second Wind' (a very remarkable man & humanitarian) and Abdel Sellous's 'You Changed My Life'. Both are good reads in different ways. This movie impelled me to read these books to find out what actually happened and who these men really are.",8,0,0,29 September 2012
Legends of the Fall," Beautiful scenery/photography; arbitrary narrative
","Many consider this one of the best films they've ever seen while a much smaller 'many' consider it nearer the worst. Between those two, for my taste, that second, smaller group is more fitting. Although not a typical 'chick flick,' the demographics of IMDb voters show a typical 5% more positive rating by females (maybe a Brad Pitt effect?).To me, the narrative seems too arbitrary and capricious, mainly a vehicle to display Brad Pitt's ('Tristan's') charms: here although he's handsome, he's also impulsive, overly inclined to physical confrontation with men and beasts, non-conformist, very loyal to some Cree Indian traditions, often indifferent to what's legal--but these traits, while very strong, unaccountably and rarely trip him up: they emerge only when called on by the proper cues in the script.There are too many other incongruous details for me: suits, white shirts & ties worn by working ranchers at their evening dinners? A career military man ('Col. Ludlow'/Hopkins), after 30 years of promotions and service, rebels against his government because of its treatment (ca. 1880-1900) of American Indians, resigns, and adopts many of their values and customs? No helmets worn by Canadian troops in battle in the first World War? Tristan/Pitt on a 60-80 ft. sailing vessel about 1920 and, with no previous sailing experience and no visible financial support, skippering it with his crew while exploring the Pacific for many years? Warm emotional relations across the distance of a thousand miles and many decades between the Colonel and his sons with his wife (the sons' mother) after she deserted them? And other incongruities.Plusses mainly for its beautiful Canadian (pseudo-Montana) scenery.",4,7,13,18 September 2011
Before Sunset," Wow! Satisfying at so many levels
","I had not seen the prequel to this although my date had and she filled me in on many details. While the experience of this film would be enriched by having seen the preceding film first, it certainly stands satisfactorily alone.In many ways, this reminded me very much of one of my most favorite movies of all time, 'My Dinner with André,' in which just 2 characters talking comprised the whole movie. In that movie, the friends had been close, drifted apart, and then had a brief reunion at a dinner at which they caught up with what the other had been doing. The two principals, André Gregory and Wallace Shawn, played themselves and each represented one side of a dialectic, say the side of romanticism vs. a conventional reality. 'Before Sunset' is parallel in many ways.At one level we have a romantic story -- two people who'd briefly been lovers nine years before and lost touch meet again. They spend an afternoon together. Will they try to fulfill what they'd started? At another level, we have the charm of conversation and exploration, of reminiscing, of gradually feeling out and discovery of how much do I have in common with this person now? -- where has this person been? -- what are they capable of now? -- how much freedom of choice do I have, does this other person have -- to make decisions? Etc.While Celine and Jesse have a capacity for relating and talking, they also have somewhat opposite ways of viewing the world and relationships -- Celine is more cynical and reserved; Jesse is more open to settling for the 'not-perfect-but-good-enough.'There are possibly a few people who have not had the personal experiences that at least somewhat relate to the premise in this film -- a relationship in which one wonders, 'what would have happened if I'd pursued that relation?' but probably most people have. And the other dilemma, of meeting again that someone but by now being involved in relationships of responsibility -- my family, my children, my present life. What would it do to them if I were to pursue my own happiness at the expense of them? Can I do that? Can I value the chance of my own happiness above theirs? Etc.The film, fortunately, gives us no answers to these essential questions but it does pose them in a way that makes us consider them.Delpy and Hawke are given screenwriter credits and I feel sure that they must've contributed a great deal to the feeling of seamless, natural dialogue.GREAT movie. No movie satisfies everyone, of course, but at the time I wrote this, slightly over 50% of the voters gave it a 10/10. For those of us in that group, it's a great film.",10,135,153,14 August 2004
Man on the Moon," Good movie, excellent acting, with a small piece missing
","I'd heard a few interviews (e.g., Charlie Rose, NPR) with Taxi characters, Bob Zmuda, and others who'd known Andy.  Out of that, I had a suspicion that Andy was a somewhat unusual variant of a Multiple Personality Disorder in which neither he -- nor anyone else -- knew who he really was.  Everything I saw in the movie only strengthened this view.Jim Carrey did a great job of showing us, letting us experience in small part, the dilemma that Kauffman induced so many people to feel about him. If Carrey wins the Oscar for the role, no one who's seen the movie would be surprized.  For me, the supporting cast was also excellent.  The movie was long but compelling enough that I wasn't wondering when it would end.The only thing missing was more of a hint as to 'why?' -- why did Andy get that way?  But perhaps that's asking for far more than anyone knows and might have needed passing a considerable amount of speculation as bio-drama.
Those who enjoy good movies, who like(d) Andy Kauffman or Jim Carrey, who like good psychological portrayals -- all those will appreciate this movie.",Null,0,0,31 January 2000
City of God," A difficult to watch but very IMPORTANT movie to see
","We chose this movie for our monthly 'Great Films' series. It's accurately rated 'R' for violence, gutter language, drugs, & sex. (One viewer left 1/4 way through because of this.) Roger Ebert said, 'This is one of the best films you will EVER see.'For many people, this will not be a comfortable film to see. BUT, it IS a very worthwhile, important film because it gives a close view of the culture, the relationships, the expectations, of those living in poverty with the opportunities and outlooks of living in a culture dominated by drug dealing and violence.In this instance, the culture is in Brazil's so-called 'City of God'--a slum area set aside especially for the poorest people who were herded into an area just outside Rio de Janero.The narrative deals with many in this area who become involved with drug dealing, rival gang warfare, and short life expectancies--as well as one, 'Rocket', who transcends all odds to become a professional photographer. It's based on a true story. The film jumps back and forth occasionally to view episodes in the lives of various important characters in the film.Although many people will find parts uncomfortable to see, yet (IMO) it's VERY deserving of its #19 ranking on IMDb's all-time 250 best films ever--and of wide viewing.It goes a long way into showing the culture, the experiences, the motivations & expectations, the relationships in those communities in, e.g., Mexico, Colombia and everywhere that support the drug trade.",9,0,2,8 October 2010
The Lives of Others," A MUST SEE movie; an instant classic
","At the time of my writing this, there were slightly over 8,100 people voting and 87% of those gave it either a 10, 9, or 8.After seeing 'Pan's Labyrinth,' I thought it was robbed when the BFF Oscar was awarded to 'Lives of Others.' But I saw LoO last night and my judgment is that, while they're both great movies (although of different types), 'Lives of Others' was justly honored. IMO, many of the characters in LoO were more nuanced, developed and changed over time; -- there were believable maturational developments of several characters in it; -- it accurately captured psychological conflicts and reactions; -- it captured the historical quality of that era of the GDR more accurately than PL did for an era 6 years after the end of the Spanish Civil War; and -- it has many haunting parallels with today's issues (interrogations, rendition, domestic surveillance, the fact that absolute power corrupts absolutely, and the slighting of ideals for public good for private gain all the while maintaining the drumbeat of patriotism). The plot's twists and turns kept me in suspense but were always reasonable. (And I'm a retired therapist and displeased by unlikely reactions.)ALL the actors were excellent with the central character, Wieser, the brightest star among many.As a summary review in 'The New Yorker' said, you leave this movie feeling surprisingly uplifted.After seeing this movie, I suggest you visit the IMDb Message Board threads where you'll find many Q&As, discussions about this movie.",10,2,4,27 March 2007
Hero," Beautiful, moving, historical fairy tale
","This was known as 'Hero' in US distribution.The famous Chinese book on its history, 'Three Kingdoms,' begins with words something like this -- 'It was ever thus -- China long divided must unite; long united, must divide.'This movie captures one phase of the efforts of one king, the Emperor of Qin, to unify a land of six warring kingdoms.A notice at the end of the movie says that the events of history were treated 'compositionally' meaning, I suppose, that several emperors who were instrumental in unifying China and the events of those eras were distilled into one.The movie has a striking beauty and often a ballet-like motion all its own; some scenes are reminiscent of those in 'Crouching Tiger...' in which a wire and flying seemed to take place. But many others are quite original, such as those seemingly shot from under the surface of a lake while the swordsman run and duel across its surface. There are many striking scenes -- the machines of war unleashing arrows; or horsemen riding with their lances and banners; or scenes inside the palace, the palace grounds, and soldiers in formation there. 'Hero' unfolds a story from several points of view, somewhat as 'Rashomon' did. But 'Rashomon' did that to raise the profound question of what is the nature of reality -- is there a single one or really multiple realities, each one dependent on who experiences it?The alternative realities in 'Hero' are not used for that effect or question, but as different hypothetical story versions, one set told by a swordsman who wants to kill the emperor and uses his versions to get closer to his quarry; the other versions are by the canny emperor who proposes the same events can be cast in a different way.But 'Hero' does raise some important questions -- when one leader wants to transform a country and end recurring warfare, is it justifiable to kill many innocents to accomplish that end? Does that accomplish the greater good? And when one's native land and one's people are endangered or killed by that emperor's actions, how justified is it to oppose him and his goal? And who suffers most from revenge? -- the target or the person harboring it? Are words and ideas ultimately far more powerful (and preferable) than using deadly instruments (the pen vs. the sword)?Those questions have been faced in ancient times. They also can be quite pertinent today.",Null,1,1,26 September 2004
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Excellent; should be a must see for all, especially J-school students
","I was a 30 year old grad student when these particular events unfolded.The climate of that time is somewhat reminiscent of our present era with its marked polarizations of views.This film does not try to explicate an era during the 'cold war' when people were building bomb shelters, searching out caves, wondering how much we'd need to survive for the 3-12 months before hoping it was safe to emerge, if ever, and come out on the surface of our planet again. There was a pervasive climate of fear.Instead, it casts a narrow, incisive look at the process of reporting news and of the competing forces on that stage as Murrow, the dean of broadcasting journalism, took on Senator McCarthy, the dean of low blows and capitalizing on the 'Red scare,' as well as battling the corporate interests in maintaining good relations with any sponsors.Making allowance for the writers and directors selecting out from thousands of Murrow broadcasts only Murrow's best -- yet, of those best, Murrow's delivery and message sound fully the equal of the greatest expression of our highest ideals in the Declaration of Independence and Constitution.His words to the American people were like the voice of all wisdom, of Shakespeare, of God.My only disappointment was that a snippet of Murrow's broadcasts from London during WW II was not included.I thought the casting and performances were excellent -- absolute Oscar quality. (And the music, too.)",10,6,12,6 December 2005
Grave of the Fireflies," 'Elegaic and riveting' -- NYTimes review
","The plot is based on a popular Japanese semi-autobiographical novel of the same name which the author, Nosaka, wrote to atone for the death of his little sister in circumstances similar to that in the film. It shows the struggles to survive of an orphaned 12 year old boy, Setsuko, and his 4 year old sister, Seita, in the weeks just before and after WW-II when food was scarce.It's directed by Takahata of Studio Ghibli (after he'd previously collaborated on many films with his more famous colleague, Miyazaki); it's deserving of all the honors it's won--and more, and certainly of much wider viewing and recognition.It's currently ranked 123 of IMDb's all-time best 250 movies as well as on Roger Ebert's list of 'Great Films' and he extols it enthusiastically.One critic said it's '....about the capacity of the human spirit to love. Watching it feels like a privilege.' It has sad moments, true, but IMO more than that, it portrays realistic tenderness and caring between the two children and we become very close to them. As another critic has observed, this animÃ© film is far more emotionally realistic than if filmed with actors. The film's emotional tone and message glowed within me for hours after.This is NOT a film for most young children; it carries a Parental Guide Advisory.It's a truly great film, a real treat to have seen.",10,1,2,8 July 2011
Big Fish," Moderately interesting and entertaining
","The story deals with a father-son relationship.  In the son's early years -- say at bedtime -- the son was enthralled by his father's stories about his previous adventures. But as he hears these same stories repeated (eventually _ad nauseum_), he views them as 'shtick' -- his father's routine to be performed at any social gathering that permits it -- and he becomes resentful of his father's reliance on them.  His being forced into the posture of a passive, appreciative audience prevents him from ever really knowing his father or having an adult-adult relationship with him. The stories form an impenetrable facade and shield. In reaction, the son becomes estranged from his father until his mother calls him and says his father is dying.  The son returns home with his new wife, hoping to re-establish an honest, intimate relationship with his father before his father dies.  His wife is pregnant and he urgently wants to accomplish this -- to form a satisfying relationship -- before he himself becomes a father.The movie very satisfactorily develops that. What happens next is that son gradually finds some pieces of evidence that his father may have had some adventures that formed building blocks for his father's schtick. Burton and his movie dramatize the father's fanciful stories and that forms the backbone and length (205 minutes!) of the film.Somehow, by finding that the stories were not _entirely_ fanciful, that there may have been some reality building blocks in them, the son reconciles himself to his father and accepts him for what he is. And at the end, at the funeral, we see a visual evidence that his father's fanciful tales had some basis in reality.  What's given us are marvelous, fanciful representations of the tall tales. And the son's brief searches for realities behind the stories also are given fanciful, fairy tale twists.  What we are not given (at least not given to me) is a satisfying sense of what helps the son suddenly give up his desire for intimacy with his father and click into accepting his father's stories and his father.  IF we view the whole thing as it probably should be -- as a fairy tale composed of a collection of fairy tales -- then it makes a moderately entertaining evening.  The cast was great.  But it could have been more.",7,0,0,28 January 2004
Annie Hall," Unique, delightful, funny--with an underlying, sad truth
","This is an unusual but very entertaining film. It frequently flouts customary movie rules: for example, the characters often break 'the fourth wall' and confide directly to the camera (we, the audience) their thoughts or have subtitles on the screen telling us what they're really thinking. In one brief scene while standing in line waiting to get in to a movie, Woody gets in an argument with a man just behind him, a professor proclaiming his views; so Woody summons a world famous expert (Marshall MacLuhan, not a part of the narrative otherwise) to make a brief appearance in support of Woody's opposing views. Plus MANY other fun 'floutings.'I completed a 5+ year psychoanalysis (as did many of my colleagues in Topeka in that era--it helped our advancements as well as our psyches) and this film pokes gentle fun at analysis, analysts, and clichés of that therapeutic process. One of my colleagues who viewed it with us, a close friend and an analyst, rated it 8/10 while I give it a 10/10. All the non-shrink others viewing it averaged in the 7-8/10 range. (FWIW, in IMDb's demographic ratings (q.v.), males consistently rate it slightly higher than females, regardless of age.)Woody, in a brief prequel, speaks to us (as the comedian, Alvy Singer, his film character, but really consistent with and little different than almost every neurotic character Woody's played). In this, he repeats Groucho Marx's famous retort on being offered membership in the very exclusive Friars' Club: 'I refuse to belong to any club that would have a person like me as a member.'Similarly (in my therapy experience), people who've never experienced (or never experienced enough of) things vitally important to them--such as acceptance, loving and being loved in return--often continually seek it out but then, just when it's in reach or, somewhat soon after it's grasped, manage to push it away. It's as if, never having received it, it's okay and VERY important to PURSUE it but NOT okay to actually possess or maintain it. IMO, they're much like the circus clowns with the big shoes, repetitively trying to pick up some desired object from the floor, but who--just before grasping it--always kicks it farther away. (Or, sometimes, they CAN find and savor it but typically only in those relationships that remain illegal, clandestine, or forbidden. The marriage of Woody with Soon-Yi in 1997 is probably an excellent example of this on both sides.) That searching, pursuing, and typical disappointment is the underlying plot of 'Annie Hall' but with lots of jokes, laughs, and chuckles spread like oodles of whipped cream with sprinkles over this underlying sad truth.DELIGHTFUL!! Much fun -- MUCH truth.",10,0,0,7 September 2011
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Exhilarating; fun; puzzling; human
","Roger Ebert's review (excellent) calls this type of film 'Cinema Maze' -- something that needs to be figured out, solved, to find one's way out. Very apt.  While it's fun to see this movie once, it's even more fun and worthwhile to see it twice. On a second view, I was astounded to find that I'd completely blanked out several minutes near the end, maybe a result of diverting my focus to process what I'd been seeing?I was attracted to this film because Charlie Kauffman ('Being John Malkovitch,' 'Adaptation') wrote the screenplay.Kauffman has a gift for distorting reality somewhat like Escher, in art, or constructing a Möbius strip (the 3D geometric figure that has only one surface and one edge) in such a way that he turns inside out our usual sense of logic and the way things are.  But in doing so in this film, Kauffman reveals more deeply how they really are. In 'Eternal Sunshine,' he does it with human memory and pain, attraction, commitment and disappointment, and love.  (There are even a few side trips that illumine ethical snares in helper-helpee relations -- something those who stay on the ethical side in doctor-patient type relationships will enjoy.)Don't see it if you do NOT like being challenged by a film. But don't miss it if you enjoy being encouraged to think -- not only on how the film's pieces fit together but about relationships. In that way, it's a bit like 'Swimming Pool' but more upbeat and poignant.Some say this is Carey's best work and perhaps it is. But Winslet's role is probably the film's axle -- and the support by Wilkerson plus the others in lesser roles is superb.The title comes from line 209 of the poem 'Eloisa to Abelard.'Take one dose, then repeat 3 days to one week later, and enjoy!",10,0,1,4 May 2004
Avatar," Great computer effects; weaker story
","The following review contains a spoiler IMO,the CGI (computer generated imagery) was stunning and worth the price of admission. I loved the animals, and especially the plants and plant-like creatures floating through the air like luminescent small jelly-fish/dandelion seeds--as well as many other plants. The floating mountains, the vegetation, the flying creatures were excellent. The fear of heights it induced in viewers was breathtaking. I got tired of wearing the 3D glasses and having my face slapped so hard, so continually with 3D effects. For ME, except for the novelty of seeing some of it that way, it would've been fine--even better--to see it in 2D.The story line was both kind of interesting but by far it's weakest part; it felt like it primarily served as an excuse to serve up all the special effects.For the story line, Cameron used elements from many historical explorations of the more technologically advanced 'civilized world' taking, raping, the resources of aboriginal tribes--oft repeated, whether with the Incas, Aztecs, Caribbean islanders, American Indians, African cultures (e.g., the Congo), Pacific Islanders, wherever. His avatar characters even resembled (IMO) some facial features of North American Indians.A key difference or variation: this time the aboriginals successfully resisted being exploited and drove the intruders out--albeit under the leadership of a defecting intruder and the help of a few of his like-minded compatriots.Also, in quite significant ways, I thought Avatar echoed a great many of the themes, conflicts and outcomes in Miyazaki's animé film 'Princess Mononoke'--except Cameron does with CGI what Miyazaki did with hand drawn art. (If you've never seen 'PM' I highly recommend it; it's not my favorite Miyazaki but very worthwhile and a deserved favorite of many.) Since avatar's are so very common in computer games, I do wonder if Cameron might be playing on computer gamers' fantasy desires to make the transition to their avatar and leave their worldly bodies and abilities behind? (I notice on IMDb's discussion forum, some people say they've seen the 3D version 12-16X!!!! -- I suspect these must all be computer gamers.) I also suspect that avid computer gamers will be almost universally those most delighted with 'Avatar' while we others will be less so.There were some plot holes.The most bothersome to me was that whenever the hero, Jake, was back in HQ sleeping, eating, reporting, etc., his avatar body was unresponsive--functionally dead. Over 3 months? Every day for 90 days? Without causing suspicion or alarm to the native Na'vi people??? And it was announced that all the life forms on the planet--Na'vi, animals, plants--were in communion with each other in a symbiotic relationship but little was made of this. The ultimate battle scene went on much longer (was it 2 hours? or 20 minutes? whatever) than I thought it deserved. How many war machines, how many explosions, collisions, how many Plexiglas windows and bodies do I need to see pierced, blown to smithereens, when I already have no doubt of who's going to win? Or was this some embedded promotional advertising for the coming release of 'Avatar: the Computer Game' ??Interesting CGI & special effects = 10 stars Story line, narrative, used as the vehicle to display said special effects = 5 stars",7,1,2,22 February 2010
Toy Story 2," A film for kids that has candy for adults.
","I saw this with a 4 year old and her mother.  The movie has some scenes that are understandably scary for that age (fights between Darth Vader & Buzz LightYear that echo the Star War's scene betweeb DV & Obi Wan Kenobi).  Kids who like lots of action, bangs, and surprises will like it.  The age range roughly 6 to 10 years is probably most suitable in general.  The movie has many references to things only adults would catch so it makes a successful attempt to keep big people entertained.  It's OK but personally, I preferred 'Elmo in Grouchland' for plot and message.",Null,0,0,21 January 2000
The Artist," Excellent, fun to see movie
","Plot: The 1920s Hollywood superstar of silent films, the French speaking George Valentin (Jean Dujardin as a Douglas Fairbanks/Rudolph Valentino figure) is bypassed when the 'talkies' take over movies (after 1928). Then the 1929 stock market crash leaves him broke. Before his fall, he'd befriended the ingénue Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo) who goes on to become a movie star; she rescues George, his career, his dog, & his chauffeur (+ more).WOW!!! What a charming, delightful movie and at so many different levels! 'Uggie' (a Jack Russell terrier, also in 'Water for Elephants') has a supporting star role (and fomented an internet campaign to make dogs Oscar eligible!). Perfect casting of Dujardin, Bejo, Uggie, John Goodman; great dance numbers. 10 Oscar nominations, if this film wins 6+, few critics will be surprised. Destined to be a classic and comfortably within IMDb's list of the 250 all-time best ever movies.{Rated PG-13: Apparently because of one brief gesture (flipping a middle finger) and a scene in which a gun is displayed threateningly.}",10,3,6,7 January 2012
La La Land," A new form of musical movie
","I was eager to see this movie after hearing it had won so many Oscars but it left my local movie house too soon and all 18 of my public library's DVD copies of the film were checked out with a waiting list over a month long. So I rented a copy and am quite glad I did.Near the very beginning, this movie has a scene that tells you that expected reality will be occasionally dismissed in favor of music and dance: As hundreds of cars become temporarily halted on one of LA's multi-lane trafficways (those of us who've driven there know that's realistic), one person gets out and starts dancing and soon that serves as the catalyst to prompt 100s of others to do the same thing (pure fantasy).The primary characters are Mia (Emma Stone) and Seb (Ryan Gosling). Emma is an aspiring actress/playwright who temporarily works as a barrista in a coffee shop until she can get her break. Seb is a jazz pianist in a club where he's forced to play the kind of music he doesn't like so he aspires to own his own club in which he can feature the kind of music he favors. The two meet, develop into a romantic couple, consoling and finding various ways to support and/or rescue each other when needed. They each do finally get their 'Big Break' -- Emma as the lead in a movie that'll be filmed in Paris and Seb in a traveling band that pays him enough to accrue enough money to start his own club in LA.'LaLa Land' ('La' is a 'play' on 'L.A.' for Los Angeles) has lots of spots where the viewer must infer what is happening or has happened because we don't see it unfold or be dramatically portrayed in the film. E.g., when Mia is shown back in LA from Paris with a child and a husband who's not Seb, that suddenly strikes us viewers that the Mia-Seb relationship won't be one in which 'they'll live happily together ever after.' With her husband, Mia & Seb do later meet (in Seb's new, apparently successful club), comfortably & briefly acknowledging each other, but continuing on in their separate ways no doubt privately grateful for the role the other did play in bringing each to their new levels. But that's also quite realistic, isn't it? -- I think many of us are grateful for how our loves in the past have helped us to go on to new levels. So perhaps this 'LaLa Land' will prompt other film makers to experiment with finding new ways of combining music & dance with human hopes and more realistic outcomes.",10,2,5,3 September 2017
The Red Violin," Warning: contains references to the surprises
","A sentimental fantasy; not great, but worth seeing.The wife of a Renaissance Italian violin maker is pregnant with her first child; her husband has been working to build _the_ greatest violin that his son, when born, can learn to play.  His wife, shortly before birth, has a servant tell her fortune with Tarot cards; the prediction proves accurate but not in the way one expects.  The woman and her newborn both die in childbirth.  The movie traces the later journeys of this violin as it passes from musician to musician.  Joshua Bell, a young 20ish concert violinist noted for his flair with romantic music, plays on the sound track.  The movie doesn't have so much 'serious' music that those who don't usually listen to it will be turned off; the reverse could be more often true -- that some of those with an especial love of the violin and its serious repertoire may feel a little short-changed. I've read a few other user comments and agree with those who remark that the transitions from one story episode to the next are somewhat rough.  And agree that the episode with Kaspar Weiss is the most effective.  The episode with an English violinist and his love, a female author, was almost worthy of a pulp fiction romance novel except it lacked enough credulity of gender roles for those times (or combining sexual and musical activities?).  Oh, and the red varnish of the 'Red Violin' -- terribly sentimental, romantic, and so fantastic as to be completely unrealistic. (Don't they feed these scripts through any technical editors?  Or didn't it matter?) 
A college freshman friend of mine who's a music major said she saw this 7 times and urged me to see it.  Not bad, entertaining,  but we have different tastes. In the demographics women in the 18-44 age ranges rate it about one whole point higher than men.  Does that make this a 'chick' movie?",Null,0,0,6 February 2000
Les Misérables," Very worthwhile but not that enjoyable to me
","Some factions consider this an 'opera,' some consider it 'musical theater.' (IMO, it resembles opera FAR more than 'Sound of Music,' 'Oklahoma,' etc., does.) Valjean (Hugh Jackman) was sentenced to years of hard labor after stealing bread to feed his starving niece. After being released, because he broke parole he was then hunted endlessly, vindictively, by Javert (Russell Crowe) attempting to return him to prison. Valjean cares for, brings up as her only parent, an orphan girl and in that process achieves his own redemption. Set in 1810-1860 era France, it deals with class & gender inequities, retaliative laws & punishments, etc., then prevalent in France as well as much of Western civilization (& with vestiges today).Stunning settings, excellent acting, but it was too much like some less preferred opera for me. (While I do like 'Faust,' 'Carmen,' 'Amahl & the Night Visitors,' 'Madama Butterfly,' etc.) I didn't leave humming any tunes from this movie. But it is worthwhile for its history, current importance & relevance, etc.",6,1,2,30 January 2013
Mystic River," Good movie, great subject, but grasped far less than it reached for
","I agree with the user review by rghawkins on Oct. 25th, '03. 
This would have been a more powerful movie if the last 10 minutes had been clipped off.  In its present form, it tries spelling out too much.I'd read some critics' reviews calling this worthy of Oscars.  And it WAS good.  I'm a retired psychologist and family therapist so I've seen many times how abuse seriously effects even those who were not themselves directly abused, and how its consequences travel on for generations. So I can't think of a more deserving subject.  I think too often in screen plays and in stories, the motivations and decisions caused by ancient and previous plots are ignored.  As if each life starts out with a blank slate, jostles with some stresses, and writes up the results.  That's simplistic.  Always our slates have been much written on and previous words always intrude, unconsciously forcing us to change whatever we're writing to make their inclusion fit and seem logical.  I was hoping to see more of that richness conveyed in something other than just violating others.  Perhaps it was but in more simplistic cause and effect actions than I'd like. A usual hallmark of good and great movies for me is the extent to which scenes replay themselves, capturing the essence of an issue or a human situation or a question.  This movie didn't give me many.Perhaps because it tried to do two things -- flesh out an intriguing mystery on the skeleton framework of family dynamics (or vice versa, it's hard to tell which should be considered the frame and which the flesh).  And possibly because it covered the area of my professional interest and work, I'm much harder to please?  Many others will be far less demanding on that issue. Definitely not a pleasant, feel good film but worth seeing.  Good performances by the three male principals and others.  But, for me, it grasped far less than it reached for.",Null,0,0,27 October 2003
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Sound premise; humor level 5th-7th grade
","I enjoyed Will Ferrill's 'Elf' a little more than 'Anchorman.'The story is based on a very sound premise: the difficulty in accepting cultural change, specifically women becoming broadcast anchors, giving the news, being primary hosts.  I hate to admit that when I first heard a female voice (Susan Stanburg) doing the anchor job on NPR (National Public Radio), it was shocking, unsettling, too foreign to me. But I adapted fairly quickly and appreciated her talent and that paved the way for more easily accepting women in many anchor or special expert positions.  Now, all I can do is shake my head in wonder at why that was such an initial problem for me.
So the story is based on a very significant cultural change our country has gone through and if it was difficult for me, it must have been FAR more difficult for males in the broadcasting industry whose careers were threatened.  (I'm sure that men and women have gone/are going  through similar transitions in many professions -- law, medicine, teaching, clergy, police, the military, etc. -- with more still yet to come.)
'Anchorman' parodies this with what is, in essence a series of skits.  To me, the level of humor seemed around the 5th - 7th grade level, quite far from what could be characterized as dry or sophisticated. 
I think seeing the film is worthwhile to reinforce memories of that significant cultural change. Each of us will find some gags that are funny and some too juvenile.",6,1,1,1 August 2004
The Shawshank Redemption," Richly human, uplifting
","Deservedly ranked at the top of IMDb's all-time best 250 films ever.The casting is superb: Morgan Freeman is 'Red,' a wise observer of people and an entrepreneur inmate who's made 'connections' so he can get contraband to other inmates for a price; he's under a life sentence for murder. Tim Robbins is 'Andy,' a smart banker and accounting whiz who was sentenced to 2 life terms for killing his wife and her lover (which he--like most other inmates, say they're not guilty of). And Bob Gunton is 'Warden Norton' who, when we first meet him, is touting the virtues of Bible reading and strict discipline. While, fortunately, I've had no first hand experience, 'Shawshank' certainly gives the feel of authenticity of prison life and its society.A long movie, most of it takes place inside a semi-corrupt state penitentiary in the late 1940s. 'Red,' in talking his thoughts out loud to himself, becomes our narrator for many developments. As the story unfolds, increasingly we come to see Andy as a person with strong personal values which he upholds in the most difficult situations. And in Andy's work for Warden Norton, we also increasingly find the warden as morally his opposite: selfish and fundamentally lacking decent moral character--all show and appearance and with no integrity, substance.In Roger Ebert's first review (of his two) of this movie, he said: '....the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything....the word redemption is in the title for a reason....' Most viewers will agree.",10,5,7,4 May 2012
Rango," Marvelous tongue-in-cheek parody of the classic western
","A thespian wannabe lizard (voiced by Johnny Depp) ends up in a western town ('Dirt') and by accident (and chutzpah) becomes its sheriff -- and through a series of further accidents saves the town and ultimately gets the girl.'Rango' seems specifically designed for and is far more fun for adults than kids. While the story can stand alone, the more movies and cowboy westerns you've seen, the more fun you'll have watching this because it uses bits and pieces from so many of them to spin a classic story in a tongue-in-cheek way. It's kind of a 'Blazing Saddles' parody but done with animals in all the roles of a classic western.Well, almost all.A CGI animated version of Clint Eastwood makes a brief appearance driving a golf cart loaded with 4? Oscar statues.The characters the various animals play are all marvelous and distinctive. The computer graphics by Industrial Light & Magic are incredible--the textures of everything (lizards' and snakes' skin, birds' feathers, animals' fur and hair, weathered wood, rusted iron) are extremely realistic. The director is the same as for the 'Pirates of the Caribbean.' Very funny, very enjoyable--both cerebral and slapstick.",10,3,6,16 March 2011
Before Sunrise," Marvellous, unusually realistic, atypical of Hollywood
","This is about the accidental meeting of two mid-20s age college students: 'Jesse' (Ethan Hawke) and 'Celine' (Julie Delpy). He's returning from a disappointing visit to his girlfriend in Spain (she's in an international student program but has fallen in love with another student and dumped Jesse). He's near broke and on a train to Vienna from where he'll take his cheapest flight back to the USA.Celine's on the same train, returning to her home in Paris when they meet. Although French, she's studied in the USA and speaks excellent English. Jesse asks - and Celine agrees - to interrupt her trip to spend a few more hours together exploring Vienna before his plane leaves. Gradually, as they get to know each other, they become more deeply attached.As Roger Ebert said, 'This sort of scenario has happened....millions of times. It has rarely happened in a nicer, sweeter, more gentle way.... (It's) so much like real life - like a documentary with an invisible camera.' This is the first film (so far, of 3) by Linklater starring Delpy and Hawke, each filmed 9 years apart: 'Before Sunset' (2004) & 'Before Midnight' (2013). While it'd be nice to see them in order, each one is so good, so unique and satisfying that it's more important to just see them. The series is about relationships: how do we get to know others and let others know us, how do we handle differences, conflicts? To what would a long term relationship with this person lead? - satisfaction? - disappointment? How much of which? How can we tell?This film's opening raises those questions by example: on the train ride, Celine's bothered by the loud conversation of a long married, middle-aged couple across the aisle from her: they argue so loudly (and obviously chronically) about? - whatever, everything - that Celine moves and finds herself across the aisle from Jesse. Their conversation starts - and where will this go? That's the gist of this marvelous, very unique movie.People who prefer car chases and explosions should avoid it--no action of that kind, whatsover; it's all just talk--but, for many of us, what exciting talk that keeps us wondering to where it will lead!!",10,2,2,7 September 2013
Saving Mr. Banks," Interesting biopic of an interesting character
","This movie is about 'P.L. Travers,' the pen name of the woman who wrote the Mary Poppins books and the negotiations and huge struggles involved between Travers and Walt Disney over Disney gaining the rights to make the one 'Mary Poppins' film. It gives much of the author's early background which influenced both her writing, those struggles and her personality.Emma Thompson was nominated (very deservedly, IMO) for Golden Globe's 'Best Actress' 2013 award. She was great portraying very difficult character.While the film is biographical, like many 'biopics' it takes liberties in which facts it presents, omits &/or distorts. Nevertheless, it captures much of this author's qualities, personality, and history. The Wikipedia article on 'P.L. Travers' is worthwhile for those who wish to sift fact from film fiction: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._L._Travers And also, if interested, you can google the Chicago Tribune article about an interview with the author of a biography of 'P.L. Travers': ''Mary Poppins, She Wrote' author discusses P.L Travers, 'Saving Mr. Banks' '",8,1,2,15 January 2014
Moonrise Kingdom," Enjoyable to most others--but NOT to me
","In 1965, on a partially settled (with town & wilderness) New England offshore island, an unhappy, many foster-homed 12 year old boy, 'Sam,' is in a scouts' summer camp and he meets an unhappy 12 year old town girl, 'Suzy,' living in an dysfunctional family. Sam & Suzy 'elope' into the wilds and camp together and that sets off several different search parties to get them back and separated.After reading many positive reviews, I was VERY much looking forward to seeing this--but was very disappointed. One reason, the Lawrence, KS, theater in which 'B.' and I saw it does NOT have a great sound system so 2/3rds of the dialog we could only guess at.But 2 things were more disappointing to me: -- (1) that ALL of the characters seemed to be caricatures of real people with over-the-top reactions & events, kind of like people taking the roles of wooden manikins taking the roles of real people. And similarly for drastic events (e.g, lightning strikes & floods that omitted realistic human consequences). -- (2) AND, certainly MORE damaging to me, a retired clinical psychologist: I've worked (therapy + consulting with authorities & families) with scores of foster kids who've been repetitively rejected by their latest set of foster parents and forced into another placement--as well as with many kids in dysfunctional families who were acting out. These are usually kids with IMMENSE amounts of hidden pain so viewing their behaviors and their behavioral consequences as canvases on which to paint comedy certainly doesn't hack it for me. (And since my 'B.' is a retired school social worker, she also shared some of those reactions although possibly not as strongly as mine.)Warning: One brief scene may irritate those opposed to any hint of animal cruelty in movies.Almost all who LO♥E Wes Anderson movies will greatly enjoy 'MK': so far 95% of IMDb voters rate 'MK' higher than I do and I have NO ill-will against any who like it.'Different strokes for different folks'My rating: 5 of 10",5,7,16,16 July 2012
Rear Window," Hitchcock at his finest
","Imagine a hot summer in New York City in the pre-air conditioned 1950s. Now imagine apartment buildings surrounding a courtyard, all windows open at night, trying to catch any breeze. It's so hot, some put bedding on their fire escapes and sleep outside. Now fill in the blanks between the parts of the residents' lives you've seen through wide open windows and what you no longer see. Jeff (James Stewart) has all the time in the world to do that; he has to wear a hip-to-toe cast on one leg for 7 weeks, repairing the leg he'd broken in his usual job as a professional action photographer (sports, mountain climbing, wars, etc.). His visiting nurse, Stella (Thelma Ritter), daily attends to his basic needs--food, cleaning, etc. Lisa (Grace Kelly) also comes; she's a well paid fashionista exec, in love with Jeff, but their life styles (& incomes) are so different that Jeff is very leery of the marriage she obviously wants.Jeff, since wearing his cast, won't sleep in bed. He's too taken with his voyeurism, his place by his window watching the various lives unfold in the various apartments within his view and imaginatively filling in the blanks when he can't see them; he sleeps in his wheel chair. He (and we) occasionally see the newly wed couple who often draw their shades despite the heat. And 'Miss Torso,' a shapely ballet dancer, who practices, practices, practices--and sometimes entertains male friends. 'Miss Lonelyhearts,' about 35-45, we know fantasies having a man in her life because she practices entertaining an imaginary man at dinners she cooks. There's the musician who keeps trying to write a great song. And a traveling jewelry salesman (Raymond Burr) whose bedridden wife is demanding and never appreciative of his attempts to serve her. When his wife suddenly vanishes and Jeff sees him disposing of a saw and knife, Jeff suspects the worst. Jeff tries to convince Lisa and his nurse, but they initially think he's going overboard. He also tries with a detective friend (Wendall Corey), his WW-II flying buddy, but with worse results. Eventually, with several increases in suspense somewhat relieved by humorous bits, all the various narratives are resolved: the salesman and his wife, Miss Torso, Miss Lonelyhearts, the musician---and even Jeff.The casting couldn't be better. The screenplay artfully makes us, the viewers, along with Jeff, into very similar voyeurs, eager to fill in the same blanks. Immensely satisfying to most (IMDb voters rank it Hitchcock's best; it's an Ebert Great Film; 100% of Rotten Tomatoes critics rate it 'ripe'), it builds suspense throughout but, nicely, lacks any doses of horror that lead to nightmares.A true masterpiece.",10,1,3,6 October 2011
Pitch Perfect," A delightful look at college days with singing
","Beca (Kendrick), an entering freshman at fictional 'Barden College,' aspires to be a DJ in L.A. But her father, a professor at Barden, insists she attend college at least a year plus join some activity group. Last year, Barden's male 'a cappella' singing group, the 'Treblemakers,' won 1st place in national collegiate competition. Barden's female group, the 'Bellas,' had 'ill fortune' and, trying hard to do better this next year, is actively recruiting new members. Beca joins it. At 'Barden College' these 'a cappella' singing groups seem to serve some of the same roles that Greek fraternities & sororities or membership on college football/ basketball teams do in most colleges: group socializing, achieving, winning school honors by competing for victory with other colleges. Beca's reluctant to join and, once committed, is reluctant to trust or be close to anyone, e.g., a boy (Astin) in the 'Treblemakers' who's interested in her. 'Pitch Perfect' with its sexual jokes (and projectile vomiting that rivals a fire hydrant: make 'snow angels' in the vomit on the floor, anyone?) is funny throughout, especially so to the 18-30 year age group with college experiences and, among those, probably more so to its females. My girlfriend & I saw this in a college town where audience laughter drowned out our hearing many lines. The music with lively choreography was great; wish there was more. (Many say that Rebel Wilson as 'Fat Amy' wins the acting credits.) Its view of contemporary college humor was fascinating to this grad from decades ago plus I loved the music. (FWIW: IMDb's gender X age ratings are also fascinating.)",7,4,10,8 October 2012
Slumdog Millionaire," Fascinating look at modern India
","Tentatively -- 8 out of 10 stars (I'll have to see it a couple more times to finally decide) This is a movie about life primarily in Mumbai/Bombay, India, as seen through the life, struggles for survival, challenges, and aspirations of 3 street urchins, two brothers (Salim & Jamal), and a girl (Latika) as they grow up from their preteens to their twenties.The 3 are Muslim in a divisive culture -- Hindu & Muslim -- and their parents are murdered, they are orphaned in a fratricidal attack by fundamentalist Hindus on Muslims. The film's narrative shows how they survived from then through early adulthood.I had problems understanding probably 25-33% of the dialog, sometimes because of accents, sometimes for whatever other reasons (my own hearing problems?) -- soundtrack, foreign language, etc.The panoramic views of India's civilization, its mixtures of poverty and wealth, ancient and modern, means of surviving, its varied levels of comfort, are unparalleled. Have you ever called a Customer Hotline and been answered by someone you figured was in India? Then you'll appreciate some scenes.Most critics give this movie a 9/10 or 10/10. I need to see it again to really decide.I can say that the background music was superb, the actors playing the early, middle, and later years of the principal characters, the '3 musketeers,' were excellent and Latika -- in her various ages -- became increasingly more beautiful. As a professional family therapist, I found the later divergence between the two brothers to be quite plausible (although not inevitable). Nothing was out of place, out of belief, for this clinical psychologist -- a level reachable by maybe only 30-40% of films.Some people who want a very propelled, tight and structured narrative may not much appreciate this film.But those of us who especially appreciate a film that conveys a very intimate glimpse into other cultures will feel greatly rewarded.",9,2,5,16 February 2009
Princess Mononoke," Beautiful artwork; interesting concept; sometimes confused storyline
","(AKA English) 'Princess Mononoke'I'd read good reviews of this and long wanted to see it so got it when my local video shop had it. I found it worth seeing but a little uneven.Much of the artwork, especially of landscapes and atmosphere and weather, is stunning. Some of the artwork, to my taste, is too crude (e.g., as in the drawings of the wolf mother and sibs to Mononoke).Perhaps those growing up in Japanese culture absorb a supporting fabric that makes the story line more natural and understandable to them than to an American audience. I'm appreciative of the idea that it does not have to be Man vs. Nature (as some industrialists view it) -- that there can be a co-existence or maybe even a symbiosis? The storyline presented realistic conflict among the forces on both sides (nature & animal vs. man) but while the motives of the conflicts on the nature/animal side were understandable, those on the human side were far less so.*** WARNING -- SOME WILL FIND THE FOLLOWING SPOILS THE OUTCOME ***Generally, I often find story lines with supernatural forces are interesting, especially when they deal with moral issues as this does. I can accept that folklore has gods with different levels of power. But it did bother me that the supergod of all Nature, capable walking on water and special powers of healing, of transforming shape from day to night, of spreading out an ooze over the whole land that would injure humans, of living and functioning without a head -- that a god with such powers has a head that can be chopped off by humans and can not find it if humans keep it in a box.",8,1,2,8 October 2000
High Fidelity," Really good movie; please read Peter Dykstra's comments (4-23-00)
","I agree almost completely with Peter Dykstra's thoughtful comments (4-23-00, please read them) although I didn't find the Charlie character as compelling as he did.  Like him, this is not my type of music so I missed many of the in-jokes, but the same kind of elitist snobbery shown by Rob and his help can be found among people in many areas.Dykstra's point about the Barry character being a mite improbable (to connect with an audience as a performer, given his previous track record) is well-taken.  But that doesn't bother me much because Rob's conflict of commitment, his very prolonged adolescence -- and his final summing up and resolution of it -- analyzed and laid bare that dilemma with a clarity and truthfulness that I've never before seen in movies.  (Would that all people, men _or_ women -- with similar immaturity/insecurity problems with relationships -- could resolve them with the insight Rob's character finally showed.)   Cusack and all the supporting actors fit well in their roles and did fine jobs.  It's a really good film and you don't have to be familiar with the current pop music scene to enjoy it (that  could only add more pleasure).",9,0,0,28 May 2000
