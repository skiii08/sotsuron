Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It's not that bad people
","I know that no science fiction can top any of the three original STAR WARS films. The first one was groundbreaking and much like THE GODFATHER PART 2, EMPIRE was better than the original. And JEDI was a little underrated. Trust me, watch the last 30 minutes or so. The last 30 minutes are the ending to a legend. But, TPM wasn't that freaking bad. Really. It's watchable. But, the characters are a little chopped up. Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker makes me vomited. Not really vomited, but there could have been someone better than him. He does add a childlike figure to Darth. You have to remember, this kid is the darkest human being on any film screen. So give it time, let it sink in. It's not that bad.",7,1,2,5 February 2008
