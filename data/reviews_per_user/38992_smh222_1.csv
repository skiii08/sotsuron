The New World," Worst Movie EVER!
","First of all, I will NEVER get that 2 1/2 hours back. It was the worst movie I have EVER seen. Being that I am a frequent movie go-er, and in my 20 years of existence this is BY FAR, the worst movie I have ever seen. Not only will I not get that 2 1/2 hours back, but I spent twelve dollars when I could have easily bought myself a fifth of vodka instead. I would recommend being trashed to enjoy the movie. If you do go and see this movie, I guarantee that you will walk out within the first half hour. I think the only exciting part of going to the movie was seeing the trailer for the DaVinci code. That was the highlight of the whole night. Another point to include was that there was hardly any dialog and Mozart was being played when Mozart didn't even exist in that time frame. I would also like to point out that I trusted this website and the other comments and I feel like I was taken advantage of. Thank you, have a good day!",1,3,12,29 January 2006
