Minority Report," Spielberg does dick (well, Dick)
","Minority Report is a solid piece of cinema. A step up for mr. Spielberg after the failure that A.I. was. Cruise is one brave man, taking a job along side with Colin Farrell, who upstages him. Yes, the real energy in this yarn is Farrell, showing us that we ought to keep our eye on his future work, because the man handles his craft well and steals the screen. The plot seems to be nothing more than the usual run'n'hide for Cruise, but the good twists keep it lively. Only REALLY negative thing I have to say about this, are the kids that can see the crimes before they're committed. Of course they explain why this is possible, but it's quite far fetched. Spielberg admires and adores kids in his films WAY too much. Still, over all, this is a good film, which I would recommend.**** / *****",9,1,1,30 September 2002
Wayne's World," What a totally amazing, excellent movie.. YES!!
","What a masterpiece. There aren't too many bad jokes in this movie.. actually I can't think of a single one. The Bohemian Rhapsody opening is such a classic. Pure fun at it's best. There's such an amazing chemistry between the whole cast that it spills on the screen. Party. And I love the cameos by Alice Cooper and Robert Patrick. This movie dates back at a time when Carvey still had a career. The Master of Disguise is clearly an attempt to create a franchise for him, because Myers has Austin Powers. You be the judge of how well that turned out. In this movie anyway, Carvey is good. Excellent. Lowe also brings color to his sleezy character. It gives me barrels of laughs the watch this movie, because it doesn't feel fake and it's v e r y clear that they had a great time making it. And when ordering Chinese take-out, I recommend the cream of sum yung guy.***** / *****",10,0,1,30 June 2003
Batman Returns," Perfection achieved.
","Batman Returns is a poem of a film. As Kit Ramsey would say: 'It's a film, not a movie!'. Michael Keaton has totally become one with the character of Bruce Wayne and DeVito and Pfeiffer justify their casting the second they appear on the screen. Nothing short of a miracle. And as much as Burton is my favorite director, Danny Elfman is the magician this time around. The score he created for Batman Returns is in my opinion the highlight of his career so far. The music is absolutely beautiful and supports the imagery dead on. I'm very much looking forward to Nolan's fifth Batman film, 'cause Batman Forever (****) was on the limit of being complete failure and the almost legendary Batman and Robin (*) WAS just that. Still, this one deserves a place in my top 10 best films list. A masterpiece.***** / *****",10,3,8,9 January 2004
L.A. Confidential," The perfect film.
","You know how Wes Bentley's character is watching the drifting bag from video with Thora Birch in American Beauty? And he speaks of life and world being sometimes so beautiful, that he feels he can't take it. I get that feeling with watching L.A. Confidential. This is a beautiful movie. It really takes you to the 50's and gives you a warm feeling of film noir. I have to admit never reading the book, but actually that takes me to a better position to rate this film as a film and not a book adaptation. And it works. My god, how it works. The characters are so far from being boring, that you'd be thrilled if they actually could jump from the screen to real life.. hell, even the bad guys. Curtis Hanson finally showed us his real potential as a filmmaker, after the likes of The Hand That Rocks the Cradle and The River Wild. Those films were not bad (actually quite good), but in the end they were just ordinary thrillers. L.A. Confidential explores deeper. The plot is not one-dimensional and I really didn't see the twists coming a mile away. Throughout the film, every character is perfectly cast and they all should have been up for Oscars. Looking for an intelligent film? Look no further.***** / *****",10,2,4,10 July 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," Much better on the second viewing.
","I first saw Revolutions when I bought it on dvd and watched it on my 21 inch TV. Not much of an experience. Then my friend's boyfriend loaned a video cannon and we decided to give it a go. Suddenly, it was a whole different world. The film really opened up to me after seeming a bit shallow the first time around.A lot of bad reviews have been thrown towards the Matrix sequels. By me also. Well I'm man enough to say I was wrong. I LOVED THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS. There. The film has beautiful dramatic tones and especially the attack on Zion is absolute eye candy. The APUs are such a great idea (although a bit of rip off from Aliens) and they look so cool in action.SPOILER AHEAD! But why the extra cheese on the last moments between Neo and Trinity before she dies? Why?! Wouldn't it have been at least a bit better if she would've died right then and there in the crash? No sappy and quite unnecessary goodbyes. Which would have been a lot less corny. END OF SPOILER!I don't know if I should recommend not to believe the hype, since I know that many people also love this film. Not just hate. I loved it anyways. Give it a chance.**** / *****",5,0,1,31 May 2004
American Psycho," So good filmmaking..
","Again not having read the book, I can't say how good of an adaptation this is, but as a film, it's exceptional. Add to that, this is the role Christian Bale was born to play. I just can't see anyone else doing it. A special thumbs-up must also go to Mary Harron for giving the whole thing a very enjoyable off-beat feel. The performances are overplayed, but on purpose and it works like a charm. It would be totally wrong to call American Psycho just a horror movie. The film is a delicious satire of yuppies and I can't remember laughing so hard recently. Loses touch a bit in the last reel, though, but not enough to make it standard fare. Simply brilliant! And by the way, that's **** for my Rules of Attraction comment. I urge you to give Patrick Bateman a chance.. or are you afraid you might like it? 'Is that Ivana Trump?!'**** / *****",8,0,1,20 January 2004
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Good movie.
","Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines cashes in on the expectations. This movie could have been a lot worse. Actually the only big difference to it's two predecessors is that the film's not even nearly as dark as Cameron's movies. It is a bit of a problem, since T1 and T2 were perfect borderline horror movies. Especially the original. T3 doesn't take itself as seriously which maybe would've been nice. That said, I must also state that this movie is not bad as a lighthearter Terminator film. It does play with the same serious issues as the originals and the suspense is very well build this time around too. If I'd be asked weather I would recommend this film, the answer would certainly be yes. Arnold is back to doing what he does best, Stahl and Danes are good in the supporting roles and Loken kicks a** as the T-X. Plus there's that groovy chase sequence which is every bit as admirable as the truck chase in T2.**** Â½ / *****",6,0,0,26 May 2004
Face_Off," Noises/off (possible spoilers)
","I haven't liked Woo's Hollywood pictures. Studios wanted to test him with Van Damme and he made the somewhat watchable actionier Hard Target (still, nowhere near great). I mean, if you can make a good Van Damme movie, there has gotta be some kind of magic in you. Broken Arrow was a horrible failure and although this did make some huge bank, it still doesn't mean that it's a masterpiece. Because it's not. Travolta and Cage are not in best shape (witness the pathetic performance from Cage, as his character confronts his wife in the hospital and tells that weepy story of their first date. There's nothing wrong with a grown man crying, but these are baby tears). And, I REALLY could have done with less slo-mo. Not a total loss, but rates about as high as Lost In Space.** / *****",4,0,1,30 September 2002
Spider-Man," This film is clearly trying to boost New Yorkers after 9/11. *spoilers*
","Spider-Man is not a very good movie. I expected much more. It's written by David Koepp, who has made some brilliant work in his career (Jurassic Park, Stir of Echoes, Panic Room), but although the dramatic tones in the story are good and the movie moves along nicely, it's the over-acting by Dafoe, that at times makes me gringe in my seat. When he's Osborne, it's done with style, but when he becomes The Green Goblin, that's when we start to go way over board. Sadly, Raimi's direction is not also all it could be. Plus, it irritates me how this film is forcefully trying to restore confidence in New Yorkers (and I guess in Americans in general), by the bridge scene, for example. When you hear someone scream 'You mess with one of us, you mess with all of us!', it really sounds overly melodramatic. And Poor. Just like Harrison Ford in Air Force One. The bad communists have attacked on America, but don't worry, our fair president will kick the living s**t out of them. USA! USA! Well, 'when in Rome..' i guess. I must hand it to Raimi, that it was a masterstroke to cast Maguire in the role of Parker. He's the most promising new talent to hit Hollywood. Knowing that, it makes me sick to think that such coverboy as Freddie Prince Jr. was actually considered at one time. Oh well, in the end, Spider-man is good for viewing or two. It has it's few moments, but mostly it's standard stuff. J.K. Simmons steals the show.*** / *****",6,0,0,2 July 2003
Alien vs. Predator," A lesson learned.
","And that lesson is that if you don't expect anything, you might be positively surprised. Like I was. I really hated the idea of Anderson making this film, since he's like a studio pet to me. If the financiers want a PG-rating in order to perform better at the box office, he's the guy they call (Resident Evil, anyone?). Yet, Anderson managed to pull it off this time and I'm man enough to admit if I've been wrong. And I was wrong on this. AvP rocks.Of course I would've preferred it if AvP had been more towards gore, like the original Predator or Aliens and Alien3, but it works the way it is. Anderson continues his trend plot outline in AvP which features a bunch of people getting in trouble in a hostile environment (Event Horizon and Resident Evil).Most importantly, the thing that made me happy in Alien vs. Predator is that they were respectful to the original characters. The predators are as bada** as ever and the aliens are slimy and brilliant. Plus the action scenes kick a** and the effects are great enough to support them. Hooray! **** / *****",6,1,3,18 February 2005
28 Days Later...," 28 Days Later delivers the goods!
","Thank God for this film. My impression of Danny Boyle was really down in the mud after a s****y turd that was A Life Less Ordinary. Haven't seen The Beach.Although people seem to think this is a zombie flick, it technically isn't. The ones who have been infected are not dead. They just go simply mad of rage after catching the virus. Still, 28 Days Later has the sweet echoes of Romero's The Living Dead trilogy without actually ripping anything off.Cillian who? I had never heard of this guy before, but after this movie hit me so hard, I will certainly be sitting in the audience of 'Batman 5' (not that I wouldn't be there anyways). Murphy is excellent in this yarn and the cast is good all together, but the man shining through this time is Brendan Gleeson. I've always liked him. One talented motherf...!Good horror coming your way out of the UK!**** / *****",8,1,2,9 June 2004
The Incredibles," Surpassed all my expectations.
","After the rather disappointing Monsters Inc. and Finding Nemo, my hopes were definitely not high for this outing from Brad Bird. I was wrong to think that. Boy, was I wrong! First, The Incredibles is not a comedy like Monsters and Nemo. Sure, there are comedic elements, but mainly this movie is just an extremely entertaining action movie. Which is kind of hard to take in at first since we're talking about a Disney/Pixar animation. The film has a warm and familiar feeling, which is a mixture of three things.. X-Men, James Bond and well, animation (duh!). X-Men, because the superheroes, or 'supers', all have unique powers which resembles the tone of the X-Men. James Bond, because stylistically, The Incredibles has taken many references from the series in case of the production design and music. For example, the capsules that travel on the track around Syndrome's island are almost identical of those seen inside SPECTRE's fake volcano in You Only Live Twice. And not only that, the period is in general very much taken from the sixties, which brings back memories from the early Bond-films with Connery. The voice talents are doing a great job (Jason Lee rocks!) and this film deserves an extra thumbs-up for containing some traditional emotional moments without being melodramatic or tasteless at any point.***** / *****",10,1,3,28 November 2005
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Avoid like your jugular depended on it.
","I went to see New Moon this morning and got exactly what I was expecting: not much.I haven't read any of the books and HATE it when people remind me of that when I talk about these films. I hate it, because it makes no sense whatsoever. Why? Because that's EXACTLY why I *AM* in a good position to rate these movies as their own right as they SHOULD be reviewed and NOT as an adaptation! And they suck, because they're boring, corny, utterly cheesy and just plain stupid.The actors look fittingly bored the whole time and it's no wonder when you consider the moronic dialogue of a garbage they have to spill out with a straight face. And the less said about the shirtlesness the better.. 'oh look, Bella has a teeny weeny cut on her forehead. What would make her feel better? I know, I'll take my shirt off.' The only good thing about New Moon were the wolves. They looked cool, largely thanks to their massive size which made them genuinely a bit threatening. That's really pretty much it. Garbage and a waste of time.Next time a woman complains to me about films like American Pie (and yes, I am aware of the coincidence of these films having the same director) objectifying women, I'll throw The Twilight Saga right in their hypocritic face and tell them to shut up right then and there. I rest my case.",4,11,18,27 November 2009
Mission: Impossible II," The original is and will always be far superior to this.
","M:I-2 is not a good movie. It's corny and melodramatic. An thus so, very irritating. What in the hell happened to the cool Ethan Hunt we saw in the first film? In the original the character was a no-compromising, antiwomanizer. We see the sequel and what do they give us? A playboy. Geez, Thanks a bunch! Here lies the problem of M:I-2 (God, I love writing that).. this movie doesn't take itself seriously enough. Ok, the first film had a stick up it's a**, but quite frankly, that's what I wanted. A cool spy film. And that's certainly what it was.Also, you can fool yourself all you want, but John Woo is no Brian De Palma. Woo is known to audiences as an action maestro and De Palma still managed to pull of better suspense and action thrills. The bullettrain climax in the original is a hard scene to top. Mission: Impossible II is below average and it's best values lie in the performance of Hopkins' cameo and Newton's drop dead gorgeous looks.** / *****",4,0,1,24 May 2004
Black Hawk Down," Ridley strikes gold again!
","How does this sound: intense war film directed by Ridley Scott. Not bad, ay? What about this: intense war film from the producer Jerry Bruckheimer. Not so good anymore. Luckily the second part has understood to give the first free hands. I admit that action has always been Bruckheimer's strong point, but when it comes to drama.. well, witness Pearl Harbor (= not good). Although BHD is based on a true story, it doesn't mean that the combat happened exactly like the film describes it. That aside, this is still a very strong piece of material that is only straightened by the great cast, supreme effects and most of all, the lack of any romance. I'm not saying that romance is a sure thing to bring any film plummeting down, but it's so fresh to see a film where it's not present just to suck up to the women in the audience. One thing, though.. there's one tiny problem with the fact, that because the soldiers are in full combat gear and most of them are wearing the goggles, it's VERY difficult to recognize them from each other. You often just don't know who's shooting and who's getting hit. The filmmakers have tried to solve the problem to some extent by writing the characters names on their helmets. It doesn't work well. But these are just minor problems and by the time the end credits roll on, you know you've seen a kick ass war movie that does not stop much to draw breath!**** / *****",8,1,1,15 January 2003
Pulp Fiction," I love this film.
","Quentin Tarantino is a genius. Plus, he's one cool mothaf**ka. And I mean that in the best of ways. How many else have the guts to rewrite the bible.. 'Do you read the bible, Brent..?'. I'm quite sure, I'll never see a better movie than this. The characters are well developed (and cool), the script is the best collection of words there could ever be and the cinematography, the music, THE MUSIC, the acting and the direction are all high standard (and cool). There's literally nothing in this film, that I wouldn't like. Especially Samuel L. Jackson deserves an applause. Nobody else in the history of humankind has made the word 'f**k' sound so awesome and cool. I only wish that I could have half of the intelligence, that this film displays. Thank you, mr. Tarantino. Keep making them, I'll keep watching them!***** / *****",10,0,1,30 September 2002
Titanic," Very good film. *minor spoilers*
","Titanic is a beautiful and thoughtful movie. One thing bothers me.. the overly dramatic dialogue between Jack and Rose. It's sooo disgusting at times. Why can't they talk like normal people? Rose: 'Oh Jack, (insert melodramatic line)'. Jack: Oh Rose, (insert melodramatic response)'. Other that that, I have very little bad to say about this. Cameron builds the tension between the characters and the ship beautifully and by the time Titanic's doom is approaching faster and faster, the film turns into a very 'beautiful' survival story. The part when the ship breaks in two is especially dramatic. One more thing, Cameron is known for his larger that life action movies, and it is obvious that this time around he's tried something else. But let's be honest.. the last hour on the Titanic is just one brilliant action scene. It's just in his nature, why fight it?***** / *****",10,1,3,12 May 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Good film, but tries to be more than it is.
","The Matrix Reloaded is not a great film. I'd heard complaints that in the first hour there's nothing happening. This is pretty much true. But it's not even close to being the reason of this movie not working as well as the first. The problem is the philosophical rubble that just goes on and on and very soon gets irritating. It feels like the directors are bragging with their material.. 'oh, look how smart problems we've managed to write in to the script'. Of course the whole idea of the world being fake is deeply philosophical in itself, but this was just the theme in the first. The first film made it's point by visuals and not including much of it in the actual dialogue, but in Reloaded they for some reason saw that it wasn't enough. Shame. Also most of the comedic moments are flat. The film has it's good qualities too. As expected, the action scenes are terrific. The fight between Neo and the Smiths goes on a bit too long though and the hero himself looks animated in some shots of the scene. The highway chase steals the whole show.. the twins kick ass and the cars flip over like it's poetry. Surprisingly good are also the scenes between Trinity and Neo. Not overly melodramatic, but rather nice. As a film, Reloaded is a three star picture, but the great action ups the stakes. Revolutions? Bring it on.**** / *****",7,0,0,9 June 2003
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," A film to teach kids 'good' values.
","I didn't like the first Potter-film. In fact, in my opinion, Chris Columbus hasn't made an enjoyable film since 'Mrs. Doubtfire'. Anyway, back to Potter.. I'm sure this is good enough for the kids and some parents may get a laugh from the calculated and shallow (read: poor) humor, but for any self respecting filmbuff, this is just a terribly naive 'gobbuldy-goo'. Only things missing are the Disney-logo and a narrator to explain the lesson of the film. Plus, it's a terrible waste of good talent (Isaacs, Rickman, Coltrane), but worst of all, this will remain as the last film of the great Richard Harris. What a shame. Like Raul Julia in Streetfighter. Terrible film, but at least HE got to fly. The child actors deserve a special thumbs-down. Hope I didn't make them cry.** / *****",Null,0,0,16 December 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Best Picture of the Year? Give me a break..
","Man, and you thought Titanic was cheesy?! When I first saw this film on the big screen, the multiple endings bothered me only a little. Now that I saw it for the second time, they simply outraged me. Best adapted screenplay, best director and best picture of the year all went this way. This time: not deserved. The Return of the King ends five times. FIVE TIMES!! I don't give a good goddamn if it was that way in the books too. I never read them. And that gives me a good position to rate this as a film and not a screen adaptation.Every single time Elijah Wood laughs in this movie (in the entire trilogy actually), I almost throw up. Couldn't they make it any more cheesier?! Especially stomach turning is the scene at the end of the RotK, where they all laugh and hug by Frodo's bed. OF COURSE in slow motion to add a little more sappiness. Plus the scene where their journey has ended and they all sit in the pub and skÃ¥l their pints together.. check out the expression on Wood's face. So cheesy I laughed my a** off.The most worrying thing about all of this is that without the cheesiness and the multiple endings, this would've really been a great movie. I don't love them, but I do like these films. And it was such a tasteless display of drama from the academy to pretty much dismiss the two previous movies and award the last and most tasteless one in spades. It made the whole thing feel like the 'Russell Crowe-syndrome', as I like to call it. They didn't award him the statue for The Insider, but instead for Gladiator the next year, because they probably felt so guilty. Maximus after all was clearly a more easier role than Wigand and didn't deserve the award as much.I can see why so many love this film and embrace it, but people, eleven Oscars? No.** / *****",7,25,57,30 May 2004
The Matrix," Fresh. Good. But not perfect.
","The first time I saw The Matrix, it was in a theater. It was good. After that, countless times on pirate videos and on DVD. Still good. But it has never given me that mystical spark that would make it a five star picture. You know how you really like some movie, but it's just missing that something, that thing you can't define? That's how it is between this movie and me.The Matrix is no doubt the most inventive movie to hit the screens in a long while and the dark visuals and themes common to the Wachowski brothers are really at home here. It's almost a crime to say what I'm about to say, but I have began to like the sequels even more. There, I have now disgraced myself.At least in one way this original does beat the sequels, though. There is none of that melodramatic romance between Neo and Trinity that in my opinion was the greatest fall of Reloaded and Revolutions. Plus here the idea is still fresh.

300," A Visual Delicatessen For The Senses.
","The frase 'best movie I've ever seen' is tossed around a lot and even (it seems) in cases when the movie's been merely cool. Well, when I say it, I mean it.. 300 is literally one of the most breathtaking, magnificent and *best* films I've seen in my life.Every frame could be printed out and hung on a wall as a painting. It really is that beautiful. In some other films where the visuals are breathtaking, the story usually falls flat or is just non-existent, case in point The Cell. The Cell is visually almost at the same par as 300 (yes, there isn't as much CG, but the smooth camera work finishes the touch), but at it's core, it's just not as interesting. And enough about JLo. The characters in this film are interesting and perfectly cast. Dominic West.. who would've though? The final nail on the coffin of this instant classic is the director himself, Zack Snyder. The man is the most uncompromising and talented artist behind the camera since.. since.. Spielberg. Great things can (and SHOULD) be expected from him in the years to come. If this achievement isn't enough to impress you, just think about this.. he managed to turn a zombie movie into one of 2004's best pictures. And it was even a remake, for God's sake! ***** / *****",10,2,5,23 February 2008
The Bourne Supremacy," Sublime Supremacy
","The Bourne Supremacy is a good example of a sequel, where everything has gone just right. Some of my friends who have seen this film commented that it was a mistake to kill off Potente's character 15 minutes in. I disagree. For one thing, it gives Damon's Bourne much more space to move and second, it really darkens his character and makes him more focused and interesting.The supporting cast is excellent. From Brian Cox to Joan Allen to even Julia Stiles, they are all in top form. I actually don't like Stiles that much, because she's tortured audiences with tasteless yarns like The Prince & Me and Down to You. The horror. Here, though, Stiles delivers a small, but intense role. And just when you think it doesn't get any better, the jaw-droppingly gorgeous Oksana Akinshina from 'Lilja 4-Ever' shows up. Plus Chris Cooper. And Karl Urban. Impressive.I loved The Bourne Identity, but this film pushed the envelope even further. In a situation where 007 would use some super gadget, Bourne uses simple household items which he happens to find. And that's a good thing, because it makes the film seem much more realistic. In the first movie, Bourne uses a pencil as a weapon and in Supremacy, a rolled-up newspaper. Pure genius.***** / *****",10,2,4,4 April 2005
Jurassic Park," An undeniable classic.
","I grew up watching Jurassic Park. But that's not the only reason I love this masterpiece. Like Star Wars and ID4, Jurassic Park was one of those films people went to see with their jaws dropped. They had really made these ancient creatures to come alive. Along with the likes of Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark, Jurassic Park is in every way one of the best adventure movies ever made.And if the effects alone aren't enough to blow you away, Jurassic Park is also masterfully directed and acted. The script is funny, but at the same time filled with nail biting suspense. John Williams' score is so brilliant and beautiful that it at times almost brings tears to your eyes. There are just almost no words! The sequels to date also work to some extent (The Lost World clearly better than JP3), but in the end they're just simply inferior to the original.Jurassic Park is movie magic in it's purest form.***** / *****",10,3,5,2 June 2004
