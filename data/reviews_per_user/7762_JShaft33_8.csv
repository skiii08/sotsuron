It," The wring generation is reviewing this film
",The majority of people giving this review a poor review are those who are fans of the book or original mini-series. This film was made with the direction of appealing to a whole new generation/audience. Most people under the age of 35 have never even seen the original mini-series. They pretty much updated the film for a fan base with a social media attention span and appetite for higher budget films. If you think they made this to improve on your memories of nostalgia from the '90's then you are completely missing the point.,6,2,4,17 September 2018
Hereditary," Horror through emotions
","This film intentionally exhibits a droning pace of tension. It feels like several films in one, playing off themes of grief, anxiety, shock, mental instability and overall creepiness. Those that enjoy cheap jump scares of slasher films are looking in the wrong direction. This movie is a collection of hidden moments and foreshadowing that add to the overall effectiveness. If you just want to watch something that you don't have to spend any energy or thought on to be entertained - this is not likely going to be your cup of tea. This is the type of film that is engrossing and likely gets even more effective after a second viewing when you pick up on all of the smaller elements.",8,1,3,17 October 2018
Yesterday," I enjoyed this despite not liking the Beatles
","I've never been a Beatles fan, but the idea intrigued me. I waited a while before getting the stomach up to watch this, however it was fortunately done well and the actual music was completely overdone like that Elton John biopic Rocketman. The acting was good and the pacing made the movie fly by.",7,2,3,18 May 2020
The Favourite," Different type of period piece
","I have no idea why everyone thought this was going to be a nice comedy. It's a period piece based on manipulation with dark comedic overtones and sharp witted tongues. It's an artful look at some of the behind the scenes lifestyles of the time. The movies is based on true characters and true events. No one can say for certain how physically intimate the women were - but there was plenty of speculation that the story is not a stretch.In the end, I found the movie to be exactly what I thought it would be coming into it. If anything, I was surprised with the stylization. I am not sure what some of the other reviewers were looking for that came away disappointed. Perhaps they didn't invest any time into understanding what this movie was going to be about.",6,0,0,25 February 2019
Midsommar," Folk horror art
","Atmospheric movie in the vein of Melancholia. If you are not a fan of Melancholia, I would skip. This is more Tales from the Darkside type horror - preying on a viewers sense of normalcy. Beautifully shot and textured - the dread is carried within it's foreboding themes. If you don't like this review, you will not like this movie.",8,1,3,29 September 2019
Wonder Woman," Completely unrealistic
","One of the most far fetched and unrealistic movies I'd seen in a long time. The scenes of WW blocking bullets with her wrist bands get old rather quickly, yet they keep going back to it. Also the fact that Dr. Maru can keep her face mask on with no apparent adhesive, yet a little breeze can blow it off also seems unbelievable.I wish they focused more on Diana's transition to the modern world. That was the most interesting part of the entire movie.",4,3,8,14 February 2018
Black Panther," Fast & the Furious: African Drift
",David S. Lee was the only redeeming part of this film. While I did like some of the 007 level technology - it was another movie overburdened with special effects and overproduced action scenes. This really was the Fast & the Furious of the Marvel movies. As far as the Oscar nomination - it was a film to keep the commoner interested in the show. No different than when Mad Max was nominated in 2016. Obviously the politics behind the nomination didn't hurt.,3,10,16,24 February 2019
Annihilation," If it's not your taste - doesn't make it a bad movie
",I can't believe how many people are saying this movie is bad. It's a niche audience - but it does what it set out to do. Slightly mind-bending but not as pretentious as some have stated. I felt like it kept me interested the entire movie once it got going.,8,1,2,7 May 2018
