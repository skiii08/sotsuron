The Incredible Hulk," Incredibly boring
","Wow. I have to admit that this is the first time I spend two hours watching a movie, where nothing is happening for 90% of the time.The first hour was so eventful I decided to take a nap... only to be shoved by a mate minutes later telling me it's the break and we should go get a coke. A quick look around the theatre confirmed my suspicions - just about everyone had the shocked look of 'we've actually paid $10 to watch this?!' on their faces.The second half was marginally better. And by marginally, I mean that there were, at least, some cool scenes. Even though overall it was quite predictable, and the ending could be seen from miles away. I could tolerate it if they were trying to push this off as a pilot and fishing for a TV series (a-la 'Riverworld'), but as a movie it's just disappointing.Oh, and while I can buy a military operation in the middle of Nowhere, Brazil, shouldn't a heavy gun battle in a college, and then in New York, of all places, have raised at least a few heads amongst the civilian population? But they just seem happy to get smashed/stepped on/crushed/shot by the main characters. Save your money.",4,2,6,28 June 2008
