Marie Antoinette," Let them eat cake!
","I am absolutely obsessed with this film. Sofia Coppola brilliantly captures Marie Antoinette's true spirit: not as an evil queen, but as a naive and young ruler that doesn't fully know the circumstance her people are in outside the walls of Versailles.Critics seem to have either loved or hated the film, but before you listen to those snubbing the biopic because it 'didn't capture the dark reality of the French Revolution' or 'Kirsten Dunst was too nice when playing Antoinette', keep in mind that these are people that really need to study up on their history.First of all, Marie Antoinette never actually said 'let them eat cake'. In Rousseau's book, Confessions, he writes: 'Finally I recalled the stopgap solution of a great princess who was told that the peasants had no bread, and who responded: 'Let them eat brioche.'' But this was written years before Antoinette even arrived in France. I think that Kirsten Dunst really captured Antoinette's sweet, care-free, bohemian spirit, and she was perfectly cast in the role.Second, this film is NOT about the French Revolution. It's about the life of Marie Antoinette. Was the revolution dark, bloody, and horrific? Absolutely. But Antoinette was never exposed to the harsh world of the rebellion until the very end of her life. This is essentially the entire point of the film-to show that Antoinette was not evil, just misunderstood. She wasn't really aware of the poverty in France and when critics say that the film was too fluffy and not dark enough, they should know that that's exactly what her life was like. With that said, this film was also amazing not just because of the great script but for several other reasons:1) The acting was perfect. As an actress, I found the honesty in each actor's performance to be real and thoughtful, and Dunst truly 'ruled' as the title role. Other favorites of mine include Rose Byrne, who played the Duchesse de Polignac, the silly, outgoing, and often tipsy friend of Antoinette. She was funny and charming. I also enjoyed the performance of Jamie Dornan as Count Axel Fersen, Marie Antoinette's love interest. Overall, the casting was great.2) DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THOSE COSTUMES. One word=gorgeous. Go to Google Images and you'll know what I mean.3) The music was flawless. I loved that Coppola chose to include not only Baroque pieces but also songs from post-punk, New Wave bands from the 80's, as well as some indie thrown in for good measure. My favorite songs in the movie include 'Natural's Not In It' by Gang of Four, 'What Ever Happened?' by The Strokes, and 'Kings of the Wild Frontier' by Adam and the Ants. The only critique I have for the film is that the romance between Marie Antoinette and Count Fersen should have had a bigger part in the film than it did. I would have loved to see more of them together. In addition, the pregnancy conflict (I don't want to write any spoilers so I won't go in depth about this) shouldn't be as long as it was.Other than that, this movie is a must-see. I've seen it at least 10 times and I'll probably be seeing it more. Enjoy!",8,1,3,19 April 2012
Ocean's Eleven," One of my favorite heist movies ever
","Ocean's Eleven is a spectacular film. It's played out perfectly and it's everything you'd want in a heist movie.The movie moves at a fast pace, keeping you constantly at the edge of your seat as you watch Danny and the crew steal from three casinos belonging to Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) for the prize of over $150 million. There's tons of twists, surprising you as the heist is carried out and nothing is as you'd expect it to be. Overall, it is an awesome movie.The Vegas setting is vibrant and cool, and it is filmed in a way to make you feel like you're in the heist with the actors. The casting is great. George Clooney was perfect for the role of Danny Ocean and plays the mastermind in a beautifully confident manner. Brad Pitt is sexy as always and super cool as Rusty Ryan in the flick. Matt Damon is the sneaky pickpocket Linus Caldwell, mixing the perfect amount of innocence to the world of high-stakes theft yet with a maturity as well. Julia Roberts is stunning as always as Tess Ocean and Andy Garcia makes the perfect villain in his role of the billionaire casino owner Terry Benedict. Bernie Mac is extremely charismatic as Frank Catton (the inside man), Carl Reiner is the old timer-Saul Bloom, and Don Cheadle is hilarious as Basher, the explosives genius. Other stars, including Casey Affleck and Scott Caan as wheelmen Virgil and Turk Malloy, Eddie Jemison as Livingston Dell the computer genius, and Shaobo Qin as greaseman Yen are wonderful in their roles. And last but most certainly not least, Elliot Gould as Reuben Tishkoff, the man funding the heist and the lovely, charismatic casino owner is perfect. Gould steals every single scene he's in. So as you can tell, this movie is a must see and a perfect ten. This is one you don't want to miss.PS- The sequels, Ocean's Twelve and Ocean's Thirteen, are amazing as well. I highly recommend you see all three.",10,1,2,3 March 2012
