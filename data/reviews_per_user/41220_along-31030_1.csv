Hereditary," Believe me, you have something better to do than watch this
","This movie is over 2 hours long and, quite seriously, you could nap for 90 minutes of it and not miss any salient, or even mildly interesting plot points. You would be better off spending the time cleaning your baseboards, or just staring blankly at a potted plant. Honestly, if I can help just one person to decide to skip watching this movie, then it will have been an act of community service.",1,4,7,1 April 2019
