Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," What's all the disappointment about?
","Plot? Jar Jar? Too Long? etc....I finally watched this movie.  Unfortunately, I read quite a bit of criticism beforehand.  I was expecting all the bad things that people hated about this movie.You know what.  I went to the movie with an open mind and sat there enjoying this 'terrible' creation.  I don't know about you guys but I don't watch a movie to critic it, I watch to enjoy it.  Yeah, there are movies that are just darn c****y but you just bear it and maybe have a few laughs later.Phantom Menace is definitely a great movie.  Love the special effects.  The plot fits perfectly with the film because it gives you an idea of what is going on and what to expect on the next prequels.  (Plot is not very exciting but definitely better than understanding the DUNE plot).  As for Jar Jar,  couldn't understand half the words 'it' said but definitely not a hinderance with the flow of the movie.I don't know.  I like the movie.  It is and for others will be a great film in the long run.  It's like Star Wars.  You appreciate it more when it get's older.  Like a good bottle of wine...P.S.  the laser combat was the best I seen so far. That phantom menace was one bad dude.",Null,0,1,21 October 1999
