Despicable Me 2," More minions - more fun!
","First of all let me tell you that it is my first review ever so don't judge me =) From the moment I saw Despicable Me I fall in love with the minions. These little yellow fellas are so adorable! I was aching to see the sequel. And the sequel is even better in some parts then the original. They were right to dedicate more time to minions in the movie then Gru. All the people (well, mostly kids but still) went nuts during the scenes with minions. And we were all applauding at the end of the movie. And I think it says something. I can't wait to see it again when it is out on DVD and I strongly recommend it to all the audience no matter what age you are. I would not say anything about the plot - it is quite predictable but still it is very interesting to watch.",10,2,3,6 July 2013
