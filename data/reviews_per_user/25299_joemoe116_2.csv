The Avengers," exceeded my already high expectations
","This review will not contain any spoilers. I want those of you who have not seen The Avengers to have the same experience I had when I saw the film. To put any spoilers in this review would be unfair to those who have not seen The Avengers. You probably wouldn't believe me anyway. I went into this film with very high expectations. Something that has never happened to me before happened when I saw The Avengers. The film exceeded my already high expectations. I remember the very end of the first Iron Man when Samuel L Jackson appeared as Nick Fury, then Robert Downey Jr. appeared as Tony Stark At the end of The Incredible Hulk, Samuel L Jackson was back and Nick Fury in Iron Man 2. . At the very he end of Iron Man 2 we saw Thor's hammer. Samuel L Jackson appeared as Nick Fury in Thor. At the end of Thor we saw Capt. America's shield. In Capt. America Samuel L Jackson played Nick Fury connecting all 5 films featuring 4 of the greatest Marvel comics superheroes of all time. Now Tony Stark Iron Man, {Robert Downey Jr.} ,Captain America Steve Rogers {Chris Evans}, Thor {Chris Hemsworth}, and The Hulk and Bruce Banner {Mark Ruffalo} are together in The Avengers. Nick Fury played by {Samuel L Jackson} brings all these superheroes together along with black Widow agent Romanoff {Scarlett Johansson} and Hawkeye {Jeremy Renner.} I'm in agreement with some of the posters who said that The Avengers is the best comic book adaptation ever made. The script was well written. The cast gave master class performances. No one else could have portrayed these characters other than the actors who played them. I was blown away by the special effects in the film. I became a kid all over again watching this The Avengers. This was an excellent movie. You should do your family and yourself a favor and see The Avengers. I guarantee you will not be bored.",10,5,11,5 May 2012
Django Unchained," A very good movie
","I am a big fan of Quentin Tarantino. I've seen all his movies from Reservoir dogs, True Romance, Pope Fiction, Jackie Brown Kill Bill parts 1 and 2 Death Prof and inglorious bastards. Quinton's dialog, is the best dialog in movies today. He is a master class filmmaker, and he will go down as one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. Last Friday, my sister and I went to see Djingo Unchained. We had a ball watching this masterpiece from Quentin. With the help of Dr. King Schulz played brilliantly by Christophe Waltz Jingo played by Jamie Foxx. A slave turned bounty hunter sets out to rescue his wife played by Kerry Washington from a brutal Mississippi plantation owner played superbly by Leonardo Deception. Samuel L Jackson gives a stellar performance as Steven the uncle Ruckus from the Boondocks inspired house N word. Django Unchained, is a violent, and hilarious spaghetti Western that takes place in the antebellum South during the time of slavery. Django Unchained is not a movie about slavery. I discovered, the harshest critics of the movie haven't seen it. Well, it's their loss. Django Unchained is the best movie of the year. Django Unchained is Quentin Tarantino and his best. Spike Lee needs to stop hating.",Null,2,7,7 January 2013
