Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," funny
",Fav line: Bilo the rapist......naughty naughty! This film is worth a see and has some very funny moments. The ending of the film is a bit of a anti climax as it seems to just run out of steam. I feel that he goes a bit too far when offending people who have invited him into their home in good faith. Where he goes to the southern dinner party he makes the assumption that they're racist without any evidence of it. Sure he gets chucked out when he brings along his 'lady friend' but this is probably due to the fact that it's late and she's unannounced! I also felt that the naked fight went a bit too far perhaps done for simple shock value. I'd go and see this film but it's not the funniest thing I've ever seen.,7,1,6,6 November 2006
