"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," One of the better Rom-Coms out there
","Okay, I don't DO Romantic Comedies. I have an absolute aversion to anything even remotely resembling a love-story with laughs. There are notable exceptions however, 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' being one of them, and now 'Run Fat Boy Run'. For a start, Simon Pegg is in it. As an actor he's hilarious. He manages to play his role with a self-deprecating air with a character that in less skillful hands would have been completely unlikeable. Thandie Newton is also in it, and as usual, she's luminous and turns out a star performance. Hank Azaria pulls a performance out of nowhere. Usually I can't stand him, but in this he's actually funny, and girls, check out those abs! OMG! The best thing about 'Run Fat Boy run' is that, unlike most Romantic Comedies, there is no lag in the middle. It's played for laughs all the way and hilarious throughout. Thank you Mr Schwimmer for restoring my faith in romcoms!",7,1,2,2 September 2008
Lucky Number Slevin," Either very good or very bad
","I just can't make out 'Slevin'. I am in two minds, its either very good or very bad. It's far too clever for its own good and just a little pretentious. Josh Hartnett takes on a great role switching from good to bad guy with ease and Bruce Willis is okayish as an aging hit man. Ben Kingsley and Morgan Freeman are the two bad guys and play their respective roles with relish, Morgan Freeman as a bad guy? Horrors! Stanley Tucci has the sexiest role he's ever played and predictably goes out with a bang. Lucy Liu excels as a sweet female lead, with none of the kick-ass attitude she usually has. The real problem I have with it is that it's so UGLY. The cinematography is gritty and has a retro look to it and the apartments are all decorated in 70's kitsh. Yuk!",5,1,4,7 January 2007
In Bruges," Effing funny!
","'In Bruges' is easily the funniest movie I've seen this year! Brendan Gleeson shines in his role, Colin Farrell is sweetly believable and Ralph Fiennes steals the show. The supporting cast is also outstanding, ably supporting the stars. Bruges is beautiful, a fairy tale town I'd never even had heard of before this movie! The script is a cracker..the dialogue sparkles and the banter between Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell is hilarious! 'In Bruges' is one of those films that demands repeat viewings simply because you're laughing so hard that you might miss the next one-liner. Admittedly, it may be offensive to those of a sensitive dispostition, but if you watch it with an open mind, you'll be surprisingly entertained. My favourite movie of 2008 so far!",10,3,7,18 November 2008
Se7en," Dark and chillingly brilliant
","Se7en takes the tired and clich√©d serial-killer genre and twists it on it's head. Literally. Andrew Kevin Walker wrote a doozy of a script and the acting by a stellar cast is superb. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt match each other scene for scene and Kevin Spacey's performance is nothing short of outstanding. He is chillingly believable as the morally ambiguous serial killer. The only one who disappoints is Gwyneth Paltrow, her character not given much time to develop due to not receiving much screen time. The final scene between the three male leads is electrifying. The cinematography is bleak, raining in almost every scene except the last. The denouement is shattering and leaves one feeling very unsettled. Despite there being little to no violence on- screen, it is extremely dark and chilling. This is a movie that will leave you questioning the morals of the world around you. David Fincher directed a movie that is nothing short of a masterpiece. One that demands multiple viewings.",10,1,2,14 November 2010
Shaun of the Dead," My favourite Rom-Zom-Com ever!
","As far as Romantic Zombie Comedies go, 'Shaun of the Dead' is the best of the genre! What? It's the ONLY one of it's genre? No way! But, that's where 'Shaun of the Dead' excels, it's original. It's audacious. It's HILARIOUS. The funniest zombie movie, intentionally funny, at that. Most Zombie horrors take themselves far too seriously and 'Shaun of the Dead' pokes fun at them every step of the way. The script is an absolute cracker! The cast, not one of them can be faulted, are uniformly excellent. Bill Nighy has great fun in a relatively minor role and adds weight to the film. I saw it, and promptly went out and bought it on DVD, so that I can enjoy it over and over again. The soundtrack is best of British, one scene in particular, with Queen's 'Don't stop me now' is absolutely inspired. A British comedy masterpiece.",9,2,5,2 September 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Overblown and overlong
","Hmmm...I really wanted to enjoy this. I LOVED the first one! Johnny Depp is the coolest pirate in the world and Orli is just gorgeous BUT Keira Knightley is just the most overrated actress on the planet. (Barring Scarlett Johannsen) Dead Mans Chest is just too long and overdone. While it does have some magnificent set-pieces, it's just TOO MUCH! The giant wheel scene goes on and on and on and on and on....... The script is bog-standard and the acting okayish. Bill Nighy steals every scene he's in though. Gotta love him! Having said all that, however, the cinematography is pretty and the effects rather spectacular and everyone looks like they're having a real good time. I hope the third instalment redeems the series.",5,4,6,28 December 2006
Hot Fuzz," Hilarious!!!
","'Hot Fuzz' is hysterical. Simon Pegg once again proves why he's regarded as one of the funniest guys in the UK! As Nicholas Angel, he's a cop-on-a-mission, making the rest of guys in his unit look bad, which Bill Nighy tells him in one of the films funniest scenes. He gets transferred to a village deep in the heart of the English countryside and once he gets there, he proceeds to show the local yokels how it's done. Simon Pegg is hilarious in his role and Nick Frost once again is his able stalwart. Other notables hold their own in 'Hot Fuzz', notably Martin Freeman, Billie Whitelaw, Jim Broadbent and Paddy Considine. It also stars one of the best Bonds, Timothy Dalton, who turns in a wonderful performance as a sleazy bad-guy, 'Hot Fuzz' is worth watching for this character alone!The humour is as dark as it gets and it's not suitable for kiddies, although having said that, my two year old niece managed accidentally to watch parts of it, and giggled delightedly at the sight of two grown men chasing a swan! :)Not to be missed!",9,1,2,2 September 2008
Juno," Pretentious and overrated
","Okay, the acting is good. It's worth seeing only for Alison Janney and JK Simmons' performance as Juno's parents and even the usually dull Jennifer Garner shines, but where Juno fails is that the subject matter is treated very lightly and the character Juno herself takes her predicament far to lightly and finds a solution to her 'problem' extremely easily and without much emotion at all. The script is horrible, peppered with words like 'Dude' and 'like, totally, whatever'. Juno is supposedly so intelligent and yet speaks like a twelve year old and yet wasn't mature enough to have protected sex? Huge plot hole, Miss Cody!!! Diablo Cody did NOT deserve her Oscar. The film is pretentious and extremely overrated.",5,13,21,1 September 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Great fun!
","Okay, it's a mess, it's busy, but oh BOY is it FUN!!! A fitting end to the POTC trilogy, (Hmm, we'll see about that!) 'At Worlds End' sees the gang reunite to fight the East India Company for their freedom. It's a whole lot of fun, the script sparkles and Johnny Depp relishes his role as Captain Jack Sparrow. It's fair to say that he's carried the series. Keith Richards makes a surprise appearance halfway through the movie as Capt Jack's father, and the interaction between them is hilarious. Orlando Bloom's character Will Turner seems to take a back seat to Elizabeth Swann which is a great pity because Miss Knightley is not the world's greatest actress and screeches half of her roles like a fishwife in a market. Geoffrey Rush also has great fun with his role as does Bill Nighy as Davey Jones. The addition of Chow Yun Fat is a good one, he also has great fun in his role. All in all, a fun movie for the family, so long as the kiddies aren't too young as the three hours plus running time may be a little too much for them.",8,4,5,25 June 2007
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Vintage Le Carre brilliantly told!
","No-one does a Spy thriller better than the British and 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' ranks as one of the best. This is vintage Le Carre (A fantastic novel that I waded through in the late 80's) and its themes of class, corruption, moral uncertainty remain intelligently intact. On the other hand, you may struggle to fathom what the bloody hell's going on. This is a film that assumes it's audience has a brain, in fact it almost insists on it. Concentrate and you will be richly rewarded. The script is flawless, the direction faultless, the cinematography is stunning, evoking a murky 1970's London. The cast is absolutely magnificent. Gary Oldman, John Hurt, Colin Firth, Ciarian Hinds, Mark Strong (playing against type), Toby Jones, the delicious Benedict Cumberbatch, Kathy Burke and the gorgeous Tom Hardy. One of the best movies of the decade. 10/10",10,2,5,29 May 2013
Pan's Labyrinth," Horrifying and sublime
","'Pan's Labyrinth' is at turns horrifying and sublime. A dark fantasy tale set at the tail-end of the Spanish Civil war, it involves a young girl Ofelia being drawn into a fantastical world while starkly devastating realities unfold around her. Yes, it IS in Spanish and yes, there ARE subtitles, but don't let that detract you from experiencing what is probably one of the best films of the decade. The effects are sometimes bizarre and it is absolutely not suitable for the kiddies, but anyone with a love for film will appreciate the beauty and intelligence behind Guillermo Del Toro's best to date. An absolute masterpiece!",10,7,14,7 January 2008
Gone Baby Gone," Stunning directorial debut
","'Gone baby gone' is a spectacular directorial debut for Ben Affleck. The story is brilliant, being an adaptation of a novel by Denis Lehane, he of 'Mystic River' fame. The acting is mesmerising, Casey Affleck once again proving he's the better acting sibling. Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman are predictably good and Amy Ryan is simply superb. The story is where the movie scores, the moral ambiguity blurring the lines between what is right, and what is more right. Should he have left the child with caring, loving parents or sent her back to her neglectful, abusive mother? The question is one that leaves the viewer reeling and will provoke many arguments once the movie is seen. Simply brilliant!",8,1,2,9 June 2008
The Last Legion," Really bad
","Essentially a B-movie with a A-list cast who vainly try to acquit themselves well with a mediocre script, Thomas Sangster shining in what is essentially a lead role. Sir Ben Kingsley hams it up effectively in his 'Merlin' role and he and Colin Firth practically phone in their performances, the main detractor being the flawlessly beautiful Ashwairya Rai delivering her lines as if reading from Cue Cards. Miss Rai is a horrible actress, devoid of any emotion.The plot is historically dubious but all these type of movies are, but unless you're a Pre-Medieval History buff, (like yours truly) you're unlikely to know that, and there' s the problem. Hollywood loves to bastardise these stories from other lands, but, heaven FORBID you try it with an American folkloric tale! Sheesh!",4,1,5,7 January 2008
28 Weeks Later," A decent sequel
","28 Weeks Later, the sequel to the Danny Boyle art-house horror cult smash, is decent enough. The first film was, in my opinion, an overlooked classic; it was raw, realistic with a great performance from the yummy Cillian Murphy.28 Weeks Later, starts 28 weeks after the end of the first story, with London having been obliterated by the Zombie infection. Repopulation is underway and two children are brought back to the city to meet their father, played admirably well by Boyle stalwart, Robert Carlyle.Where the movie scores is the cast and the acting, Robert Carlyle is extremely effective in the male lead and Rose Byrne brings up the female lead, ably supported by the rest of the cast.The script is equally good, being more cerebral than the usual 'skop,skiet en donder' than we're used to. The score, as in the first, is fantastic, John Murphy doing a wonderful job of evoking fear and tension There are some truly thrilling moments in the film, some of the highlights being the napalm detonations, and night vision sequence in the subway, the night vision sequence is easily one of the most terrifying moments on film. All in all, '28 Weeks Later' is an excellent follow-up. Bring on '28 Month's later'!",7,2,3,21 January 2008
The Hills Have Eyes," Creepily effective
","'The Hills have eyes' has been remade for the M-TV generation, with lots of in-your-face scares and jumpy moments. The original, if I remember correctly, is a log longer with better characterisation. The beginning is the best bit, with the villains being off-screen, and like 'Jaws', the movie fails when the villain is shown. The make-up effects are laughably bad and the 'baddies' just look silly. HOwever, Emilie de Ravin saves the day with her portrayal and she carries the film. The cinematography is excellent and the bleak landscape adds to the creepy atmosphere. The script is bog-standard for this type of fare but on the whole it's not bad for a night's entertainment if you're not too fussy.",5,0,0,9 July 2007
Little Miss Sunshine," HUGELY overrated!
","Similar in tone to 'Juno', 'Little Miss Sunshine' fails to pull you in, simply because all the characters are so 'quirky'. Barring the work of Michael Gondry and Charlie Kaufman, 'Quirky' is fast becoming a Hollywood by-word for 'crap'. The script is quirky, the acting is quirky, believe me, Alan Arkin must have a WONDERFUL publicist, and the story-line is really, really 'quirky'. Can some-one please remind me why Alan Arkin won the Oscar for 'Supporting Actor'? Jackie Earle Haley in the masterpiece 'Little Children' was far superior to his turn as a 'quirky' Grandad. No Justice! The only good thing about 'Little Miss Sunshine' is The End. I cannot believe that a piece of rubbish like this can be exalted as a 'Best Picture' contender, the Academy was really scraping the bottom of the barrel that year!",3,1,3,2 September 2008
Knowing," Overblown and silly
","'Knowing' gets off to a promising start but deteriorates into silliness at the end. Alex Proyas, who directed the masterful and vastly superior 'I, Robot' gets all ham-fisted with this one. The child actors are like stepford-children, the little girl in particular, one scene not even allowing her to grieve her mothers' death. The adult cast fare no better. Nicholas Cage approaches his role with his usual intensity, which is a pity. He seems to have lost the ability to enjoy himself in a role, especially seeing it's a disaster flick. Where' s John Cusack when you need him? Rose Byrne, of TV's ' Damages', comes off as whiney and shrill. The script is silly, is full of plot-holes and descends into schmaltz and a thinly veiled attempt at Christian propaganda. It is also far too long and may have been improved with tighter editing. May have...but I doubt it.",2,1,6,14 November 2010
Salt," Great fun!
","Regardless of all the negative reviews, I absolutely LOVED this movie! Yes, it's mindless fun but it's a movie for goodness sake! It's supposed to be ENTERTAINING! Angelina excels in her kick-ass role, beating up and killing a ton of people without staining her pristine white shirt. Liev Schrieber, the man with the sexiest voice in Hollywood, is his usual excellent self and one of my favourite men to watch, Chiwetel Egiofor, is also good. The script is bog-standard for this type of fare and won't be winning awards any time soon. Salt is worth watching on a lazy afternoon when you can just check your brain at the door and enjoy it with a good bowl of popcorn. Hugely enjoyable.",8,1,3,27 December 2010
Disturbia," Highly enjoyable
","'Disturbia' is a thoroughly enjoyable thriller. Okay, so it's 'Rear Window' for the MTV generation, but don't let that put you off. The plot is simple, teen loses his father tragically and then predictably goes off the rails.While under house-arrest after an altercation with his Spanish teacher, due to sheer boredom he starts spying on his neighbors and becomes convinced one of them is a serial killer.What raises 'Disturbia' above the average is the acting. Shia LeBoeuf is a wonderful leading man. He is rarely off-screen and when he is, the film suffers. Carrie-Ann Moss and David Morse support ably but LeBoeuf carries the film with an engaging performance.10/10.",7,0,1,25 February 2008
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Epically entertaining!
","Alternative, witty and hip, 'Scott Pilgrim vs the world' is HUGELY entertaining. I snapped it up after reading the blurb on the front, 'From the makers of Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead'. While not quite in the league of the two British comedy classics, Scott Pilgrim has a charm all of it's own. While the too-cool-for school comic effects grate after a while and the Tarantino references become a bit wilted the charm lies in the cast and the acting. Indie darling Michael Cera is a hit in the title role with a fantastic supporting cast including the more talented Culkin sibling Kieran as the gay best-friend. He has some of the best lines in the movie and is absolutely hilarious. The female roles are well fleshed out for this type of movie and the girls kick butt in some of the funniest fight scenes ever. Some well-known faces makes an appearance too, such as Chris Evans (Fantastic Four, Cellular) in a hilarious role as a skate-boarding movie star and Brandon Routh (Superman, Chuck) as a Vegan with super-powers and Clifton Collins jnr (Crank) and Thomas Jane (The Punisher) in one of the films funniest scenes. 'Scott Pilgrim vs the World' is one of my favourite rom-coms ever, right up there with 'Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind'¬Öoddly the leading lady in both of these films have an unusual hair-dye. ;)",8,1,5,17 April 2011
Gone with the Wind," I may be biased, but
","'Gone with the Wind' is a masterpiece. Brilliant acting, superb script with gorgeous, sumptuous cinematography. Vivien Leigh is luminous as Scarlett O'Hara, a spoiled rich brat in every sense of the word. She has zero redeeming features, except for her beauty and fashion sense! Rhett Butler is the epitome of a Southern Gentleman, Olivia de Havilland putting in a wonderful performance as Melanie and Leslie Howard dashing in his role as the man between two girls. There are those that have slammed GOTW for being racist, but for goodness' sake! It's set in the civil war. Slaves were a fact. Are we going to gloss over history and change it because we find it offensive? How silly. Gone with the wind is a wonderful film and should be standard viewing for everyone on the planet.Just as an aside, I'm biased because my mother named me after the girl that got the guy. Melanie.",9,2,3,2 September 2008
No Country for Old Men," Simply outstanding!
","I don't understand the negative reviews 'No Country for old men' has received! Its absolutely riveting, with amazing performances all-round. The script is predictably good. (It is the Coen's, after all!) The cinematography is bleak and suits the sparse plot-line but the sound, Oh God, the sound!!! With absolutely zero soundtrack, the sound is easily the best thing of 'No country for old men'. I could close my eyes and just listen to the story unfold through the sound-effects. Everything is crisp and heightened, the wind on the plains in the beginning, the guns being cocked and the air-rifle providing the films' most intense moments. Javier Bardem carries the film with easily the scariest villain on screen since Peter Lorre in 'M'. He simply oozes menace and one is left feeling slightly unsettled by the fact that you simply cannot help being drawn in by him. I cannot stress enough how GOOD this film is. If you haven't seen it yet, you simply have to!",10,3,5,18 August 2008
2012," a roller-coaster ride of a movie!
","2012 is one of the most fun movies I've seen in a long time. My four year old niece adores it, screeching at the screen for the characters to 'GO, GO, GO!' The movie is filled with moments like this, which makes it very exciting and exhilarating. Suspend belief and you will enjoy it. Start thinking and questioning the science behind it and you wont. The acting is standard for a disaster movie, the only stand-outs being John Cusack and Chiwetel Edjiofor, who relish their respective roles and have a great time with them. All in all, highly entertaining with several laugh out moments. Highly recommended for a rainy Sunday afternoon.",7,1,6,11 April 2010
The Dark Knight," Exciting and exhilarating!
","Okay, so it's # 3 on the IMDb's top 250. Quite frankly, I'm shocked by that. I mean, it's good, but not THAT good. Methinks the Hype of Heath added to that score, but no matter. 'The Dark Knight' is excitingly good. The acting is terrific, Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Aaron Eckhart, all excel in their respective parts but two cast members stand out. 1. Heath Ledger: hype aside, he is scarily convincing and possibly the best Batman Villain to date. 2. Maggie Gyllenhaal: takes over the Rachel Dawson role and makes it her own. Bye-bye insipid Katie Holmes, Hello Ms Gyllenhaal. Finally, a real actress as a superhero's love interest. It is a tad too long, but has wonderful set pieces that keeps one riveted to the screen. All in all, a good afternoon's entertainment, but number 3???? Maybe not.",7,2,10,2 September 2008
Green Street Hooligans," Bye-bye Frodo!
","Elijah Wood excels in this unassuming little film set in the world of Football Hooliganism. He successfully throws off the mantle of Frodo in this movie, ain't nothing hobbity about this character!! He plays a Harvard student unjustly accused who then goes to England to avoid going home instead and becomes involved with Charlie Hummam's (yummy!) character and the insane world of Football hooligans. The American quickly becomes attuned to the fighting and camaraderie involved and too late realises his mistake before facing tragedy and personal triumph. The script is brilliant and the score...haunting. The use of Terence Jay's 'One Blood' in a key scene is tragically apt. I can thoroughly recommend it.",9,0,0,7 May 2007
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Original and Audacious!
","In a word - Brilliant. Michael Gondry has served up a masterpiece with 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind', which has become one of my favourite love-stories of all time. The story is completely original, not adhering to the normal (yawn) boy-meets-girl formula. The plot line is audacious, the script nothing short of brilliance. Mr Gondry assumes that his audience has a brain and unlike contemporary rom-coms doesn't insult his audience with a formulaic ending either! Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet carry the film, Ms Winslet in particular shining in her role as Clementine, which must surely rate as one of films most endearing female characters of all time. Similarly the supporting cast are excellent, Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood and Tom Wilkinson all shining in their respective roles. A must-see!",9,0,3,2 September 2008
Grindhouse," Sheer bloody fun!
","'Planet Terror' is pure, unadulterated, fun! An adrenaline fun-ride of a film! I don't know why South Africa chose to split the 'Grindhouse' on release, but I'm glad they did. 'Deathproof' just doesn't compare to 'Planet Terror'. While Tarantino got bogged down in dialogue, 'Planet Terror' is low on talking, but high on action! From Josh Brolin's psychotic doctor to Naveen Andrew's Psycho scientist to Rose McGowan's go-go dancer,the characters are all unique and crazy-cool. The only drawback to the film is when the little boy shoots himself. Its unsettling and just a little unnecessary, in my view, but that aside, you can't go wrong with 'Planet Terror'. It's a check-your-brain at the door kind of movie but delivers a punch that few other horror movies have done recently.",8,2,4,18 August 2008
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," Beautifully made
","A lovely albeit tragic story told in the best possible way, 'The Wind that shakes the Barley' is a an excellent historical film. Cillian Murphy excels in his portrayal as a man caught up in events well beyond his control. As anyone with a love of Irish music knows, the title 'The Wind that shakes the Barley' is a song about a rebel who sacrifices his love for his cause, and that's exactly what Damian (Cillian Murphy) does. At the outset,he's apathetic to the cause wanting more to go to Medical School than to get involved in fighting that he sees as pointless. As events unfold he becomes more involved and indeed, becomes one of the ringleaders and is ultimately doomed by his unstinting support and involvement. Cillian Murphy is one of those actors you can't help but watch, bringing an intensity to the role. The supporting cast matches him admirably and the story pulls you in. The British are unsympathetically shown, which is a pity, seeing as most of the soldiers sent to Ireland were merely boys and were only there to follow orders. Many of them fell in love with Ireland and the Irish and more than one baby were born of British soldiers during the occupation.",7,4,8,9 July 2007
Zombieland," trailer-trash version of shaun of the dead
","A less intelligent version of Shaun of the Dead, Zombieland is nevertheless mildly entertaining. Woody Harrellson has a great time with his role and Abigail Breslin once again proves that she's the most talented actor of her generation. Where the film fails though is it's gore factor. It's squeamishly violent, unnecesarily so and the scene in a native American shop is offensive and crude. Comparisons to the vastly superior Shaun of the Dead are unavoidable and Zombieland lags in the middle becoming a zombie-road-trip which is boring. Zombieland does have a few laugh-out- loud moments though and Bill Murray an hilarious cameo!",5,2,6,17 April 2010
The Departed," Jack's BACK!
","'The Departed' is by far my favourite film of 2006! It's absolutely brilliant. It marks a return to form for Jack Nicholson, too long has he languished in rom-com hell! Jack's Back! Boy, is he EVER! With by far the best lines of the movie and he delivers them with such relish. But it's by no means Jack's movie, Departed is strictly an ensemble piece. Leonardo Di Caprio is captivating, putting in an anguished, haunted performance of a tragic figure. Matt Damon puts in his best performance since 'Talented Mr Ripley', with a character that is completely immoral and self-serving it is easy to loathe him. Even Jack Nicholson, the villain of the piece, is more sympathetic than Matt Damon's character. Mark Wahlberg has a ball with his character delivering his lines with aplomb and even Martin Sheen puts in a stellar performance. Vera Farmiga, easily recognisable from 'The Manchurian Candidate', puts in a good performance of the female lead. (Lucky girl, getting to kiss both Matt and Leo!!!) The Script is excellent, the accents impeccable and the soundtrack, Oh man, the SOUNDTRACK!! Brilliant! The Dropkick Murphys are a perfect accompaniment to all the Irish gangsters. All in all, Marty Scorsese delivers what is his best since 'Goodfellas'. If he doesn't get an Oscar Nod for this then there is no justice in the world!",10,1,3,27 December 2006
The Holiday," Vile and waste-of-time
","Now, okay, I'm not a fan of the romcom, but THIS is one of the worst example of the genre. 'The Holiday' has everything that I hate about the romcom: Irritating submissive female characters - check. One-dimensional male characters - check lack of script - check cutesy kids and/or animals: check to BOTH!!The Holiday even manages to throw some Christmas schmaltz into it as well,leaving one feeling slightly nauseous. Cameron Diaz overacts in every scene, Jack Black tries hard to break out of his 'cute but funny guy' shtick and Jude Law and Kate Winslet are left with one-dimensional characters that are hardly sympathetic.The only character that stands out is Eli Wallach's. Really, I think Mr Wallach thought he was in another film entirely.A complete waste of time and money.",3,3,7,16 April 2007
There Will Be Blood," Terrifyingly good!
","'There Will be Blood' is one of the best films to come out of Hollywood recently. PT Anderson, who served up such delicious offerings as 'Boogie Nights' and 'Magnolia' once again delivers a tour-de-force. The storyline follows US Oilmen in the 1890's, although nothing we saw in 'Dallas' and 'Dynasty' in the 80's prepared us for THESE oilmen! In a harsh landscape, people scrabbled to make a living and if you had an iota of business acumen and the penchant to use others for your own gain, you went far. (This is how I understood the storyline!) Daniel Day Lewis is scarily good in the main role, veering between showy salesman and brutal taskmaster, he delivers one of the scariest characters seen on screen recently. Paul Dano, in his preacher role, matches Day-Lewis scene for scene, which is surprising for one so young. I'm inclined to say that Mr Dano was robbed of an Oscar nom. The only detraction is the soundtrack, which is a bit of a distraction with such a good storyline, but thats a minor quibble in what is essentially a modern masterpiece!",8,1,3,18 August 2008
Man on Fire," Washington on top form!
","This is simply put, Denzil Washington's finest film to date. He puts in a searing performance as Creasey, an assassin turned Body-Guard who's emotionally and psychologically damaged and who finds redemption in an eight-year old girl, portrayed by the brilliant Dakota Fanning who is the most talented actress of her generation. Her character Pita is the human heart of the film and one is left genuinely shocked when you think her character is killed off.Radha Mitchell and Marc Anthony portray parents caught in a terrifying situation and until the denouement one is filled with pity for them. Radha Mitchell, easily recognisable from 'Pitch Black', puts in a good performance as a grieving mother and Marc Antony is surprisingly good in his role. The supporting cast is filled out by Christopher Walken and Mickey Rourke, and in this case one is left guessing as to who the villain will turn out to be. (Surprise!) The film is extremely violent and is filled with disturbing images not suited to sensitive viewers or kids. Tony Scott's direction is tight and the use of sub-titles is highly effective. The cinematography is excellent, employing the same grainy look used to great effect in 'Traffic'.",9,1,2,29 March 2005
The Last King of Scotland," Sheer brilliance!
",": A tour-de-force of a movie! Forest Whitakker simply astounds with his performance of Ugandan dictator Idi Amin. He is - in a word - breathtaking. Very rarely does the academy get it right but boy, did they ever! There aren't enough words to describe the performance Mr Forest puts in. He actually becomes Idi Amin, not only does his voice change but so does his stance. He goes from a cuddly bear to terrifying despot in the space of one scene! Brilliant. The rest of the cast acquits themselves just as well, James McEvoy matching him scene for scene and Gillian Anderson (of TV's X-Files fame) virtually unrecognisable as the wife of a British doctor. Kerry Washington is the only member of the cast that disappoints,her accent being all over the place but she isn't given enough screen time for this to become a problem. The script simply crackles with dialogue and the cinematography is excellent. The only (minor) quibble is that the massacre of 300 000 people is only alluded to, but perhaps we didn't need to see it on screen, there being enough violence and gore to keep even the most bloodthirsty fan happy. 'Last King of Scotland' won't appeal to everyone, but it IS a must see. My favourite movie of the year so far. My rating: 10/10 (This happens very rarely!)",10,2,4,11 June 2007
The Blind Side," Boring and offensive
","Simplistic, naive, offensive and overlong. The Blind Side offends on so many levels. It's supposed to be about Big Mike Oher who drags himself out of the ghetto and goes on to be a star football player but instead it's about the benevolent White Christian Republican family who takes him in and makes it all happen. Wow. Good on the christians and good on the republicans. Not. The Christian aspect is rammed home at every opportunity and after an hour, begins to grate. The script is peppered with clich√©s and some of the scenes badly judged. The film is so manipulative and what Sandra Bullock won the Academy Award for, I'll never know. She plays basically the same part she has in previous films. What was the Academy thinking?",3,8,14,17 July 2010
Never Back Down," A teen version of Fight Club
","'Never back down' is a movie we've all seen a million times before. This one fails to veer from the formula of 'Karate Kid' and a slew of wanna-be's. Sean Faris headlines and is faintly reminiscent of a young Tom Cruise. His co-stars are Cam Gigandet, a muscled (yum!) Blonde guy who steals the show and Djimon Honsou who is the only actor allowed more than a one-dimensional character. Maybe he's just the better actor. The script is clich√©d and the dialogue clunky. The movie only comes alive during the fight sequences which should satisfy any action lover and the girls are gorgeous. Essentially this is a teen version of 'Fight Club' for the MTV generation, but it's okay, if you're not too discerning. Just don't expect any real acting.",5,1,4,13 October 2008
Shrek," Quality entertainment
","An excellent comedy, entertaining for kids and adults alike. There are those who have criticized 'Shrek' and its sequels for it's crude humour, but that, to me, is where 'Shrek' scores. Adults can enjoy the 'adult' humour while kids will just take in the visuals and enjoy the slight story as well as take in the moral of the story, which is, you can only be yourself and people will like you anyway. The joy in Shrek is not only the visuals though, but in the script and acting. Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz and John Lithgow are having fun with their roles! They clearly sounded as if they were enjoying theirselves here. Cameron Diaz, in particular, who in other movies just grates, makes a perfect anti-hero princess. John Lithgow has a great old time with his Lord Farquaad,and the sly references to Disney make this a perfect antidote to all those cutesey-pie kiddies movies we've been inflicted on in the past!",9,0,1,20 August 2008
Casino Royale," Best Bond, in the world, EVER!
","'Casino Royale' has to be the best Bond movie ever, starring the BEST BOND ever! Daniel Craig is outstanding as Bond, silencing all the naysayers. He lends Bond depth and character. It's so refreshing having a real actor portray the super-spy. Mr Craig makes Bond seem real, with actual flaws and emotions. Brilliant! The Bond Girls are the only let-down, Eva Green is UGLY and Caterina Murino an AWFUL actress, but this is the only flaw that the movie has and I'm willing to forgive, mainly because of Daniel Craig's performance and the appearance of Jeffrey Wright, one of my favourite actors. Well done to the producers too, for taking the Bond Theme song back to Britain, where it belongs. Chris Cornell has written a great lyrics to 'You know my name'. Fabulous.",9,0,2,28 December 2006
RED," A great time had by all!
","'Red' is great fun. It's one of those movies, like the Oceans trilogy, where the cast has such a great time filming that it translates onto the screen and you can' t help having a good time with them. That's not to say they have a great time without actually working. The acting is outstanding, even Bruce Willis excels in this one. (Mainly because he's bald¬Ö I have a theory on this) Helen Mirren, John Malkovich, Morgan Freeman, Brian Cox and Mary Stuart Masterson (who steals all the scenes she's in) are all uniformly excellent (Well, they would be, woudn't they?) and the supporting cast is magnificent, including Rebecca Pigeon, Karl Urban, Julian McMahon, Ernest Borgnine (He must be in his eighties by now, surely?) and an hilarious Richard Drefyss. Really, you can't go wrong with this one. There's a love story for the romantics, lots of action for the boys and funny without veering into silliness",8,1,1,18 April 2011
Donnie Darko," Weird and Wonderful!
","'Donnie Darko' is simply one of strangest little films I have ever seen and may just be my new favourite of all time! Jake Gyllenhaal is simply AMAZING in the title role. His range is simply astounding and is one of the most talented young actors of his generation. He is admirably supported by an able cast, including his sister Maggie, which was a master stroke in casting as it lends an authentic air of continuity. The chemistry between Gyllenhaal and Jena Malone is equally impressive. But it is the plot and script which astounded me, the dialogue is astounding and the twist, when it arrives, is audacious and mind-blowing. It is a film which demands multiple viewings.",10,0,1,12 January 2005
Shark Tale," Underwater Wise Guys!
","'Shark Tale' is an absolute gem! With a fabulous cast that includes Will Smith, Robert De Niro, Martin Scorsese (whoever thought he could be funny?), Angelina Jolie (even sexy as a fish!), Jack Black and Renee Zellweger this has huge entertainment value. The script sparkles with witty Will Smith one-liners, Robert De Niro effectively sends up his 'Godfather' characters and has a laugh at his own expense and Ziggy Marley and Doug E Doug steal the show as two Rastafarian Jelly Fish. Kiddies may not understand all the references to other movies, notably 'The Godfather' and 'Wiseguys' although 'The Sopranos' and 'Gladiator' are also parodied and they will definitely not understand the subtleties of Lenny 'coming out' to his father about his secret lifestyle but these add to the entertainment for adults. What will appeal to kids is the bright animation and the perfectly adorable supporting cast, including an army of kamikaze shrimp and the whales at the 'whale wash'. All in all, 'Shark Tale' is perfect family entertainment!",10,2,4,22 March 2005
