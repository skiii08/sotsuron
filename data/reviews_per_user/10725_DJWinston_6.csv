Hereditary," To what end?
","Yeah, we get the obvious theme of the film before it starts from its blatant title, and then as if we weren't beaten over the head with 'passing down' theme throughout the film, we get it as a closer in the most obvious final credits sequence with the 'hereditary' letters dropping down from one credit to the next. Good lord. Didn't anyone see that final credit sequence and say 'No, let's not beat a dead horse.'?Some interesting moments to be sure, but I didn't find this one all that frightening or all that interesting. Yes, mental illness can be and often is passed down. So? Tell me something I don't know about that situation.And although Toni Collette is one of my favorite actors, not one of her better performances in this one.",3,1,6,7 July 2019
Rocketman," A musical reverie that works!
","Not your traditional paint-by-numbers biopic, but instead Rocketman is a beautiful flight of the imagination that hits at the emotional heart of its subject in all its vagaries, and is both affecting and insightful. I loved every minute of the reverie. All of the actors do top-quality work (god I love Jamie Bell -- catch him in Nicholas Nickleby sometime) so you feel the episodes onscreen as opposed to just observing them.If you've never heard of Elton John or if you hate musicals where people burst into song, stay home. Everyone else, GO!",10,8,16,8 June 2019
"I, Tonya"," Make up your mind! What kind of movie are you making?
","What kind of movie was this supposed to be? Because it bounced back and forth between dead-on realism (Rawlinson) and raw violence (domestic and parental) to satire? (Harding's interview recreations) and absurdist comedy (Eckardt - good lord!) to the point where I just didn't know what the filmmaker(s) were trying to accomplish. I learned nothing new about Harding's story here, so maybe my POV on the story was the target? If so, you need to pick a tone and stick to it. Because I felt continually jerked around, I came out of this movie within antagonism toward the whole enterprise and sympathy for none.And as for the acting, I personally thought Robbie was terribly miscast as Harding---didn't believe her for a moment, and Janney, while competent and entertaining, can play this type of supporting role in her sleep and did nothing here to convince me otherwise.I just ended up feeling that maybe this movie was better suited for the Lifetime TV channel--although even there a couple of reality TV documentaries have told the same story in a more interesting manner.",3,42,92,31 December 2017
Bohemian Rhapsody," 'The Canonization of Queen'
","That should have been the title of this fawning homage to the other band members of Queen. Apparently the three of them were saintlier than Mother Teresa with the patience and understanding and good will of all the saints put together. And newsflash, touring rock bands in the 1980s did not behave like the heavenly host.Could have been a layered and fascinating movie about actual human beings, but instead we get this self-righteous claptrap of someone's idealized version of what went on. I suspect even Freddie would have been embarrassed by this band 'bio'.",4,2,7,13 January 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," It has to be more
","It has to be more than a fairy tale. It has to be more than an homage to Hollywood Gone By. It has to be more than filled with beautiful shots that take us back to days gone by. All this was there excellently, but without human beings and a human story (or stories) to draw us in and make us care, it all ends up just so . . . . cold. Until we get to the ratched-up ending which, although it certainly makes us sit up and take notice, I don't know to what end. Yeah, I wish that final episode had turned out your way too in August of 1969. But so what? It didn't. The switchup may be cathartic for Tarantino 50 years later (like the scalping in that other one), but it wasn't for me. Just didn't make me care about anybody or anything in this movie. And that's my era.Well, maybe the clips from the old TV shows got to me a little.",5,2,4,1 August 2019
Da 5 Bloods," A Spike Lee Disjoint
","Much as I admire Spike Lee's talent and audacity, this film just didn't work for me. Too many preposterous plot points while the motivations (of everyone, it seemed) were never clear. The whole thing was just confusing.And yes, disjointed.",4,260,370,13 June 2020
