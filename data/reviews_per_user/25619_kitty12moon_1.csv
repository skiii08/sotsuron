The Blair Witch Project," it was awful!!! it lies about what witches are about. i hated it.
",it was awful and it is accusing witches of being evil. it lies and should be banned. for witches have a law that they ALL abide by and it is 'An it harm none do what tho wilt' which means do what u want but don't hurt anyone. if any one sees this film i encourage them to burn it with its lies! my friend saw it and was traumatized and now stick figures scare him! see what this movie has done! now if you believe anything you see you are not seeing truth your seeing what is called a hoax. and if you are wondering who killed that guy it was probably some psychopath either living out their or following them. i hope no one will believe what they see because Hollywood does sometimes stretch the truth or lie because they want viewers and they don't think people would like to see the truth.,Null,0,1,26 October 2004
