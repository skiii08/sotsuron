The Avengers," Another above average superhero team-up movie
","Just saw this movie yesterday at a local cinema, and I was only mildly entertained after seeing it.To be honest, I was quite disappointed not to see Edward Norton reprising his role as Dr. Bruce Banner in this movie but after watching Mark Ruffalo's satisfying performance as the emotional and impulsive alter ego of the withdrawn and reserved physicist, I was pleased with the end result of Hulk's casting.Overall, I felt that it achieved its purpose as a fun-filled, action- packed, witty superhero-themed movie. Kudos to director and writer Joss Whedon for a well-balanced character development among all the heroes, giving each of them their deserved screen time.On the downside, the jokes and witty banters among the superheroes didn't bode well with me personally because I felt that it was mostly out of place and tiring to see Tony Stark with his usual 'I-am-Iron-Man- and-I-can-say-something-smart-and-you-will-laugh' routine. The movie also failed to properly address the consequences of such a huge number of superheroes, destroying many buildings and lives of ordinary civilians, in their quest for battling evil like it's DC rival's 'The Dark Knight' (a benchmark I've set for all superhero movies) did back in 2008. Not to mention the first 30 minutes of the movie was quite a drag and not enough to maintain the attention of an average movie-goer. Also, the inclusion of a weak villain like Loki and a new race of Chitauri aliens unsuccessfully made the plot more interesting as it is evident that even Thor or Hulk could easily defeat Loki in a match.Ultimately, the movie was quite forgettable with its main role as a summer movie blockbuster typecast.",6,3,13,4 May 2012
