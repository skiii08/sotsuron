50 First Dates," Wow.
","This movie is such a good vibe! Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore perfectly work as a couple. No other movie has a similar plot or deals with these kind of matters! I would describe it as new, refreshing and hilarious",10,1,1,20 September 2019
Easy A," just demential
","I hated this movie. the plot doesn't make any sense and it's not even funny. I gave 2 stars only because I love Lisa Kudrow and I was happy to see her but at the same time I was so sorry to see her in a movie like this, she's worth so much more.",2,2,3,25 March 2019
