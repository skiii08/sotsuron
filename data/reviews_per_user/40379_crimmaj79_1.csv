Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Terrible, Chacters wooden and over played, story makes no sense
","This movie was terrible.The story was completely different form the book,and as a stand alone movie was quite awful.My wife who never even read the book said this movie was terrible.The only reason we didn't walk out is because I really wanted to see if the movie would end like the book. The book ending was really quite good, the movie end was stupid. I was given Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter the novel on CD by a friend. It was surprisingly good for a novel about an ax wielding president killing vampires in his spare time. The thing that made the novel so good was how careful Seth Graham Smith was to keep everything historically accurate. People dates places were very accurate in the book with some liberties of course. This movie, however did not even try to link the story line to any real history. The characters in this film felt very wooden and over played;Kind of like one of those lawn silhouettes painted fluorescent orange,not a pretty sight. The key events in this movie are rearranged from the book to make way for big holly wood stunts that seem very unnecessary and make little sense to history, or the original story. The movie went away from everything great about the book and made the whole idea of Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter as hooky as it sounds. Do yourself a favor and get the book on CD and skip this movie. You will enjoy the story a whole lot more.",1,10,22,23 June 2012
