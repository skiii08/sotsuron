Antz," Really zany
","This isn't disney but it is so zany and hialarious it WILL tie you in stitches. It is family entertainment woody allen style and closely resembles the simpsons. This is disney for baby boomers. I am 15 and I was dying of laughter but my dad who took more things  to heart and laughed even harder than me. He particularly laughed at a 'peace protest' by the ants singing 'give Z a chance' (give peace a chance)  Really funny and different stuff, complete with the best animation I have ever seen make this a real joy to watch",10,0,0,10 October 1998
Schindler's List," Most Harrowing film experience of all time.
",'Schindler's List' is the single most harrowing film of all time. It makes you feel ashamed to be a human.Excellent. A masterpiece. If there is one thing that is negative about this movie it is I will never be able to see it for the first time!,10,10,17,11 August 1998
