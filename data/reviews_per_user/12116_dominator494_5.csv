Casablanca," Casablanca
","Casablanca directed by Micheal Curtiz is certainly one of the best films of the 20th century and perhaps of all time. Casablanca takes place in a Vichy controlled part of Africa during the early years of WW2. Rick, the main character is played by Humphrey Bogart, who knocked the role out of the part with this ground breaking performance. Rick is sort tough guy who owns Ricks Cafe Americaine, he eventually runs into an old lover named Ilsa played by Ingrid Bergman. Bergman left him heart broken in Paris and now is asking for his help. Casablanca is one of the greatest romance films of all time, the acting of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman were astounding. The movie caught many by surprise because it was not a highly anticipated film, and did not really have a huge budget, however the acting and story makes Casablanca a Hollywood perfection.",Null,0,2,11 March 2015
Citizen Kane," citizen kane
","Citizen Kane is a masterpiece of a film for its artistic aspects as well as its story. The story in short, is about a group of reporters trying to find out what Charles Foster Kane's last word were. This film was directed by Orson Welles and was his first film. throughout the film Welles had a lot of power over the movie, he was given full artistic freedom over the film. Charles Foster the main character is said to have been a portrayal of an actual newspaper journalist William Randolf Hurst, which was another reason the film stirred a little controversy. The film is also said to be way ahead of its time when it comes cinematography, Welles utilized many low angle shots, extreme close ups and long uninterrupted shots.",Null,1,3,18 March 2015
Patton," patton
","Patton was directed by Franklin Schaffner and was released in 1970. It is wonderful film, and not to mention very long. George C. Scott played a knockout role as General Patton. The story does an excellent job in taking us through General Pattons campaign and portraying his gungho tough guy personality. The film begins in North Africa and goes through his campaign all the up to Europe. Patton was a defining film for Scott, the cinematography and shots of portraying north Africa were brilliant. This film was quite significant at the time because America was in the thick of the Vietnam war, so this film really created a sense of patriotism and what better way to instill patriotism than making a film about George Patton a rough tough red blooded America that stop at nothing to achieve full victory. overall I give Patton an 8.5/10.",Null,0,0,21 April 2015
Singin' in the Rain," singin in the rain
","Singin In The Rain directed by Gene Kelley and Stanley Donen is an excellent musical. Firstly, I must say that I am not Particularly a fan of musicals, However this film greatly exceeded my expectations. I was expecting constant singing throughout the film but this was not the case. The film actually has an extremely well written script. I would say this musical is way better than the Sound of Music. The films cinematography is uncanny, the choreography by the actors is stupendous and very impressive especially with the long takes during the tap dances. The film is also quite humorous and the acting by Don Lockwood and Cosmo Brown was excellent, the two actors complimented each other very well in the tap dancing scenes and overall had great chemistry throughout the movie. overall I give this movie a 9/10",Null,0,1,7 April 2015
Psycho," great film
",Psycho directed by Alfred Hitchcock is an excellent film. I would consider it scary even compared to today's horror films. The keeps you thinking and has an awesome plot twist at the end that leaves you in awe at how well the script was written. Tony Perkins and Janet Leigh both played outstanding roles. The score and cinematography are both excellent. Hitchcock used some interesting shots such as the close up of the man falling down the stairs. Psycho is also known for its famous shower murder scene in the beginning that included the famous shrieking sound effect of horror films. Overall I give Psycho an 8/10 for its plot as well as its incredible acting.,Null,1,2,1 April 2015
