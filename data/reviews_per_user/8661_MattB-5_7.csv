The Blair Witch Project," The antidote for Lucas, Spielberg, and CGI
","Not as scary as I expected, but you gotta love a movie like this while Hollywood is either re-making old movies poorly, making feature movies out of lame TV shows, or dumping millions into special effects. I hope some day soon the fat cats like Lucas and Spielberg who haven't had an original thought in 20 years will stop getting all the hype and movies like this that are original and interesting will be a priority in Hollywood.",5,1,1,2 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," I was rooting for the Evil Empire....
","Never saw the first two installments (star wars, empire) and after watching this movie, I have no desire to ever see the first two. Let me get this straight, a bunch of cute, cuddly teddy bears beat the Evil Empire by hitting them with logs?...er...sorry, that doesn't pass the sniff test.Why in hell did they sell out and go for a Disney type of ending?. I thought Star Wars was supposed to be 'cool'. Even all the dead people came back for the (apparent) cast party at the end. Could they be any more manipulative?. And thanks to the producers for implanting that damn eewok song in my brain, I have not been able to get it out of me head for years, it is driving me mad.",4,9,20,7 April 1999
Forrest Gump," This one ain't going to age well...
","I don't get it. Not a bad movie, but I must have missed something, I do not understand why all the hype or why it is considered a 'great' movie. The emperor has no clothes. A couple of laughs, I guess a nice message about living a life with quiet dignity, and a bunch of absurd and nonsensical stuff thrown in for no apparent reason. Interesting when shining a light on the destructive, hypocritical, and hedonistic underside of the 60's movements, should have kept it going instead of getting too silly.",4,2,4,7 April 1999
Armageddon," Beats the hell out of 'Independence Day'
","Didn't expect anything out of it, but somehow got drawn into it despite flaws, it kept my attention. Not great, but somehow entertaining. Probably due to good and quirky action movie character actors. Only things that made me sick were the Liv Tyler character and the embarrassingly bad Aerosmith song at the end of an otherwise good soundtrack. >",8,1,1,15 July 1999
The Godfather: Part III," Atrocious
","So bad that it tarnishes the whole series. Seems like a rip off of the previous two, as if some other film maker had tried to copy Coppola's style. Cliche-ridden, poor story, poor acting, passionless film-making, uses the same dramatic devices and dialog of first 2 movies, complete lack of originality, a movie that should not have been made, Coppola's cupboard is bare. He over-mined this theme.",1,31,55,7 January 1999
The Green Mile," Heavy handed
","Made with little subtlety, grace, or wit, suffers from the same disease as Shawshank in seeking profundity in every vignette. Whereas I could overlook some of the preposterous and contrived situations in Shawshank and just enjoy the movie, the Green Mile just seemed contrived except for a few scenes and characters. Of course it has redeeming qualities about it, namely Duncan's performance and the gripping execution scenes.
I like Shawshank alot despite its flaws, however The Green Mile is just plain mediocre, not one I would ever want to sit through again. It could have been a decent 90 minute movie. The far too long and frequent mouse vignettes detracted and cost the movie momentum, there is no need to show a guy pee 10 times in the movie, we understand that it hurts when he pees, enough already!. The evil prison guard was just far too simple and one-dimensional a character to the point of absurdity which eliminates the impact of his comeupance at the end, contrast this with the very satisfying end to Shawshank's prison warden (a far more interesting, faceted, and believable character). The end was diluted as well, I think the movie went a scene too far at the end into some fuzzy preaching, as a viewer it really wasn't necessary, the impact of Duncan's end on the Hanks character and the viewer is strong and moving and the movie should have ended there instead of having a scene to explain to the audience (as if to a slow fifth-grader) the truth of the moment.",1,18,59,5 January 2001
The Shawshank Redemption," Morgan Freeman is the only great thing in this movie
","Satisfying, good movie, but the only great part of this movie is the magnificent performance by Morgan Freeman. An apparently inspired Tim Robbins rises above his very mediocre talent and delivers an adequate performance. Ham-handed attempts at profundity in every scene get tiring as is the use of every prison movie device, character, and cliche in the history of hollywood.",3,3,10,29 August 1999
