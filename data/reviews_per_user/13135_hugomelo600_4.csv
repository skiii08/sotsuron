Skyfall," Silly, Overblown, Dumb and Boring.
","Silly, Overblown, Dumb and Boring. That's how I would describe this movie in four words. I can't understand how this movie got such positive reviews. The direction was OK and some of the performances great (mostly Bardem's). However the backbone of a movie his it's screenplay and that's were the movie falls completely apart. The screenplay was a mess: the characters dialogues and banter were trite and clich√©d, the plot was overblown and idiotic and the character's decisions and actions made little to no sense. The only positive points of the movie were Bardem and Fienes, who gave terrific performances (altough the latter didn't have much to do throughout the movie anyway) and most of all Roger Deakins, whose photography was gorgeous as always. Everything else in the movie was fair to mediocre. SPOILERS: Craig's Bond in this movie achieves a all new level of stupidity that kept me wondering on on earth this guy is still alive. Every decision he made was dumb beyond belief. Who would shoot against an airborne war helicopter with an automatic from a window of a old manor? Why didn't he shoot the villain when he was on his way to kill M and still allowed him to press the radio that caused a subway to be rammed against him? Those are just two of the many idiotic decisions that Bond made during the film, not to mention the biggest one of all: taking M to a secluded old manor without any manpower and virtually no weapons. That makes perfect sense! Also, in the end he fails his mission, breaching protocol while doing so and Mallory still reinstates him.",5,9,19,7 December 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," A very enjoyable journey back to Middle Earth, even if somewhat smaller in scope.
","Peter Jackson's new journey into Middle Earth is an extremely entertaining and well constructed movie. It is not, of course, up to the impossible high standard that The Lord Of The Rings set for Jackson, but it is, on all accounts, a very good fantasy and adventure movie. The movie got critizised for it's deliberate leisured pace. Although I agree that some of the movie's scenes are not essencial and could very well be truncated without disrupting the narrative, the fact remains that these scenes, although not essencial to the plot, are not boring or uninteresting. The movie has considerable length but it never gets tiresome. Of course the novelty is somewhat gone to the point where at certain moments you can predict what course of action certain characters will take to advert tragedy .But despite that, the movie never gets boring and will certainly keep most viewers riveted throughout the movie due to it's well placed humor, beautiful imagery, visual effects, fleshed-out world and cameos of Middle Earth inhabitants that have been introduced to us in 'The Lord Of The Rings'. The movie, if approached on it's own terms and not subjected to comparison to it's counterpart, stands scrutiny with great ease. Or it should, but apparently the critics failed to evaluate it fairly, considering the average tomatometer rating. How this movie gets an average of 65 per cent and the childish, cartoonish, terribly scripted Sklyfall is over 90 per cent is beyond my grasp.",8,4,12,27 December 2012
Prometheus," A Misunderstood Future Classic.
","Prometheus is an intelligent, amazing, visually arresting and thrilling film. A science fiction masterpiece who I believe will suffer the same fate as Blade Runner - heralded as a brilliant film in the future despite being dished by many presently. The story is amazing, the characters are interesting, the suspense and revelations are build perfectly. The movie is very influenced by Lovecraft, in particular his story 'At The Mountains Of Madness' and it is clear that that is intended considering the massive wink towards the end when a 'Cthullu like' alien makes an appearance. The film has been very criticized and from my perspective, unfairly so; to be quite frank a lot of the critiques were very inaccurate and many times it was clear that a lot of people just didn't understand much of the plot. Much is said about supposed plot holes, but it all comes down to one thing: many didn't understand the movie because many did not figure out the reason the engineers created men. Once that reason is figured out (and there are many clues in the film that enable us to conclude as to what that reason is) the movie makes absolute sense. Many accused the characters of acting in a random fashion. That is completely false. There is a reason for the character's actions and many feel there are not because they expect characters to be likable and nice. Think outside the box, please, and understand that the humanoid does not follow any morals, he aims only to follow it's creator's directives and achieve knowledge regardless of the price; some of the characters are not bad or good, just something in between like most human beings. Overall, a brilliant film both visually and plot wise. I hope the negativity doesn't keep the studios from doing the much needed and from my end, desired, sequel.",8,2,11,17 February 2014
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," A disappointing mess
","Contrary to most people I actually enjoyed Man of Steel. While I objected to certain option the filmmakers took, I found it to be a thorughly enjoyable super hero movie. My positive reaction to 'Man of Steel' gave me some hope for this oddly titled semi-sequel, despite the involvement of the likes of David S.Goyer and Zack Snyder. Sadly I found the movie to be a sprawiling, poorly scripted and paced mess that took itself too seriously - it's dudes in capes, not Nietzsche. The attempts at philosofy and depth were laughable, but nonetheless approached by the Director as if the script was intelligently written, which certainly was not. The action (of which there was very little until the dumb mess at the end) was poorly constructed, excessively CGI'd and very unexciting. A movie featuring such iconic characters of popular America culture should have been carefully and efficiently planned out. Such a massive gathering of iconic DC comics characters could have been, if handled right (as it has been before in comic books and animated movies and TV series),been something truly special. Instead we have this mess of a movie that does not deliver in any counts. Such a wasted opportunity. I regret deeply having awarded the people involved in this mess with the price of a theater ticket - they'll actually think they have done a good job and make a equally awful semi-sequel.I haven't been this disappointed with a movie in a long time.",5,7,14,30 March 2016
