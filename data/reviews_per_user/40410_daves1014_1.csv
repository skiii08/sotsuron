The Blair Witch Project," Garbage
","I can't believe I wasted my time watching this. Maybe the most over-hyped, overrated movie (if you want to call it that) of all time. GhostBusters is more scary than this piece of junk. I wanted to rate this a zero but unfortunately, 1 is the minimum.  Please don't waste your time.",1,25,46,10 August 2002
