Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Very cool, with only minor flaws
","Well, it isn't quite as fantastic as the original trilogy, but I found very little to dislike about TPM. The special effects were amazing (natch). I loved the podrace and the sequence at the end where there were four or five different battles going on at once. I actually enjoyed the story. Some have claimed that its intensely political aspects (embargoes, blockades and trade treaties) were boring, but I liked how Lucas showed us more of the inner workings of the world he has created. It was also an interesting way to begin the evolution of the 'Star Wars' mythology. I can't wait to see how the questions and problems set up in TPM will come together in II and III. (Hopefully, they will have better titles. Rumors I've heard: Episode II: 'The Rise of the Empire.' Episode III: 'The Fall of the Jedi.' I love those titles!)As for the characters, Jar Jar is definitely no Chewie, but he wasn't as excruciating as he's been made out to be. Lucas could have done better, though. And I miss Han Solo and his deadpan wit. If I were to point to one major flaw in TPM, it would be a lack of a Han-type character to provide intelligent and humorous commentary on the proceedings. What was the deal with Darth Maul? He barely had any lines at all! However, I think will find out a lot more about the Sith in the next two films. I have no complaints about the others. Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson made cool Jedi knights and it was great to see Yoda, R2-D2, C-3PO, Jabba, the Emperor, and of course Darth Vader in their younger days.In short, don't believe people who tell you Episode One sucks. I found it to be a very worthy entry into the saga and I'm not making any plans for Memorial Day Weekend 2002.",Null,0,0,21 May 1999
