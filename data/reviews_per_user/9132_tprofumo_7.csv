The Legend of Bagger Vance," 'A reel of good film, ruined.'
","Hollywood will tell you it is looking for new, different stories.  Actually, what Hollywood looks for is the same old story with a slightly new twist.Robert Redford has got the message. We have in the past seen films about almost every conceivable sport, from pool hustling to bob sledding. They almost always have the same plot. The long shot guy or team wins. Whether its about baseball, football or ice hockey, whether its about an individual or a team, its always about a loser or losers who find redemption.So, having exhausted the major American sports, and in Redford's case this includes fly fishing, we turn to that most thrilling of spectacles, golf.The plot is this.  It's the 30s, former golf phenom Matt Damon, who somehow got messed up in World War I, agrees to play in a three way golf shoot out with the two greatest players of the era, Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen. Will the gambling, boozy (well, not too boozy) Damon get his swing back? Only, it seems, with the help of his own person guru, played by Will Smith. Smith appears out of the night in a spiritual sort of way and before long is spouting new age advice of the type that made Luke Skywalker invincible with a light sword.There's no point of going any farther with the plot, because if you can't figure it out from there, you've never seen a Hollywood sports movie.  This is essentially a festival of cliches which centers on believing in yourself.
The camera work is great, the sets beautiful and the sunsets just knock outs. The acting is passable and Damon and the girl he is trying to win back, Charlize Theron, soldier on bravely with their parts. Smith gives what at best could be called a relaxed performance. What he seems to be doing is impersonating one of those guys sitting around on the sports journalist roundtable shows, pondering the more philosophical aspects of one sport or another, but really just waiting for the camera light to go off so he can pick up his paycheck and go home. You'll want to go home, too, about halfway through the film.Actually, the filmgoer would be better advised to go outside and get some exercise rather than seeing this through to the end.",Null,2,3,22 November 2000
Underworld," Underworld is the undeveloped world.
","This is an idea whose time hadn't yet come and quite possibly, never will. It seems to be a sort of blending of 'West Side Story,' various Hong Kong kung fu movies and the old Universal horror classics of the thirties and forties.  But it doesn't jell into anything at all.The film is apparently set in modern times and centers around a blood feud between vampires and werewolves,  or lychin as they are called here.  Not much point in saying more, because there really isn't more, despite what could have been an interesting idea.  Instead, the storyline just seems to be one endless set up for an endless string of chases through dark, narrow tunnels or dark narrow streets.  But the odd thing is that both clans seem to rely on good old fashioned gunfire rather than sucking blood or ripping each others throats out, making the fact that they are supernatural beings almost irrelevant.It's as if the filmmakers wanted to make a horror movie, but kind of wanted a martial arts movie, too, and yet, just to hedge their bets, decided to make it a gang movie from the hood. So they wound up with nothing, just a sort of low budget Matrix that neither frightens you nor makes you sit up in awe over the special effects.If the special effects from martial arts films aren't there and the old fashion thrills and chills we expect from vampire movies aren't there, what is there?  The characterizations you might think would spring from some writer's mind if he were going to turn vampires into a centuries old clan complete with mansions and intrigues and waring factions within factions? Nope.  Again, they sort of tried, but not very hard and came away with next to nothing, no characterizations, no interesting sets or costumes or customs.Lastly, one has to look at the acting.  Scott Speedman, late of 'Felicity,' plays a human caught in the middle of this horror show ripped from Universal studios one sheets of the thirties.  And since the movie is painfully underwritten, he is given almost nothing to do, something that only emphasizes his rather dower personality.The real shame, though, is Kate Beckinsale.  This was a vehicle for her and perhaps designed to make her into some kind of rival for Angelina Jolie, who rose above 'Lara Croft' making it into at least a little something.  But Beckinsale complete misfires here, just as she did in 'Pearl Harbor.' She's proved before she can handle dramatic material and recently was quite good in 'Laurel Canyon.' And perhaps her best performance to date in an American film was in 'Last Days of Disco.' But here she spends an entire movie wearing the exact same expression, something of a cross between annoyed and perplexed, as if she's trying to figure out how she got herself into such a stinker.Not a good effort from Kate, or the people who put this one together.Don't bother.",Null,0,0,7 October 2003
Lost in Translation," The best trip of the summer
","This has been a good summer for intelligent, thought provoking films like the enigmatic 'Swimming Pool,' the disturbing 'Dirty, Pretty Things' and the mystical 'Whale Rider.'But Sofia Coppola has come along with what could be the best of them all in 'Lost in Translation.'This may be the best 'fish out of water' film to hit the screen in a long time.  It may be the best travelogue of a big city since 'Roman Holiday.' And it may be the best May/December romance since Woody Allen's 'Manhattan.' And Like 'Manhattan.' this is a film which succeeds on a number of levels, especially visually.  In fact, cinematographer Lance Acord does the best job of romanticizing a city since Gordon Willis turned New York into a black and white Ansel Adams show set to Gershwin in 'Manhattan.'But viewers who do not want a travelogue should not be put off, either. Coppola stays away from the tourist scenes you might expect to find when a film is about two people frolicking in a foreign land.  Instead, she shows Tokyo as a town that is erupting with nightlife, a city that seems made for after hours adventures.  Scenes of video arcades and kareoke bars seem to be ripped right out of a William Gibson novel.The final shots of Tokyo at night are breathtaking.Beyond the pretty pictures, though, is a story about a middle aged guy and a girl young enough to be his daughter who, due to fate and do to their own restlessness, find themselves thrown together in a Tokyo hotel with lots of time and temptation on their hands.Bill Murray and Scarlott Johansson both do wonderful jobs of portraying people suffering from the kind of boredom we used to find in stories about the English upper class.  Both are unhappily married, although her reasons are more obscure than his, both are well off, both are tempted to find some excitement.Without getting into spoiler territory, this picture does bog down a little at midpoint.  And part of the problem is the problem facing the two protagonists.  Neither can get up the energy to do something drastic, because in reality, neither really has to.  There is no burning incentive to jump ship for either of them.  Both would like something to strike their fancy, yet neither may be willing to risk all they have without a better reason for doing so.In fact, this picture is in many ways about what used to be called in the 1930s and 40s a shipboard romance.  Two people are trapped for five days on an oceanliner crossing the Atlantic and they may, or may not, act on their attraction to one another.  But even if they do, everything goes back to normal when the gangplank is lowered at their destination and they go their separate ways.  They might meet years later at a cocktail party and may wink or may not.  Hell, they might not even remember.Luckily for us, Coppola has written a pretty good third act to this story and the action picks up in the end, although the ending is a little too enigmatic for some tastes.But then, that's not always bad.Maybe the closest thing to this film since Woody Allen's 'Manhattan'(1979) was the late Claude Sautet's remarkable 1995 film 'Nelly and Monsieur Arnaud,' which featured a fascinating May/December love story between Michel Serrault and the amazingly beautiful Emmanuelle Beart.  Beart, in an interview, said the story was about two lonely people who just needed somebody to talk to at a juncture in their lives.True enough and perhaps our hearts go out to the lonely so willingly, that we want them to consummate their relationship just so they, and we, won't be lonely any longer.  That's the feel Coppola left me with through her film.But 'Nelly' took the 'ships passing in the night' idea to a different level by having the characters there let the chance slip away.  And the looks on both their faces as they go their separate ways are worth the price of admission all by themselves.One doesn't quite get that feeling in 'Translation,' because you get the feeling the full story has not yet been written.Do see this film. I intend to see it again and as soon as possible.",Null,0,0,22 September 2003
The Bourne Identity," A first class action/thriller
","'The Bourne Identity' is about as action packed, suspenseful a thriller as you are going to find and that's rather surprising, because the plot is not all that original, and not very difficult to figure out, even if you've never seen a movie like this before.The plot has Matt Damon fished out of the ocean and finding that while he knows how to do all sorts of things, including speak a lot of languages (he's American?),he just can't remember his name or anything personal.The rest of the tale is the unraveling of his past, which turns out to be all about his work as a CIA assassin. Director Doug Liman does an excellent job with the almost non-stop action, which is expertly staged from start to finish.  That includes a car chase through downtown Paris which puts to shame the one staged in 'Ronin' by car chase expert John Frankinheimer.  Liman's work is less precise in terms of the direction of actors, but then for the most part, they don't have all that much to do acting-wise.Damon is fine as the man without a past.  German actress Franke Potente (the redhead from 'Run, Lola, Run') is even better as the girl who gets involved with him.  She is actually given a little room to work and she does well, especially in a scene where she witnesses a brutal fight to the death, and finds she cannot just shrug it off as one more day in the office.Some of the other casting falls a little flat, though.  Chris Cooper, usually great, is somewhat miscast as the head of a CIA black ops group. The very talented Julia Stiles is given little to do as a Paris CIA operative(and looks much too young for the job) and Clive Owen, clearly British, sort of seems out of place as a CIA assassin.But the action moves so fast that you hardly notice and overall,the picture succeeds very well,even though you pretty much know how its going to come out before the first reel is over.I recommend the film highly.But one final thought about it's timing.  'The Bourne Identity' makes its debut as America continues to be caught up in the war on terrorism.  That's interesting because this film is clearly about the CIA, which is depicted as a US government agency that assassinates foreign leaders, then blames the crimes on others; murders innocent civilians, and then lies to the American people when its leaders perjure themselves before Congress.All this at a time when US intelligence agencies are arresting suspected terrorists and holding them incommunicado, at times saying it may not even grant them a trial.  But we are told, trust these government agencies, we can believe them.  They may have blown chance after chance to head off the 9-11 attacks, they may have muffed countless important cases in the past, they may have failed to predict any of the major events they had been looking out for since World War II, but don't worry, they've finally got it all right.Sorry, the message in 'The Bourne Identify' rings a lot truer than most of the pronouncements coming from real Washington officials about why we shouldn't mind that they are whittling away at the Bill of Rights. Robert Ludlum may be simply a novelist, but John Aschcroft is a failed politician(he was defeated in his bid for reelection to the Senate by a dead man) and Aschcroft is the one I don't trust.",Null,0,1,22 June 2002
The Italian Job," A re tread with a few miles left on it
","I went to see 'The Italian Job' on the recommendations of people I know. I no longer consider these people to be my friends.This film stars Charlize Theron and three Mini-Coopers.  Seth Green is good in a supporting role.  Donald Sutherland is fine in a cameo.  Also in the cast is Edward Norton, who delivers an undistinguished performance as the bad guy, and Mark Walberg.  He is nominally the star, or at least, he gets top billing.  He plays the head of the heist mob.  Unfortunately for Mr. Walberg, every one of the members of his mob has a life and a personality, except him.  His character is so underwritten that it would take a James Cagney or a Cary Grant to bring it to life.  Not being blessed with their personalities, Mr. Walberg simply soldiers on along reciting his lines competently, but having virtually no impact on the screen.  Had he dropped out half way through the picture, you would not have missed him.  But again, he was given precious little to work with.The story is a remake of a 1969 Michael Caine film about a complex heist in Venus, Italy, and after the crooks have their booty stolen from them, and even more complex heist in Los Angeles to get the swag back.  Not much more needs to be said.  We have all seen it before.  The whole film is in reality one long build up to another big car chase, this one involving the Mini-Coopers and taking place in the tunnels of the LA subway system, which we are informed is after all, under utilized.Forget that not a single one of the male characters is in any way believable.  They really don't matter.  This is a movie for people who want to kill a couple of hours and nothing more.  Actually, Miss Theron's personalty throughout most of the film is probably the strongest of the lot and she does a pretty good job with her role.She's worth seeing.  So are the Minis.  Are they worth $8.50 even at matinee prices?  Not really.  Well, maybe Charlize is.  I can see the Minis at a showroom any time I want.",Null,0,0,1 June 2003
Pearl Harbor," In the tradition of 'Titanic,' sorry to say
","Actually, I liked this one better than James Cameron's 'Titanic,' but only liked it. It's the kind of movie that, like popcorn, is okay while your eating it, but doesn't leave you very full.The film's centerpiece, the attack on Pearl Harbor, is a special effects gold mine that generally comes off fairly well, although some of the stuff, like Japanese planes flying on their sides in between buildings, was a little silly looking.  And every vehicle that was hit did NOT explode like a gasoline tanker truck.  Following bombs down from a 'bomb's eye view' also seemed a little silly.But in general, the scene went well.What went less well was the rest of the movie.  For me, the love triangle around which the film was built came off as largely what it was, simply a vehicle to carry the story along to the Cameron/Spielberg style 'big scene.' For me, the problem was not the idea, but the execution.All three of the protagonists gave rather lifeless performances.Ben Afleck has done better work other places and always seems to me more suited to bad guy roles than he is to playing the hero. It's part of the problem with modern movies, though.  There seem to be no Jimmy Stewarts or Henry Fondas or James Cagneys around, no larger than life personalities who can take these mediocre characters and lift them up. Josh Harnett was even weaker and other than being good looking, I simply didn't get what the girl saw in him.Kate Beckensale, who I have liked in many roles in the past, including 'Brokedown Palace,' 'Last Days of Disco,' and her British work, fails here in my view, underplaying most of her big scenes.  Maybe it's the fact that she was a cardboard character, the Army nurse with no backstory to build upon, but she simply missed here, with the exception of her scene during the battle, where she got it together to some extent, but not completely.  I expected better work from her.But the acting was universally flat among the three of them, and that usually points a finger at a director. Like Cameron, Spielberg and DeMille before them, big picture, spectacle directors usually aren't all that good at getting things out of actors and Bay seems to be in that mold -- better at blowing things up than whittling things down to their emotional cores.I give it a good, solid 'B'.  It's entertaining, but not enlightening.  I still feel a lot more for Henry Fonda's character in 'Mr. Roberts.'  We never see him die, never see a shot fired in the whole movie, but he comes off as much more of a war hero than anyone in 'Pearl Harbor.'",Null,0,0,26 May 2001
Gangs of New York," Better than I expected
","I went into this film with low expectations, since I simply hadn't heard much good about it.  To my happy surprise, it exceeded my expectations in almost all categories.Beautifully mounted and shot and swiftly directed, this is Scorsese's best period film to date, far exceeding the awkward 'Age of Innocence.'As everyone notes, Daniel Day-Lewis turns in a very strong performance. Cameron Diaz is adequate in the female lead.  Leo DiCaprio is once again woefully miscast as a tough street kid and the idea that he could rally the tough Irish of New York around him at the end of the movie is almost silly.DiCaprio is the film's biggest downfall for me, and he leads directly to the problems with its plotting.  The story here is that a kid from a tough neighborhood sets out to avenge his father's death.  That's it.  DiCaprio's character seems to have no other goal and thus comes off to me not only secretive and brooding, but largely uninteresting.Central characters of films should have big goals, with the revenge motive thrown in for good measure.  As it was, Bill the Butcher was a far more interesting character and the film should have centered on him, with DiCaprio telling Bill's story.  As it turned out, Bill seemed real, Amsterdam seemed as contrived a character as his name implied.A simply change in focus could have turned this good film into a great one.",Null,0,0,27 January 2003
