Requiem for a Dream," Hard to forget
","This is one of those movies you won't forget after seeing it. Most movies are forgotten the next day, or the day after. This movie will be brand-marked on the back of your head and won't leave soon. The story is very weird, but also realistic. And not very optimistic, it gives you something to think about. After 'Pi' the director of this movie is holding on to the same style,which I think is a original and great style. I look forward to his next movie (that will be 'The Fountain' I think). It's Before this movie I never saw a movie with Jared Leto. I must say he did a very good job, just as the rest of the cast. Jennifer Connely and Ellen Burstyn really stood out. The combination of the cinematic styles and the good acting will make sure you can get lost in the movie. And finally a movie without a 'hollywood-ending'.",10,1,2,14 February 2005
