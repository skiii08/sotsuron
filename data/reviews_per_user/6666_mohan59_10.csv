Ford v Ferrari," Very enjoyable and entertaining
","This is a pleasantly surprising film. Partly because of the narrative - I was expecting a pro-Ford take on the celebrated rivalry, after having seen the Amazon documentary (I think it's called the 24 hour race or something). I was proved wrong.By choosing to focus on the two primary characters (superbly portrayed by Matt Damon and Christian Bale), James Mangold's gamble pays off handsomely in this tale of man and machine against all odds. Ford vs Ferrari is as much as Miles-Shelby's dogged perseverance against stumbling blocks from their own backers as it is against their iconic European counterparts. Their partnership is chalk and cheese - the diplomatic Shelby complementing the 'difficult' Miles but it works remarkably well. There is a good reason the American calls the Brit 'Bulldog' as Miles' tenacious pursuit of the perfect lap motivates people around him to go further. The action and humor prove an effective blend in driving the narrative forward. The cinematography, score and sound design are expertly done, capturing the intimacy of characters' personal lives as well as the frenzied restlessness of race days.In terms of performances, Bale and Damon have a terrific chemistry and Mangold exploits it shrewdly. While Bale tends to overact in some scenes (his facial expressions border on the ridiculous sometimes), he nails the eccentricities of a war veteran-turned-race-driver character to perfection. Unlike others, I did not find his accent surprising, but his preparation and dedication to his craft continue to leave a lasting impression. That said, this film completely belongs to Damon. He has the best scenes, the best lines and the meatiest character. His Texan drawl may not be pitch-perfect, but his control and restraint form the essence to the story as well as a ideal icy foil to Bale's hot-headed, fiery persona. The supporting cast is quite decent, though I was disappointed to not see the John Bernthal get more screen time.Ford v Ferrari wins not because of the titular rivalry, but inspite of it. A very enjoyable and entertaining racing film.",8,1,2,24 November 2019
Skyfall," Interesting, but...
","First things first. This is nowhere near as dreary as Quantum of Solace. That was one film which after watching gave me the feeling: 'Did I just watch a Bond movie or a star-studded documentary on water preservation?' At the same time, Skyfall is not Casino Royale either. Craig's debut Bond vehicle had the right mix of decadence, delicatessen, and deviousness on either side of the fence. Comparing films is not necessarily a good thing, but then, Bond flicks are prime targets for such a study and I would have to say this could have been a lot better.To start with, the story fits in with the premise of Bond returning to his past to confront those pesky ghosts. Likewise M. In a story closely resembling Mission Impossible (1996), Bond must prevent a list of all field agents and their aliases from falling into the wrong hands. Although the list is lost, Bond nearly succeeds, but for an apparent failed shot from Eve (Naomie Harris), he plummets into the white waters below and is presumed killed on duty. Cut to a daring attack on MI6 HQ and Bond gets all teary-eyed about dear ol' England and reports for work, with a stinking breath and bloodshot eyes for good measure. His evaluation tests prove negative, but M (Dame Judi Dench, in a far cry from the imposing matriarch of the secret service) overrules them and reinstates Bond into active field work, much to the chagrin of Interior Security Chairman George Mallory (Ralph Fiennes). Packed off to Shanghai to resume his tete-a-tete with the assassin who stole the list, Bond fails again, but this time, is thrown a lifeline by a mysterious woman called Severine (Berenice Marlohe). She leads him to Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem), a former MI6 agent who was once loyal to M only to be sacrificed by her on a doomed mission and has now sworn vengeance on 'Mommy' (as he calls M). Bond captures Silva but loses Severine along the way. A sneering Silva taunts M in captivity (similar to how Joker delighted himself in provoking Dent, Batman, and Gordon in The Dark Knight). Through a combination of computer wizardry and clever disguises, Silva escapes from the cage and bombs an underground rail line, throwing Bond and his pursuers off-track (literally). Meanwhile, as Silva has released few names from the list and those agents facing public executions due to blown covers, M is summoned to a court hearing where she faces tough questions. Bond has determined that Silva is on an all-out assault to get M and she barely escapes. Bond takes her to his childhood home called Skyfall in Scotland and proceeds to guard themselves along with the house-keeper Kincaid (Albert Finney). The first line of attackers arrive and Bond & Co deal with them successfully, albeit with M getting shot. Silva arrives in a helicopter and proceeds to decimate the house with heavy firepower. Bond increases the stakes by lighting cylinders in response to Silva torching his beloved Aston Martin and finally kills him with a knife, but is left downcast as M succumbs to her injuries. Eve reveals that she is actually Moneypenny as Mallory takes over M's job.The story is not entirely original, borrowing elements from spy flicks. Bond's motivation which seemed to be under scrutiny in QoS (one of the few saving graces of that film) is taken for granted here, in a manner that is almost off-hand. The background score is jarring at times, and Adele's rendition of 'Skyfall' is not bad but not great either. The fights are great but not memorable. Shanghai has been shot beautifully, though! As for acting, Bardem is the top-dog. His chuckling demeanor, his rat monologue, his macabre face as he removes his false teeth, all serve to paint him as a coldly vengeful former agent. Craig is great as well, but seems to be strangely subdued in some scenes. I got a great kick out of seeing Fiennes and I am really curious to know how the next instalment will pan out, given the prickly relationship M and Bond share. The two ladies are neither Black Widow nor Vesper Lynd but somewhere in between, which is all the more confusing. Ben Whishaw adds charm to a tiny role, but seriously, where are the gadgets, man? All said and done, this film raises more questions than answers. And those questions are more to do with the film itself, than anything else!",6,2,9,11 November 2012
Captain America: Civil War," Political drama with some iconic comic book chaps
","At the outset, I was not very keen on watching Civil War. I felt the superhero genre had hit a saturation point, a plateau on which writers were trying to churn out new ideas, more stars were being hired to play lesser-known comic book characters, and the merchandising was nauseatingly omnipresent. Fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on how others look at it), I have not seen Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice, nor do I intend to. So with all that, I walked in for a Friday night screening with mixed feelings.Pleasantly surprised is probably the right description. Yes, the plot is fairly convoluted. I didn't use a timer, but I felt Iron Man had more screen time than Cap. The airport scene is mind-bogglingly devastating and Spidey does add a breath of fresh air to the narrative. But those are not what make this movie stand out from others in recent past.The movie's strengths are its themes and the questions they pose. Since man learnt to draw lines on sand, intervention, especially in international diplomacy, has been THE topic of heated debates, caused embarrassing scandals, resulted in gruesome conflicts, among other unforgettable pages in our history. As much as military prowess is coveted, it leads to fateful consequences that are more often than not irreparable. No wonder, the famed German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel declared 'We learn from history that we learn nothing from history.' Another striking reflection this movie renders is loyalty in the face of escalating isolation. Cap is prepared to lose his more powerful friends than abandon his former World War II buddy, who can't help question Cap's judgment during one of his saner moods. Chris Evans' portrayal is convincing in terms of being fiercely protective of someone who has left an inerasable trail of blood. Sebastian Stan's Winter Soldier is almost a comic book version of Arnold's Terminator, barring the iconic bike and shades. The disappointment is in unanswered questions on how or why those in his team are as committed to the cause as he is. The cameos of Ant-Man and Hawkeye are gimmicky as well, but Anthony Mackie's Falcon thankfully adds the necessary humor to keep the interest from flagging.The third feature which is pretty much obvious to everyone is a role reversal between the primary leads. While Cap has morphed from a patriotic soldier in First Avenger to a violent renegade in Civil War via the path of a reluctant leader in Avengers, Iron Man has done a remarkable volte-face of his own from a cocky vigilante to an obedient company man, suffering an identity crisis along the way. The two men were already having a prickly relationship in 2012 and 2015 but in 2016, the arguments are no longer verbal. The punches, jabs, kicks, flying discs, fire blasts are all intended to cause maximum damage. As the curtain draws, we are left with an open-ended conclusion, a bruising battle ending in an uncertain stalemate with neither man a victor.Honorable mention must be made of new additions Daniel Bruhl and Chadwick Boseman. I was very impressed with Bruhl in Ron Howard's Rush where he played the obsessive, cold-blooded Formula 1 legend Niki Lauda battling a life-threatening racing accident to return to the circuit. Here, he does a brilliant job as a scheming military Colonel who is out for vengeance. His motives at the beginning seem distinctly nefarious but as the MacGuffin is eventually revealed, his rationale now pleads for empathy, even if his methods are still highly questionable. On the other hand, Boseman has a promising screen presence and acts with an uncanny restraint, holding his own against seasoned industry veterans. Like Bruhl's Colonel Zemo, his T'Challa swears revenge as payback for a family tragedy but chooses to be a better man. I confess, I will watch the Black Panther movie when it releases (as announced) in 2018.Infusing politics in movies based on comic books is not unlike playing with a loaded gun. That being said, credit must be given to writers of this movie who walked the tightrope of offering us themes based on modern events while still driving and shaping historic characters.",9,2,9,2 June 2016
Inside Out," An artistic triumph
","For some reason, I couldn't quite catch this movie in theaters and I managed to watch it on an international flight. And boy, am I glad I did! As far as concepts go, I was astonished at the amount of detail and coherence in execution. The visuals are absolutely stunning, the colors rich and vibrant, the characters utterly memorable and some of the most poignantly heart-breaking lines of dialogue ever spoken/sung in any movie, let alone feature animation. It is every bit a Disney-Pixar classic and as emphatic a return to form as it can get.The story revolves around a young girl child who is happy in her world and has to suddenly acclimatize to another environment when her family has to move. Growing pains and social issues affect her while she grapples with increasingly complex situations, both at home and school. Meanwhile, the interplay between the five primary emotions inside her mind is both dynamic and fraught with compromises, much like how we deal with others everyday. As things come to a head and young Riley is about to make a life-changing decision, the events that follow leave a lasting impression, with an increased appreciation of the phrase 'emotions are what makes us human'! I recognized some dichotomies - for instance, Minnesota, usually perceived cold, is regarded as warm and comforting by Riley while San Francisco, renowned for its sunny weather, is seen as foreign and unwelcome. The other contrast I noticed was all five emotional figures (Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust) do not always stay true to form, with Joy especially exhibiting nuances far beyond what her name implies - case in point, her touching admission preceding the last act (that entire sequence was too much for my eyes to take, by the way). All this might be considered a tad too much for young children to appreciate, but with time, they may probably realize how beautifully honest this movie was in trying to portray their growth and the underlying issues.Certainly, it is not without flaws: the plot meandered a bit 2/3rds into the length; Joy's 'A-ha' moment seems strangely contrived, despite the impact it had; the music was adequate but not truly captivating as in the case of other Pixar offerings. But the beauty of this medium is that it offers filmmakers opportunities to steer audiences to more engaging experiences; Pete Docter and Co accomplish this with aplomb.In terms of cast and crew, the voice actors are superb selections - Lewis Black aces the Angry persona with generous dollops of sarcasm; Mindy Kaling is just perfect voicing Disgust; Richard Kind's performance as the imaginary Bing Bong is an absolute tear-jerker, while Kaitlyn Dias shows remarkable poise playing Riley. But it is Amy Poehler who steals the show in a coruscating blend of vivacity, vibrancy, and vicariousness. Her Joy is not an infallible leader, but one who accepts others in the face of challenging situations and plows ahead with inspiring positive energy. The animation left me spell-bound, especially the sequence where thoughts are shown to be abstracted, and are endowed with a lot of heart. The movie is fairly short, but a running time of 94 minutes is appropriate justice to a slightly heavy subject matter. The humor compensates with trademark Pixar staple of jokes, albeit intended for slightly more mature viewers. Pete Docter gave us the outstanding Up six years ago and ably accompanied by Ronnie del Carmen, has categorically demonstrated that he is a fabulous storyteller and a master entertainer.Inside Out is every bit a Pixar fan's well-deserved reward for patience. Do yourself a favor and watch this magnificent gem.",9,192,393,21 September 2015
Quantum of Solace," Craig excels, but movie disappoints
","The blue eyes are cold, calculating and mean business. The occasional smirk is reserved for those who deign to humor a man on a personal vendetta. The body is supremely athletic, the stamina relentless, the aim unerring, and the motive compellingly haunting, albeit confusing. And despite all this, there is a heart within the man. Oh yes, there is.Welcome to the world of Daniel 'James Bond' Craig.Comparisons with the awesome Casino Royale will be inevitable but even with that, this movie disappoints a fair bit. The plot is wafer thin, the antagonist's objectives are very vague, the action sequences, though marvelously choreographed and shot, were one too many. Ditto product placements. And I just can't believe that this movie is only 106 min long. I thought we deserved better for a sequel. A giveaway of the feeble storyline, perhaps? Enough mud-slinging. To start with the positives, there is Craig. Then, there is the fractious relationship between M and Bond. Hitherto, Bond movies have always shown M as this overbearing watchdog who seems to irk Bond to no end. Here, we see the grudging respect and the rare concern, despite not seeing eye-to-eye on most matters. Then, it's the uneasy partnership of the MI6 and the CIA. Oh, before I forget, the opera scene is terrific as we get to see Bond get into the nitty-gritties of sleuthwork, full of impersonation, intimidation, inventiveness and insouciance. The plane chase sequence is also good, an obvious homage to the classic Bond movies, where there were only propeller planes.Other sequences that stay on the mind are Mathis' quiet exchange with Bond over the late Vesper and Bond finally tracking down his adversary. When the latter sequence started, I almost mistook it to be the same one where Bond kills Dryden in CR, prior to the credits. Speaking of which, the traditional action sequence that precedes it is sure to kick in the adrenalin but the credits song is just awful. Chris Cornell simply rocked with 'You know my name' but this one had a weird rhythm and Alicia Keys' grating vocals.Coming to the cast, Judi Dench and Mathieu Amalric are great. The Dame is clearly on top of her game, and I enjoyed each dialogue between her and Bond completely. Mathieu made a less-than-convincing part look interesting predominantly because of his short stature and a charming smile, masking a ruthless streak along the way. But the movie simply belongs to Craig. Any doubting Thomases should now be convinced that he is the right man to play Bond.Rating: 6/10",6,1,2,7 November 2008
Up," A synonym for cinematic excellence, a benchmark for animation movies
","Where do I begin? Oh yes, the first time I heard that Pixar were coming up with their latest feature length offering from my sister, who is greatly passionate about character graphics and is desperate to join Pixar. Admittedly (like some of my fellow reviewers here), I found the storyline about an old man and a young kid stowing away to a legendary place in the South American jungles a bit dull.But, boy, did Pixar prove me wrong spectacularly! As a visual treat, it's as perfect as anything you could ever imagine. The moments, tender and funny, never overplay and I found myself wiping my eyes on at least 3 sequences, most notably the one towards the beginning of the film: I laughed when Carl's family politely applauded, looking bewildered; I smiled when Ellie points out the cloud shapes; I was in tears when the doctor gives the shattering news that Ellie can't become a mom and finally my heart went out to a lonely old man who strives so much to keep a promise made to his wife when they were kids. It's impossible for a normal sane person to go through this scene without a pair of wet eyes.The amusing moments begin when an old man Carl Fredericksen (Edward Asner), disgusted with the changing world, decides to take an adventure trip to Paradise Falls, a place where he and his late wife once dreamt of going. However, he has to contend with an overenthusiastic young explorer Russell (Jordan Nagai), an adorably foolish dog Dug (Bob Peterson), a pack of mutts trained by Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer), idolized by Carl and his wife but doesn't seem to be what he really is. On the way, Carl doesn't redefine loyalty or any of that heavy-duty stuff, but as a human being, he becomes less of an island and more of a lovable father figure, especially in the last scene. This effort at redemption is justly rewarded. Watch the movie to understand my point.The musical score is first class and embellishes each scene, giving it an everlasting lustre. The dialogues are witty, charming and as the old saying goes, never interfere with the narrative if not required, which leads to a truly memorable cinema experience. I'm definitely catching it again.Take a bow, Pixar. For having introduced a synonym for excellence in motion pictures: UP.",10,0,2,30 August 2009
Beauty and the Beast," Visually stunning, otherwise underwhelming
","Although a film's watch-ability may not be directly implied by its Academy Award nods, there is a reason why the 1991 version became the first animated feature film ever to be nominated for the Best Picture category. That version had everything: gorgeous animation, songs of warmth and affection, tremendous voice acting, and a story that was both traditional and far-ahead of its time. We all know how Belle, well-read as she is and dissatisfied with her laid-back village life, longs for adventure. Her father, the eccentric inventor Maurice, is a kind of a bumbling simpleton at first, but is indeed a caring parent and protective of his precocious daughter, whose talents are not lost on him. A village which at once becomes a mob on the mere whim of a deeply narcissistic, insecure person. With such an impression, I was hoping that the live-action version would take the film's already-legendary status even further and make it an all-time classic. Alas, I have to admit I am disappointed. There are several things in this film that were not in the animated version: the lead protagonists' backgrounds are more defined, there is a minor twist in the final act, Le Fou's predicament is more deserving of empathy than the foolish sidekick he was in 1991 are the ones that come to mind. First up, the story. It stays largely faithful to the original (save for the twist I mentioned above). The humor works rather well, but is rather forced at times, leading to some awkward chemistry between the lead pair as well as between Gaston and Le Fou. In terms of progression, here is where I felt let down: Beast offering his gigantic library as a token of affection to Belle was a pivotal moment in the animated version, it made Belle realize that there is a softer side to her ferocious host. The title song also feels a bit flat; when Angela Lansbury sang with her heart, you could feel the quickening of the heartbeats, the racing of the pulses, and the irresistible magic of the moment when Belle and the Beast dance in the ballroom. As Belle finally trusts Beast by resting her head on his shoulder and the Beast is totally taken by surprise, his servants encourage him further, enhancing the timelessness of both the film and the song. Sadly, the live action has no such charm. The build-up is rushed, the song ends before you can realize what is happening, and Emma Thompson, as celebrated a thespian she is, tries her best but is unable to match Lansbury's memorable rendition. I was also disappointed to not see 'Being Human' in this film, it was a song that demonstrated the servants' aspirations and could have served to illustrate how their lives where before the curse took effect. And with just a touch over two hours, the film's pace seems prolonged and ponderous.I am not sure if the lead pair is miscast. On their own, they are pretty efficient: Emma Watson is convincing in her portrayal of a forward-thinking Belle. Dan Stevens is left to bare his soul as a tortured fiend, which he does mostly well. But its when they are together that feels a bit underwhelming. Paige O'Hara and Robby Benson's chemistry in 1991 was terrific and amazing, the former's gentle civility perfectly contrasting the latter's jarring cruelty and eventually transformed elegant nobility. It was refreshing to see Le Fou (played by the excellent Josh Gad) have a human side to him, which made his performance all the more relevant in these times. Luke Evans is equally superb, as the obnoxiously self- centered Gaston who manipulates people to his will. Kevin Kline deserves plaudits for his portrayal as well. However, I don't think Ewan McGregor was that convincing as a French candelabra, to be honest. With an odd French accent, his banter-filled exchanges with Cogsworth lack the rapier wit of Jerry Orbach-David Ogden Stiers' double team. The film does have some positives though: Le Fou's characterization, the lead pair's backstory (both mentioned above), and the stunningly exquisite production design. The detailing was intricate and dazzling, especially in the castle's interiors and Belle's ballroom gown. Overall, this film works, but in hindsight, I should have watched this without much expectation. So that would be recommendation.",6,12,25,18 March 2017
The Dark Knight Rises," 'You missed a spot, Nolan'
","I'll be brutally honest here. I liked The Dark Knight better than this. Even though its just couple of hours since I finished watching it.Sure, TDK had its flaws, but then, it was such a marvelous noir saga, a treatise in crime drama that left us begging for more at the end. The phrase 'page-turner' is often applied to engrossing books, but that could work just as well for the magnificent film. To this day, I cannot take my eyes off whenever I see TDK and by the time that ravishing interrogation scene between Batman and Joker is on, nothing is likely to stir me from my seat. By choosing to make the titular character undergo a perception shift, a massive (and ultimately successful) gamble was taken. And who can forget the late, great Heath Ledger's spectacular performance? TDKR is not a bad movie per se. Seen alone, it has the ideal ingredients for a summer blockbuster: an A-list cast, monumental action sequences, modern themes of terrorism and official ineptitude, as well as intricate sub-plots which mesh well together at the end. There is more than a passing reference to the predecessors, especially Batman Begins (which, in my humble opinion, is an enormously underrated flick). And it works to a great extent.Where this film fails as TDK succeeded is in the amount of layering. Some sub-plots were so complex that I was left confused as to where I was before that particular sequence (case in point: Blake's impromptu reconnaissance of a dockyard). Others were left frustratingly hanging in thin air. The plot also seems slow paced at first. While the first sequence is downright awesome, what follows afterward is distinctly underwhelming. Above all else, Batman is renowned to be a master strategist. Here, he ends up getting deceived not once, but twice at Catwoman's hands. You mean to tell me that eight years is good enough to make a superbly trained, marine-worthy, genius escape artist-cum-detective become dull? Really? I won't go ahead and slate Nolan more here, simply because he gave me the privilege of watching two of the best superhero movies ever filmed in Batman Begins and TDK. The glass is always half-full in my eyes, and I'll admit that Hathaway and Gordon-Levitt were both perfect selections for their roles. I'm not too sure of Tom Hardy, since his performance is more physical than metaphorical but given his task was to exude a ruthless menace, he did his job. The rest of the familiar supporting cast are brilliant as before, especially with Caine showing his human side that we always suspected was well alive beneath that stiff British upper lip exterior and dry wit. I read somewhere that this is not a Batman movie, but a Bruce Wayne movie. And I fully agree. Having to reconcile (with unflattering results) with a life without Batman, Bruce is alone even as a social presence and a corporate figure. It is a true challenge but then again, Christian Bale turned in a remarkable performance in both BB and TDK (he held his own in those scenes where Ledger was not present). And in TDKR, he leaves an indelible mark on a role that would probably be the benchmark.Batman Begins was all about 'Fear' while 'Chaos' was a running theme in TDK. TDKR does a great job in being a conclusion to the trilogy, but it is not the best one among the three, probably because there is no strong undercurrent of a theme here.",7,52,100,21 July 2012
Black Panther," Discount the hype, discover a film
","For far too long, Marvel Studios' PR department has been waging a sustained assault on us patrons' psyche with over-the-top promotional material, ranging from comic conventions, merchandising, endless trailers/previews and cultural references. Whoever is heading that unit needs to take a vacation, along with the staff. Immediately. This is a serious request.Because what we have been led to believe is Black Panther is the best superhero film ever made on the legendary African warrior.This film is nothing of the kind. Instead, it is a compelling and competent drama of greed, loyalty, vengeance, and social standing. Other reviewers have pointed out that this film is quite overrated and not worthy of the hype. To be very honest, that was my feeling as soon as the credits rolled. It was a few minutes later that my appreciation of the film's tone and import started to change. This film is not about a fictional kingdom or a mysterious metal or other tangible things. It is more a study of who we are as a human race and where we stand today.I will try not to spoil the film for others. There are numerous scenes where characters wrestle with their inner conscience, confront a dilemma or two, and balance critical decisions with consequences. These scenes are not hoisted out of reality, we experience moments like these ourselves. Circumstances can make past decisions look outdated and wrong, even. At the same time, embracing change a little too quickly has pitfalls as well. There is a line said by a male character, which goes thus: 'It is tough for a good man to be a leader'. And it is true. Not everyone is born a leader. People learn and evolve over time, dealing with situations that sometimes are beyond their control. And by presenting those situations, the filmmakers have chosen a path that can be a little underwhelming to viewers at first, but relatable to us in some ways. I would even go as far as to say the overall theme of this film is more about what we are willing to do to protect who or what defines us without losing sight of what unites us all. It does sound serious, but the film manages to tackle these topics. Not expertly, but in a reasonably convincing fashion.The cast is near-perfect. While Chadwick Boseman could have done better by adding a little spark to his T'Challa, he has an extraordinary screen presence in the guise of the titular hero. A simultaneous ninja-statesman, his brand of aggression, without any outward weapons, is ferocious and decisive. Danai Gurira and Lupita Nyong'o are excellent as General Okoye and War Dog Nakia respectively. Their fight sequences are superbly choreographed, along with those of the others. Michael B Jordan's acting chops are legit, he exudes menace and power as Killmonger. Daniel Kaluuya is a strong addition to an already-impressive line-up. But I was most impressed by Letitia Wright as Princess Shuri, the feisty younger sibling of the King. A firebrand techno-genius who can handle a skirmish quite capably, some of her inventions make Iron Man's creations pale in comparison. I expect to see more of her in future installments, if the post-credits scene is anything to go by. Seasoned veterans like Forest Whitaker, Angela Bassett, John Kani, and Sterling K Brown support the main cast with their renowned expertise. And not for the first time, Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis' scenes together are a delight to watch. While Freeman does provide some comic relief, it is also refreshing to see him get actively involved and bring his own skills to the table. As for the crew, one important point first: bear in mind, the director is a relative newcomer in the competitive world of big-budget superhero franchises. I have not seen Fruitvale Station or Creed yet, but Ryan Coogler had a lot on his plate when entrusted with the enviable task of directing this highly-anticipated venture. He delivers a really watchable film, even if some adrenaline junkies might complain that the action sequences are few and far between. By choosing to focus on drama and intrigue instead of fast-paced, mind-numbing action (my number one reason for hating Avengers: Age of Ultron), Coogler makes a calculated move to pose questions about ourselves. His crew back him up admirably, whether it is Rachel Morrison with the camera (some of the wide-angle shots were gorgeous), special effects, or music. The production design is top-notch, the sweeping, high-tech interiors of Wakanda contrasting rather charmingly with the rustic, almost-idyllic outdoors. At just a touch over 2 hours long, the pace is neither too rushed nor sluggish.My sincere advice to those who have not seen this film yet: if possible, erase the sky-high expectations caused by Marvel's hype-machine and watch for what it really is. You will probably enjoy it more.8/10",8,5,13,20 February 2018
Flight," A story of two flights
","As a kid, I've always been interested in planes, big and small. I later discovered a truly fascinating series called 'Air Crash Investigation' and have watched almost every episode there is. So when I caught the trailer for this film few months ago and also noticed Denzel Washington was involved, I was instantly hooked! This film is a tale of two flights: the first is there for everyone to see. A take-off in thunder and lightning which soon descends into mid-air chaos, then certain disaster only to be mitigated by the heroic, if unusual, actions of the Pilot-in-Command, Capt. William 'Whip' Whitaker (Denzel Washington). In an inspired move (a clear nod to the doomed Alaska Airlines Flight 261), he decides to fly upside down to overcome a steep nosedive and completes a landing which is nothing short of miraculous. Capt. Whitaker is regarding a public hero, on the verge of a certain recognition from his pilots association, and apart from the crushing loss of his coworker-mistress, Flt. Attendant Marquez, is in good shape. Until things take an ugly turn and the second flight takes off.A broken marriage with a past history of liquor abuse has left Whitaker a chronic alcohol and drug addict. Routine procedures following the immediate investigation into the accident have revealed higher than permissible BAO levels, which his attorney Hugh Lang (Don Cheadle) and rep Charlie (Bruce Greenwood) are confident can be overturned. However, Whitaker's guilty conscience prompts him into making repetitive arrogant claims ('No one else could have landed that plane!'). One such outburst causes a bad rift between him, Charlie and Lang, with a formal hearing only days away. Consorting with a hippie (Kelly Reilly), Whitaker tries to find some purpose but with the demons fast closing in, his crew caught in the crossroads of whether to support their savior or bring the truth to life, Whitaker's life nearly derails when he's thrown out by his ex-wife and son. Left with nowhere to go, he seeks asylum at Charlie's. The day before the hearing, his addiction gets the better of him, but somehow, he manages to 'breathe' his way to sobriety and walks in.The hearing is faithful to reality and hard-hitting. Melissa Leo shines in a great cameo as an investigator with pointed and charged questions. What follows is not entirely surprising, but the exchange between an investigator who is out to seek the truth and a pilot with a dark secret is not unlike many courtroom dramas we have seen before.The story is pretty unique and decently authentic. The crash scene is superbly shot (couple of scenes inside the plane are not for the fainthearted!). The supporting cast do their job but it is Washington who 'flies' this engrossing film with high-class acting. Not every seasoned actor can pull off a conflicted professional but so good is he that you see the pilot, not the actor when he dons that slick blazer with the shades and sticks that smirk on his face. His is a performance worthy of several award nominations. Maybe his third Oscar, who knows! If you are a Washington fan, do not miss this Flight!",9,5,12,3 November 2012
