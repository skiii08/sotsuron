The King's Speech," I don't know
",So yeah. King's speech. Sounds like fun and I guess it is. So plot. It's about one of the British kings who had a trouble with the stummer and because of it couldn't give a spech although he had to. So he goes to a doctor(sort of) and it begins. Overoll the plot isn't bad isn't that great either but it's enjoible and that says something. Special effects. Well there aren't any. Yeah well they could of done stammer in slow mo but they didn't. Acting is great. Especially the lead and Rush. They both awesome. There's an atmoshere of England I'll give it that. So it's an enjoyble movie but I still can't get why it's got an Oscar wheres Inception didn't even get a nominee.,8,0,1,4 July 2011
Sucker Punch," Wow...wait...what?
","Sucker punch. Yeah I admit the name sucks(it's funny 'cause... whatever). So I skipped the theater and just watched it on blu-ray and it's... well let me start from the start. The plot. It tells about a girl who locked in some creepy asylum where girls dance for... well for some rich man. And our girl named baby doll(Who thought about those names?) as soon as she gets there decides to break out. Yeah - sounds cool right? So the plot is alright I guess, could of been better but the plot isn't the most important here. Acting is pretty bad. In entire movie there is only two characters that I liked. The villon pisses me off but whatever. Through entire film you'll be hearing a lot of songs. They are good I guess but not to my liking (not rock). Now about why 7. Badassery. The action scenes are awesome. You watched 300 right well it's almost as good. Almost all the action scense were happening in baby doll's head so they could do cool things. Slow mo is awesome (again 300). So I give it what I gave it not because of the plot or characters rather because the movie is badass. Go watch it like right now or tomorrow, I don't know",6,1,2,4 July 2011
Fight Club," After the book...
","So I've read Chuck Palahniuk's 'Fight club' and just wanna say a couple words about it first. This book is written in a very specific way, it's written almost without dialogs, yeah there is lines here and there but there no dialog it's like just a character says something then after a period of time, after some events are described, another or the same characters says something and so on and I loved this writing style. It really stands out and it shows something unique in Palahniuk, something we haven't seen before, something we see in all of his book. Also he puts a lot of great saying in the book that really lives you thinking. The book gives a couple of hints which basically, if you smart enough, unfold the ending long before it. And the last thing - the characters are really well done. So that's all about the book, know the movie. Is the movie following the book, is it as brutal and mind consuming as the book? Well actually yes, yes it is. So as for me the strongest point in the movie is the script, it sticks to the book and its few dialogs but also it brought as much as to Chuck to say that it's an improvement over the book(well actually I don't think so 'cause I prefer the original ending). I mean - how many script writers can do that? All the actors did a great job of making there characters look alive(although I still think that Norton gave his best performers in Primal Fear). Pitt and Carter is also awesome. So yeah the movie is brutal but there were some little, great things in the book that weren't in the movie which is a real bummer. From all two Fincher movies that I watched (Seven is the other) I think this is the best. Oh and yes Fincher did a great job as well. Watch the movie and if I convinced at list one person to read the book than my job is done.",10,1,3,14 October 2011
Ed Wood," Who... weit.
","Ed Wood. Alright before this movie I had no idea who that is. Turns out he's a director who is belived to be the worst director ever. I wish I got it. So the story is about him trying to tell stories. Did I mentioned that he also writes plots he directs? The plot is unbelievably funny. I'm not sure whether or not it supposed to be a comedy or drama but I think it's both. The characters are great. They almost as good as in The dark knight and that says something. My favorite three characters are Ed Wood himself played by Jonny D. to whom we'll get later. The character played by Martin Landau. And he totally deserved an Oscar for that. And the character of Bill Murey who is great. Well he's a man who wants to be a woman how could he not be great? So J.D. acting. It's incredible. His funny, not to smart, creative. He's awesome. You'll feel what he feels. Yeah you will. Special effect are... well there aren't any. And those which Ed does is really funny. So the movie is incredible(did I say it already?). If you want to hear a story (partly) of a man who likes to dress up like a woman (which is really funny) go watch it like right now.",10,0,1,5 July 2011
The Prestige," Yeah... I'm thrilled again
",It happens with every Nolan movie. The guy can't do anything wrong. Of cause we've got to give credits to Christopher Priest who came up with a great story and Nolan's brother Jonathan for helping hem. So it's about a... I don't know... a war I guess between two magicians. One is more of a showman and the other is obsessed with tricks. Well don't get me wrong they both obsessed but Christian Bales character is really obsessed. So for the most part the story runs in London in 19 century. Oh yeah good old London. And it's great because the city is beautiful. So the plot is incredible. I know you've heared it a lot but there are twists after twists. And when you think that there possibly can't be more they give you more. So that's that. The acting is great again as always in Nolan's film. He knows who to hire. I liked Bale and Caine the most. They're great(did I say great like 3 times?) Special effects are good I guess. Well it's not Dark Knight nor Inception there aren't so much but those which are there are great. So yeah there you have it. Another masterpiece by Nolan.,10,1,1,5 July 2011
Tangled," at last something thrilling
","So I didn't bother watching it in theater because... well because I'm an idiot. And that says all. I watch it at home but still managed to enjoy it. So the plot. I won't get to muck into it so is not to spoil anything. So there's a princess that don't know that she's a princess, a guy (cool guy) that wants money and steal a crown of our princess and a fake mother who's a... well a... whatever - you got it. So that's it, they all tangled together (it's funny 'cause I used the word tangled when the name of the film is... oh, whatever). So the plot is really enjoyable. More than that. So now that we done with that lets movie on to songs and music. They are as awesome as me. Honestly. 'I've got a dream' is as good as ' you've got a friend in me' maybe better. Animation is as coll as always and much better than toy... caught... story 3 which is I think compared to this is sh... well you got it ey? Acting is great. Everyone is great. I would honestly punch a guy who decided not to include it in Oscar nominee in the face. Well - he should've seen it coming. So yeah that's that. Movie is great. 10 stars. So go watch it............................................................ searisly why are you still reading it - go watch it.",10,8,10,2 July 2011
Watchmen," Well...One thing on my mind.
","So yeah I watched Watchmen the other night. Actually it's so damn lone that I watched it in two nights. Zack. I guess he is my second favorite director(not screenwriter). He knows how to do a badass movie I'll give him credit for that. But it's not always enough. Sure it was enough with 300 but this time around it's different. The plot is. jy? you know what it's so boring that I won't even review it. I didn't like all characters except for one. Seriously I don't remember a single name.The one character I did like is a dude with a sock on his head. He's badass. So I guess it's all bad. Oh yeah and the fact that it's unesessery long. I'd like it more if it was shorter. The good things. Well actually there's only two good thing. The sound and music and the fact that this movie is truly badass(not as much as 300 but anyway). The action scenes are so cool. They just incredible. The style of the movie is awesome(wow I guess it's three) I admit that. So overall a boring plot, uninteresting characters and cool badassness. Seriously compared with the Dark Knight or even Batman Begins it's just crap. The dark knight had badassness as well as script, characters and acting. Oh yeah the acting here is decent I guess - nothing incredible that would erase the flaws. So 6.",6,0,2,8 July 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Harry Potter
","Yes - it's here. In fact it has been here for some time. So I guess I'm late but I don't give a .... well you got it. So Harry Potter and the deathly hallows. Cool name by the way. So let's start with the plot. I mean the screenplay because we all know that the book is as awesome as hell. The screenplay is ... well not so good. I mean it's not bad either but it could of been so much better. They deleted scenes which would take couple of minutes but would add so much. And there's nothing bad about a long movie(yeah we all remember LOTR don't we?). So yeah that's that also they for some unknown reason change some lines. Like when Ron gets all angry and is about to go he says 'I sow you to the other night' wheres in the book he said 'I got it you choose him'. I mean JK knew what she was doing and her lines would always be better than those of the dude who rote screenplay. OK, now that we're over with that - effects, yes of cause special. I've got to admit - there pretty cool. Of cause it's no Dark Knight nor Inception though it's understandable since Nolan wasn't around (dan it). Acting. It was pretty good. Rupert Green rules as always. Atmosphere is not as good as in the book but whatever. So all in all it's a good adaptation and you've got to cheek it out. You know you would anyway it's a bloody HP we're talking about.",9,1,4,2 July 2011
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Whait...what... is this twilight?
","Yeah. New moon. I've got to admit that twilight sounds cooler. But it doesn't matter, does it? First about twilight. I really liked it. After I watched the movie I went on and read the book and I liked both(of cause book's muck better, I'm just saying). Now New moon. The screenplay is - ye. I don't know though I should. It's not good to say the list. I currently reading the book and it's so much more enjoyible. So yeah that's that. Special effect. Well turning into wolf was pretty good. In the book it says that they explode so, I don't know I guess it's good. The acting. I like Kristen Stewert(or whatever her name is) but the guys who play Edward and Jake are really bad. Yeap. In fact they so bad that they almost good and that says something. Music is good so is the sound. All in all skip it and go read a book you'll have much more fun that way. Searysly why are you still here? Go!",6,0,4,3 July 2011
The Dark Knight," The Dark Knight
","Wow - that sounds cool even now. So yeah I watched it not in 2008 or 2009. I watched it in 2010. There are two reasons why - 1st because I'm an idiot, 2nd because I always thought that Batman sucks. Well now I know that he's not and I do. Whatever. Let's start with the plot. Look at me ms. smart pants. The plot is, well awesome. The characters believable, there're cool moments and everything you want from a script. Nolans and Goyer did a great job as always it's like these people can't do anything wrong. Atmosphere is incredible. It's very dark throughout the whole film. Gothem is as awesome as is was in BB. Everything is believable. Special effects are great. What else would you expect from a movie with this budget. My favorite moment is (spoiler) Batman vs joker fight which was just - wow. And the truck flip from the trailer is - wow (dan it) Next and best part is acting and it's... yeah I used all the cool words. To actors were given great characters and they upened(is this a word?) them even higher. And the part which everyone already knows is Heath Ledgers perfomens. he is I don't even have a word for it. After this I watched all his movies and he became my favorite actor. The movie is great but wheres his not on the screen you wait for him to show up and finilly kill somebody and he always does. So that's that. After this movie I became Ledgers and Nolans fan. And if you haven't watched it you missed like everything. I'm just saying.",10,1,4,4 July 2011
Inception," Inception
",Unfortunately I didn't watch it in theater because I wanted to watch it in English. Before this I only waited so hard only fo HP. So the movie. Without spoilers of cause. The plot. Yes the plot is... well it's Nolan so it's obious that it's awesome. Of cause It explores dreams and it's really interisting. The movie builds layers upon layers and it's cool. In Inception there is two twists - at the end and almost at the end. Of cause there aren't as many as in Prestige bus they really great. In the end you'll have to make a chose. But enough of that. Special effects. Because the movie takes place in the dream they could do some cool stuff. Really cool. And it truly deserved Oscar for that. Soundtrack is amesing though I like TDK's soundtrack just a bit better. Acting is as awesome as in Dark Knight but is it better than the DK? I can't say it's better cause the dark knight is like my favorite movie. It's as good as. So yeah that's that. I have no idea why Nolan didn't win an Oscar. So watch it like right now.,10,1,5,3 July 2011
Toy Story 3," I don't know...
","Toy Story. I love it. When I was a kid I never watched the whole movie for some reason just parts but my classmates were talking about it a lot. So when I was like 15 I finally decided to watch it and I just loved it. Of cause back then there wasn't part 3. But now there is. So the story is about our toys getting to the kiden(I don't know how to spell it) garden. And how they didn't like there and tryed to escape. Oh, good old Hollywood. So the story is OK I guess I didn't enjoy it as much as part 1 and 2 but... Animation is good although I liked Tangled better. Acting is awesome. So are the songs and sound. Now to the bad. I think I didn't like this movie that much (although I liked it) because it takes itself way too seriously. It's not nearly as funny as 1 and 2. Yes there are a lot of characters and I guess it's suppost to be good but I don't think it's such a good thing. You don't get to know them well anyway. First parts didn't have that much characters but were so much better. So the movie with OK plot, a lot of characters, good animation and lack of humor. But you know that you would watch it don't matter what. It's you're childhood.",7,0,2,5 July 2011
Signs," wait for it.. wait...yeah there's the twist
","M. Night Shamalang or something like that or otherwise the guy who killed Avatar (as a movie the series is indestructible). So this guy gets a lot of hate. His included it a topic called People Who Should Not Ever Be Considered Artists/Geniuses/Good People/Actual Human Being(you laughed at the last part admit it). And I actually watched only three of his movies, liked 1 and loved 1 and hated third. And the one I loved is as you already guessed is Signs (wow that sound cool). So on the field of different country signs appears. And some think that that's bullshit but some people believe that aliens are here. So I won't spoil anything for you guys I'll just say that the plot is great the dialogs are awesome and of cause it has a twist. Oh you Night. So that's that now to acting. Mel Gibson (yeah the guy who promised to kill his girlfriend) plays great I loved him. The guy from Gladiator is good and the kids are decent. The soundtrack is bad-ass if anything I would love that movie just for that. Although I love it for a different thing - the atmosphere. Yes it's really cool. There're scary moments where you go - d...m what a f...g s...t just happened and it's great. So the movie is great and the only complaint about it is the look of the alien well his... just watch the movie and find out for yourself.",8,1,6,5 July 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," It's an end... it's kind of sad
","Yeah - everything has to end which often is a bad thing, maybe even terrible. But oh well. From the first Harry Potter I've read(which is Prisoner of Azkaban) I fell in love with the series. Alone with The lord of the ring(hobbit included) it became my favorite story. It just has so much to it. So much spirit, heart and awesomeness. And now the end has come. OK that's enough of me rambling. So the screenplay. I thought it was pretty good, damn even really good. Of cause there are some lines that was much better in the book but the ending is awesome, I can even say that even though it's unlogical it's almost better then in the book(it would of been better if they said everything they said in the book during the fight). The acting is great. I loved leads perfomenses, loved Helena Bonham Carter and even though Alan could of done better than that I loved him too. The special effect's are the best I've seen. The 3D is awesome. It almost - yeah just almost - got that special book atmosphere. All in all it's the best movie about the young wizard and the best ending possible. Goodbye Harry - we were lucky enough to stay with you till the very end.",10,0,1,20 July 2011
The Fighter," Lifted
",So I just watched the fighter. I think the name Spirit would be better for this film. But let's start from the beginning. It's a story of Michy Ward who is a boxer. So his mother's his manager and his brother played by Bale is his trainer. Naturally his a good boxer but his brother who's on crack rarely comes to the training and when he comes he always late and his mother just a terrible manager who gives him all the wrong fights and he... but that's enough otherwise what's the point of watching it? So characters in this movie are great. All of them. All his family irritates you hell of a lot just like they're suppose to. My favorite two characters are Matt's and Christian's. Matt plays good but Bale is just... well he had to take crack when filming and I wouldn't be surprised if he did. So he plays here even better then in American phyco and in the dark knight which I thought was impossible. So there ain't any special effects but the boxing science look awesome. They much more interesting that real box of cause they don't show the whole match but what they do show is great. The ending is predictable as hell but it doesn't matter because you'll be enjoying this movie so much that you don't care about predictability. So if by the end of this movie you won't feel lifted you're just not human.,8,0,1,5 July 2011
