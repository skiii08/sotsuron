First Man," Ignore the Politics, Watch the Movie. Period.
","üëçüëç'First Man' is excellent on all accounts. A masterful film both dramatically and as a cinematic experience. It is easily a must see. And as for that flag controversy, could we all grow up? Yes, there is NO dedicated shot of the American flag being planted. There is merely a wide shot that shows both the lunar lander and the flag from a distance. The film doesn't rewrite history or try to be anti-American. The movie still goes out of its way to point out the event as an American achievement. Heck, it even had a French woman say something like 'I knew America could do it, I had faith'. If you choose to boycott this movie because of that one shot that wasn't in the movie...then that is honestly sad. And you if see it and then hate it for that reason, you completely missed the point of the film: Armstrong dealing with a personal family tragedy. In place of the flag planting, the film choose to focus on something more personal that many are lead to believe really happened. Honestly, I hope it did because it was beautiful. Much like the film itself. Go see it. Ignore the unwarranted hate. There are plenty of other movies that can be serve as the scapegoat of modern Hollywood bashing.",10,17,33,21 November 2018
Deadpool 2," 'Deadpool 2' Review: Pools in a Few Improvements
","'Deadpool 2' improves upon the previous film by providing a better narrative, a worthy villain, and well-staged action scenes to go along with all of the shock meta-humor from the first entry.Wade Wilson, aka Deadpool, (Ryan Reynolds) is enjoying the life of being an immortal merc with the mouth until this lifestyle leads to the death of his girlfriend (Morena Baccarin). To redeem himself, he takes it upon himself to save a tortured mutant child named Russell, aka Firefist, (Julian Dennison) from the law and the vengeance of a time-traveling soldier named Cable (Josh Brolin).I liked the first Deadpool film well enough, but I was far from a fan of it. Everything about the Deadpool character was well handled and Ryan Reynolds was perfect casting. Not all of the humor worked with me, but most of it did. All of those same points carry over into the sequel just as equally. My major issue with the first film was the fact that if you took away all the humor being pushed into your face, the superhero story being presented was just kind of by the numbers outside of the cancer aspect. A man gets superpowers at a cost, seeks revenge, and has his girlfriend kidnapped for the final. It was fun, but there was just something about it that didn't make me love it. Perhaps the humor was too much? I tend to prefer subtlety more. Outside of that, the film had a lame villain and little to no action scenes. Luckily, number two fixes those things.The story here seems to find more serious ground than the first and made some effort to give the Deadpool character a little heart. All the humor is still there, but things do feel more balanced. That's not to say every joke landed, but most of them did. The film is still a lampoon, but that feels like an extension of the character's behavior and not at the expense of the narrative.Josh Brolin's Cable is a big assist to this. Just in appearances alone, he crushes the first film's attempt at an antagonist. A half-human, half-robot super soldier with a metal arm and multifunction gun that makes the Winter Soldier look like a wimp, even with a burnt teddy bear strapped to his belt. His character is very similar to that of a Terminator, sent back to eliminate Firefist in the past before he becomes a threat later. Actually, the whole plot is like 'Terminator 2', considering the use of child and a seemingly immortal protector.An invincible hero can often be a problem since we as an audience know that there is no real danger. This can make action scenes rather pointless from a dramatic standpoint. Maybe that's why the first film didn't do much in the way of creative comic book fights (aside from the highway scene). In any case, 'Deadpool 2' ups the ante by providing more superhero action this time around, and it's all done very well, thanks in large part to the new director, David Leitch. He is known best for his choreography involvement in some of the best fights in American film and co-director of 'John Wick' (aka 'one of the men that killed John Wick's dog' as the credits say). The film sports some good set pieces, with the raid on a prison convey being the highlight.Outside of those three points, everything is basically the same as the last film. If you really enjoyed that one, you are likely to enjoy this one around the same level. Personally, I still think some of the humor does fall flat and tries too hard to be funny. The Deadpool films like to throw in everything and the kitchen sink, as the saying goes. (Ironically, as one of the posters LITERALLY acknowledges a kitchen sink). Either way, there is just an odd feeling when a film is constantly trying to get you to laugh at everything. I say it works at least 75% of the time. For me, a better example of a humorous superhero film was 'Thor: Ragnarok' from last year. Still, to each their own. I definitely felt 'Deadpool 2' was an improvement.There are plenty of post-credit scenes to wait for with great payoffs. I should note that there isn't one at the very end. So, you don't have to wait around.",7,1,3,24 May 2018
Ready Player One," 'Ready Player One' Review: High score for Spielberg
","'Ready Player One' brings back the fun Steven Spielberg with an old-fashioned, effects-laden adventure where the world is often more important than its characters. Still, this world is guaranteed to entertain fans of nostalgia both young and old, even if the older crowd will find the basic plot formulaic and predictable.The film is sort of like how 'Tron' was back in 1982 if you replaced the made-up characters and environments with those of actual pop cultural icons. The future setting of the film is so displeasing that the majority of the population has chosen to enjoy their time inside the OASIS, a virtual reality video game where you can basically do anything or be anything. The socially awkward creator of this game James Halliday, now deceased, has left a three-step challenge that if completed, will grant the victor access to control the OASIS. The story follows Wade Watts and his friends on a quest to complete the challenge before an evil corporation that is bent on seizing control of the OASIS through the completion of the challenges and turning it into what would essentially be a pop-up ad heaven (or hell, depending on your perspective).'Ready Player One' is a great visual experience first and foremost. The use of nostalgia feels more as a means to be realistic rather than a means to capitalize on one's childhood. There are plenty of moments that are just there to be pointed out as Easter eggs, but it never distracts from the core story. The adventure inside the OASIS is fun and immersive in the classic Spielberg sense with the balance of seriousness and humor being on point. The film also does manage to throw in good messages and satire about society being obsessed with trying to escape the real world, often at the consequence of losing touch with the things of true value in the real world. The best example of this is the idea of teenagers developing a 'relationship' online despite never seeing each other face to face. As one character quotes, 'You only see and hear what I want you to.' The message is also pushed via Halliday who chose to devote so much time to his own pop culture safe space, that he lost a close friend and a chance for love in the process. So in a sense, pop culture does serve an actual purpose. Still, purpose or not, it is very gitty to see so much on screen at once. I particularly jumped onto the fanboy train once the heroes entered the second stage of the challenge, which involves navigating a certain popular horror film which I shall not reveal.This is definitely a film for kids, who will likely walk away with this ironically becoming a nostalgic part of their own childhoods. Adults will also have a lot of fun, but as an adult, I can't help but notice some things. For one, there really isn't much to the core plot. Outside the OASIS, things are pretty basic. The human characters are mostly just base level and, oddly enough, are overshadowed by the colorful avatar counterparts. The plot of an evil corporation, an underground resistance, and the inevitable revolution of little people vs elites has been done time and time before and sadly the film does nothing to mix up that narrative. The story goes pretty much where you expect outside of the visual package that is unique to 'Ready Player One's' style. The characters aren't bad and all the actors are great, but only two really walk away with memorable depth: Watts's love interest Art3mis and OASIS creator James Halliday. Also, the exposition was very heavy at the beginning of the film. While some was necessary, there did come a point where I felt the voiceover narration from Watts was going overboard.Most of this is just nitpicking as none of that ruins the overall fun factor of the picture. The world of the OASIS is worth price of admission and some good, timely messages do manage to speak through without feeling preachy or political. The fact that the nostalgia feels like it has an artistic purpose really impressed me, but I can't deny I will likely indulge into more viewings just to find all the pop culture Easter eggs I likely missed...for fanboy satisfaction.Recommended.

Bohemian Rhapsody," Give Queen the Prize!
","üëçüëç
Gosh, what an entertaining film. I mean, not going to lie, any film featuring an extensive Queen soundtrack is usually already gonna get a bump up in my book. (ala 'Flash Gordon' and 'Highlander') So, a biopic about Freddie Mercury already has an advantage with me. But then go out of your way to add a great story with a fantastic cast and solid direction that is both slick and stylistic and you got a winner. Rami Malek deserves an Oscar nomination, period. The man literally transforms into Mercury. Go watch any retro behind the scenes clips of the real man and you can see for yourself. He managed to deliver Freddie's heightened personality and his more emotional behind the scenes moments, namely his fight with his sexual desires between the woman he loves and the men he also can't seem to stay away from either. The rest of the cast delivered as well. I particularly enjoyed Mike Myers as a music executive that isn't all that fond of Queen's efforts to break from traditional formulas. Bryan Singer and Dexter Fletcher both deliver a well directed movie that thankfully doesn't feel like the mess that 'Justice League' was when it's original director had to jump ship. Not only is it sheer entertainment, but there are legit moments that had me tearing up a bit. If a movie can do that, then it is REALLY doing a good job. I think critics are just bunch of sour pusses with this one. 55% on Rotten Tomatoes? Tell that the 95% of the audience that loved it. The only way I could see someone not a least enjoying this movie is if they just don't like Queen in the first place. Which, if that is the case, you probably got other issues to worry about honestly. I do think the movie could have gone deeper into Freddie's life with his family. Actually, it could gone deeper with many things. But, nothing about the movie feels chopped out. Go see it! On the biggest screen if possible because the Live Aid concert is more than worth it the extra cost.",9,4,6,21 November 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," 'Avengers: Infinity War' Review: A War to Marvel Over
","Where is the 'Infinity War' review? What is an 'Infinity War' review? I got one better...WHY is 'Infinity War' review?.....okay that was a stupid reference.'Avengers: Infinity War' gives fans the quality battles and banter they were expecting out of Marvel's biggest comic hero mash-up yet, but also takes things to a new high with a bold ending and providing the best MCU villain to date.Following the breakup of the Avengers, the Earth and the entire universe is finally the target in the crosshairs of an alien war lord named Thanos, who seeks to collect all six infinity stones so that he can gain the power to exterminate half the population of the universe at the snap of a finger...literally. To take on this threat, not only do the Avengers have to get along with each other again, but team up with the Guardians of the Galaxy to save the day. But can they?This film is basically review-proof. You can barely talk about anything because just about anything would be considered a spoiler. Thanos plays an Easter egg hunt for 6 glowing power rocks and our heroes, broken into various parties, try to stop him from doing so. The film wastes no time getting to the point and never really has a moment where the film tones down its breakneck pace. Even in dramatic moments the film never drags on too long with any obstacle. Clocking in at 2 hours and 40 minutes, the film never feels its length.Character interaction was arguably the highlight of the original 'Avengers' from 2012 and that is, even more, the case with 'Infinity War'. The new characters added to the Marvel roster are now thrown into the mix and the filmmakers clearly did their homework to make the sure the right individuals were mixed together to maximize the comedic effect. The best example of this is the mix of Thor and the Guardians. If someone back in 2008 would have coined the idea of paring the God of Thunder with a smart mouthing space raccoon (or rabbit if you ask Thor), reasonably the almighty film judges would have thrown the screen booking right at them without hesitation. However, to no one in 2018's surprise the combo works better than one could have dreamed. Then there is the matching of Iron Man (power by science) with Doctor Strange (power by magic). The more Strange appears in films the more I want another Doctor Strange solo film. Except with a good villain next time.Speaking of good villains, that has been a notorious issue with Marvel films. At best, the antagonists are just fine and get the job done, but rarely has there been a villain who steals the show or really proves to be much of a threat. Black Panther more or less yanked the chain along with Guardians 2 and Spiderman: Homecoming. Now comes 'Infinity War' with Thanos to break the chain. Just in the opening scene alone, the film establishes Thanos as a legitimate threat to our heroes. Not only is he a well presented threat, but he is also a well-defined character. Josh Brolin, who is basically good in everything, provides such a good performance that you almost start to reason with his character's plight...even if genocide is a part of the equation of it all. This really is his film in the end.On the matter of 'ends', the climax of this film is a new definition of daring not only to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but superhero films in general. I can't say what occurs, but needless to say, it will be interesting to see how they go about following it up. Remember, even though 'Part I' isn't in the title, this is a two-part story that ends in a cliffhanger.There are no real negatives to speak of here. I personally still put 'Civil War' as the best of the MCU. I felt that film handled complex social issues and political differences in an interesting way and for me, watching heroes go against each other is more tragic then fighting another common enemy. I also felt the action had more interesting choreography. The battles are well handled in 'Infinity War'... it is a war film after all...kind of in the title. Still, there wasn't really an 'airport scene' or 'omg Cap and Iron Man are fighting' scene. The action is grand, but it's not necessarily one of 'Infinity War's' highlights in my opinion.Still, it is very impressive when the highlight of a superhero film is the dramatic moments and not the action. 'Infinity War' provides a quality dosage of both and should be more than enough to keep the core audience healthy and hungry for the next chapter in the MCU.",9,1,5,19 May 2018
A Quiet Place," Psssst.....'A Quiet Place' is a Good Place
","................................................oh sorry, I was trying to be quiet with the review. Oops.Whispers: 'A Quiet Place' serves as one of the freshest and most well-directed thriller/horror experiences to date by successfully reinventing the use of one of horror's biggest tropes: the silence before the scare.Sometime before the present story, alien creatures arrived on earth that are blind as a bat but have a heightened sense of sound and speed to track their prey. These creatures appear to have wiped out the majority of the population (both human and animal alike) with only a few scattered families remaining, including the protagonist unit of the Abbot family. This family attempts to survive on limited resources and deal with each other's family drama all the while having to remain as silent as possible to hide from 3 creatures lurking in their woods.The gimmick of the film is that characters have to refrain from all loud noises in order to survive. Even the simple sounds of walking on leaves or creaky floors and even moving plastic board game pieces could attract unwanted attention. If that can get you killed, image what knocking over a lantern could do. Or you could also try to give birth to a baby. The idea of using silence to heighten fear is nothing new to horror, but in 'A Quiet Place' the technique is made even more effective as now ANY sound is deadly and scary. It practically makes the use of jump scares seem less lazy again.Since the characters can't make even make heavy foot noises, the use of speech is rendered useless and characters must rely on American Sign Language as the main form of communication...translated to the audience via subtitles. This was first used efficiently on the big screen with Fox's new Planet of the Ape trilogy for the ape to ape dialogue. With a few exceptions where characters are near spots making natural noises louder than their voices, this is a dialogue-free film. One could compare the film to that of a foreign made one with subtitles or even the old silent pictures of the 1920s. 'A Quiet Place' relies mostly on visuals and saves its moments of sound like it is a limited resource. I am sure some audiences will find this boring after some time...because lord forbid there be even an ounce of patience left in the general audience today. Still, I can safely say 'A Quiet Place' handles these techniques to the highest level of quality.This is made possible from director and lead star John Krasinski who proves that both behind the camera and in front of it, he is more than just 'Jim from the Office'. Krasinski helms the film in a very Hitchcockian manner or even that of Kubrick's 'The Shining'. It's deliberate and slow, allowing for the audience to take in the atmosphere and the rules of the world in a smart way. The audience is treated with the respect to put all the pieces together by delivering the exposition only in visual or implied means. In a sense, the lack of dialogue forces the film to use old-fashioned storytelling, which makes for good storytelling overall.The only complaints are mostly nitpicks based around certain moments of character behavior. Some characters do things that you really would think they would be smart enough not to, such as keeping a toy that literally was just established as a noisemaker or running off into the woods by yourself to throw a private hissy fit (though to be fair, the whole 'unrealistically foolish decisions' thing seems to be a common trope for horror movies in general).Then there was the plot point of the mom of the family being pregnant. In a world where noise is literally death, why would you risk getting pregnant (it is clear she got like this AFTER the world went into a mute hell)? Even more so...how did you manage to 'procreate' without making noise? On second thought, perhaps the less we know the better...Still, these are little nitpicks that are basically overshadowed by all the greatness around them. 'A Quiet Place' takes a seat right next to last year's 'It' as modern-day proof that horror can still be superb. But if you feel the need to give a standing ovation...remember: silent claps.P.S. In reference to the people that sat behind me in the theater: If you saw the film prior to bringing your friends to see it again...perhaps don't say what's about to happen. That would be greatly appreciated, please.",9,6,11,19 May 2018
Black Panther," 'Black Panther' Review: Another solid Marvel film, but not a Masterpiece
","'Black Panther' serves as yet another solid entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, showcasing a wildly different world feel and a deeper story than previous entries, while still providing the staples that the devoted fan base enjoys. Many critics and audiences are proclaiming this as the best of the series and even saying that the film is a masterpiece. I feel that is stretch as there are some apparent issues with film's execution of action, effects, and actual focus of the story, regardless of depth. 'Black Panther' is indeed a good film, but not a 'masterpiece'.The story follows T'Challa aka the Black Panther, sometime after 'Captain America: Civil War', finally taking the throne of his late father in the advanced hidden capital of Wakanda, an African country pretending to be a typical third world nation. When an old enemy pops up again, the new king finds himself face to face with a mysterious American mercenary with stirring obsession with Wakanda.The story to 'Blank Panther' is actually really good and goes a step above the usual in the MCU with plenty of emotional depth to its characters and not relying too much on previous films in the series. I will refrain from speaking on it to hold back spoilers. I will say that the story basically becomes the 'Lion King'. Nuff said.Our hero is very likable and never does anything to break his status as a good role model. Chadwick Boseman created a fan favorite with Civil War and those qualities carry over here.The villains are also above par, which for me has always been an issue with Marvel movies: a lot effort for the hero and the villain is just a one note baddy played by a high profile actor. Andy Serkis returns to replay his role of Klaue from 'Age of Ultron', providing yet another over the top and energetic performance. His character isn't deep, but he knows how to chew the scenery. Yet again, this man proves he should have more roles, even outside motion capture. Then there is Michael B. Jordan as Killmonger. I won't spoil his character, but needless to say Jordan continues to show why he is one the new greats by providing an entertainingly defiant and yet emotionally involving villain. It's nice to actually have one that was an understandable reason for his behavior.From the beauty of the advanced world of Wakanda to the superb soundtrack by Ludwig Goransson, the film provides a great blend of native African culture mixed with a futuristic cyberpunk style. The film is downright beautiful at times, especially during the spiritual ancestorial plain scenes. There is even a hint of James Bond through a scene where T'Challa is given a new suit and gadgets ala every Q scene ever. Boseman's charm helps with that vibe too.As I said, the film is not a masterpiece. First off, while I do like the story over all, I do feel like there is was one story going on and the then another one just sorta starts halfway through. The film is pretty focused on Klaue until the halfway point where in which Killmonger suddenly just takes center stage. I found that little jarring. I guess Klaue was just a means to an end. I also found the fight scenes to be rather meh. The action itself is good with some great set-pieces such as cool chase scene in South Korea. I mainly mean the coverage of the one on one fights. They were just shot too close and cut too quick at times, making it hard to really appreciate the conflict. You just get the idea that people are beating down on each other. This is why I praise movies like 'John Wick' or 'The Foreigner' for actually covering visible fight scenes. I also found the final conflict at the end to be disappointing as it was ruined by some pretty meh CGI. It honestly looked like a 3D animated cartoon by the end. The CGI was actually iffy in some other areas too, and this late into the MCU that shouldn't be the case. It sorta looks like 'Gods of Egypt' at times. (A guilty pleasure by the way) Also, some of the camera work as just headache inducing. One shot in particular where it starts upside down and spins around really just hurt my eyes. I get the idea: 'the situation has been turned upside down so let's literally shoot this in an unnerving way'. Ultimately, it just gave me a headache.Despite these issues, I still think 'Black Panther' is a solid entry in the Marvel cannon and I am excited to see more of Wakanda in the upcoming 'Infinity War'. I just feel some are making this sound better than it really is. It is really good movie, but not a great one. I feel perhaps it might be some the politics of the film that is raising it up to 'masterpiece' level. I just don't care about that. I just care about whether it was a good movie or not. 'Black Panther' was good. Recommended.",7,0,1,19 May 2018
