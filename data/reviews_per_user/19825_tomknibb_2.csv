Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," worth about six dollars to see
","This film is very entertaining, exciting and worthwhile, especially for the die-hard 'Star Wars' fan.  It is rather eerie to watch Anakin Skywalker as a young boy, knowing that he will eventually turn into the evil Darth Vader in later movies.",Null,0,0,31 August 1999
The Sixth Sense," SPOILERS
","Bruce Willis as Malcolm doesn't figure out until the end that he's dead. This is not possible.  He tries several times before that to talk to his wife and she rarely says anything.  If that were happening all the time and no one EVER reacted to him, he would know within a few hours. Also, some people have posted here not knowing why the mother was poisoning her daughter.  The answer is that she had a condition called Munchausen syndrome by proxy.  The screenwriters apparently assumed that the audience would know about that.",Null,0,0,14 December 2002
