10 Cloverfield Lane," Too many flaws
","As in many movies of the genre it is the sound effects that create the suspense. The plot raises more questions than it answers: why was Michelle restrained by the leg behind a heavily locked door? How come her leg healed so quickly? Why did her mobile phone work at all if everything out there was destroyed? Why was the bunker lit by so many power consuming lamps? The movie did not convey a sense of time, how long after the disaster was it before that woman banged on the outside door? The sutured cut on the forehead healed nicely, how long does that take? The more I think about that movie the more crap I think it was except for Goodman who was excellent.",4,7,20,10 March 2016
