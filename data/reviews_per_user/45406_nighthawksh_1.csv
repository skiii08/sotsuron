Walk the Line," good as far as it went
","The film was great, as far as it went. There is so much more to the Johnny Cash story. .The years he spent in Nashville sharing an apartment with Waylon were very important in his life. The film only devoted a few scenes to that. Waylon Jennings later came to be a large influence in his life, which was not addressed.The drug issue was not covered as throughly as he did in his autobiographies. I would like to have seen more emphasis on his addiction and the hell he went through to kick it. After he wed June, he travel led a lot, including to Vietnam during the war, plus his own TV show. Then there were 'the Highwaymen' years.J R Cash was much more than 'the man who wed June Carter.' I would like to have seen the film show that, not just be another romance story.I would hope they could do a sequel",7,0,0,6 April 2006
