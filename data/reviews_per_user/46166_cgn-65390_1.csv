Blade Runner 2049," The Golden Rule Of Sequels Remains Intact
","Matching the majesty of Blade Runner in a sequel was always going to be an uphill task and mission impossible and, unfortunately, BR 2049 is not capable of an upside surprise.With so much room to play with (this film is shy of three hours long) and a budget rumoured to be over $150 the meandering and pointless story fails to ignite the imagination beyond the obvious visuals in front of the audience.The chief of police was probably the best actor in the film and showed a lot of conviction, but even she suffered from a bad script. When the replicant lies to her about his task being accomplished she instantly believes him. What was her job again? Next when a thus has mal-intent towards her what happens? The thug waltzes into her office with no one on guard or standing in the way. Then there is Deckard who is living in opulence in a palatial setting that would make Trump green with envy (although that guy is envious day in and day out, ah nvm...).One fears Ridley and Villeneuve want to do to Blade Runner what has been done to Alien and make a joke of it all. Let's hope I am wrong (again).",Null,8,16,16 October 2017
