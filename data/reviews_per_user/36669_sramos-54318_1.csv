Your Name.," Awesome
",One of the best works of mark. It has exceeded my high expectations for by a mile. The emotions are thoroughly felt through out the movie.The irony of beloved ones turning into strangers and the desperation both the characters show and their struggle to stay together is very touching. The animation is lagging in some scenes but the overall movie is one of the best i ever watched. The good thing which gives warmth to the heart is that in the end both of them finally met each other. The ending for his other works like 5 centimeters per second leave a person with tears but this movie has it all. I would recommend this to every anime fan and also to those looking for a movie full of emotions.,10,2,6,14 January 2017
