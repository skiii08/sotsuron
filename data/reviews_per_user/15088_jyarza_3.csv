Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great movie although the other Star Wars movies were better
","Well, it was a very good movie, but there wasn't so much action and suspense as in the other Star Wars movies. The only thing that is better in this movie are the special effects, of course. The movie starts slow and boring but the ending is full of action. Besides, all Star Wars fans must watch it, it starts explaining the whole situation of the other movies.",10,8,11,15 September 2000
Children of Heaven," Wonderful
","Oh, well what can I say about this movie? It is so touching. It is unbelievable how the writer could make a whole story from a very simple thing: a boy, Ali, that loses a pair of shoes after picking them up from a shoe repair store. This shoes where for Zarah, Ali's sister, who needed them to go to school. They donÂ´t tell their parents about what happened and try to solve everything by themselves. It has many funny situations, but also very dramatic ones. However, I didnÂ´t like the ending. It's very strange.",Null,1,1,5 October 2000
The Exorcist," Good, but not scary
","The acting, directing and producing of this movie were wonderful. The plot was also very good. But sorry, I wasn´t scared at all. I was actually laughing in some of the scenes. To be honest, I haven´t watched any movie that has actually scary, and I've seen Halloween, Scream, I know what you did..., Psycho, and none of this are actually scary for me. Maybe for a little child, but an adult... Come on!!!!",Null,0,1,20 April 2001
