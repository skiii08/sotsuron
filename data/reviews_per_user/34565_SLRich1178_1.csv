The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Amazing
","This was the first Twilight movie that I actually saw in the theater. I was blown away. I was very skeptical about watching the first Twilight. It took me a year or more after it came out to decide to give it a shot. So many people were telling me how it was a 'teen' type film. Wow! They were wrong. I was hooked the minute I watched them. They got better and better and better. I can not wait until breaking Dawn 2 comes out 11-16-2012. Yes, I am following it that much. I was in such anticipation for the wedding that I almost could not contain myself. It was amazing how they made it work, it was all very breath taking. I think that they made the sex scene very tasteful and what it should be between two people that have waited. Then, when it came to Bella being pregnant and looking the way that she did, they did an amazing job at making her like like pure heck! When Jacob imprinted on Rennesme I cried so much. The only thing i think I was most mad about was the ending, but then again, they do have to make you want to see the second one. Come on November I am waiting!!!!!",10,1,6,30 April 2012
