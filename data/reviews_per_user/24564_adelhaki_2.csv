The Equalizer," not a fantastic film unbelievable abilities of the hero
","for me action movie should be a realistic one, i am not watching a science fiction movie while the hero has abnormal abilities, considering that he is a human being. i saw the abilities of Denzel Washington near those Arnold Schwarzenegger has in terminator movie, and its not fits the differences between pure action film and a one which has in it a science fiction sides. also no one can defeat an army specially when we talks about a Russian mafia gangs, the master exaggerated scene was when Denzel break into the mafia boss castle facing no resistance, killing him and walk away on peace, how ironic specially while Denzel left with no wounds. the movie has its nice sides of entertaining and it full of action and rapid strikes. There was a rush in the end As if the filmmaker note that the film Has lasted too long, so he decided to end it skipping some action scenes that are necessary to complete the whole image. so you can see it if you have enough time and not interested in details.",5,3,6,18 December 2014
Mother!," nothing to watch in this one
","3 stars is away over the true mark that this movie deserve, i am shock how ridiculous can writers and producers can get. you spend two hours in order to entertain yourself or remove the cover from the truth, but its too lazy when found out that you lose your time for nothing. no entertainment,no wisdom and lazy conclusions, so frankly i don't recommend this movie to any one, else i will be cheating the others and make them see a movie which don't deserve any viewers. skip this one and find to your self another good movie.",3,6,10,8 December 2017
