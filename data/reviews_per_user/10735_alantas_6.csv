Source Code," Serve in death
","This film could had been great. I think the story is decent, the plot well crafted (just don't think about it too much :)) and it relies more on acting and human interaction, than mindless action. It has it's flaws, but they are not as nearly irritating as the 'war on terrorism' and Afghanistan war hero BS. It feels like the government and it's agencies own Hollywood. You know what? If you are a true American soldier, you will serve your country after you die... If you block this part out of your mind, you may enjoy this film. If they were conducting the source code experiment at a university and they used a man, who let's say offered his body for scientific purposes, I would give this film a 7. But I can't overlook the annoying propaganda, so it's a 5.",5,1,2,16 June 2011
City of God," Mean and cruel
","I saw City of god two days ago on the national TV. I was shocked. For me it's more than massacre, that's what I read on a Hungarian site. The critic also said that poverty and violence are cheap export merchandise. It's good fuel for any film and keeps you in your seat. I can't argue with that. Definitely it kept me in my seat, but not only because it's extremely violent. The most important for me is atmosphere. And Cidade de Deus really has it. Pulls you in, and won't let go. I felt the choking air full of dust in the favella. The story is fast, the characters are great. Real? I don't think so. But it gives you a strong feeling, an impression about misery and you think: that's like when god leaves his children alone. If you watch closely you can find humor and irony.",10,1,3,5 June 2007
Clash of the Titans," I still can't believe this is soo bad
","I've seen the original film about a thousand times. I think because it is charming, the characters are likable and the medusa scene give me the creeps till this day. This remake has no values. At all. I don't want to offend anyone who took part in the making but I'd like to know that what audience is this made for? It's too violent for kids and has nothing to say to adults. Next time watch the original before making a remake and build on it's values. Modern filmmakers really have to learn that CGI orgy has nothing to do with quality. It's like writing a book based on the words length and how they sound. I have the feeling that the script was written in two hours during a hangover by a twelve year old. Am I getting old? I don't think so, but todays high budget CGI films are made for the dumb.",1,2,3,1 August 2010
Midsommar," Style over substance
","I watched this movie, because it popped up on some 'best films of '19' lists.
I appreciate brave film making and daring to be different, but I also appreciate stories, that make some sense. It felt to me that trying to shock the audience was more important, than anything else. There's a long buildup, that leads to nowhere. I found myself laughing at some points, because this film tries ridiculously hard to make people uncomfortable. It might have worked if the characters had some actual depth, or it was done in a more subtle manner.
In the first ten minutes I thought to myself, that this film tries to copy Hereditary (which I liked) in a bad way and later found out, that this is from the same director. It isn't a bad thing to have a distinct style, but in this movie, the theatrical elements outweigh the actual message, whatever that was. Was I supposed to care about any of the characters? Was this supposed to be an atmospheric cult horror? I mean a horror about a cult. If there's a hidden meaning to all this, it was so well hidden, I couldn't find it. Otherwise it was dragged out needlessly long.",5,5,7,27 December 2019
Prometheus," Flirts with mediocrity too much
","As a true fan of the Alien franchise and Ridley Scott, I wanted to like this film very much. I didn't want to believe the bad reviews, yet they are right when they say this film is mediocre in a lot of ways. In certain aspects the viewer feels that if a little more thought went into them, they could have turned out much better... like the characters for instance. The smallest problem with them that they are very clichÃ©, the bigger problem is, that they are really dumb. Not for scientists, but for average people. It seems like they lack common sense in several situations. Thanks to the bad writing, you never have the sense of reality which helped significantly the first Alien film to gain its cult status. In short, the whole film is watered down to the level of your average Hollywood popcorn flicks in terms of character interactions. Another huge let down is, that there are annoying plot holes all over. You get the feeling, that they had to cut out important scenes at the expense of making sense. And I'm a guy who usually willing to look over this kind of stuff, if its not downright insulting to intelligence. Now let me write a few thoughts about the design. Stuff that worked before, still works. The Prometheus, the suits and the gadgets are okay. But at some scenes I felt, they were made only to show, 'look guys how much stuff our computers can render'! Simple case of overdoing stuff, because they had the budget and resources. Prometheus isn't all bad, it has some really worthwhile scenes where I felt, that Mr. Scott still has it. Unfortunately these are greatly overshadowed by the flaws. Michael Fassbender is definitely the best among the acting crew, his performance alone worth seeing this film. Overall my opinion is, that Prometheus could have been much better if it didn't want to impress the widest audience possible so badly and just a little more thought went into the writing. Still enjoyable, but a lot of us expected more.",6,2,6,14 September 2012
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The lack of originality is strong with this one
","I watched this movie today and the more I think about it, the worse it seems. As a lot of people said it before me, it's the shameless recycle of episode IV. JJ ruined Star Trek and now Star Wars, but in a different way. Let's face it, this whole show was a huge marketing stunt and not much more. The story lacks depth and very uninteresting, given that we've seen it all before. It's simply unbelievable, that they couldn't come up with anything original. Or is this what the masses wanted? The rating shows, that apparently they wanted this, indeed. So everyone who worries about spoilers, just chill, because it's a remake, with technically more advanced visuals and without the charm. Horrible pacing, not very good acting, lame Darth Vader wannabe evil guy and no memorable moment to mention. Not even the death of Han Solo... sad. To say something positive: the design is great, I liked very much the practical effects and the movie looks very good overall. It definitely doesn't belong to the list of the best movies of all time. I won't hurry so much, to see the next one. Hugely disappointed...",1,36,53,21 December 2015
