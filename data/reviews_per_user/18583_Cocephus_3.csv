Alien 3," So much potential...
","In light of the first 2 Alien movies (both of which are in IMDB's top 100), Alien 3 is a huge disapointment. The characters seem poorly developed, the action is stale, and in the end, our heroine plunges to her death, presumably killing the chance for any sequels (boy, they should have listened... 'Alien: Resurrection' should have never been made). However, David Fincher, a director who's proved his potential with 'Seven' and 'Fight Club', knew exactly what kind of movie he was trying to make. Executives at Fox cut out nearly an hour of his final movie, so much so that he didn't even want his name attributed to the final project. The film had the potential to be great (check out the list of deleted scenes on the message board sometime) but due to studio interference, came out as less than mediocre. *** SPOILERS *** On the bright side, Sigourney Weaver's at her toughest, dealing with the loss of the girl she thought of as her daughter and the news that she's carrying the next alien queen in her chest (another slightly confusing aspect that the shortened film didn't address). Lawrence Fishborne gives a characteristically strong performance, and the alien looks better in this film than in any other movie of the series (the first 2 films showed very little of the creatures themselves; Resurrection's CGI often looked plain ridiculous). In the end, this is a film directed not by David Fincher, but by Fox. I can't wait to see the director's cut due out in June to see the potential that this film should have lived up to.",Null,0,2,23 March 2003
Alien," The Standard for all Sci-Fi afterwards
","I originally saw Alien only a few years ago, after I had seen special-effects laden knockoffs like 'Starship Troopers' and even the last two films of the Alien franchise, and I was blown away. Ridley Scott's bleak characterization of corporate-controlled space travel strips away all the romantic, swashbuckling ideals that 'Star Wars' had laid down only a few years earlier, and H.R. Geiger's horrific set and creature design created a terrifying new vision for moviegoers. To say that the movie starts off slow is an understatement: Scott drags out his film for the first hour or so, giving us little to sink our teeth into and emphasizing again and again the concept of 'space truckers' rather than 'space explorers'. The crew dresses casually and follows no set protocol: we see that these are not zealous scientists, but real people trying to make a buck and get back to their families. However, when the crew is enticed by a tidy explorer's payment to examine a strange distress call, the film picks up into an eerie, gut-wrenching exploration of a derelict spacecraft carrying very hazardous cargo.*** SPOILER'S WARNING*** Of course, the true turnaround event of the film is John Hurt's classic 'chestbursting' scene. Legend has it that the cast of the film had no idea what was going to happen, as Scott wanted all of their reactions to be authentic, and they are nothing if not that. The race of Sigourney Weaver's Ripley against both time and the creature at the end of the movie keeps the viewer absolutely glued to the screen, and just when we thought it was safe to go back in the airlock, we're given a skillfully maneuvered twist ending that directors like M. Night Shyamalan are still using for last-minute scares. The inclusion of Weaver as the heroine in a movie like this was a slap in the face to both sci-fi and horror traditions. As is evident with Carrie Fisher in 'Star Wars' and Shelly Duvall in 'The Shining', damsels in distress were the moviemaking rage when 'Alien' was released; we were provided instead with a cool, collective leading lady who used every instrument at her disposal to save herself and, of course, her cat. While  'Aliens' was a fantastic, although very different, sequel, the remaining films in the franchise have been disappointing at best (God-awful at worst). The original, though, set a standard for sci-fi horror, and film in general, that is still looked up to today.",Null,0,1,28 October 2002
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," An Instant Classic
","`The fourth film by Quinton Tarantino', as the credits shamelessly explain, is yet another bankable classic from a director who's already changed the art with `Reservoir Dogs', `Pulp Fiction' and `Jackie Brown'.From `Kill Bill's first surprising gunshot to its monumental cliffhanger ending (right up there with `Luke, I am your father'),  the movie is relentlessly intense, tearing an audience between wanting more action and wanting a cigarette to calm frayed nerves. We follow the tale of `The Bride' (played to convincing, vengeful perfection by Uma Thurman) as she sets out to murder her former colleagues, members of the `Deadly Viper Assassination Squad', and their leader, the enigmatic, faceless Bill. After attempting to leave the group of assassins for a normal life, the Bride is tracked down on her wedding day and witnesses the murder of her wedding party, right before Bill puts her in a coma. Four years later, a very angry Bride wakes up.Tarantino pulls no punches, creating, as one critic put it, `The most violent film ever released by an American film distributor'. Squirting blood and flying limbs abound, but the director does it all with a breathtaking sense of style. We witness one sword-dance in silhouette, one in black and white, one over a beautifully filmed snow-covered Japanese garden, and even a sequence in Anime. `KB's story is minimal, but Tarantino's aim is style: Sergio Leone, Cheh Chang and Bruce Lee are all paid homage, and then gracefully outdone.The soundtrack, primarily Japanese artists performing American styles, is haunting: Tarantino breaks form by not using well-known American classic rock (who could forget being `Stuck in the Middle' of Mr. Blonde and a helpless cop?), but by doing so sets the perfect mood of the film. They're songs we've never heard before, but feel strangely connected to.Yes, the movie is in two volumes. However, the end feels right, coming after an epic battle that puts `Reloaded's `Burly Brawl' to shame. `Kill Bill' is a testament to Tarantino's ability to take the craft of his idols and make it his own, mixing classic cult film style and mixing it with his own wicked sense of Cool. Not for the faint of heart or anyone looking for a `feel-good' film, but `Kill Bill' is at the very least an instant classic.",Null,121,249,12 October 2003
