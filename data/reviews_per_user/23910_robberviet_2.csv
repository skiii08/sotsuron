Your Name.," Magic in real life
","The movie started with one simple idea: The feeling that you have when you met someone for the first time. Similar. Warm. Touching. Just like you have known each other for such a long time, and somehow, you was separated. And you know deep in your heart that you are still looking for that one every single day, you will know right away when you met each other. With that simple idea Makoto Shinkai have developed and built a master piece have in the name: Your name. Taki is a city boy. Mitsuha is a country girl. They have different life, not to mention totally opposite. But by a mystic power, they are connected to each other, through space, time. A lot of thing happened for various reasons, and they have forgot each other. But deep inside, they both feel a gap, a hole which cannot be filled. They neither understand nor explain, but they know that they are looking for each other. It might take months, years, lives but they know they will recognize each other immediately... I have to mention again: the movie is such a masterpiece. The story is touching and meaningful. It is magical yet it is familiar with everyone of us. The animation is beautiful. Story telling is good and logical. The music in the movie is something special. It is not just matching and touching, it is also affected the movie itself. If you read the book, you will find out that even before they met, RADWIMPS and Makoto had the same thought about the original idea. A lot of thing in the story had been changed according to the lyrics. If you have enjoyed other movie of Makoto like 5cm per seconds, you will enjoy this movie too. To me, this movie is nothing but one the best two anime of all time, with Spirited Away.",10,4,6,9 July 2017
The Lion King," The best animation movie of all time
","Disney, Pixar, Ghibli... all of them have created wonderful movies which I can call classics. If I have to chose my 2nd most favorite movie, it will be really hard. However, if I have to choose my most favorite, there is no other than Lion King. Although it is a Disney movie, it is not just a movie for kids. You will enjoy this movie no matter how old you are. A classical plot, of course since it is inspired by Hamlet, can be easy to predict, but you will find all the little things and details combine together to make such a masterpiece. The opening - and of course the ending, the songs, Hakuna Matata, the lessons, the magnificent African view, the characters, the voice... The lessons in the movie is sure worth notice. The past can be hurt, but it is in the past! Sure, not typical magical Disney with a fantasy world. It's dark, betrayal, death, the fallen... But hey, that's what make it great!",10,1,1,28 November 2016
