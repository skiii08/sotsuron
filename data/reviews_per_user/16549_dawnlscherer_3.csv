The Lobster," My mouth was hanging open for most of the film
",Absolutely fascinating. Yorgos Lanthimos is a mad man and I love him for it. Dogtooth blew my mind. Lobster followed suit and was hands down my favorite movie of 2016. These films are so refreshingly weird and non-formulaic. Where can I stream The Killing of the Sacred Deer? Take my money!!,10,1,3,2 December 2017
Bohemian Rhapsody," Queen Censored
","What a sugary, surface level biopic of Queen. Where's the dirt? I guess I wanted to see more of Freddie's countless lovers and drug use. I would have liked to learn more about where certain lyrics came from. I would have liked to have learned anything..about the other band members. This seemed very watered down; like a version of Queen's story you could tell your 10 year old. The music of course was a lot of fun throughout. I think Rami's performance was good. It's not his fault they made the prosthetic teeth comically large.",5,7,10,31 January 2019
Bird Box," Once I realized...
","Once I realized that this movie was meant to be listened to in a different perspective than it was told from, I liked it a lot better. Those who saw the light experienced pure bliss, while those that refused to look at the light took refuge in a school for the blind.",8,1,2,30 July 2019
