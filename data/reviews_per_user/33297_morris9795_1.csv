Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Hysterical
","Borat is, without a doubt, the funniest movie I have ever seen. I don't think I ever stopped laughing. Whereas there were certain parts that were at least partially staged it does not take away from the movie at all. The scenes 'in Kazahkstan' are obviously staged but still very funny. I would recommend this movie to anyone with a sense of humor. Though for those of you considering taking your kids to see this be forewarned there is some nudity. Also, some of the scenes, though funny, are rather disgusting, i.e. the scene where Borat uses a toilet for a wash basin. Though this is mild compared to a later 'wrestling' scene. Regarless the movie is absolutely hysterical and the anti-Semetic jokes make it all the funnier since Cohen is Jewish. Even so some of them teeter on the lines of good taste. More than once I found myself laughing but commenting on how 'wrong' the statement was. Bottom line is, if crude humor, American ignorance, fecal matter, and male nudity don't bother you go see this movie. You are guaranteed to have a side-splitting good time.",10,2,13,5 November 2006
