Blade Runner 2049," Very authentic to the original but could have been better
","I just want to say right off the bat that I quite enjoyed the first Blade Runner film it was the first of its kind, a Neo-Noir tale that take place in the future. The film (which came out in 1982) was so influential that the theme, style and setting that Blade Runner establish was use in other films like A.I, Judge Dredd, both the original and remake of Total Recall and Ghost in the Shell (which has been recently remade). However despite been a fan of the original, I couldn't get into this film, it was overly long and both the story and plot were very weak.Going through the story as spoilers free as possible, the film takes place 30 years after the events of the first film. A Replicant by the name of K who is also a Blade Runner task to hunting down other Replicants like himself, after one mission he finds a box hidden under a dead tree which leads him to a bigger investigation about Replicants as well as finding out more about himself. Of course there is more to the story but that's as far as I can go without spoiling it.The problem that I find with Blade Runner 2049 is that it has very little substance in its story add this along with a paper thin plot and lack of proper character development and you have gotten a pretty boring film. It also doesn't help that the trailers for the film makes it look like an action heavy film when in reality is more of a poignant film a poor one at that. Speaking of misleading trailers Harrison Ford who is show prominently in the trailers is barely in the film, he doesn't even show up until the last 30 minutes of the movie serving only as a Damsel in distress for K to save.Everything else about the film is great from the special effects to the ambient music to the sound design. It feels like you are watching Blade Runner and doesn't feel like another movie with the word Blade Runner slap on it, it's very faithful to the original. The cast for the most part are really good in their roles and work well off one another. The only actor I thought was miscast was Jared Leto who I am starting to hate as an actor. He does nothing in this role other than giving us bland dialogue making a somewhat interesting character dull, kind of like what he did with the Joker in Suicide Squad. Having said that I do give the movie high praise, in an age in which nearly every movie is been rebooted this doesn't feel like a cash grab.",8,0,3,16 October 2017
