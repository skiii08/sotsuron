The Sound of Music," I couldn't fault a thing! A Masterpiece
","I've grown up with every Female generation in my Family Singing these Songs, so it's surprising I've only just got round to watching this now. I had no idea this Movie was so Dark! Starting with the Joyful opening which slowly progresses to an unpredictable Sinister Storyline.This is Top Cinema at it's best!! The Costumes, The Settings, The Actors, The catchy Song writing all get Top Marks from me. I even found myself so engrossed and feeling anxious with sudden urges to shout at the Screen, especially near the End.I couldn't fault a thing! It's such a shame that modern Film makers seen to have lost the ability to write such Masterpieces anymore. A Brilliant Movie!!!",10,28,28,17 December 2015
Ant-Man," vaguely watchable!
","All my predictions for this Film were pretty much spot on, with it being a Movie you shouldn't take too seriously, with Paul Rudd playing the same Role he always does and a script full on long 'Science' explanations to why things happen BUT if you forget all the 'Adult' complex Superhero Movies Marvel has just spent Years rebuilding it's reputation on, and try to put 'Honey! I shrunk the Kids' and 'It's a Bugs Life' as far out of your mind as possible by pretending you're 15 years old and back in 1985, This Movie is vaguely watchable! I still can't see how Ant-Man is gonna feature in a serious Avengers Movie as the whole concept seems a Parody of itself.. Still! It could've been worse, it wasn't a bigger shambles as Green Lantern and after all, Hawkeye was made an Avenger for just being good with an Arrow...",6,1,6,17 December 2015
Blade Runner," Utterly Superb!
","This is the first time I've seen this Movie and as there's seven different versions, I decided to watch 'The Director's Cut' it was utterly Superb!! The detailing, atmosphere, Characters, Special FX and the entire World it's set in was incredible. Futuristic Movies from this era were by far my favourite. My only fault with this Film was the fact I didn't really connect with Harrison Fords Character which made me not give a damn about his Love interest or the Journey on his part. All the other Characters were Cast perfectly in my opinion so other than that it's Brilliant and a must see!! I've now heard the 2007 Final Cut is even better...",8,0,2,17 December 2015
