The Sound of Music," The film, while not without its discrepancies, is a delight for all to enjoy.
","The Sound of Music has been, and probably always will be, one of my favorite films. While the historical discrepancies throughout the film are noticeable, and it does not correctly portray aspects of Austria during the time - that cannot be held accountable in the movie, because that is in fact what it is. A fictional movie based off of a Broadway musical. One cannot help but love the amiable and family-oriented film. Julie Andrews has a wonderful voice, and portrays the role of Maria as the optimistic nun who become nanny and then mother to the Von Trapp family well. Plummer, is not particularly my favorite character but he also portrays the captain in a decent manner.Wise is a experienced director and his experience is seen through the popularity and wonderful clips and action of the film. The songs of the movie are playful and fun to sing along with, and easily get stuck in your head. Overall I like the film and would definitely consider it well deserving of all is Awards and nominations.",7,5,14,27 November 2006
