The Blair Witch Project," It is very interesting this site and I like it a lot.
",I watch thriller films since i was 12 years old. This film was not what I was expected to be. I was expecting something else. Something with more terror or more dark feelings. They're screaming without reason. Only the last 15 minutes of the film was good. This is not the thriller of the year.,Null,0,0,12 December 1999
