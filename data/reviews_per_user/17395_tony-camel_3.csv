Casablanca," Outstanding...
","Casablanca is the sort of film that suffers from its reputation. People walk into it expecting to see the greatest film of all time and are disappointed when it doesn't measure up to their own pet faves. But if it doesn't have the depth of some masterpieces, it is certainly among the most entertaining, with a brilliantly witty script, a superb cast and one of the most stirring scenes in all cinema, the so-called Battle Of The Anthems when Laszlo incites Rick's patrons in a recital of La Marseillaise. It also broke social ground, with Sam the pianist (Dooley Wilson) being one of the first black roles to be treated as (almost) an equal. Most of all, it's a film you can watch again and again. If you haven't yet, give it a try; it could be the start of a beautiful friendship.",10,5,9,5 March 2007
We Are Marshall," We are ready...
","Just about every actor gets at least one big moment to cry. That's a given in a story of this nature, and some of them are better than others. Mackie's stoic attempt to take punches in an injured shoulder is full of passion, but Fox's random breakdown is, well, just like a flashback from Lost. He is better on the field, showing us a side to his personality we haven't seen yet. Strathairn seems the most sympathetic as the pained authority figure making tough decisions. Mara (Brokeback Mountain) looks so innocent you just want to hold her hand and stroke her hair every time she wells up. Aside from that, there's also a lot of personality in the film. McConaughey leads the team with a gleam in his eye and a smirk on his lips, but it never comes across as insensitive. He's hip, so of course he's the one who can lead them out of tragedy. And as an ensemble film, the cast comes together as a community, in which a single tragedy can affect them all, and a single victory can give them hope.",5,4,5,5 March 2007
The Illusionist," More like this please!
","The Illusionist is also a bit sluggish, sort of like a complicated magic trick building to its climatic conclusion. It starts at the turn of the century, when mysterious stage magician Eisenheim (Edward Norton) arrives in Vienna and begins performing his astounding illusions. He arouses not only the curiosity of the people, who believe he has otherworldly powers, but of the ruthless Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), an unsavory fellow who'd like to prove the man a fraud, especially after he witnesses a budding attraction between his beautiful fiancé, Sophie von Teschen (Jessica Biel), and the magician. What Leopold doesn't know is that Eisenheim and Sophie were once childhood sweetheartsand now that they've reunited, a dormant and forbidden love affair has been rekindled. Now it's up to Vienna's shrewd Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) to uncover the truth, charged by Leopold to intensify his efforts to expose Eisenheim. With Uhl doggedly pursuing the man behind the magician, Eisenheim prepares to execute his greatest illusion yet.",7,1,2,5 March 2007
