First Man," Could have been a great film!
","First Man could have been at least as good or better than Appolo 13 or The Right Stuffs.But a bad and uninspiring script and dark filming style killed First Man!Actually, I enjoyed watching the behind the scenes on the first man dvd more than the movie itself.",4,2,5,23 February 2019
1917," Could have been a great film about WWI
","I must say that I was dissapointed in watching 1917
because it could have been a great film about WWI.The problem with the film 1917 is that its gimmicky story telling and surreal filming style distract and got in the way of telling the horrors of wars!1917 could have been as good as Platoon, Apocalype Now & Schindler's List.",4,4,7,25 March 2020
