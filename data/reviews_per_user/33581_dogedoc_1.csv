Casablanca," All the ingredients for a classic
","Bogart is not exactly what one would call a handsome leading male. Bergman certainly is a beautiful leading actress. The softness of black and white film makes one feel as if you are in a dream but at the time the film was made, the reality of a world at war made the film even more poignant. The theme is just as important today as it was then and perhaps this is the reason it is a timeless classic. The classic good vs. evil The film makes a wonderful point of showing heroes are ordinary people called upon to do extraordinary things. The true beauty in this film is you just end up feeling good after it's all over. I never tire of watching it.",10,2,3,26 December 2004
