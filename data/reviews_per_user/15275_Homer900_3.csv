National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Good Matin√©e Fun
","Our daughter dragged us to see this sequel to National Treasure. I thoroughly enjoyed the first movie and this one, while not as original nor as compelling as the first one, does hold its own. I heard many favorable comments after the lights came up. It was a good popcorn movie wrapped in some real American history, but once the wrapping was removed, it was pure hokum, but isn't that what a movie is supposed to be? An alternative to real life? Wouldn't it be amazing if these treasures really existed and were found? But then I'd have to believe in the Illuminati, the Secrets of the Masons, the Da Vinci Code and Al Gore. If you want to be entertained, go see this movie. If you want to be challenged and think deep, critical thoughts about something, take a philosophy class.",7,3,8,23 December 2007
Pearl Harbor," A cheesefest for the historically ignorant
","I have been trying to sit through this bloated, ignorant and horribly acted movie for the past few hours. Since when do Army Air Force officers amble onto a Navy ship to watch a shipboard boxing match? Since when did active duty USAAF officer leave the US and fight for Britain, while still on active duty and the USA officially neutral? Since when did P-40s turn, twist and do aerobatics that out maneuvered the Japanese Zero, probably the single most nimble aircraft in the early part of the Pacific war? I could go on, but the music was ever present, the camera movement made me reach for an airsickness bag and the thought that kids today think this is what really happen at Pearl Harbor is sad. A stupid, stupid movie.",1,40,78,26 August 2006
Windtalkers," Horrible
","I saw this on the History Channel and I was expecting something more. The scene that bothered me the most was the training scene where the Navahos meet Slater and Cage's characters for the first time. The scene, on the beach with the Marines training, running and living in a tent city looked as if was a left over set from Baa-Baa Black Sheep, a terrible TV series about Marine Aviators in the South Pacific. The direction was pedestrian, the effects ridiculous and the acting, well, what can I say? The drilling was laughable, and everything else looked like they had a casting call and filled replica Marine uniforms and had them walk around.My son's 4th grade class put more emotion into their class play than this bunch. As far as even an entertaining movie, I watch most every war pic that comes along. This one I turned off and will not watch it again. It ranks with Pearl Harbor as one of the most ridiculous war movies made. 0/10.",1,2,4,16 April 2005
