Skyfall," ummm....quite disappointing
","This is MY first 007 series and I was excited to see it. However, it was quite disappointing to me. The actions were fantastic; one of the best. However, I had few times when I felt bored and I couldn't concentrate to the actual story. Also, I don't realize why Serena(?was that right??)came out. She seemed to be one of the main character but she wasn't. She just died quickly....Just a really small character. But as I repeat, the action scenes were excellent. And, the last part was a lot of fun. I was impressed at the last scenes. That was fantastic. Really fantastic. Cool movie but something's missing......That's why I give you a 7.",7,5,13,2 November 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," It was marvelous!
","Being honest, this was the first dark knight series I watched. Well, I've seen the first one but it was when I was quite young, so I don't remember anything. Still, I was really excited about the release. At first, I didn't recognize who was who since I haven't watched the previous movie. However, while the movie went on, I began to understand everything. The action in the movie was fantastic. Watching it made be realize....Wow.... This is Christopher Nolan. I really enjoyed Inception and I recognized many common things in the two. Tom hardy, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and other characters were in inception, the storyline was abundant. Both of them had dramatic twists at the end. I was really surprised at the end. This dark knight made me watch the other series..... Just.... fantastic.... Can't wait for the next one!!!!",10,3,9,14 October 2012
