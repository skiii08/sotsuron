Requiem for a Dream," Wanna-be art; really just crap
","This film looks like something that could have been commissioned by Nancy Reagan's 'just say no to drugs' people. Simplistic and heavy handed, this is the sort of moralistic tripe you'd expect from a police visit to your high school classroom.SPOILER Read this paragraph only if you've seen the movie:Synopsis (just to remind you how stupid this is) 'Innocent fun among 'normal kids' leaves a guy crippled, his buddy in jail, his girlfriend a crack whore and his mom lobotomized. It's all because of ... gasp ... DRUGS. Drugs are bad, mmmmkay?' /SPOILERJesus, do Americans know nothing about making a movie with some SUBTLETY?It's time for a 'drugs are mystical and great when used with care' movie get rid of the bad taste this movie leaves behind.",3,21,44,12 July 2001
The Big Lebowski," Among the 5 ultimate cult classics.
","There are some movies that are written so well that you inadvertantly memorize big sections of the script, and realize later that your friends have as well. This happens with Monty Python movies, Spinal Tap, Pulp Fiction, and Big Lebowski. I'm serious. This movie belongs into the comic stratosphere.",10,0,1,28 May 2003
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Gags and one-liners... but no atmosphere
","This movie foreshadows well the modern Hollywood blockbuster. It gets all its mileage out of individual gags that are sort of strung end-to-end, and there you have the movie. Everything is a bit light and fluffy, and the whole production seems to say 'Look! Heartthrob actors, dressed up like cowboys, doing cowboy stuff!' It certainly has entertaining portions (along the lines of Hollywood's usual 'something for everyone'), but I wouldn't call it a good movie. Best watched after Sergio Leone's masterpieces have faded from memory. I didn't take that advice and found myself thinking 'this is so weak!'",6,13,21,28 May 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," I thought I hated every new movie, but I love this one!
","Wow... see this while it's still in the theater. I hated, HATED Harry Potter, the Star Wars prequel, Titanic, and all these other super-hyped movies. Honestly, though, this is different. This is smart and a lot of fun to watch.",10,0,0,24 December 2001
The Usual Suspects," Oh, if only I could care!
","Here's what I saw: Actors reading terribly forced lines is a lifeless way (even Kevin Spacey! For shame!). Then there was a whole bunch of smoking, and some shooting, and a bunch of guys (obviously) pretending they're Godfather. I sat there for an hour waiting for the movie to get better, and it just didn't. Then I stopped caring.Sure, there were a few plot twists, but if you don't care about the movie, they just seem like sillyness. In fact, the whole thing comes off amateurish, which is weird given who's involved. In the end, there is probably more excitement in watching a grandmother knit socks than this failed movie.",4,8,15,19 February 2003
District 9," If a movie must be lame, it should at least be fun!
","The first ten minutes of this movie were promising, but after that it was basically a zombie romp genre piece - and not a good one. I appreciate a good, campy zombie movie, but this was dumb without being either fun or interesting. Just picture all the worst elements of Avatar without a shred of what's good in Avatar. That's just too much to swallow.One thing that was done well: Things looked really grimy, and that was cool. The closest movie to this (and superior) is Braindead - also associated with Peter Jackson. But that movie never forgot that it was not meant to be serious. This one started off interesting, then outed itself as a zombie-style humor piece, and then completely lost both threads and spent 60+ minutes being stupid while forgetting to be funny.",3,8,16,20 January 2010
I Am Legend," Instultingly bad writing; interesting concept executed miserably
","I want to warn anyone with half a brain: Do not see this movie! Please! You will sit in your seat and scream 'Why is the protagonist such an idiot?' How come he's the last person alive and the power is on? If he so allegedly smart, why is he too stupid to think of trying X or Y or Z or ... ? It quickly becomes obvious that the screenwriters didn't really think very hard about the scenario they composed, they most certainly had no knowledge of the profession of medical research, and most criminally, they just didn't care. I don't want to cite examples because I don't want this post to contain spoilers. But believe me, there are countless examples.This movie should just be avoided, left alone at the video store, and erased from history. By the time it gets to the laughable resolution, it's really that infuriatingly bad.",2,5,8,25 December 2007
Moulin Rouge!," Incoherent, embarrassing crap
","No spoilers below; no plot to spoil!If you are the sort of person who can find lasting amusement in butchered 80's songs in a fin de siecle Parisian setting, this movie is for you. I thought I might have been one of those people, but alas, I found myself sinking in my seat in vicarious embarrassment for all who appeared on screen. The movie looks like it might try to have a story, but quickly decides this is too hard. Much easier is to throw up a bunch of spectacle and colors and some good-looking actors (who unfortunately open their mouths eventually). Had I paid more than US$1.50 for my seat, I would have been fuming mad. As it was, I was only a little bit mad for the waste of time and the damage to my faith in humanity. (Comparison: soon thereafter I saw 'Legally Blonde' and cheered the smartness of that movie.)",3,0,2,30 July 2001
Event Horizon," Actually Scary
","You shouldn't go in expecting classical sci-fi when you go into this movie. It really is a horror movie, set on a misbehaving, damaged spaceship orbiting the planet Neptune. The thing is, space really is pretty damn scary; this movie portrays that really well. I must confess that this movie didn't begin promisingly--basically, it makes you think it will be a standard B sci-fi flick with cookie-cutter characters, a few not-terribly-original tech ideas, and all the rest that comes with that genre. I watched this alone late at night, scoffed a bit, but then...A certain scene made me think 'whoa, that's pretty freaky' ... 'and that too!' I was starting to feel strange watching this B-grade Sci-Fi movie. And then it hit me: I was actually scared. I can't quite explain it, but there it was: for the first time since I can remember, I was frightened by a movie. For maximum effect, I suggest you duplicate these conditions: watch this movie alone (not a good 'girlfriend' movie), late at night, turn off all lights and blast the sound. If you have neighbors, use good headphones. Be charitable with your suspension of disbelief. In this case it actually pays off.This movie is underrated here because I think it advertises itself in a misleading way. Make no mistake: it's a horror movie, and a pretty good one. If everyone who rated it would have followed my instructions above, I'm sure its ratings would have hovered around the 8. Well, maybe 7.5. Still, if you have a free Friday night alone, you won't regret renting this DVD.",9,0,1,31 July 2001
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," Brilliant music, amazing movie
","I'll just say one thing: merely the 'origin of love' song, accompanied by brilliant animation, has more art and genius than 100 normal full-length American films. And the whole movie is just plain awesome, on so many levels. Wow!",10,3,5,5 July 2003
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Complete rubbish
","While the visuals were occasionally pleasing, this is the nicest thing I can manage to say about this terrible movie. I usually try to express my opinions with subtle language, but such expressions fail me when I think back on the 200 minutes of torture I just put myself through.I was not a bully in school, but even I would have made sure to beat the crap out of Harry Potter on a regular basis if he were ever my classmate. He was in the paradoxical position of being a total moron of a student, and nonetheless a teacher's pet. Apparently, this was because he had some powerful parents. Add to this a total lack of any charisma, and you have a formula for a kid who would ordinarily never keep his lunch money past 10 AM. But, magically, Potter becomes some sort of a hero. Nice fantasy! I never realized how much I need justice to prevail in fairy tales. Apparently I do, because here I am, angry that Harry Potter didn't become the #1 wedgie recipient of his class.",4,0,5,25 November 2001
The Matrix Reloaded," The dumbest movie since Highlander 2
","I saw this movie with a big group of friends, and we actually managed to have a good time in the end, but only because we stayed up until 4 am, drinking and laughing about the unforgivable stupidity of every single scene in this movie. Just about every single movie parodied by Mystery Science Theater 3000 was, by objective standards, a better movie than Matrix Reloaded. My advice to anyone who is forced to see it: Think of it as a parody, as an attempt to spoof the genre. Seen like that, it's sorta funny. But if you can, avoid this catastrophic movie like the plague.Thanks to the sequel, I now feel dirty for having liked Matrix 1. The sequel is so bad that it makes even the original impossible for me to like anymore.",1,0,0,17 May 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Waiting for the de-cheesified version
","First off: the effects in the battle scenes were awesome. The technical team behind this movie is the greatest that's ever been assembled, bar none.But there are deep flaws in this movie, flaws that could have been fixed very easily and cheaply. You forget about them during the battle scenes, but you can't escape them.The most serious general flaw is the unforgivable shallowness of the characters. Really, they are pure lifeless caricatures. Everybody declares their one 'motivation' and then follows it. Sam 'protects Frodo'. Frodo 'is a good hobbit who tries to do the right thing but the ring tempts him.' Theodan (played well, at least) hesitates before he helps Gondor, but in a 'Lucas-moment' captured on camera he decides, for no apparent reason, to ride down to his death in Gondor anyway. Denethor (the second-most butchered character of the trilogy) is just mad and villainous for some inexplicable reason, so Gandalf whacks him a few times to get him out of the way. It's fine, because he's apparently evil. Faromir (the most butchered character) had his Lucas-moment transformation in the last movie, and here he is just a prop. (Good actor; terrible role). Who else... Yes, Aragorn: 'I am a dirty but noble ranger who has to accept a heavy responsibility' (and I have erotic dreams about my elf-girlfriend so she gets more screentime. Arwen is a prop, photographed with a soft-lens effect. Mary, Pippin: Start taking responsibility after all this time. Gimli: comic relief again. Legolas: there to say things that no sane living person would say in order to inform the audience what's happening. Oh, and he has to do one physics-defying radical battle stunt to show off that along with knowing how to state the obvious, he has impressive dexterity. Eowyn: Woman who's mad the men don't let her fight, has a crush on Aragorn, of which comes nothing. Later makes eyes with Faromir. Seagol: 'prototypical split-personality. This confused some people into thinking that his character is the most complex, and (a truly pathetic statement about the movie) he might well be. Still his 'character' is so silly that you start thinking Jackson designed him to make the kids laugh, like JarJar.So, you might say: well, we only had 3.5 hours; that's not enough time to develop the characters and the plot. Bull. Now it's true, Jackson dropped many balls in TTT and it's now too late to pick them up. But at least the most absurd caricatures could very easily be patched up. Jackson CAN do it, if he puts his mind to it. He did a great job with Boromir in FotR. It's not from many minutes of screentime. If was from not dumbing down the part, and repesenting his motivations as Tolkien did. Faromir got robbed in TTT because Jackson had no interest in making him a real character. But what he does with Denethor is unforgivable. Instead of an apathetic evil guy, Denethor was a great and wise leader from the elder line of men. He was profoundly intelligent and cared deeply for Gondor. But he was utterly without hope because he was demoralized through direct contact with Sauron by the seeing stone which wasn't mentioned. Denethor, unlike Gandalf, had a sane plan for how to deal with the ring: Keep it in Minas Tirith, the most defensible place in the West. Now, I know that Gandalf has mystical insight into the future, and that helped him launch the 'Kamikaze Frodo' plan, but on the face of it, the plan is patently absurd. Denethor (and Boromir) are no fools to think so, and Denethor is quite understandably upset with Faromir for sending the ring into almost certain capture by Sauron. How long would it take to convey this situation of Denethor's? Less time than Pippin's absurd song, or Gandalf's absurd lecture on the afterlife, both of which served no purpose and weren't in the book. This alone would have added mountains of credibility to the movie. But no. Instead, characters either act exactly according to their stereotype, or just randomly (like Denethor insisting Faromir attack the entrenched orcs in Osgiliath but not caring about the defenses of his own city - totally senseless and random).Oh, how I wish a real Tolkien fan and an intelligent person were there to smack Jackson (as he had Gandalf smack Denethor) when Jackson is tempted into an act of cheesifying tyrrany!But nobody smacked him, so he produced a movie loaded with manipulative Hollywood cheese at every turn. Feel sad now. Feel excited now. Oooh, watch out, that guy's evil! Frodo and Sam are weary. Really, really, really. There is even cheesy music to make it all more shallow and spare you the burden of having to think. Every individual sequence has some sort of a climax, many done not through character development but through sheer Hollywood manipulation. After 3.5 hours of that, you're climaxed out. Or rather, you're left a bit cold for the sequences where the real climaxes are supposed to be.In general, you leave with the sense that the worst of Hollywood shallowness tamed a gem of literature which self-consciously tried to distance itself from that sort of shallowness. If you were a fan of the book, you'll leave having been entertained... but if you don't feel a bit dirty afterwards, you've forgotten too much of the book.",Null,0,0,22 December 2003
High Fidelity," The best date movie ever made, bar none.
","I feel stupid for renting this DVD out of curiosity and watching it alone. I am contemplating whether I should pretend that it never happened, and on my next 'let's just rent a movie' date I'd pick it up and say something like 'oh, I heard 'High Fidelity' was supposed to be good. Have you heard of it?'Yeah, that's if I were smooth and manipulative. I'm sure it would work. Unless I had a date with an extraterrestrial or a complete idiot, we would do a lot of bonding from just watching this together. But no, I'm too honest to deceive a date like that. If it's not too late for you, be advised. This is the best date movie ever, and I don't imagine a better one will be made.",10,0,2,9 June 2003
