The Benchwarmers," Pretty funny
",I went into this movie thinking it wouldn't be that funny. Surprisingly though i found my self laughing through the whole movie. Certain aspects were kinda weak but over all it was a funny movie.The acting was funny and there were so interesting cameos for people the the terminators son and El Neno's brother. There are some pretty funny punchlines that you will be quoting for awhile after you have seen it. Also to my surprise i had to see the movie twice and even though i knew all the punch lines i still found my self laughing at all the jokes. To put it simply i thought it was going to suck but it turned out to be a good movie.,8,1,1,21 April 2006
