Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Less Jar Jar, more Darth Maul, other than that fantastic!!
","For the first episode in the series it does a decent job being exciting AND setting things in motion. I must admit there was a little too much comic relief(Jar Jar Binx) throughout the movie, possibly done to make some of the slower parts more interesting. Also I expected Darth Maul to be in it much more than he was after all he IS the deliciously evil antagonist. Despite that I give it a solid two thumbs up, after all I HAVE seen it twice already and it only came out 2 days ago.",8,0,0,21 May 1999
