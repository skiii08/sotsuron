The Blair Witch Project," I felt let down
","I felt the movies hype at the time was over rated. The worse thing is that new movies coming up are now comparing themselves to this movie ......Why? The camera work is jiggling about so much to the point of making me sick.......we know the film makers wanted realism but this was over done..... stop this silly nonsense over realism by making the camera shots more unsteady, this spoiled the movie all the way through I would of enjoyed it more with less spinning camera shots or filming some ones feet instead of the action expected. I found my self bored trying to stop my eyes from dancing about. As a student film I would said good effort. But please film makers do not go down this route as Blair witch it not clever.",Null,0,1,20 August 2012
