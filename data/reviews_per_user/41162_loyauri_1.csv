Blade Runner 2049," sorry to tell you, it's bad
","this movie is boring! i sat in the theater and watched the entire thing - hoping at some point it gets better, well it didn't. you will find almost no action in this 'masterpiece', the plot is dull and boring - dialogs the entire movie and nothing new or amazing happens. my two friends left in the middle and so did 3 more guys who sat behind me, when the movie was over i heard some people talking about how boring it was...anyway this movie should get a 6.
