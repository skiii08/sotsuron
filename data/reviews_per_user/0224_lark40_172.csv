Womack tells Stanley that San Francisco's Alcatraz Island has been taken hostage, along with 81 tourists, by marine General Francis Xavier Hummel who, for years, has been protesting the government's refusal to pay benefits to families of war veterans who died during covert military operations. The death of his wife Barbara Hummel on March 9, 1995 drove General Hummel over the edge, and now he's holding hostages in order to get his point across.

Hummel who demands a moral purpose holding the lives of an urban area at stake.* The character's motives and perfectly defined, especially General Francis X. Hummel. Even as the film's bad guy, he serves an understandable position, thus we empathize with him, unlike most villains witnessed in modern day thrillers.The picture is unpredictable and contains several inducing and unexpected twists proving this movie is imaginative and free to surprise us. The conclusion is not formulaic. 'The Rock' is filled with artful design and crafty performances. It is one of the 1996 best action films.",7,1,1,14 October 2016

When the camera focuses inside Iron Man's helmet, the real percentage of '475' can be seen. It appears to the left of the screen, close to Tony Stark's and destroys the forest but when they come on board the floating ship and discuss the coming together with loki messing with everybody head of the ship comes under attack
In Norse mythology, Thor's father Odin had two ravens, Huginn and Muninn, who would bring Odin information from Midgard (Earth). (This film repeats During the scene where the Avengers are discussing Loki and his scepter can control anyone he likes with as its the soul stone
Loki brings the Chitauri alien race to Earth to help him invade it. The Avengers are formed to prevent this from occurring. As it was a dream so Fury says of coulsen This is in keeping with the first issue of their self-titled comic book series, in which Loki is responsible for manipulating a chain of disasters that bring The Avengers together in the first place plus destroying new York with the team slowly coming together with speactular alien attacks loki attacking hq. Hawkeye and blackwidow and the avengers theme playing as the Hulk does smashing good and the captain trying to convince locals he is a good guy
And iron man suits count is up to, 8: The Mark VI is an upgrade of the Mark IV, and the first to sport a triangular chest piece containing the new vibranium-powered Arc Reactor. This suit offers an all-around upgrade to the flight and weapons systems, including mini wrist-rockets and a palladium-powered laser system on the back of each hand that cuts through anything like a hot knife through butter. The Mark VI is the first to withstand submersion in water, but was, once again, ultimately destroyed in the Mandarin's attack.: Like the Mk V, this armor does not require a gantry system to apply, instead using lasers that identify and couple with totes adorbs wristlets worn by Tony, initiating a similar auto-equip function as seen in The Avengers when Loki throws Tony out of his own building. It has additional thrusters on the back, calves, feet, chest, knees, and toes (knees and toes). It's equipped with 90+ high-explosive micromissiles, two tri-barreled laser modules, an anti-armor missile, and upgraded plasma chargers, which increase repulsor rates.
then the attack of New York is amazing as there is so much battles going on that action going on with all the superheroes doing there thing is epic the evolution of iron man suit is great to watch one hell of a great film cant wait for the follow up stories wait till a few minutes to see the credit roll and see the twist epic film",10,1,4,25 March 2014

The Monuments Men," weird odd true story
",I heard this film got only 33 on rotten tomatoes I don't know why as its a funny odd story that had to be told because the nature of which its told in. George Clooney does a great job at directing and acting the man is talented by getting a great cast bill Murray I don't normally like him because he normally serious he was underused here but his scenes are fun . Matt Damon went behind enemy lines in saving private Ryan in Belgium its funny he goes back there to find art the whole film is odd like a carry on film but the scenes in the film thee is lots of emotion to the story the normally soldiers didn't take these guys serious enough but they had saved billions in arts and monuments and treasures all over Belgium and France and saved it from Hitler for his own private collection I gave this film 7/10,7,0,1,17 February 2014

During the mission to Naboo, Qui-Gon's destiny allowed him to seek out Anakin who would then bring balance to the force in a way which was not expected.

Before becoming a Padwan learner with Obi-Wan, Qui-Gon tells Anakin Skywalker of the importance of the midiclorians and the way they communicate. 'Learn to quiet your mind and you will hear them talking to you'. as young ankin wins a race he is showing his skills flying saving jar jar Bink's and the fleet accidentally the prophecy To hear the will of the force was something all Jedi were trained to do and Master Yoda was no exception. Yoda was aware of this and was deep in meditation when he first heard something unexpected. During the massacre of the Sand People, Yoda heard the voice of Qui-Gon calling out 'Anakin!'. Focusing on this, Yoda then attuned his mind to communicate with Qui-Gon. Something he would later pass to Ob-Wan Kenobi through Qui-Gon's mentoring.Communication with Qui-Gon allowed Yoda and Obi-Wan to transform into the force.

Iron Man 3," Unleash the power behind the armor.he starts an odyssey of rebuilding and retribution. Ptsd creating his own demons in the shadow of his own crumbling empire
","This movie as 'a full-on Tony Stark-centric movie. He's stripped of everything, he's backed up against a wall, and he has to use his intelligence to get out of it. He can't call Thor, Captain America, or Nick Fury, and he can't look for the Helicarrier in the sky.' Robert Downey, Jr. further described the character as influenced by a post-Avengers Assemble (2012) world:
The most what I love of this film is. There wasn't any Avengers in it trough the whole film. Only Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk made a cameo scene on the end of the credits but that was it and it did not bother me or annoyed. The story centers around Tony Stark not Avengers, that is why I just love this movie! Thank god Jon Favreau step down as the Director and Shane Black replaced him! I was surprised by the fact that Disney allowed Shane Black making an Action film flick in the and Die Hard With a style! Yes Action style!'What are his challenges now? What are some limitations that might be placed on him, and what sort of threat would have him, as usual, ignore those limitations?'
The best iron man yet he is tested to the core as his empire crumbles and falls taking on the so called mandrian he must us a past qutence to take down fire exploding with Extremis, zombies use his ingenuity to survive the from clues in the blast zone outside the Hollywood Chinese cinema
But he has some soul searching does he make the suit or does the suit control him this is spectacular special effects he use nano tech to control his suits without having to be in dangerous situation
The film sets place after the events of The Avengers on Christmas Eve!!! Tony Stark (the always wonderfully charismatic Robert Downey Jr.) is falling apart. This is the first time I see Tony Stark and Iron Man in a snow in Christmas, This film reminds me on Batman Returns . It is pretty good. The attack on Tony's house whit helicopters blowing Tony's house to pieces was the first time in the film I ever saw. Gwyneth put Iron Man Armor on in and she saved Maya Hansen that was outstanding. The scene was pure action! As Tony suit malfunctions in Midwest America we find Tony vulnerable and has to remember real life and as he is a mechanic he has to go back to his roots in a shed This is were a kid in this film who reminds him about how it is for kids to look at him as a role model and no he isnt annoying, he did a good job helping Tony Stark against his post traumatic stress disorder attacks Tony Stark was brilliant fixing and building a new armored suits on new ones. Iron Man saved 13. passengers from falling off the airplane Air Force One, tough he crashed in the truck, I loved that scene. Aldrich Killian participated in the development of Extremis thereby amassing a group of Extremis-enhanced soldiers under his command. Killian played by an awesome Guy Pierce did a wonderful job portraying a villain to Tony Stark. I really think Guy Pierce just did an amazing job portraying a villain in Iron Man 3 he was some A.I.M. soldier creating a terrorist attacks and he was brilliant to make an alias Mandarin! To mask his illegal activities as terrorist attacks he created the idealized terrorist persona known as the 'Mandarin'! that was brilliant and I love the twist!. I love plus create an all out assult on maimi docks with the extremist and soldiers and an army of iron mans robots the best in the The series

Deepwater Horizon," a human aspect on the horizon as cheap parts on a deep sea oil well causes a leak out of ecological catastrophe of epic trillion proportions
","Mark Wahlberg is a versatile actor who can do anything from comedy to his fascination for movies based on real-life events - The Perfect Storm, The Fighter, Lone Survivor - with the true story of the 2010 drilling rig explosion off the Louisiana coast. Deepwater Horizon is arguably the most harrowing film of the year. This film is tension packed dramatic With a real docudrama feel, Lone Survivor director Peter Berg brilliantly builds up the tension on the 'well from hell' as events unfold. Technically, this is a tour-DE-force but, more importantly, it feels like the crew have been honored in the right way. This film is a must see at 1hr 38mins of real |Action, plenty of Drama, and the edge of your seat on the high sea Thriller I will give this 9/10 for effort because the oil in the sea bed leaked because BP didn't do any safety checks on the sea floor cause it was 67 days the oil exploratory drill was meant look for oil but the deep water horizon was falling lithely apart and costing to much keep a float as the executives on board were cutting corners to much to the ecolocial disaster that was about to happen 210billion gallons of oil leaked . A story set on the offshore drilling rig Deepwater Horizon, which exploded during April 2010 and created the worst oil spill in U.S. history a great director Peter Berg who also done When faced with our darkest hour, hope is not a tactic with a budget $156,000,000 (estimated 9. of 10. Makes a documentary-style, based-on-true events film into a stunning special FX action-thriller with the sort of technical detail that you'd expect Star Trek nerds to demand and enjoy.Berg is in the same category. He's directed some really good movies (Lone Survivor, Battleship, Hancock,The Kingdom),. Like Wahlberg, if you enjoyed one of Berg's movies, odds are, you'll at least feel you got your money's worth with all of them. 2 people really impress here: Peter Berg for putting this film together and John Malkovich his acting. Is UN believable his rang is quite remarkable show that his character only cared about money not safety Berg clearly expresses a passion for this that brings to life a film based on an investigative news article. They definitely released this at the correct time. Those looking for horror and gore without being stuck. You will feel truly scared and surprised watching this film without a single gimmick. you know that it's easy to get caught up in the details of how much of the story based on actual events really happened and how much was embellished or altered to make a Hollywood movie. Along the way, I have made a decision to do no research into the facts of the real-life story and just focus solely on the movie itself. I mean, the movie makes no claims to be a historically accurate documentary, so I shouldn't hold it to those standards. And this blog isn't about movies being historically accurate when they don't necessarily claim to be. Mark Wahlberg plays Mike Williams who is blue collar worker on the drilling rig turned into an action hero the Deepwater Horizon. But that's the third thing we learn about Williams from the preview. He's a husband and a father first. He says goodbye to his family before being flown by helicopter with his crew to the rig. All his daughter wants is a dinosaur fossil. All his wife (Kate Hudson) wants is for him to return safely. Once aboard the rig, an executive named Vidrine (John Malkovich) and others from British Petroleum are more than anxious to commence with drilling. They skip a concrete test and excuse a failed system test. They are already 43 days behind and over budget and will do whatever it takes to not fall further behind despite Mister Jimmy's (Kurt Russell) stern objections. They should have listened to Mister Jimmy because everyone's worst nightmares explode into reality. Because the standard safety test leads to mud coming into the pipes causing every kind of disasterDeepwater Horizon marks the reunion of Director Peter Berg and Mark Wahlberg who collaborated on Lone Survivor three years ago. It was nominated for Oscars for Sound Mixing and Sound Editing and won the Screen Actors Guild Award for best stunt team performance. While Wahlberg has been nominated for his roles in The Fighter and The Departed, he's one of those reliable actors who makes smart choices. If you've liked one thing Wahlberg has done, odds are,you'll like them all. Most of them won't get nominated for awards, but they will all be entertaining. Great cast mark whalberg as tech engineer Mike Williams goes around to john Malkovich character pointing out everything that's wrong Kurt Russell who is safety manager Jimmy Harrell Gina Rodriguez Andrea Fleytas John Malkovich VidrineEthan Suplee Jason AndersonFrom the preview, I said that Deepwater Horizon looked action-packed and visually stunning, but that it also looked predictable with pieces of the rig falling apart or blowing up blocking every turn as Williams and the survivors try to find a way to escape. Stars but I'm It was exactly as the preview said it would be and it was absolutely predictable; however, even though you knew what was coming, it was so perfectly executed, it still shocked you. From the beginning, there was no doubt about the fate of the rig as not-so-subtle clues were dropped along the way from his daughter's school presentation, to the tie of the executive, to the helicopter ride to the rig. You knew it was going You knew it was going to happen, but when it did, it choked the breath right out of you and didn't give it back until the very end of the movie. when faced with the darkest hour hope is not a tact.It is worth the money to watch in theaters.",9,1,3,3 October 2016

In Bruges," a guide to a non fairy tale view of a tourist destination as hit men meets the weirdest of people as he shoots first and sight sees bloody later
","In Bruges came out in 2008 to raves reviews and awards like the golden globes and 1 Oscar in this 1hr 47mins of funny moments of comedy and 2 hit-man on the run and throw in some drama to the mix in a weirdest tourist town in in Belgium for a film I gave this film 8/10 Guilt-stricken after a job gone wrong, hit-man Ray and his partner await orders from their ruthless boss in Bruges, Belgium, the last place in the world Ray wants to be. Director:Martin McDonagh first film is a stylish black comedy thriller staring Ralph Fiennes ..as harry a family man but a cold blooded hit-man with a vicious London crime boss who sends his boys to a picturesque city to lay low for more orders when ken played by . Brendan Gleeson he plays this character very good trying keep Colin Farrell character a playboy fast talking partner from going crazy and running away but sets out on an adventure with ray meeting skinheads surreal tourists a another film set with dwarfs on a euro thrash film and prostitutes and when the last call comes from harry the fun turns to life or death situation As Colin Farrell's performance won him a deserved Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical in a golden globe. and meeting other lowlifes along the way abusing over weight tourist his character doesn't like the tourist side of bruges also Nominated for Oscar Best Writing, Original Screenplay martin mcdonagh this is a kind of Irish film following Harry's advice, takes in the sights of the medieval city with great appreciation. But the charms of Bruges are lost on the simpler Ray, who is already despondent over the innocent death, especially as it was his first job. Things change for Ray when he meets Chloe, part of a film crew shooting a movie starring an American dwarf named Jimmy. When Harry's instructions arrive, Ken, for whom the job is directed, isn't sure if he can carry out the new job, especially as he has gained a new appreciation of life from his stay in the fairy tale Bruges. While Ken waits for the inevitable arrival into Bruges of an angry Harry, who feels he must clean up matters on his own, Ray is dealing with his own issues I've really liked Colin Farrell but who knew he had such a good sense of comedic timing? There is a running gag involving fighting with a bottle, and karate, that he manages to keep fresh as it pops up throughout the film. Brendan Gleeson's character provides the moral center and plays the straight man to Farrell's Ray. This works well as the movie turns more serious towards the end. However, for my money, the best performance is delivered by Ralph Fiennes who plays Harry the pair's criminal overlord back in London. Whereas Gleeson character embodies the moral center, Fiennes's Harry fills the role of principled immorality, plays the straight man to Farrell's Ray. This works well as the movie turns more serious towards the end. However, for my money, the best performance is delivered by Ralph Fiennes who plays Harry the pair's criminal overlord back in London. Whereas Gleeson character embodies the moral center, Fiennes's Harry fills the role of principled immorality, if there is such a thing if there is such a thing. Fiennes creates a character with a dubious moral center and is a quite believable figure of Shoot first. Sightsee later. After seeing the trailer, In Bruges looked like a plodding British comedy with little originality and repetitious humor, hence the low expectations. Yet, In Bruges exceeded my minimal expectations, and, unlike my impression from the trailer, was an original drama with good acting and a nice blend of comedy mixed in. It was funny in the right places and appropriately dramatic when the story shifted into high gear towards the end. The another aspect of the film worked for me was Ray's love interest. Early in the film he manages to woo Chloe, a drug dealer with, drum roll please, a heart of gold. For my tastes, the budding romance comes across more as a vehicle for jokes and drama. But it's a small thing and I doubt anyone but me would notice. I intentionally left a lot of plot points out, because, as I've mentioned, this film surprised me in a good way and I don't won't to ruin it for anyone else.In Bruges is a good film. Go see it.",8,1,2,9 September 2016

Darkest Hour," One man went against the grain, stood tall and changed a nation to no surrender, don't give in and forged a new hope in European theatre of war thou shall not pass
","In a career already filled with great performances, Gary Oldman has arguably saved the best until now.
This film is two hours long but it fells like a prequel to last years Dunkirk. As Winston Churchill in Atonement director Joe Wright's relentlessly gripping, race-against-time biopic Is Oldman about to get a an oscar nod for best actor and sure he might win it took, Oldman does that rare thing - makes you think he's the first and last to ever play the British wartime leader who is a drunk.
Motivating a the heart and souls of the parliament and the British people.
Oldman disappears into his his its hard to recognise him . as we see the old prime mister Nevill losing his seat because he is no good to the role.
As we see Churchill strategies come under fire from the war cabinet with motivating speeches with lily Jame's character following and typing his ever word his war office try to undermine him. but just as the darkest hour approaches he looks to the people for wisdom , in an interesting and climatic sen before he meets Parliament he absconds from his car as he is missing in actin from a war meeting to get on the tube to engage and find the real heart and vision of great Britain and go to parliament and give a rousing speech.
to give a fighting chance to the soldiers of Dunkirk and help save a nation,
and say thou shall not pass these border a best film if I ever saw one
Kirsten Scot as wife Clementine, Ben Mendelsohn as King George VI and Lily James as just-hired secretary Elizabeth Layton, Darkest Hour has just as much for fans of The Crown as lovers of The Cruel Sea. A must see

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," save a rogue rebellion as it looks for a fault in the dangerous world destroyer bridging a gap for future heroes of of swashbuckling hope a master plan gone rogue
","This 2hrs 13min |of Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi I gave it 10/10 as DirectorGareth Edwards who directed the 2014 Godzilla and the brilliant low budget monsters and his star wars is classic movie in the fold of the old and jj Abraham's one the force awakens . so lets blast off on this fun and original film The Rebel the weight of myth, Rogue One is a machine of a film that moves toward its inevitable endpoint with unrelenting determination. Although there are a few familiar faces, Edwards naturally drops plenty of references to the original trilogy – a certain pair of classically mismatched droids make a cameo appearance – . Rogue One isn't a new type of cinema experience, or unique. It's also a prequel, so the story has somewhere specific it has to end up. With that in mind, Gareth Edward's movie is pretty close to an instant classic, in my opinion. It doesn't rush along, but give us ample time to get some sense of characters and locations. It doesn't dwell on exposition, other through character, and actual plot. her mother, hoping that she'll be able to provide an entree to the militant radical Saw Gerrera (Forrest Whitaker), the recipient of a covert message from Galen borne by a renegade cargo pilot named Bodhi Rook (Riz Ahmed), you feel for the pilot because he wants a to really help The purpose of Rogue One's opening movement is to assemble a ragtag band of fighters, one that also includes the blind Force worship per Chirrut Îmwe (Donnie Yen) and the grizzled gunner Baze Malbus (Jiang Wen), who will take up the charge of stealing the Death Star plans when the Rebel Alliance gets cold feet. Yen and Jiang play their characters with a gruff tenderness that suggests their relationship may be more than platonic, and Alan Tudyk lends his voice and his movements to K-2SO, a wisecracking former Imperial droid with an unnerving penchant for calculating the precise likelihood of his comrades' deaths. That this literally motley crew's heroism is never so much spoken in the movies that follow it chronologically only makes their heroism more poignant: they are history's forgotten soldiers, laying their lives on the line while others carry the baton across the finish line. When the X-wing pilots show up with their bushy '70s handlebar mustaches, it brings the ends of the franchise's circle together, but it also reminds us how much has changed between then and now.More important than Rogue One's contribution to Star Wars' plot is the way it inhabits its universe. JJ Abrams had the responsibility of extrapolating from the original trilogy, and George Lucas's prequels wound back the clock, but Edwards' movie is happening virtually on top of the first movie, which leaves him with a unique and daunting task: to make a movie with virtually the same elements as the original Star Wars that still feels like it was made in 2016 and not 1977. The film does this largely by engaging a multiracial cast from different parts of the globe, but also by a embracing the range of perspectives that come with it. When Jyn announces she's planning to end her brief tenure in the rebellion because it makes no difference to her who rules the galaxy, the one about Jedi Knights and galactic emperors with quasi-mystical powers, the next installment of which won't be along until this time next year. But a Star Wars story nonetheless, about people who don't have quasi-mystical powers and have never done the Kessel run in less than 12 parsecs, although they're reasonably good with a blaster in a tight spot. It's an epic about extras, an opera about spear carriers This is the story about how the rebel alliance acquired the plans for the death star, and it manages to give the plot and characters in A New Hope more meaning, and gravitas. References and Easter eggs from the original trilogy sprinkled throughout will surely encourage repeat viewings from fans and while not being the biggest Star Wars fan in the world, I have found myself a lot more interested in going back for another full viewing of series based solely on how much I enjoyed this standalone outing. It's been a while since we've had a series of films to look at as an annual Christmas tradition and having grown up watching Lord of the Rings in the cinemas year after year, it's something I've missed. After taking two big risks and pulling it off two years in a row, I have no doubt that the cast and crew and Disney and Lucasarts have it in them to provide that new seasonal tradition ever year, the movie is squarely focused on the new characters we've come to know, and the battle we've come to live. We know they succeed in their objective to get the Death Star's blueprints to the rebel comrades, but we've never known the cost of that success. Once we do, that knowledge holds the tantalizing prospect of making even Star Wars feel like something new again. And makes you wanting I think episode 8 or 9 rate the best 3 1 star wars a new hope 2 the rogue one 3 revenge of the sith",10,1,5,1 January 2017

Mark IV (Iron Man 2)
Marvel
First Appearance: Iron Man #85 (1976), Iron Man 2 (2010)
A battle with the supervillain known as the Freak destroyed the Mk. III armor. The Mk. IV is one of the models with the longest lifespan, and was worn by Stark's friend James Rhodes during his tenure as Iron Man. This is typically Stark's backup suit whenever his modern armors fail him. In Iron Man 2, Stark wore the Mk. IV for most of the film until he completed the Mk. VI.Mark VMarvel
First Appearance: Iron Man #142 (1981), Iron Man 2 (2010)
There is very little similarity between the Mk. V armor in the comics and that of the film. Where the film's version is a portable one-off used in the race track fight against Whiplash (and subsequently disposed of), the comics version was meant for space exploration and to fight the villain Sunturion. Because of Stark's advancements in technology, though, it clearly doesn't get a lot of play.Mark VIMarvel
First Appearance: Iron Man #218 (1987), Iron Man 2 (2010)
Another suit that has very little similarities between its two versions, the Mk. VI was made in the comics specifically for underwater excursions. Everything was reworked to function in the ocean depths, plus the ability to jettison its wearer if escape was needed. In Iron Man 2, Stark makes the armor after creating a new element for his Arc Reactor. And as we saw in Avengers, it was the first suit to have underwater capabilities - and the first to get all dinged up by Helicarrier blades.",8,0,0,20 June 2019

I gave it 7/10 as its good but not great
dirJohn G. Avildsen
eluctantly retired from boxing, and back from riches to rags, 
Rocky takes on a new protege who betrays him, as the champ's son must adjust to his family's new life after bankruptcy
Rocky Balboa is forced to retire after having permanent damage inflicted on him in the ring by the Russian boxer Ivan Drago.
 Returning home after the Drago bout, Balboa discovers that the fortune that he had acquired as 
heavyweight champ has been stolen and lost on the stockmarket by his accountant. His boxing days over, Rocky begins to coach an up-and-coming fighter named Tommy Gunn.
 Rocky cannot compete, however, with the high salaraies and glittering prizes being offered to Gunn by other managers in town.
Sometimes it gets annoying to me how critical people are of the Rocky series. It's like they feel like they have to say terrible things about it, probably because people can be so negative 
that they can't find it in themselves to believe that a 'less than intelligent' person with heart, drive and passion can move mountains and achieve success. I personally thought this, and every other Rocky movie, was fabulous. I thought Sage Stallone was amazing in his debut as Rocky's son.
 Also, this movie showed a more real side of boxing, the business side, with exploitative agents and corrupt business tactics. Some may think the Rocky series is an unrealistic saga, but Rocky IV proves it isn't. The person we saw struggle, fight, and grow rich is now back to square one..

Aquaman," can bridges of both sea and land be built upon a seaman quest to unite the wild atlantis way
","The film is a game changer in terms of special effects its up there with avatar if I had seen it in 3 d it would change superheros films for ever
Let's start off with a bit of truth: I like Aquaman. I' DC Comics fan. I'm not saying it's a great movie or that it's the savior of the DC cinematic universe, but it is a lot of fun. 'It's a bizarre but weirdly effective movie.' I can't put it any better than that. Arthur Curry, the human-born heir to the underwater kingdom of Atlantis, goes on a quest to prevent a war between the worlds of ocean and land.with William defoe playing vulko who show aquman how to learn his role with tridentand using his skills he need the back story is good with king orm talking over the king of atlantis when he over throws the and attacks a meeting aquaman is forced to fight him in an underwater arena this is epic and mera helps but but as we see Nicole kidman character is good givers good advice and was rescued so when aquman has to find the real ruler he must become the hero and go epic and clues to atlantis and its power before its destroyed he has to light the way
I can, however, give you a few more details. We begin with a new version of Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) who feels more like an aquatic vigilante than the deep sea prince we're used to. Arthur's rogue hero lifestyle leads him into a faceoff with a group of high-tech pirates. The pirates are lead by David Hyde (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) and his father Jesse (Michael Beach), who just so happen to be in the middle of stealing a submarine. You know, because why not. This leads to one of the most emotional scenes of the movie and after it's all done Arthur and has his first enemy in Hyde AKA Manta.
The enemies don't stop there. Arthur also has an Atlantean brother by the name of Orm (Patrick Wilson) although he'd probably prefer King Orm-because he's pretentious that way. I mean, this guy is the quintessential bad-news-sibling who might want you dead or imprisoned or just somewhere bleeding 'cause you're lost to the world. The battle under water is like lord of the rings its amazing
To counter the forces rising against him, Arthur has a great dad (Temuera Morrison), and a mom (Nicole Kidman) who loved them both deeply before she had to leave because, you know, Queen business ain't nothing but work. He also has a potential crime-fighting partner and a love interest in Mera (Amber Heard) the princess of another underwater kingdom.
So Arthur's life is fun...because he loves danger...and he's a total bad boy...but he has a lot to learn about compassion and what being a hero means. Which is what this movie is about.
So, shall we go with the good & the ugly? Let's do it.Jason Momoa is glorious. He's funny, charming, and tough. That's what you want in an Aquaman and it's what's been missing from DC movies-other than Wonder Woman. As his foil, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is the perfect counterbalance. His Manta (formerly Black Manta) is ruthless, charming, and relentless. I've got nothing but applause for these two and I've got big hopes for their rivalry to continue in future films.
Secondly, DC has found a formula I believe will work well for them as they redevelop and revamp their live action movies.10/10
The computer generated imagery is brill at times like the tsunami and not in a campy way that feels intentional. The characters and their hair [see: tresses] move more like they're flying through air rather than gliding through water.
Still...It's a fun movie. Jason Momoa makes everything better. And this represents a first step in DC finally giving their characters and their fans the movies we want and deserve. So, I say cheers to Aquaman-his pilsner glass may be far too flashy but at least it's filled to the brim with good stuff.",10,0,3,24 January 2019

Thor: Ragnarok," The Fate of the Gods rests in the hands of bitter sibling who brings destruction and death and the end mystical fortress
","This is my 306 review
The opening sequence where Thor battles . Surtur for his horn bears a close resemblance to the Balrog the Fellowship of the ring In Lord of the rings fights in the mines,
and While RagnarÃ¶k traditionally means the end of everything, in the context of the film, it means disassembling what's already there, and rebuilding it. To me, it's stripping down the establishment, and then building it up in a new way, which is almost like this cyclic idea of RagnarÃ¶k. I love heroes that really go through ordeals and then come out the other end completely changed. That's way more exciting and interesting. You can never go back from that.'Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is imprisoned on the planet Sakaar, with the grandmaster played by Jeff goldblum who has a gladiator ring and has battles this film grows on you and the battle with Thor and Hulk is mighty fun with no molijnar which is and must race against time to return to Asgard and stop RagnarÃ¶k, the destruction of his world, at the hands of the powerful and ruthless villain hela had shape-shifting abilities(Cate Blanchett)In Valkyrie's
: 'It's in Loki's nature to change. He's a mercurial spirit, and the minute you try to define him he changes shape.
But tessa Thompson character is a feisty rebel on the rubbish planet her character valkrie loves to taser what' she wants But events in RagnarÃ¶k try and inspire him to change forever. The Goddess of Death shows up, and the stakes are high for everybody, so Loki, perhaps more than ever, is challenged to define himself in the face of that threat. He and Thor are in such an extraordinary situation where everything is so unfamiliar that their familiarity, as family members, becomes important.' we also get Doctor Strange leaving his calling card for Thor as loki disappeares into his magic realm
So I Thor getting everyone to safety on the bridge and with valkries Thor and the Hulk trying to fight his sister loki gets a chance to kinda save the day but its bitter sweet as he summons surtur the blitzkrieg asgard
The Director Taika Waititi does a fine job of reinventing the comic timing it grows on you this film sets a up the last few avengers nicely this film is not like the others you won't be sure about you have to watch again to appreciate it",9,1,7,25 September 2019

Still, this is bonkers with Shaws gang on the antonov carrier with cars chasing spectacular fights cars flying its all going here its just mayhemthe best thing about this flick is the character interaction, even with actors whose roles are this limited. Letty's amnesia adds an interesting soapy twist to the plot that forces Dom to constantly try to remind her why she loves him. Brian's fatherhood also lets Paul Walker do a bit of enjoyably self-serious acting of his own. Otherwise, Tyrese Gibson and
Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges and han get their back sides kicked in the underground are left with the snappy comedic relief, while Gina Carano, Gal Gadot, and Elas Pataky merely get to look feisty and hot in their action scenes (but at least they do a great job at it). As for Dwayne Johnson, he gives an unusually deadpan performance this time around, with only just a few outrageous outbursts of manly banter here and there. Nonetheless, the cast here is consistently entertaining, with the screenplay letting everyone get a chance to shine, even if some of them aren't quite as memorable as others. The script delivered an action moments with high explosions on an airplane that are not forgettable. I love that fight between Gina Carano & Michelle Rodriguez which it was tremendous. Getting to grips so much happing
The Budget: was massive 160mil but these films grosses keep going up with an opening in America of $97,375,245, and finished with$238,679,850 and

Deadshot Will Smith portrays Deadshot and the costume for the character and all of his weapons will have written on them the phrase 'I am the Light, the Way', an obvious reference to Jesus. his daughter is his heart but this plays on his mind with Bruce Wayne's batman having a vital cameo appearance getting to grips with two characters he might be able to control he batman is doing a tony stark for the justice league we have jokers girlfriend on the side Margot Robbie ... Harley Quinn and her trusty baseball bat she is creepy just like the joker played by Jared leto he gets a cameo he uses his skills to mess her mind up in arkam but I like to see him more as pops up from time to time keeping up with his gal we have katana the samurai lady who is on kill orders for these bad guys she is bad ass.we have the rest of the motley crue story Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje ...and of them diablo character and boomerang are cool character with their fiery stories and their tech gear to kill Killer Croc Jay Hernandez playing a laid back character.. Diablo he gets his role down to tee because his character is fiery but learned to control but it takes a pivotal moment for him breath fire back into life just in the nick of time saving the crew we also get the flash cameo looking forward to seeing his film Ezra Miller ... The Flash Jai Courtney ... Boomerang Common ... Monster TAdam Beach ... Slipknot all these character get great songs on the soundtrack to the film during the action with the head played Viola Davis her character takes no crap Amanda Waller from any one asking her superiors to support her so we see the explorer Cara delevigne character June Moore/enchantress going cave hunting only to discover the wrong cave and accidentally gets taking over by a witch so fast forward to the story were she can shape shift and fly anywhere with getting caught so with but Amanda Waller has enchantress under control with a heart in the box so she has her on a tight leash so with the group together the army has Scott Eastwood .playing.. Lieutenant GQ Edwards and Joel Kinnaman ... Rick Flag who plays the head of this rag bag team of mist fits with him in the lead the suicide squads find out their mission as there is a giant terrorizing midway city so they leave from there jail in bel reve and seeing them on the chopper as Alain Chanoine ... Businessman / Incubus this incubus is in cahoots with enchantress so as the team comes under attack the action begins as all hell brakes loose the team don't want to be there but haven't got a choice so as enchantress has a team of weird baddies between them and the mysterious lighting object they have to battle themselves keep rick flag alive and deal with Harley Quinn absconding with her boy and her craziness and a sniper shot to kill but dead shot as he say he never misses but unfortunately her chopper goes down not knowing is this a ploy who knows fool them as well along with great special effects rick flag has his issues with enchantress to so this weird film is just punk enjoy Worst. Heroes. Ever Mid-credits scene: Bruce Wayne has dinner with Amanda Waller, offering her his protection in exchange for one of her top secret folders on meta humans enchantress has her chance also with an evil monster that she created in toe but fighting with the squad diablo uses all his fiery arsenal going to for toe visually this is just about matching the tall monster but his friends have an ace up there sleeveThe acting was more than I expected out of this movie. In terms of acting, I'll go in order of my top 3: Robbie, Leto, and Smith. All of their portrayals are excellent. El Diablo is a nice surprise, his character made us feel for him, maybe even more-so than the top stars. Leto knocks it out of the park. As a Ledger fanboy, I was dreading his performance, but his character was amazing down to the slightest movement. No amount of dialogue is wasted nor any simple movement is wasted. Overall, the movie was great, again, some awkward script, but the action scenes are done extremely well and the acting is great. 8/10.just below the great Batman v Superman in my opinion but its set it up nicely for a sequel and the rest of the justice league",8,0,2,17 August 2016

Interstellar," time travel= relativity =space equilibrium= Nolan's grand space masterpiece
","chris Nolan a delivered another original story with with less special effects its more old school stuff with flight simulators done instead of geeen screens with space painted on the outside everything you see in this movie is real as your going to get so here starts the story of a farmer called cooper played by Matthew mconnaughey another Oscar performance who was a N.A.S.A pilot and his family he finds out that there is a problem with earth food sources and stumbles upon a plan to save earth and t leave earth for another world with his daughter he loves and his daughter tuned into other worldly scientific things that I wont explain you have to see this to understand the films relevance on finding a solution to the worlds problems there is a solution in here house were signs are there but I wont make sense until the end he has really turned the corner in his career what a RenascenceFirst of all, it is incredibly beautiful to watch. Honestly, it was so beautiful that I felt like I was sucked into the movie. The way Nolan decided to show some scenes really remind me of contact and parts of inception you see in this movie ca feel the talent of Christopher Nolan, just by looking at the way it is filmed. The techniques he used contribute to create that visual environment in a believable way.The sound environment is just mesmerizing. It is a very important part of the movie, because some scenes take place in space, and Noland just found the right way to use sound. The soundtrack (made by the great Hans Zimmer) is breathtaking, epic, amazing, unreal. I could find a lot more adjectives to qualify it, but you have to hear it to understand how epic they are. you think how loud this film is you think you ware a astronautMatthew, In this movie... Well, he is the movie. he orchestrates this film that everybody else feeds of his power so much that everyone around him gets better. But Matthew is just what was needed to feel the human part of the story (which is very important in Interstellar). He is capable of making us feel so many different emotions all along the story, as a father, as a human. Anne Hathaway was very convincing, all together the actors managed to create some harmony, which makes the human interactions credible. Caine, Chastaing and Affleck are a perfect choice. And then there is... The special guest who is mischievous in a minor role , is actually much more important than that. He proves, once again, that he is a great actor. Watch and see. and a sarcastic computer really a bit bizarre in space but this computer does come in handy in a important scene And finally, the scenario/story. I won't spoil anything here; I'll just try to convince you how great it is. Nolan is known to revolutionize everything when he tries a new genre in cinema. Well, once again he did it. With The Dark Knight he revolutionized the superhero genre. With Interstellar he's revolutionizing the sci-fi genre in cinema. he worked with a physicist in gravitational physics and astrophysics to help him with this movie. And we can feel and see just as Spielberg did in the 80s Nolan is doing it now Today, Nolan is laying the new foundations of the genre in cinema, proving that cinema is still at the beginning of what can be done (brace yourselves my friends, we have not seen anything yet). Why? Well, simply because we only know a few things about space, some things can't be proved for the moment, so we can use theory, and make the best of it. That is exactly what Nolan did. He used theories that exist today, and made a movie about mankind, about pioneers, about humanity, about us.whole journey that they thought was fraught with danger and the unknown as they have received messages from across time and space to realize that they had the answers after all it was just his daughter love to figure out what the lead scientist life work (Michael Caine) was about My rating for this movie can only be a 10,this film does not feel like 3hrs of moving space enthralling epic masterpiece with a beating heart of love and time and bending space time from a to b to meet his family across the universe This is the sci-fi movie of the decade, and probably the best movie Nolan ever made.if you like thinking about logic you might just come way thinking that this earth can be saved if we take what Nolan was taking about and not just taking the earth for granted Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night...

"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," a sign of the times a question asked posing a question a mystery to solve only the police to solve puzzle
","This film is up for all the major awards in the oscars its stunning
and deserves a few awards
its dark humour it has jokes 
one liners 
revenge 
and turns into a screwball comedy which from 
the name of the film its turns into something different
 that has to be seen 
its not the the ordinary awards film it has brilliant acting 
mldred Hayes (Academy Award winner Frances McDormand) makes a bold move, painting three signs leading into her town 
Although the film is about grief, anger, revenge and violence, it is extremely funny. Above all because of Mildred Hayes' 
stubborn character and her ability to verbally humiliate people by her extremely sharp tongue.
 The monologue she delivers when a priest visits her house to tell her she has gone too far, is priceless.
with a controversial message directed at William Willoughby (Academy Award nominee Woody Harrelson), 
the town's revered chief of police. When his second-in-command Officer Dixon (Sam Rockwell)
sam rockwell is having a ball and deservers a oscar caring for the law but 
, an immature mother's boy with a penchant for violence, gets involved, the battle between 
Mildred and Ebbing's law enforcement is only exacerbated
and the town turns against her 
Three Billboards will make you feel deeply, laugh loudly and think hard, often in the space of one scene.
 Despite the gravity of the subject matter, there are more laughs to be had here than in most traditional comedies; 
McDonagh's balancing act of dark humour and real human emotion pays off yet again, 
in a film that is geographically far removed from In Bruges, but shares much of its sensibility

Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Voices That pass through knowledge of a generations past to Channel a true spirit of power to cancel last orders
",", just got to see film in Jan in the cinema
this final part of the rebooted trilogy does rediscover a sense of adventure and maybe even a sense of wonder.
But there is something missing in this film
I gave it, 9/10 There's not just a sense of an ending with The Rise of Skywalker but also a sense of fatigue that we have seen this all before, especially in the mad dash of the closing battle. The once awe-inspiring visual flourishes and world-building spectacle have become merely quick rushes of been there done that . There is, after all, a fine line between the gravitas and profound Jedi-babble of Star Wars mythology and cornball sentiment and wooden dialogue.So after decades of intergalactic war and bloodletting family feuding it all comes to a end with a closing scene that may even leave you with a lump in your throat the size of the Death Star. However, be warned!JJ Abrams is back on board as director for this final chapter and there is a sense of righting the ship after The Last Jedi, a great film which went in a different way and I loved it because it tried a different wayand the rise of skywalker weighted down by its own self-importance. He mostly pulls it off with panache in a two-and-a-half hour movie bursting with spectacle, rip-roaring action scenes and maybe even a few tears with old camoes and old friends dropping in from time to time.
Scene set by that opening scroll, we are in a whole new galaxy of darkness. Forget all that talk about the First Order; now it's all about the Final Order, which just might be the evil empire to end all evil empires. Millions of light years away in an uncharted corner of the galaxy, a dark figure from the past is plotting quite a comeback...
when the film is given a chance to breath it delivers its most memorable and impactful moments with the emotional and physical moments between rey and kyko ren the glue holding them together
Meanwhile, in the rebels' secret base, Rey (Daisy Ridley) is losing faith as she completes her Jedi training under the watchful but bemused (well, it is Carrie Fisher) eye of General Leia Organa. In between aerobatic leaps and shinning up trees, Rey is also terrified by visions of her own possible future and this leads to some revelations
Sadly, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver, turning the space opera pulp into spun gold) has lost his tantrum-throwing fury and resolved his daddy issues. He is far more assured and in this movie. And his personal battles with rey are more deep and thoughtfulIt certainly looks spectacular. Our brave crew of Finn, Rey, Poe, Chewie, BB-8 and C-3PO (RD-D2 has very little to do) sure get around in a race against time to locate a vital navigational tool that may foil the Final Order's plans. They go planet-hopping, fetching up on a water world with a constantly-churning sea and a desert planet, Their sojourn here does have the film's best executed scenes - a speeder chase through canyons, which is essentially a re-run of the speeder chase on Endor from Return of the Jedi, and a desert showdown between Rey and Ren which sees them locked in a battle of wills over a stormtrooper transport suspended in mid-air.We finally get to find out why General Hux has been so very fidgety in the first two movies and I'd like to have seen more of Richard E Grant, who turns in a fantastically lip-curling performance as the truly dastardly Allegiant General Pryde. There's also a new droid by the name of D-0, who may be suffering from social anxiety
Abrams keeps up the pace in-between glances and military mumbo jumbo about weak points on Imperial star fighters, communication towers and pensive ruminations about the Dark Side.
So with rey funding her self in Exegol in the Unknown regions where her personal battle of minds and hearts gets all her powers from voices of Jedi masters all the past and present channelling generations of Jedi might into her through her if she can bring order to her family tree the final mins are emotional charged epic but lacks a heart beat",9,3,15,5 January 2020

","stand last stands hope rising above to breach the portals humanities existence against aliens W M D As a war between humankind and monstrous sea creatures wages on, a former pilot and a trainee are paired up to drive a seemingly obsolete special weapon in a desperate Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi effort to save the world from the apocalypse @ 2hrs 11mins i gave it 8/10 written/ directed Guillermo del Toro this film made over 100 million which nobody say coming he wanted tom cruise to play idris Elba's character stacker Pentecost but turned it down to so he could do oblivion which idris Elba played a blinder but has nothing on tom cruise but idris does a great job here being the leader of the resistance this is a underrated film that has great potential like transformers but Giant monsters (known as Kaijus) are the extraterrestrial beings that are currently ravaging Earth. However, they don't come from above the atmosphere, instead they come from beneath us. A portal in the bottom of the ocean serves as the method of transport these Kaijus use to reach us. These Kaijus are arriving one by one, and as they do, they increase in size. They're so massive in size (I reckon they're bigger than Godzilla) and the amount of destruction they cause is just indescribable. to fight monsters we created our mechanical monsters they action is brilliant', this movie has a real sensible plot off 2 unlikely heroes's Now that seems like a basic plot, but I can tell you that there's actually more than that and the story is deeper than it looks from the outside. 'Pacific Rim' provides sensible explanations for the phenomenons that occurred in the film. Now I'm not a genius or a scientist, but the explanation is logical. The characters. Our protagonist is Raleigh Becket. He's had a bad time after his partner and older brother Yancy died in a battle against a Kaiju before. But he's recruited by Marshal Stacker Pentecost to pilot one of the four remaining Jaegers. His new partner is Mako Mori, a Japanese girl who wants to be a pilot to avenge the death of her family. Becket's and Mori's Jaeger is the American-made Gypsy Heart the characters feel reel sense of heroism as we The cast behind the characters were great too. Charlie Hunnam was terrific as Raleigh. Idris Elba gave a commanding performance as Stacker. Rinko Kikuchi rocked as Mako Mori. The chemistry between Hunnam and Kikuchi was excellent too. But I have to give special credit to Ron Perlman (who previously played in del Toro's 'Hellboy' films) as the black marketeer Hannibal Chau who makes a living by dealing with Kaiju organs. He has style and charisma. I also loved Burn Gorman and Charlie Day as Dr. Hermann Gottlieb and Dr. Newton Geizler, respectively. Their chemistry was absolutely perfect and these two were just amazing. Guillermo del Toro also did a great job in his directing because I gradually became supportive of the Jaegers and every time they fought, I rooted for them to win. I became immersed into the movie. Every time a Jaeger was in trouble, I was rooting for them to get back up and fight back again. I wanted them to smash the Kaijus to pieces. Pacific Rim' is just simply awesome. Now, it may not be for everyone, but if you love action, giant monsters, and giant robots, you'll definitely love this. Or if you're just trying to have some fun, watch this. It's got both brains and brawn. Final Verdict: 'Pacific Rim' is an amazing and explosive ride that is plenty of fun to watch, accompanied with dazzling visuals and a coherent plot. spectacular i wonder what the sequel will be like lets wait and see",8,0,1,10 June 2016
American Sniper," unique and gritty look through two sides of a legends life
","well here is a film that grabs your attention from the start there are war films and there is sniper films and there is not many of them told I have seen middle east film like the kingdom, Michael Clayton ,jarhead and black hawk down , compared to the them this is brilliant film war film on my list only a few have got a 9 out of ten this film depicts Bradley cooper as Chris kyle who thinks life is easy as a cowboy but after 2001 thinks he can help America but not thinking of how little things in a war can effect him basically he there but an empty shell of a person so Bradley cooper really gets his acting skills on depicting post traumatic stress disorder because being in a war zone leaves him looking over his shoulders after four tours of watching for insurgents running at you when he comes home to his wife and kids this leaves him restless and not knowing who is friend or foe but he becomes a legend because of his sniping kills even kids are in his line of fire protecting his army buds but he is hunted because A warrior has a job to do,'. 'It is a noble job. It is a hard job. He takes those moments upon himself so the rest of us will not have to. He looks evil in the eye and stands up to it so we can sleep soundly as he said he didn't want to kill but in order to protect freedom he didn't want god to judge his role More than that, however, he says the film also reveals the true nature of the US's adversaries.'American Sniper goes where no movie has gone before in showing how the enemy uses children, kills children and savagely tortures its enemies,' he writes.The film also shows that while war can be traumatic, most soldiers 'emerge on the other side, often better men'. as he became a hero for the Americans he also become the hunted with a bounty on his head so he began hunting this insurgent ill leave this part alone so I don't give away to much but this film deserves some Oscar like black hawk down but eddie redymane deserves his for best actor for theory of everything sienna miller does brilliant at as wife of a husband overseas left to pick up the pieces of whats left of his soul. clint eastwood does great at his directing and pacing great story of what killing does and then trying to integrate back into society only to be taking down by one his own 2hrs 12 mins a legand a warrior a hero for the ages someone to thank you for saving freedom and lives",9,7,22,22 January 2015
Rocky II," rocky struggles with own doubts of high expectations his sprite is low his love is down can he get his connection right one more time.
","Rocky struggles in family life after his bout with Apollo Creed,while the embarrassed champ insistently goads him to accept a challenge for a rematch. this film is good but not as good as the first. I gave this one 8 out of 10 , this film is 1hr59 mins directed written and stareSylvester Stallone They've come a long way together...a boxer and a dreamer. But there is still one fight left. this is a classic fight film showinng how rocky wants to go back to noraml but has to make end meat to get by. this film is more fun as we get to know the carracters more. As we find out rocky has no eduation due to his as he tries his hand at comericals. Rocky Balboa is enjoying life. He has a lovely wife, Adrian, had a successful fight with Apollo Creed and is able to enjoy the moneyhe earned from the fight and a new endorsement deal. Unfortunately, Rocky becomes embarrassed when failing to complete an advert and ends up working in a meat packing company. He believes that he will no longer have a career as a boxer.So Rocky settles down, marries Adrian and a child comes along as well to add to the borad However soon his ability to not read well costs him his job making commercials and Rocky struggles to find another job. Elsewhere Apollo Creed is furious that so many people are criticizing him for going 15 rounds with a guy who came off that street. So Apollo wants a rematch. Rocky decides that he must fight again, which upsets Adrian due to the health risks he may face. But with adrian in hospital rocky put his life on hold his carer on hold Apollo Creed is shown more and his character is expanded the most and you get to see what he is like more. Carl Weathers does a great job with Creed in this episode and really plays the upset athlete at the media well. Paulie takes a back seat in this film for the most part but Adrian is very significant in this film as she is the main reason why Rocky is so reluctant to get back in the ring.The training that Rocky does in this film is epic. Love the training that he goes through in this film,slamming metal, chasing chickens, and hopping around with lumber on his shoulders.Rocky really works hard training in this film, my personal favorite of his films in how he trains.. The 'Gonna Fly Now' song is not the same as it is in the first film. It is not sung by the same people who sang it is the first film so it is not nearly as good. However this song is only used when Rocky is running, not when he is doing his other training. They used the 'Going the Distance' gets you pummped up. And ready for the actionA great sequel that is funny, further expands the story and characters, and has some really great and memorable moments. A must see and easily the second best film of the series.",8,2,2,25 October 2017
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The path of the chosen one judgment is clouded by the darkness at his cross roads just as colonial interstellar war of conspiracy begins
","this film is under rated big time star wars attack of the clones 2hrs 22mins 7/10 set 22 yrs before the original star wars directed by George Lucas so ten yrs of his original meeting Anakin hides his romance from the republic as obi wan finds out about murder attempt on the senator and finds a clone army for the Jedi to protect the republic in a twist. as Anakin has grown he is becoming more powerful he is becoming a handful for obi wan his crossroad of his training and his meeting with a powerful figure leads to a choice so as obi wan goes looking. The story line is great. The opening chase scene is great. Obi-Wan's search for the missing planet is great. The final battle is great. Most all of it is great. And, one thing that I greatly appreciate about this film is Christopher Lee's performance as Count Dooku. Funny name aside, Lee turns out a convincing portrayal of a lead antagonist that makes you understand what the Dark Side is all about. I found Darth Maul to be rather lacking as a villain in 'Phantom Menace', but Lee makes up for this in profound fashion.with Anakin and Yoda fighting to stop count dooku from changing Anakin as they found out who hired her. The Jedi Council assigns Obi-Wan Kenobi to discover who has tried to kill Amidala and Anakin to protect her in Naboo. Obi-Wan discovers that the dart is from the planet Kamino, and he heads to the remote planet. He finds an army of clones that has been under production for years for the Republic and that the bounty hunter Jango Fett was the matrix for the clones. Meanwhile Anakin and Amidala fall in love with each other, and he has nightmarish visions of his mother. They travel to his home planet .I have to say that I find this to be a really enjoyable movie. I tried not to like it when it first came out due to its name. Seriously, George Lucas...'Attack of the Clones'? I mean, I get it, but there were lots of options for a better name than that. 'but hey its star wars and the acting is good and the battle finale meaning the dark side is getting stronger and Anakin coming stronger means he is close to choosing his life",7,1,2,15 May 2016
Lion," getting lost from a family is traumatic experience and a challenge is finding them again is a mammoth needle in a haystack t
","this truly emotional tear jerkier journey begins a 1hr 58mins of a truly emotional and mammoth journey that Will have you crying your eyes for the trip you went on with saroo and then to find out the truth will leave people who have hearts of stone cracked with tears this | Drama i gave it a 9/10 A five-year-old Indian boy gets lost on the streets of Calcutta, thousands of kilometers from home. Garth Davis' deeply moving directorial debut Lion is about as uplifting as a film can get, without ever feeling emotionally manipulative. It tells the true story of Saroo Brierley, a young boy who gets lost in India after hopping on the wrong train and ends up homeless in Calcutta before being adopted by an Australian couple. Twenty years later, he begins an odyssey to try and track down his birth mother and hometown. It's an astonishing film which is both a tearjerker and a crowd-pleas er - without being a sell-out. this has a strong cast this story is played out over two stories interconnecting saroos young life with his middle 20 self to piece together how he got lost and try investigate where his village was from 1600 km away not properly pronouncing his name or his village and speaking Hindi and not Bengali language so this film is about separation finding a family and getting into the complex story of adoption process and his unanswered questions the felling guilty for leaving his brother he wanted to let know he was safe and mother but cause his new life was in saroos way guddu his older brother was in his mind playing games collecting money to get food but saroos girlfriend Lucy played by Rooney mara his on off girlfriend found him hard to be around as quest became unbearable his guilt drives him to hide this quest from his adoptive parents and his girlfriend. Only when he has an epiphany does he realize not only the answers he needs, but also the steadfast love he has always had with all his loved ones in both worlds and the guilt but the a stunning child performance played by sunny pawar makes you want him to find the needle in the very big haystack as we Davis' film builds to a truly beautiful conclusion that left me emotionally destroyed.as you and saroo finds the truth . the truth hits like a runaway rain that the emotion flows its the saddest happy film that you will seeI think the fact that this is a true story played a massive part in the conclusion having such an impact on me. Davis plays it out brilliantly and the inclusion of real life footage in the end credits, along with startling facts about how many children go missing in India, just added more power to the already powerful film it deserves a best actor and best film for the journey you go on .

Ant-Man," Mind control of his species gives a master thief a whole new evolution in a shrinking world Protecting the origins of a secret in a daring heist
","The myth of the quantum realm we're all the hero's we're throwing into
Access to the Quantum Realm was finally realized by scientist Doctor Hank Pym through the use of Pym Particles, particles of an extra-dimensional nature that are capable of altering the size of beings or objects. Janet van Dyne, Pym's wife
A Sling Ring is a mystical object which enables the wearer to open a dimensional portal to other locations , and also, although it requires much effort, throughout the Multiverse as well this film is from the 80s and 1995 and now its totally fun great cgi and brings a different way of thinking to marvel mutiverse
Ant-Man was not at all what I expected. I have been a fan of most of the previous movies of the Marvel Cinematic universe, . it has good story and time line with ultron and holds your interest throughout. There are plenty of action and the fight scenes, but unlike the previous Marvel movies, this movie focuses on a heist. This, along with the comedy throughout, makes it a breath of fresh air in the Marvel universe. No Marvel movie since has so seamlessly bonded the genre of action and comedy. And when looking for Howard's stark facility the for the stuff that controls the machine for the particle is on avengers soil this is fun when ant man encounters falcon because he breached security
Scot lange played Paul rudd shows a vulnerable side
The main character, Scott Lange, is not a billionaire or scientist or ancient god, and he doesn't have super strength or intelligence; he is a thief who deals with holding down a job or not but when a job comes along he finds something or kinda faith plays a part in a job he stumbles upon that might save his life in San Francisco and her earns to be able to see his daughter. This makes him incredibly relatable. Being played by Paul Rudd doesn't hurt either. Rudd, along with the rest of the cast, delivers a memorable performance. The idea of a father trying to reconcile his relationship with his daughter may have been used before, but Evangeline Lilly and Michael Douglas make it work without seeming trite or overused. The role that really stands out is Corey Stoll as Yellowjacket. He is, in my opinion, the most terrifying villain the Marvel universe has seen yet. He doesn't want global domination, he wants money and power, and that makes him a very believable villain. Stoll's performance is more three-dimensional than one might expect in a super hero movie, and adds to the already great cast. 8/10",8,1,1,20 September 2019

When a terrifying force threatens everyone a cross to the globe the world's greatest soldier wages war against the evil hydra of organisation led by I'm famous red skull played by Hugo weaving who robes the tesseract in Norway for his new energy sourceChris Evans is a good Captain America and downplays any flashiness associated with him as the Human Torch. The CGI effects that show him as a scrawny twig were seamless. He carries that vulnerability with him throughout the film whether he is getting beaten up physically or emotionally. There is a good old fashioned sets with captain America helping the army in the woods get into hydra fortress with an attack on a bike using his shield then saving his friend on the train chasing after running red skull on the train and the plane getaway sequenceThe rest of the cast fills their roles well- especially Tommy Lee Jones as the gruff, but lovable, colonel and Hugo Weaving as the evil baddie bent on wold domination. Those two play their characters the way you would expect them to. Although .' The only odd twist is that Captain America's sidekick from the comics, Bucky Barnes, is much tougher and older than you'd expect. And the power source Howard stark is looking to use is the blueprints Tony stark finds in iron man
Red Skull enters New York City as a target for his end game. On the display, the word 'Ziel' appeared, which is German for 'target'. It is also the Dutch word for 'soul'. In Avengers: Infinity War (2018) we discover Red Skull to have become the guide to the Soul Stone after his seeming demise in this movie caused by the Space Stone inside the tesseract.There are numerous one-liners throughout the movie that You also get plenty of action and explosions which are always a crowd favorite. Stylistically, it's very similar to Iron Man. Overall, it's a fun comic book adaptation that really adds into steam Marvel is building up to with The Avengers. Nice work.

He brings some very much needed brevity to the proceedings and loves his jocks to show off to the media Julia Roberts acting is e Screenwriters dream Richard Curtis's ('Four Weddings And A Funeral') goal this time around seems to be a sharp satire of the Hollywood starlets and their psychotic relationships with the public and themselves, and the old wacky English humour we've come to expect from any film with Mr. Grant. It's a very odd mixture of the audience-pleasing easy comedy and something more sinister - possibly due to both lead's past public lives. so as they meet Williams friends and family they cant believe who he brought to a family party so she is ordinary like everybody the romantic music soundtrack is very good to deal with offset of their story as it goes has a lot to say about fame and the effects of it on a life. It never bothers to take a stand or really explain if Roberts's character embraces her super stardom or is oppressed by it. Screenwriter Curtis makes compelling arguments for both sides of the debate but strays away from truly looking deep within their souls When you think about it, William was a fan of Anna but was worried that the fame thing would have an effect on him 'Notting Hill' is an extremely charming film with so much love to offer. 7/10 and its perfect date night film .",7,0,1,27 August 2015

Hoover Pat McClung John Frazier Best Music, Original Song Diane Warren And that song 'I Don't Want To Miss A Thing'. Which plays at your heartstrings at a pivotal moment in the story After discovering that an asteroid the size of Texas is going to impact Earth in less than a month, N.A.S.A. recruits a misfit team of deep core drillers to save the planet. So as we see oil workers finding oil on when we see Bruce Willis . captures the 'reluctant hero' role, of .. Harry Stamper perfectly which is unusual for Bruce to play against type finds Ben Affleck ... A.J. Frost character in bed with his daughter the guy he trust the most she 4Liv Tyler ... Grace Stamper who is love interest as her father goes on the rampage NASA flies in to find harry to ask for help in drilling on the asteroid he asks for his team to go with the head of NASA Billy Bob Thornton ..character. Dan Truman who is stressed out that his new astronauts might not be able to handle space training as we taught this film is fiction we see 25 yrs later they landed a satellite on a meteor maybe in the future this could become science fact. These asteroids also decimated New York soon thereafter. Then, NASA discovered that there is an asteroid roughly the size of Texas heading towards the Earth, and when it does hit the Earth, the planet itself and all of its inhabitants will be obliterated, worse, the asteroid will hit the Earth in 18 days. Unfortunately, NASA's plans to destroy the asteroid are irrelevant. That is when the U.S. military decides to use a nuclear warhead to blow the asteroid to pieces. Then, scientists decide to blow the asteroid with the warhead inside the asteroid itself. The only man to do it, is an oil driller named Harry Stamper and his group of misfit drillers and geologists. As he and his drill team prepare for space excavation, the asteroid is still heading towards the Earth so we have a huge cast for this because there's is two teams independence and freedom on two space shuttles with the cast as follows is Will Patton ... Chick / Steve Buscemi .his character is deadly in space but his comic timing is crazy but dangerous in space.. RockhoundWilliam Fichtner ... Colonel Willie Sharp Owen Wilson ... Oscar ChoiMichael Clarke Duncan ... Bear /Peter Stormare ... Lev Andropov Ken Hudson Campbell ... Max ( Jessica Steen ... Co-Pilot Jennifer Watts 3Keith David ... General Kimsey / Jason Isaacs ... Ronald Quincy But as they refuel on Mir we see an explosion and the two teams barely survive and then have so come behind the big rock but as one team heads toward the rock freedom gets hit and is blown to pieces leaving the mission in a danger and independence is missed it mark so they have to drill 800 feet in iron fer-rite which is very hard but with Ben character missing and the team having difficulties it's actually very dramatic. The acting is great from pretty much all accounts, even Ben Affleck does a good job here coming to the rescue but the team are undermined by earth because they don't believe they can do it but Bruce character turns out to be a hero in the end a we see his last transmission to his daughter this film is so underrated",8,1,2,5 August 2016

Dunkirk," getting home was hard so home came to them on the brink a will to sacrifice regroup and come back stronger
","Christopher Nolan's relentlessly tense historical epic Dunkirk is a war movie like no other its heartrenching it has 3 stories to tell its a classic film and its the best film of the year its feel so real you think your in it. its on par with saving private Ryan as a movie this film just immerses you in war with a story with harrowing soldiers coming out of a battle and seeing them no words can describe what the saw but this film rips up the conventional war book completely rewriting it and makes you panic as you are place on the escaping land sea and air there is no need for back story but the music with Hans zimmerthe score is breathtaking as the dodge bombs bullets and drowning as the wait at the beaches as the English general Kenneth branagh character struggles to help his men home the spitfigters are helping the people in the boats from being attacked by a superb tom hardy he buys people time to get rescued this is his tired film he has a mask i don't think he likes to talk much just act as the navy has asked for help with the small boats so you see the rousing story and seeing these men help the 400000 solders regroup its very emotional this part of the film , a gripping, edge-of-your-seat thriller than doesn't give you a moment to catch your breath. you don't need a list actors in a war movie as the director has outdone himself again and maybe it will get loads of Oscars people go see this movie in all its gloryThe Oscar-nominated director has carefully crafted a truly immersive cinematic experience that drops the viewer right in the middle of the action.Nolan's elegantly concise script distills the heroic story of the Dunkirk evacuation into three intersecting perspectives – the land, sea and air –which play out on different time lines. Dunkirk is a taut, incessantly nail-biting and harrowing depiction of a pivotal moment in recent history. this film is 1hr40mins and the budget is well spent i gave this a 10 out of ten your heart will be pounding and no words can describe how shocking the world could have been with the heroic people who risked the life to help Europe to come from the edge of extinction .",10,4,11,27 July 2017

Captain America: Civil War," a line has been drawn in the sand as politically motivated accord causes a civil unrest amongst the avengers splits the group powerful apart chose which side your on
","So we have captain America 3 is a avengers in disguise minus Thor and hulk that would drop any film down from ten to 8.5 but we have fine comic and action paring in the new incarnation of spider man and a new character of black panther to bring the film up 2to 10:out of ten. this film improves on Ultron even though that was a marvelous film but this is a lean and busy smart story which is also very strong indeed the jokes are left to the new characters as the main story is brilliant so no need for them here as it's a civil war as captain America played by ever evolving Chris Evans he is the spiritual leader of the avengers but he jealousy of iron man tony stark who buys everything. so he is being undermined by him so with that out of the way we have a James bond style opening where we have captain America the black widow falcon and a drone chasing targets in Lagos so with hydra trying for wmd and there bad on the loose causing issues for the team chasing these targets a mishandle effort causing collateral damage the UN and world leaders want to reign in the superheroes only do dived the team in two iron man, black widow war machine on one side of the accord then on the other other captain America Scarlett witch hawkeye falcon and the vison and ant man and the newbies introduced get some of the comic relief in between the action to cause a stir but as captain America thinks he being boxed in and no freedom Tensions start to flare and to make he is emotional due to a loss of a figure head in the founding of shield. and things get worse, in that the Captain's old friend Bucky Barnes aka The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) appears his mind gets altered like he hypnotized so he lining up another high profile assassination. The ensuing chaos quickly drags the rest of The Avengers into the mix as everyone starts to take sides in a fight no one wants to be having. Both characters make a big impact both in their introductions and their roles in the plot as it unfolds. The story itself also makes some clever twists and turns along the way. Just when I thought things were getting predictable and eye-rolling cheesy it all changed and created a new dynamic of for the characters involved. Fight scenes are scattered throughout and serve to dazzle and amaze with a surprising amount of humour thrown in along the way. So with winter solder being captain America old alley his background has changed his mind alters like a switch and captain America side with him causing a few twist in this film takes his vengeance out causing captain America to save his friend ultimately leading a 2 on 1 situation causing no end of harm a and also a old figure head in captain America life gone changes his belief and alters his taught process. and old fashioned car chase ensues with the with the having his own agenda black panther chases the winter solder and captain to fight it out during the chase with the law not far behind. after this a past haunts and hurts iron man down to his guilt and that cause grief so much that he takes his vengeance out causing captain America to split the team as hydra suicide bombing in Europe and so with law enforcements chasing around trying to bring justice reign in the collateral damage and when the sides come together to get there points across to look for a peacefull resolution, as we get the civil war choosing who side is who on but there's a pivitol moment in the film when the side realize that 2 against one who will stand and fight for a friend or who will fall and die trying or will the political motivations get the interfere. with Marvel films in 2016 is that this is now the 13th film in their current ongoing cinematic universe. Your enjoyment of any of the Avengers films or this Captain America film will largely be affected by how many of the previous films you have seen and paid attention to. The character development is great but it takes place over a number of films and isn't suited to anyone looking to drop in for a quick superhero flick. With this being the last 'main' story film before the third Avengers movie in 2018, a lot of things are left open. Not everyone gets to live happily ever after, and that's a good thing, but with two films every year Marvel movies are going from strength to strength . Whether or not they can keep the momentum going again through a number of solo films remains to be seen. Captain America : Civil War is now showing in every cinema imaginable and is absolutely recommended viewing, but only if you've actually seen some of the recent ones. the story lines are big the big wow moment is here is well 2hrs17 Min's and two end of credits sequence stay right to the end as well the characters are a strong as ever 10/10 ill leave the spoilers out as impacts on the story.",10,11,24,6 May 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," pre potter documenting a global search for beasts and magic hidden in plain sight an essential guidebook from a- z on where to find all of them
","I saw this in the cinema an its worth the price of the tickets as newt friend is a slimy beast of robbing everything his name is niffler cute but cunning, as the story the 1920 new York setting and twist and cameo the film doesn't feel 2hrs13mins and its mostly adult went to see this its for Harry potter fans too Seventy years before Harry Potter was given accommodation under the stairs, wizard Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) lands in New York in order to make a trip to Arizona. Not one to waste a trip, Newt is carrying with him a suitcase full of magical beasts which have been almost entirely outlawed in the US. The UK and US wizarding communities have very different ways of seeing things believe it or not, and sometimes to the extreme. Auror Tina Goldstein soon apprehends him after an incident at the bank sees him losing track of the beasts and his briefcase is a vast safari park for endangered species . Accompanied by normal human being Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler) they now must track them down in the hustle and bustle of New York City. Complicating matters are a spate of murders and environmental disasters being attributed to the magical community. At risk of discovery from a group known as the New Salemites, Percival Graves (Colin Farrell) and the Magical Congress of the USA must now find Newt and the one behind the disturbances.As you can see, the film that has to start a new franchise has a lot packed into it. Fantastic Beasts is not a prequel to the Harry Potter franchise. It is very much a spin off set within the same wizarding universe. The rules of the world are generally the same but all the characters are new and interesting. It does falter in some parts by making reference to characters from the Harry Potter books a bit too much and expecting a slight bit more knowledge of the subject material that can really be reasonable. I did have to spend a few minutes after the film googling character names to figure out what was being referenced.Everyone puts on a great performance across the board with Ezra Miller being the unexpected highlight as a young member of the New Salemites. Arguably the most impressive feature of Fantastic Beasts is how dark they were willing to go with some of the content. I'm admittedly a sucker for whenever a fantasy or family film is willing to be somewhat realistic with its plot and avoid the fairy-tale tropes. The New Salemites plot thread is bound to have some of the younger viewers watching between their fingers but provides a really interesting side to the wizarding world for anyone older.Whether or not you will find the same enjoyment that I did in Fantastic Beasts depends a lot on how you feel about the Harry Potter series. I don't think it does enough to stand on its own to anyone who hasn't seen the other films, nor will it change the minds of anyone who rolls their eyes at the series. From the opening Warner Bros logo with the Harry Potter theme lightly sprinkled in, to the flick of the wands and the lore of it all, I had a smile on my face like I was back watching the first movie again. In the end it was just really fun to get absorbed in a brand new story in an existing universe where we don't know what's going to happen for once. If they could have spent a bit more time developing the villain instead of relying on previous Harry Potter knowledge it would have gotten full marks, but for now it's well worth a watch",9,2,6,30 November 2016

","back to middle earth i kind of knew how the first hobbit would end but this film grabs you in and doesn't let go until the end which was unexpected and making you want to see the last hobbit it bring back the memories of the first L O T R .the second grabs you with breataking story. amazing special effects FAR darker tone and MUCH more fantasy action The spiders of Mirkwood here approach actual horror.the piercing together of the dark lord from the L O T R trilogy because its 60 years behind the originals bring s a little bits of the story of where the dark lord got his power will already know that this is the start of the war with Sauron, and the all-important Dark Lord could not well be ignored. Tolkien in his letters noted how Sauron casts just 'a fleeting shadow' over the pages of The Hobbit; in Jackson's movie the shadow is darker and deeper.Entire new subplots are freely created and added to the story. The Elf Tauriel and her unlikely infatuation with one of the Dwarfs is clearly meant to add a love story where the book has none, and have at least ONE strong female character its was nice to see Orlando bloom back his actions scenes were brilliant.bilboa bagins brings a kinda warmth to the story of trying to be a hero.you know waiting for the dragon to come along was well worth the Wait as the first film teased because the action scenes story and and thing of smegal the way his character was done thing 100 times better with the dragon this was highlight of a terrific movie that the left you spellbound is nothing short of brilliant, full of detail that can only be appreciated on the, I'll award Jackson's re-imagined 'The Hobbit' 9 an half stars.",9,0,4,19 December 2013

","So we have 19 films in the MCU after 10 years we get the the end game in marvel phase 3

2hrs 29mins and 10 mins for credits with an all important sos to 
the ulitimate hero in a marvel ous universe so not giving plot spoilers just
figure that one out 
this is my biggest written review i have giving 
with 6 stones played out over 19 films
 1 The Space Stone (a.k.a. The Tesseract) this was found in captain america the first avenger all those years ago
The Space Stone gives the user power over space. Anyone holding the Space Stone can create a portal from one part of the universe to another
2The Mind Stone (Loki's scepter) thor .The Mind Stone allows the user to control the minds of others. 
3The Reality Stone (Aether) the purple stone The Reality Stone grants the user power to manipulate matter. comes the second thor movie
4 The Power Stone the guradian of the galaxy The Power Stone bestows upon its holder a lot of energy-the sort of energy that you could use to destroy an entire planet. 
5The Time Stone (Eye of Agomoto)The Time Stone grants its owner the power to re-wind or fast-forward time this is seen in doctor strange
6The Soul Stone Basically the Soul Stone allows the user to control others 'souls,' both living and dead rumoured to be in Wakanda
this is iron mans 30 iron man suit out of 46 comic creations wow
Thanod has no conscience so His motivations feel somewhat morally ambiguous and at times even make him seem sympathetic. 
Directors Anthony and Joe Russo do a superb job developing Thanos' personality outside of simply wanting universal dominationas he has emerged from the universal shadows
thanos is a despot looking for power and his time in the sunset
 With the Q ship in New York this destroys New York as thanos hench men come looking for the stones
ebany ma and friend come after the strange with iron man and his protege spider iron man
so we get this iron man gets onto this Q-space ship and head off to titan with wity popular one liners to help and pop culture to refernce 
We see all the story take place in space with guardians after they gettting a distress beacon space and find a planet destoryed and a thor in distress
without his trusty item but finds but finds Nidavellir,but has to restart a planets dangerous engine 
where they and Eitri create an enchanted battle-axe known as Stormbreaker this might or might not be the key
there we see all the hero's story vision just happens to be in Scotland to trying to stay out of the spotlight with scarlett witch
they come under and attack but captain america , the black widown and falcon rescue him this all leads to wakanda. 
I did not see the film black panter but the higlight of the film is the nearly the main event and battle with the soundstrack from avengers ringing out
when the q ships come and the alien shape shifters called Chitauri attack wakanda and we see an all out battle with the fortress under an attack 
we 6 heroes here doing shock and awe explosions 
bruce and the hulk have a fun time her but they have issues and may need therapy fun or what in the heat of battle 
he has a lend of a machine but in space groot has handle on things he is central to a comeback in the heat of battle 
Two years after the events of Captain America: Civil War, the Avengers team remain a fractured group of heroes,
 with some completely dropping off the radar altogether. However, one day, the powerful intergalactic tyrant Thanos (Josh Brolin
) arrives on Earth to complete his collection of Infinity Stones, which upon acquiring all six, will allow him to control half of the known universe. With time quickly running out, 
The Avengers must reunite and team up with the Guardians of the Galaxy to put an end to Thanos' unquenchable thirst for power.
so we have 6 stone from all over the universe a rampaging thanos is the ulitimat vllian 
his home of titan has been destroyed 
while this is going iron man spider iron man and doctor strange and Peter Quill / Star-Lord trying to fight thanos on his home planet
this is the critical moment in the story and brilliant set peices and some film's darker tone, there are still some hilarious scenes of bante
so with the avengers broke up there split in seperat battles across space and several stars planets 
so with thanos proving that no challenge is left unturned no love can change his path of destiny 
vormir is where thanos given the choice he choses death over life with a heartbreaking moral to his story
with so much at stake he must just leave his gurard down but with a mass extinction on superhero scale
but an old leader has the power he pages a hero calling to the heavens can one person answer that call or has fight gone for ever 
this sos for the ulitimate can the day be saved or this is it for everyone",10,1,2,8 May 2018

Ghost Rider," a bounty hunter under contact by the devil blazing a hell of a trail beating the devil at his own game to beat the clause
","Ghost Rider came out (2007) I loved this film in the cinema its one of marvel lesser known film in 1h 54min | Action, Fantasy, Thriller Directed Mark Steven Johnson who done the unloved daredevil this a fine job of mixing cgi with live action When the motorcyclist Johnny Blaze finds that his father Barton Blaze has a terminal cancer, he accepts a pact with the Mephistopheles, giving his soul for the health of his beloved father. But the devil deceives him, and Barton dies in a motorcycle accident during an exhibition. Johnny leaves the carnival, his town, his friends and his girlfriend Roxanne. Years later Johnny Blaze becomes a famous motorcyclist, who risks his life in his shows, and he meets Roxanne again, now a TV reporter. However, Mephistopheles proposes Johnny to release his contract if he become the 'Ghost Rider' and defeat his evil son Blackheart, who wants to possess one thousand evil souls and transform hell on earth. Hell Is About To Be Unleashed with an enormous budget$110,000,000 (estimated) it had an Opening Weekend:$52,022,908 and it grossed 130millin American and world wide gross$315,802,596 Nicolas Cage is hilarious. He has a face that is like a silent movie actors and I kept thinking about movies like Nosferatu or Phantom of the Opera. He's been waiting for years to play this role and you can really feel how much fun he's having just going crazy, especially in the first scene when Johnny Blaze turns into the Ghost Rider. The movie just borders on the edge of campy but always manages to pull itself back before going to far. And Sam Elliott. It's got Sam Elliot. What more could you ask for? His curse has become his power with astonishing special with the character is an uncompromising bad ass johnny blaze suits nick cage down to a tie over the top character he was only a teenage stunt biker when he sold his soul to the devil peter Fonda character years later johnny is a world renowned daredevil by day a and a ghost-rider at night of marvel back catolougue legend as t devil sidekick bounty hunter he is looking after evil souls on earth and throwing to hell but in a cruel twist of fate johnny comes back to his first love eve Mendez who is a journalist johnny blaze thinks he might still have some chance if he can beat the devil and win his soul back to do so he will have to defeat black heart the devils son played by wes Bentley traces of around with detectives gathering info as they wreck the city and ghost-rider making a mess of the roads with his flames from his bike and his motley crew come for ghost-rider and leave hell bent on getting what he wants his wayward son whose plotting to take over his fathers realm and collide hell with earth unless ghost-rider can think of a plan in time.and with the caretaker taking care of his soul he is also on one last ride to hell with his double act with the ghost-rider in the old west",7,0,0,7 March 2017

Add Robin Williams in perhaps his best role ever (too close to Good Morning Vietnam for me to make the call), and you have a wonderfully entertaining movie.Ben Affleck is convincing as the best friend to a genius, able to effectively play the joker and the friend who would 'lay down in traffic for you'. Matt Damon's portrayal of that genius realizing that life has something more to offer than batting cages and bars is equally stunning. And Robin Williams certainly leaves nothing to be desired in this inspiring and emotionally film my 166 review",8,1,3,20 July 2016
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," a heavy burden on a small shoulders his guide is dangerous & precious as leaders battle for freedom battle rages an evil ally changes brings middle earth to its knees
","As assumed, The Two Towers begins where The Fellowship of the Ring ended. The majority of the film follows four separate groups and their story lines: Frodo and Sam; Aragorn and Legolas , Merry and Pippin, and Saruman and his army. The performances live well up to the standards of the first film,with a particularly notable performance from Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, whose role is significantly larger in The Two Towers.Aragorn satisfies a thirst for someone to root for, a thirst that was left partly unfurnished in Fellowship. It's much easier to root for Aragorn than it is for Frodo;Aragorn has many more qualities of a leading man, a soldier, and a hero. More than once did the audience, filled mostly with academy voters, applaud the heroics of Aragorn . Gollum also shines in a much-welcomed large role, due to extremely realistic computer animation, and a fine performance from Andy Serkis,upon which the animation was modeled. In Fellowship, it was appropriate to consider Gollum one of the many great 'features' of the film . However, here he is more of a leading character and a 'star,' and his convincing dual-personality, stabbing voice, andwell-choreographed body movements make him consistently eye-grabbing and the center of focus of nearly every scene in which he appears. with the end tended version of 3hrs 25mins on DVD this film is a instant classic like the first he was unknown director peter Jackson but was given a treasure chest to bring magic to the big screen with 94 million budget for this it made 340million While Frodo and Sam edge closer to Mordor with the help of gollum who has a split personality who brings them on his own terms so he can get his precious back Frodo is brought through dead marshes the ring is getting uncomfortable to him as the souls reach out to him SAM is struggling with this journey as we see the orcs come under attack from Eomer who takes the gang to Osgiliath? where the last past of middle earth is stay to fight but saurian and his dragon follow the eye to nearly get Frodo isengard are readying the army with sauron ready to do battle the other hobbits find an ancients trees who find that the forest is coming alive and when Pippin tells what has happened the story in two towers has 3 or four story arcs with Gandalf the white coming to leogloas and Aragon who are on there way to rowan where the king is under a suaraon magic spell and Aragon and his friends are ambushed on the way leading to him going missing and Erwin willing him back to go to plead at rowan that it is not safe their and get them to helms deep the mid point of the battle of middle earth so as we so the stories coming together Aragorn comes back leoglas is reading the small armies at helms and Frodo on his way as see the archers the orc suicide bomber break the fortification the desperate to hold on the swashbuckling action from legolas grimly battle axing the orcs the elves and then last stand by Aragorn and elves only for Gandalf and to comes to the rescue in this civil war but the bigger battles lie ahead The battle sequence alone represents successful filmmaking in its highest form. The choreography of the battle, the visual effects, the pacing, acting, cinematography, and music, all work together in perfection to achieve grand filmmaking which is as entertaining and enjoyable as film can be.For this very reason, no one, whether a fan of Fellowship or not, should miss The Two Towers. it deserved more than 2 Oscars but as we know that last was a classic of any era. 9.5/10",9,0,0,6 July 2017

Emilie Schindler / Jonathan Sagall ... Poldek Pfefferberg (as Jonathan Sagalle) Embeth Davidtz ... Helen Hirsch Schindler is a vainglorious and greedy German businessman who becomes an unlikely humanitarian amid the barbaric German Nazi reign when he feels compelled to turn his factory into a refuge for Jews. Based on the true story of Oskar Schindler who managed to save about 1100 Jews from being gassed at the Auschwitz concentration camp, it is a testament to the good in all of us he bribed the Germans into giving him people to work in his factory in which they were supposed to make arms but keep them alive Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire.Yes, both were very real. The Plaszów labor camp was located in a southern suburb of Kraków and was presided over by the real Amon Göth. Under Göth's command, many thousands of Jews were killed there, it is documented that Göth was every bit as cruel and psychotic as the film depicts him. Schindler's factory, Deutsche Emailewaren-Fabrik, also existed in the Kraków city limits. Schindler's efforts to bring Jewish prisoners to work in his factory are also documented. There's an old saying; 'You have to spend money to make money.'. Schindler was schmoozing with the local Nazi & SS officers to build a customer and contact base. He'd already made plans to open the Emailwarenfabrik factory & supply the German army with cookware but he needed to find the right people to sell his product to, IE, all the officers that frequented the restaurant. You can see him working up the chain of officers that come into the place. Schindler (at least in the film) is presented as not only very charming but also very cultured -- he orders appetizers & entrees that appear to be crowd-pleasing & converses with the Maitre'd about the right wine for his guests. At the end of the scene we see him having a drink with Oberführer Julian Scherner, who is the highest ranking officer that enters the place -- his rank is that of a senior colonel. If Schindler is able to, at the very least, strike up a friendship with this man, then Scherner will be likely to throw business Schindler's way through the other officers under his command. Schindler's strategy pays off well; he picks up a lot of business & begins making a lot of money.Schindler wasn't completely broke when he arrived in Krakow. You can see, while he picks out his outfit for the evening, that he has lots of Polish zlotys stashed in various places. Schindler is also a very shrewd businessman, as we see throughout the course of the film. He'd be the type of person to know how to stretch his money during dinner to accommodate his guests, however he did lavish on them quite a lot to gain their trust and friendship. Also, the restaurant management might also have, later in the evening, recognized Oskar to be a trustworthy customer and may have let him run a tab for his dinner expenses. Schindler could have easily paid them back later with a budget of$22,000,000 (estimated) it made a lot of money in in America $96,067,179 Steven Spielberg makes one of (if not the one) his greatest movies of all time. Liam Neeson gives a great performance as Schindler and the whole film is just powerful, amazing and sad but it doesn't matter because the movie is so good. Ralph Fiennes makes an even better performance as Goeth, a man who made everyone stare into the screen with anger and sadness and that is just what a movie is supposed to do-make you feel sad, happy, angry or effect you in some way. I read that someone thought it was overrated and bad, but I think it's a classic and it'll never go away. So if you want to see one of the greatest historical films ever made, then go buy Schindler's List.",9,9,13,29 July 2016

The Amazing Spider-Man 2," breathtakingly awesome in 3D
",if I could give this film any more than 10 out of ten I would but here comes my 19 review I rate the 3d action just like avatar which was breathtakingly amazing I saw the first film in 3d after seeing adds for it in 3d and I thought the story was better the original and Andrew Garfield made the film better as he felt nearer to spider man in the comics than Tobey McGuire he was good but there is all ways someone to it better the original films from Sam Rami were good stories so you have to compare the original sequel which I loved to this 3D spectacular and it doesn't compare to in amazing spider man as this brilliant sequel has a great story heart breaking emotional story around Gwen and peter their relationship in real life sends sparks flying literally in the film which makes this film a whole lot better and the comedy sections are so funny sometimes easing the craziness going on around him when the action really gets hot you find out about his peter parker dad in a thrilling opening sequence which is awesome in 3D and a conspiracy theorist will wonder if his father is really dead or not so I wonder will we see the father again lets see any way this film will have a smile on your face watching the action you find yourself laughing so much but flying with spider man will make you have a fear of heights if you see certain parts there is great comic feel to this story with Jamie fox you have awesome baddie as electro you feel for the guy but sees the world the breath taking battles are stunning and their battles with the urban soundtrack just adds to the 3d effects with the electricity you think you are going to be hit with two more baddies this is as good if not better than spider man 3 theirs issues with peter and Gwen that need to be sorted as the end gets close the action is ramped up again choices are made and new and old baddies to get and sequel from this will have tragic consequences for peter and spider man the final battles scenes makes spider man 2 look crap. 3D effects for these scenes are a standout moments takes your breath away with a twist in the story and Paul Giamanti he was good as rhino I never would have thought he would be this good and the green goblin looks menacing and harry Osborne played by Dane Dehaan plays it so chilling that puts William Defoe outing to shame only as we compare we see which actors do justice to these characters at the time spider man was good but with the director Marc Webb he explores the film and human and spider man life and come up with a power full action and the best franchise reboot since the dark knight role on number 3 with and the ending leaves it open for 2 characters in this film to make the action even better wow this doesn't feel like 2hrs20mins this film is well worth watching doesn't matter how many films spider man there once they keep things fresh new enemies and special effects to match then I don't see why this film should beat the box office predictions a beat the spider man 3 3day opening day of 150million I reckon 139 million,10,27,72,30 April 2014

Hidden Figures," the figures behind the scenes that had the elusive numbers hidden but were had to think outside the box
","the Director:Theodore Melfi who directed st Vincent with great acting from bill Murray and Melissa McCarthy does great jobs of getting historical facts out in the wider public an unknown NASA story about colored women in the 60 doing all sort of scientific work like computers put were shunned because of the racial divide The story of a team of African-American women mathematicians who served a vital role in NASA during the early years of the US space program. This film has low budgets but kick butt with other higher profile picture for the Oscars they are the rocky of the awards season under dogs with a big heart The best movies show us our shared connections., Hidden Figures absolutely does. The film tells the story of three African-American women who were chasing a police car as an escort after the women car had a broken down. who are experts in Stem (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths). We see so few women on screen working in these fields, and even fewer who are African American. And the fact that this is a true story, yet one most are unfamiliar with, is disgraceful. We've been deprived this amazing story about women of colour for too long. But the movie doesn't dwell on the fact that history has ignored these women's invaluable contributions. Through Hidden Figures' emotions, wonderful acting and joy we become a part of the story and are taken on a ride with these women that culminates in one of the greatest feats of humanity: a person going into space. What Hidden Figures teaches us is that man made it to space thanks to the calculations of an incredibly brilliant African-American woman. With its box office success, Hidden Figures has proved that audiences are hungry for these types of stories, and just like with the Russians getting into space just before Alan shephard did their trials NASA found untapped talent in a group of African-American female mathematicians that served as the brains behind one of the greatest operations in U.S. history. Based on the unbelievably true life stories of three of these women, known as 'human computers', we follow these women as they quickly rose the ranks of NASA alongside many of history's greatest minds specifically tasked with calculating the momentous launch of astronaut John Glenn into orbit, and guaranteeing his safe return. Dorothy Vaughan, Mary Jackson, and Katherine Johnson crossed all gender, race, and professional lines while their brilliance and desire to dream big, beyond anything ever accomplished before by the human race, firmly cemented them in U.S. history as true American heroes Kevin Costner character was AL Harrison who was trying to get a these numbers and make sure the rockets and people got back so with taraaji p Henson playing the brain-box with memory for numbers but people who kept putting her back because her reports go through AL assistant Paul Stafford played by Jim parson who character was over whelmed by how much the accuracy of the GPS coordinated were by the Katherine and with the help of her friends they won over the colou divide and a mile and a half toilet situation and with a mini budget of 25 mill it has made 146 mill and counting this one will give la la land a run for its money and with the help of NASA archive it gives historic accuracy to the unknown women behind the science this 2hrs 7mins I gave a worthy 10 out of 10 it might win for best actress and best editing you couldn't get a true story great acting all around here kevin Costner deserved an award here for pushing the boundaries",10,1,6,26 February 2017
1917," To deliver a message in time of isolation You have to go through obstacles surviving by thinking outside of trenches
","This is a smart film that you expect battles like saving private Ryan but what you gets is an edge of your seat thriller the plays on you fear of what is around the corner this film plays like one long shot like birdman. The this feels like you are in the trenches going through barb wire. Dir mendez goes for an alternative to put a fresh take of the cost of war two soldiers get an impossible task blake and champan delivery a messages behind enemy lines and they know the Germany a laying a trap for a regiment to get there in broad day light to thousands of soldiers the story is fictional story but risky missions were not uncommon then
For soldiers to complete there mission must cross peak blown up muddy battlefields get through rat infested German bunkers. The swamps dodge planes fights face to face combat and snipers in raging city infernos..
A destroyed bridge near the bombed-out village of Écoust-Saint-Mein prevents the British lorries from crossing, so Schofield crosses alone on the remnants of the bridge. This draws an attack by a German sniper across so as the flares go Chapman races through bombed burnt building he races through the streets to avoid flares from Germans.
whilst surviving the climb up the berm, there is no sigh of relief, no respite from the fear of uncertainty. They survive to move forward to face more uncertainty.
It is a cinematographic feast for the eyes, long expansive shots that follow the protagonists as they execute their mission. It does not hide the horrors that existed in trench warfare, it shows them for their brutality and abundanceWatch if you will, but know there is no pleasure in watching and the film will grab you and the beginning and not let you go. Even though we know the outcome of WWI, there is no joy, there is no peace. Watch because it will allow you a glimpse at the horror and brutality of war; reflect on their service and sacrifice. Note, as we (the viewer) are 'walking' through the trenches, glancing shots of the young soldiers shows them with flat affect, isolation, almost apathy; this is the face of 'shell shock,' what we know call post-traumatic stress disorder

Jurassic World," mix and match origin of the species ind ominous Rex
","First it was a Park, now it is a World. The Dino-attraction meltdown franchise – invented by novelist Michael Crichton and given an big film treatment by Spielberg renewed for a forth movie the magic and nostalgic moments bring you back when Hammond was dreaming this up but decided against it but the genius in in gen wanted a theme park and they got them when you hear that music it makes your hair stand up just because you have 4th film it gives a story but you can never beat the original classic but boy good they give brilliant go at trying and maybe succeeding it but have laugh out moments with Jake Johnson who is the control room he is a nerd with the original Jurassic top predicting disaster Jurassic World doesn't have an equivalent of Samuel L Jackson's chain-smoking employee Arnold from the first film, or indeed anything like its all-but-subliminal reference to J Robert Oppenheimer. But this is still a terrifically enjoyable and exciting summer spectacular: savvy, funny, ridiculous in just the right way, with some smart imaginative twists on the idea of how dinosaurs could be repositioned in a consumer marketplace where they are almost commonplace, and how the military might take a sinister interest in weaponising these scary beasts. There's an almost Gaia-its conception of how dinosaurs might solve their own crises and in a (partial) nod to contemporary views, we get a heroine who can take out dinosaurs with a stun gun and also run very fast away from them in heels. All these dinosaurs are female, which incidentally puts Jurassic World It was directed by Colin Trevorrow, whose last feature outing was the indie comedy Safety Not Guaranteed. But, most importantly, it is executive-produced by Spielberg himself, whose influence is in every base pair of the film's DNA. the crowds scream in panic while pterodactyls peck their heads, there's a ghost of the chaotic beach in Jaws; the moaning, injured brontosauruses, blinking and grimacing so huggably, are like homesick ETs.so we SE old friends from the first and memories that last The idea is that this theme park is nowadays quite normal and established; whatever the checkered safety history of Jurassic Park – and the second and third films are effectively passed over in silence – things are now fine. . Anyway, people go to the flourishing Jurassic World in Costa Rica all the time to see tame dinosaurs. Maybe too tame. Something new and different is going to be needed to provide that unnatural and transgrurch that sets the narrative in motion. Jurassic World is managed by Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), a successful uptight career woman who is a little bit controlling and unhappy: she is nervous about looking after her two nephews the two brother are brilliant in this we cool motorized vehicles a trip like a childhood Spielberg film friendship and Dino expert child experience of a life time where they don't get bored it brings back friendship and survival have come for a visit to the World, owned by flamboyant entrepreneur Masrani (Irrfan Khan). She is also a bit nervous about the creepy new GM mega-dinosaur they have secretly created to boost visitor numbers: the terrifying Indominus Rex, created by lab supremo Dr Henry Wu (BD Wong) and watched over by the sinister military consultant Hoskins (Vincent D'Onofrio).Do these people quite realize how intelligent and aggressive their new dinosaur is, do you suppose, and how very unlikely it is to remain within its paddock? To add to her personal non-dinosaur issues, Claire just happens to have some chemistry with fellow JW employee Owen (Chris Pratt), a rough-and-ready Indiana Jones-sh rap tor wrangler and dinosaur whisperer who has actually trained a performing group of prehistoric carnivores to do his bidding for the tourists: he also rides a motorbike, wears a leather waistcoat and appears to live in a . Needless to say, rescuing the two boys from the upcoming Dino catastrophe is going to bring Owen and Claire together and generally end their emotional ice age. Owen is an old-fashioned guy, a rough outdoorsy sort, a man's man, maybe kind of a  well, what's the figure of speech for an extinct old-fashioned type? Certainly not 'dinosaur': they were vigorous and capable survivors who might yet turn out to have been on earth longer than humans. Chris Pratt gives a tremendously likable performance as Owen: easy-going, relaxed, somewhere on a continuum between Harrison Ford and Tom cruise there are great action set pieces that make this film what it isDallas Howard is also very good: coiffured and groomed and composed as Claire, this actor brings her kind of intense presence to the part. In fact, it is she who has the faintly rapturous presence, especially when her retroussé nose is seen in profile. Owen, Claire and the horrible Indominus Rex make quite a team. It's a world of fear and fun. . This sophistry allows the resort's scientists to create their new attraction, the lethal Indominus Rex, a heady 50-foot-long (15m) mix of Tyrannosaurus, Velociraptor, tree frog and cuttlefish.

Logan," an indestructible no more his primal instincts ravaged he is the last of his kind as he walks his line here him roar one last time
","Logan is like god of war in the PlayStation games sick of fighting looking to be left alone seeking revenge and sick of people dying in this 2hrs and 17mins it just feels like he has not care in the world here is the best film of the year so far director James mangold who done the original wolverine does the opposite of what a superhero film should feel and look this is what an end to a superheroes life is like a risky look that might alienate people but it gets it right Hugh Jackman gets to the heart of wolverine where his friends have died he is a superhero carer for charlies Xavier in his cerebrum little box in the middle of the Mexico desert with an albino watchdog called Caliban Hugh has learned how to play a lone wolf in wolverine and in this he is conflicted tired and vulnerable not like the young wolverine with zest but there is some life in the old dog but he is on his last legs as he needs medicine for Xavier's nightmare seizures that rattle everybody brain and only a few can survive his brain is a w.m.d Logan expects us to take it seriously – and we actually can because the last two were good this just blows the rest them out of the water he was young showing how indestructible he can be this one he is lost but finds a purpose when a stranger comes along Logan's darkness is not simply an aesthetic filter as in Batman v Superman Logan's darkness is not simply an aesthetic filter as was the case in Zack Snyder's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice; it emanates from within the character. It's ironic that the title shares some DNA with the famously campy 1970s sci-fi film, Logan's Run, in which people are considered obsolete at 30 and murdered. In its way, Logan is just as much about the pitilessness of the aging process, and Jackman's battle-scarred, stiffening body is as expressive in this regard as his perma-scowl of a face. It's taking him longer to heal, his eyes are never clear and one of his claws won't fully extend. This makes him less Logan's Run, more Logan's Limp. He's as battered a superhero as we've ever seen, and for the first time his body bears exterior witness to the inner torture that has always defined him. His body is the story.we go on a road trip of sorts through the through the Midwest through to Dakota The film's plot kicks into overdrive when Logan's fate becomes entangled with that of Laura (Keen), a close-to-feral young girl who brandishes claws and fury as fierce and lethal as Logan's own. As the unlikely trio go on the run, we see echoes of Logan himself in Laura's terrifying rage and the tentative emotional connection she forges with Xavier. It's one of many smart moves on the part of James Mangold, who does double duty as director and co-writer. Bringing Laura into the picture allows him to explore Logan's trauma, regret and hope through the filter of this pint-sized powerhouse's origin story But Logan does go defiantly against the grain by favouring melancholic mood and themes of mortality and deterioration over inflated, end-of-the-world stakes or grandiose action pyrotechnics So despite an almost pathological reluctance to get involved, Wolverine is drawn into the role of protector, in a manner that the screenplay, co-written by Mangold, Scott Frank and Michael Green, keeps from getting overly sentimental, while still providing the film with what little emotional uplift it has In an era of cinematic product homogenization there's no doubt that Logan is a risky proposition. But this is reportedly Jackman's last time donning those claws and chewing on that cigar. Considering it was his Wolverine, as the centerpiece of Bryan Singer's X-Men (2000), who launched the currently omnipresent superhero phenomenon in the first place, maybe the most appropriate thing would be that, with the brutal, melancholic elegy that is Logan, Wolverine remakes the superhero movie again, this time as a farewell. After 17 years and 8 other X-Men movies, Hugh Jackman returns as James 'Logan' Howlett aka Wolverine for one final time. Set in the near future, Logan currently makes a hopeless and depressing living as a limo driver for whoever gives him a call. No mutants have been born in over two decades and almost everyone he knows is either dead or doesn't care anymore. Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) is bedridden with a rapidly deteriorating mind and requires regular medication to keep his psychic abilities in check. These two have been surviving day to day and refusing to talk about the past until a young girl named Laura (Dafne Keen) comes along in need of Logan's protection. And as he finds people to help and hide out dark forces are never far behind testing Logan and the child out as well as her young gifted friends can Logan protect and get them to their safe haven but the journey is perilous To say any more would ruin one of the potential films of the year. You can definitely watch it having never seen an X-Men film before, but you just aren't going to get that emotional investment from knowing you're seeing an actor play a role he has become synonymous with for the very last time. Logan is full of surprises, not for kids, a great farewell to Hugh Jackmans role as Wolverine and overall just a fantastic film. We will miss Hugh in his iconic role but this is the definite role but I gave this a well deserving 10 its going to better at the box office that his other two wolverine",10,3,8,21 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," evil manipulating mind games plays havoc with heroes of peace
","heres the follow up to the smash it of super hero's coming together to save new York so this time around we find that following the events of captain America shield has being eroded by hydra as of the TV series so avengers are now taking over helping out defending earth and looking for Loki The Tesseract and Loki scepter as it hold a power source to help any who can harness it ultimate source as the gems that the marvel universe are looking for through all these films if you been following them here is a list The Infinity Gems (dubbed 'Stones' in the Marvel Cinematic Universe) covered as of 2015 include The Tesseract (The Space Gem - Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), _The Avengers_), The Aether (The Reality Gem - Thor: The Dark World (2013)), The Orb (The Power Gem - Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)) and Loki's Sceptre (The Mind Gem - The Avengers so any way the so we see hydra keeping the scepter so avengers come looking for the hide out so Thor can bring home his power source but the the new additions to avengers quick silver and the telekinesis witch are very good with playing mind games with the heroes and but any way we find tony and captain America sharing the responsibilities of leaders the wit and humor is funny like a bromance with the with all the lesser heroes getting screen time which was one of my request and the last avengers hawk eye has plenty of screen time wondering because he human and not indestructible he wonders is he a team players or does the others need him and black widow longing for love plays on her mind and who can be the person who is worthy of thor hammer cue for funny interactions and when it comes up again be gob smacked because its a funny moment in serious action playing off each other the hulk flirting with hints of romance and his inner demons are playing havoc cue scenes of destruction and Thor having issues with iron man but Jarvis his right hand man from computer voice to new hero the vision in this film so with Jarvis looking to find a scepter power source and tony looking for peace unwittingly releases a new villain upon the world called ultron which looks like the terminator with upgrades plus The one character that stole the show, would be James Spader. He embodies an evil AI robot perfectly. He can be really calm and yet menacing and sometimes he can be full of rage and anger and manipulates others and using silver blade and using Scarlett witch,s they unleash mind games with our superhero's minds Dept to there inner fears and their stories and great action scenes pursue with another iron man suit the hulk buster which when the hulk goes ape the ensues a epic fight of the burley kind and with robots and villains way better than the first film looking for world end and with ultron looking to use the scepter power to a machine out of earth cities to rise up (no pun intended) there is battles of wit here more than the first and dark stories to be told 3d effects are epic so great Aeriel battles so it and the power source to be protected so when all heroes come together it a great finale with nick fury helping out all here and the vision here a sequel that leaves you breathless If the finale lacks the emotional payoff of the first movie, that's also because Whedon had set himself up with a near impossible task in the first place. That probably explains why the 'Age of Ultron' is at its core a very different movie from the first 'Avengers', not just because of how our superheroes evolve in the face of imminent destruction precipitated by one of their own but also because of the complex psychological themes that Whedon explores here. His ambition is certainly admirable, but it is inevitable that those looking for the same straightforward thrills as its predecessor will be at least slightly disappointed. That said, this is still an outstanding feat by any measure, a riveting blend of intimate character moments and grand action spectacle that remains quite simply, Marvel-Lois. and cameos a plenty to explain my 9.5/10 for this film this film hasn't got the epic battle of new York in this film but this has an epic story of 10 characters and the inner fears so this gives my story 10 out of ten action is 9/ because there is smaller battles going on so not on the epic scale we have seen but still amazing so 9/10 and 3d is 10 so at 9out of ten I think I got this score rite bring on phase 3",9,2,7,25 April 2015

The excellent cast, the music and an exciting new director/writer were enough to get me in the door. I'm always a bit hesitant when it comes to filmed musicals.. Will it be stagy, stilted and awkward? Not in this case. Damien Chazelle has made a wonderfully cinematic and loving ode to the dreamers and and artists of the world . It goes away from the predictable musical ending while wrapping up the movie in fellow swoop, opening the audiences' eyes to the entire meaning of the story, beyond the theme of follow your dreams. The idea that dreams are possible when you are willing to strive for them, but life isn't your own la la land. Everything does not end perfectly.",10,3,8,18 January 2017

Nicolas Cage gives an effortlessly engaging lead performance. His male and female sidekicks (Diane Kruger and Justin Bartha) play off him quite well. The main villain (Sean Bean) is a more low-key bad guy than we tend to see in movies these days... he doesn't go on and on ranting and raving and screaming to prove how bad he is... he just proves it quite matter-of-factly through his actions. Jon Voigt and Harvey Keitel do alright in a couple of minor roles that don't do much for their acting cred but probably gave their bank accounts a boost... . I was also pleasantly surprised that there were less dumb action stunts than I expected. The two major stunt scenes in the film (a car chase and a stairway cave-in) were pretty exciting... the movie wisely concentrates more on plot and dialogue from the producer of the pirates of the Caribbean Jerry brucheimer comes a thrilling edge of your seat adventure puzzle story like DA vinci code staring nick cage and abundance of special effects and an outstanding supporting cast as an obsessed treasure hunter tries find and decipher ancient riddles left behind that will lead to greatest treasures ever known by man in history and he is dogged by ruthless criminals who wont leave him alone and needs it himself heart pounding chase across Washington dc from the library to the George Washington memorial to the bell tower of independence to the declaration of the American society with close calls make the stakes even higher in a crime caper and one of Disney's exciting treasure hunts ever experienced I hope you enjoyed my review its just under 2hr 10mins",8,1,1,28 March 2017

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," This time its personal as an ever expanding to the edges of the known universe in search of family matters
","This film is hard to explain and review because its space and planets involved in the mcu its complicated so bear with as planets and stories will be told because this makes Jason and the amazing technicolor dream look amateurish
With a whole multi-verse to continue to explore, Vol. 2 doesn't rest on its laurels or spend a lot of time revisiting old haunts. Instead, the sequel rockets the Guardians to brand new worlds to meet an array of new aliens and gods, most of whom want the Guardians dead for various reasons. Vol. 2 is a hell of a ride once again. Pack up your gear and your Baby Groot and strap on your seat belt on the Milano, as we hit the stars and visit the many new planets and locations in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2:So here we go so set to the all new sonic backdrop of awesome mix 2 marvel continues g I t g 2 goes boldly we're the teams adventure as they traverse the outer reaches of marvels cosmos. The guardians must fight to keep their odd newfound family together as they unravel a mystery of star Lords family tree and true parentage old foes become new alies and characters from classic comics comes to their aid and
So with planet hoping and times lines of the m c u In the Marvel Cinematic Universe timeline the film takes place in 2014, three months after Guardians of the Galaxy (2014). It takes place a year after Thor: The Dark World (2013), before or after Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), and a year before Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015). Ego arrived on Earth and began his relationship with Meredith Quill in 1980, which took place 38 years after Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) and 32 years before
Stan Lee clearly exists, you know, above and apart from the reality of all the films. So the notion that he could be sitting there on a cosmic pit stop during the jump gate sequence in 'Guardians' was something very fun, it says, 'Wait a minute, he's this same character who's popped up in all these films?''So with connections to up and coming phase 3 films in this movie
While traveling via multiple space hops, one of the planets the ship travels past appears to be the Kronan homeworld. This is home to Korg the rock creature, who will be appearing in the Planet Hulk storyline of Thor: Ragnarok (2017). Thor already fought and defeated a 'Kronanite' in Thor: The Dark World (2013).The opening battle sequence resembles the first issue of the 2008 comic book, which featured the newly formed Guardians battling a giant monster from another dimension. In that story the Guardians were defending a cult called the Universal Church of Truth, which had ties to Adam Warlock. In the film the Guardians are working for the Sovereign race, which is later revealed to be in possession of Adam Warlock's cocoon. Both the Sovereign and the Church become adversaries of the Guardians.The Sovereign are an arrogant and xenophobic race of golden beings genetically engineered for perfection. The Sovereign consider themselves superior to every other race in the galaxy
When the Sovereign chase the Guardians, they use a remotely piloted ship. The consoles they are operating look like the ones in video game arcades back in the 80's and 90's, especially when the eliminated pilots crowd around the last remaining starfighter, cheering him on. In another nod, the Guardians fly into a Quantum Asteroid Field to escape them. 'Asteroids' is a very early arcade console game.
As a result of the Guardians' victory over Ronan in the Battle of Xandar, they are hired by the Sovereign to protect the Anulax Batteries from the Abilisk in exchange for The Sovereign releasing Gamora's sister Nebula (Karen Gillen) into the Guardians' custody. Their golden high priestess Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki) declares war on the Guardians after Rocket (Bradley Cooper) steals some of the Anulax Batteries
When they escaped from the Sovereign fleet, the Guardians of the Galaxy crash landed their starship the Milano on the planet Berhert. On this forest world, the Guardians meet Ego and Mantis (Pom Klementieff), his empathic helper. Soon, the Guardians split up: Star-Lord, Gamora (Zoe Saldana), and Drax (Dave Bautista) accompany Ego and Mantis back to Ego's planet while Rocket remains on Berhert to repair the Nebula
The ice world of Contraxia would seem to be an unusual vacation destination, but nonetheless, Contraxia is a favorite stop for the many factions of the Ravagers. When staying in Contraxia, the Ravagers frequent the Iron Lotus, the planet's most colorful den of sin, drink, gambling, and ill-repute. Howard the Duck, after escaping confinement in the Collector's destroyed museum on Knowhere, was sighted schmoozing at the Iron Lotus
One of the most powerful yet unusual beings in the universe, Ego is a Celestial born countless millions of years ago. Alone in the beginning, Ego, in the form of a giant brain, began expanding itself and gathering knowledge, eventually taking the form of a lush garden planet roughly the size of Earth's moon (but with a human-looking face). Eventually, Ego began creating avatars of himself, taking on the forms of the races that inhabit the planets he visited to spread his seed. This includes taking on a human form and siring Peter Quill with Meredith Quill on Earth.
Ego hired Yondu and the Ravagers to retrieve each of his children born across the alien races, but Peter was the only one of Ego's offspring able to tap into the light, Ego's Celestial powers, which would allow Ego to absorb all of the planets he seeded into himself. Ego has a strange side to him that he does reveal but
When Yondu, Rocket and Groot escaped the Ravagers on board a splinter ship called the Quadrant, their destination was Ego's world to rescue the rest of the Guardians. However, Rocket miscalculated the number of necessary space jumps it would require to reach Ego, and the Quadrant ended up performing 750 space jumps.We saw several unidentified planets and aliens in the course of the Quadrant careening across the multi-verse, but the most significant aliens sighted were the Watchers. The Watchers are an ancient race whose mandate is to observe all events in the universe - but they must never interfere. This particular gathering of Watchers were being regaled by tales of the misadventures of one of their own informants, who had taken the form of an older human male (Stan Lee). Uatu, the Watcher assigned to observe Earth, resides on the Blue Area of Earth's moon. It's possible this was the location briefly glimpsed when the Quadrant jumped in the vicinity of the Watchers.that Nebula 'is a pretty angry woman, with some daddy issues and that, in the second movie, we're going to start to see how much pain her father actually caused her, and we're going to delve right into the relationship with her sister Gamora. I think we might even feel a tinge of sympathy towards her this time.'
There is five end credits this film is madness and you expect nothing else
One of the end credit scenes shows the Sovereign creating a cocoon of sorts for a new being named 'Adam.' It is assumed that this refers to the character Adam Warlock
Uatu is the Watcher assigned to observe Earth 616, the reality in which the regular Marvel Comics Universe takes place.
. Also appearing were Krugarr, an alien sorcerer who, in the comics, was from another timeline and was the disciple of Doctor Strange, and Mainframe, an alien female robot who, in the comics, was a male and an android related to the Vision
Star-Lord's father, as a continuation of exploring the personal side of the Guardians: 'If a raccoon could talk and shoot a machine gun, how could that be? Answering that question ended up being the entire foundation of the first film. There's a sadness in these characters. Rocket was an animal experimented upon and torn apart. Groot has far more in common with Frankenstein's monster than with Bugs Bunny. Ego is an even more ridiculous character. But if a planet was alive, how could that be? And how could it father a child? Nova Prime said about Peter's father in the first film that he is something ancient and unknown, and being a cosmic being, alone for eons, is even more lonely than being the universe's sole talking raccoon.'
This film is nearly as good as the first film the special effects and color would be probably great in 3d like the first I just saw it on DVD and its a bonkers stunning film great acting as usual and groot and rocket steal the show As usual

The Shape of Water," finding a fishy fairy tale in a era of trouble is an experiment of love under extreme circumstances silence is the key chemistry melts the silence
","The Shape of Water floats to the top of 2018's best releases to date and will be anchored in viewers' minds long after the credits roll.
From master storyteller Guillermo del Toro comes THE SHAPE OF WATER,
 an otherworldly fable set against the backdrop of Cold War era America circa 1962Well I have seen 4 oscars nominated films from dunkirk , 
the darkest hour, three billboards and the shape of water all so 
different, they are all so different but It think it will creep up a beat 3billboards with this unique 
beauty and the fish story ,in an undrground facilty is were we see the monster love story begin 
 think sally hawkins moving portaryl of using sign language mkaes her deliever
an enchanting story of never been loved ,the lonely janitor and zelda are janitors who come across 
Richard Strickland character who is saddistic with a creature who is a god like creature with amazing not to give
away the plot to much .
 the vunerables approach to her character is brings out the chemisrty more
than talking it makes it a unique stroy when she meets the monster and he begings to feel her pain for him and 
Despite communicated in silence you can hear them loud and clear from not just their sign language 
but also just physicality which made the connection this what makes its What makes the chemistry truly unique
 is that it's non verbal which to me is the best approach; all the more genuine and beautiful. As Old Pete once said, 
'If love is really true, it doesn't need an answer.'there is also a Russian plot as well here getting under uncle Sam nose 
its a groundbraking film.Michael Shannon plays richard strickland in charge just loves to get under people skin just like zod in man of steel 
he is really is good as a villain you plain hate as he is a monster in the guise of authority. 
Theres an interesting character study about him is we get depth into his diseased psyche as he is literally a product of his time,
 a man living on fixed notions on what a person is supposed to be,
As ever, Richard Jenkins is a class act he is her neighbor and he is s quiet and puts in a terriffic friendship with Eliza that pulls at the heartstrings 
who longing to help her with her problem of freeing her love healso loves his art and captures her momets in pretty detail imagination
 Octavia Spencer loves to into her oscar films she brilliant as eliza sidekick
del Toro's wildly imaginative adult fairytale is an opulently entertaining monster fable that is spectacularly stylised and perversely enchanting.
this 2hrs 3mins its really does get into your heart.She will no doubt bring home a golden statue at the upcoming Academy Awards.
this film is a classic a monster movie made with real love",10,39,71,23 February 2018

Die Hard," a cops mission to destroy a megalomania xmas heist yipi Ki yea
","so heres a career defining movie that made a star name out of Bruce Willis and changed the action man film forever as john mcteiernan made a reunion with his producers from predator who saw a book called nothing last forever about suspenseful story about terrorist and hostages so when they started looking for police office john McClain they saw a young Bruce Willis who as the character was a no nonsense sense of humour who didn't get technology so with his keen sense of what is going on so when he looks for his wife in nakatomi building he goes he accidental stumbles upon a heist of sorts and hides so with the ringleader and his Hench men after 650 million in bearer bond hands grubber played by a brilliant Alan rick man who looks scary and brilliant and menacing hey defined his movie career out of this so any way with McClain thinking about his idea to thwart the terrorist in the building hey goes to action as everyman but has no way of contacting the police on the outside In his battle to save his Holly, McClane is scorched, torched, beaten and blown up. He jumps off the roof and falls through air ducts. He uncovers deception and double-cross and picks broken glass out of his bare feet. No help comes from the naive and incompetent police, who are unable to get inside, and even less from the FBI. McClane is not a super cop. He is an ordinary guy, who doesn't want a fight. When he is shot, he bleeds. He hurts. All he has are his pants, his vest, his gun - which runs out of ammo. This is the first realistic connection the audience has. When you don't want to be in McClane's position, it makes for much excitement. John McTiernan, who's only previous mainstream movie was Predator, uses awesome photography and technical skills to give the film a truly polished and sophisticated look - it was nominated for four technical Academy Awards. He also allows for enough time for decent character development, most of which comes between McClane and a cop (Reginald Veljohnson) he makes friends with on a CB radio.Die Hard manages to be heart-pounding and teeth-gritting every single time. And if you are one of those many people who have only ever been able to watch it on TV then now is definitely the time to rediscover a cool, classic and creative action picture.its hard to believe Richard gere was going to McClain its another Christmas film with difference 9/10",9,1,1,19 November 2015

Joker," The toxic carnage in his eyes rage at the spotlight of austerity to purge a failing system bubbling up a fanatical emptiness to the disenfranchised mob
","No cgi just realistic life. Just saw it in the cinema on SundayThey say there's no money to be made anymore with serious, gritty dramas.
They say that. But not this
But then they haven't seen Joker, the origin story of Batman's arch-enemy, co-written and directed by Todd Phillips
This is hidden masterpiece
Arthur Fleck is an oddball in a cruel, intolerant world that doesn't have time to care for vulnerable people.There is not a career adviser on the planet who would have pushed him in that direction.
He's a chap who wants to put a smile on people's faces, and so he becomes a clown-for-hire during the day and an amateur stand-up comic at nightHe lives in a Gotham City that's gone to the dogs:no sun uncollected garbage bags pile up like stinking black skyscrapers, welfare budgets have been slashed, and mass civil unrest is one small trigger-point away In realism for flash point of seismic portions and with the keys to power and copycats on the lose
To cleanse and purge on the nervousness of greed of a power struggle in the core of society A lone voice to takes the mantle to imaginative spotlight of his mob as he rides the waves of an election of spiraling toxic fumes rising from the carnage in the streets to the subways he gives lawlessness a new name to the baying mob
This gives a mega boast in grittness creepiness the joker has connections issues falling between the cracks of austerity in Gotham his grubbness in his makeup as his art of choice giving his deception like Inspiring his vendetta for life life and he is failing at everything because he hasn't a talent that descends to madness as mother's stories bring vengeance her love and his for her in is a downside there run down building and many fantasies of his neighbours and with hatred for the elite. his laughing illness that is creppy uncontrolled leads to situations that causes his bleakness in human society that in 'to cleanse, purge in away spirals into unimaginable events
So when lives are taken it makes the city tense looking to a void for some cult to follow he becomes their clown Prince his cult action of arising from hellish tormentall over a character no human soul just feeding rich people's lies of being family and mistrust of and using his
His only pleasure comes from watching Murray Franklin's chat show, on to which he dreams of being invited one day. Robert De Niro plays the legendary TV host,
Phoenix plays Arthur's tragic descent in a way which seemingly encourages our empathy but makes sure he never really gets it: so on the package this is the health warning we know he's not a character to whom you'd dont want to get too close. He will give you smile of approval his death sentence
, who plays a role in setting Joker down the path that turns him into the sociopathic clown
So the joker is up for 11 Oscar including best actor and best picture. He is deserves best actor for his portrayed of demented soulJoachim grips the hellish torment of a tormented soul and gives a classic portrayal of angst his character dillusions delve deep into the void and this film is taxi driver
Instead you have Joaquin Phoenix uses his weird charisma giving Daniel Day-Lewis esque performance of such intensity and weirdness, it will either have the Academy clowning the prizes in for realism
There is a maniacal emptiness behind his eyes which is a bit creepy.
The sun never shines in this Gotham City.Class war simmers while the media crank up the tension with inflammatory headlines and irresponsible TV shows that give airtime to the wrong people for the wrong reasons. The elite live in a pampered bubble without a care in the world, wilfully ignorant of the hardships other folk suffer. It might be set in the early 1980s, but it is clearly a parable about the here and now.
mythology, but has now been bolstered in Joker by an unflinching deep dive into his origins. Pulling back the curtain on the Joker was a risk, but it's one that pays off hugely here as Phoenix's portrayal of the character, who has been played many ways by many actors to varying degrees of success, is unique and if anything, more terrifying, as this story is so grounded in a quasi-reality and the most real-worldly Gotham we've seen. If you haven't got a phobia of clowns you will after this creepy but stunning movie of the year.Joker is infamous classic one for the ages. 10/10",10,2,3,7 October 2019

This is ladies and gentlemen; the ultimate guy movie. it made 100 mill at the box office The movie is filled with crazy over the top characters such as Pinball, Johnny-23, The Marietta Mangler and Sally-can't-dance. It has some of the best casting in a movie I have ever seen. The actors are all simply perfect for their roles. Especially John Malkovich and Steve Buscemi are excellent as always and their characters are the best of the movie even though Buscemi's character wasn't really needed at all. The introduction of the prisoners at the beginning of the movie is completely over the top but I love it! It possibly is one of my favorite scene's in cinema history when we first meet Cyrus the Virus and Diamond Dog, the music really sets the mood in that scene.Of course the story is not important, it's all about explosions, shootings, fist fights and everything in between. But dislike other action movies 'Con Air' actually has a story that I like, even though it's completely over the top. Although I think that the movie might had been better of without the Poe's family scene's and story line, even though I still sort of like the emotional scene's between them. Also I think that Nicholas Cage is a bit too much of a good guy in the movie, not only does he help his friend on board, he even finds time to try and save all the cops their lives and that of the bunny present for his daughter.A good thing is the excellent soundtrack by Trevor Rabin and Mark Mancina that gives the movie an extra 'cool' feeling.One little point of critic is that the editing isn't always great. But I can live with that...Perfect entertainment in a crazy over the top non-stop action movie! There are better action movies out there but not much. nominated for 2 Oscars",8,1,2,6 November 2016

","So I saw this when it came out in the cinema it was original and take on a not so clean superhero film. The will Smith explodes onto the screen in his first superhero film I think this action packed comedy from director Peter berg this is 1hr 42mins on unrated version on blu Ray. Hancock is sarcastic hard living and misunderstood superhero who destroys everything when flying after bad guys wrecking signs with know care in la and wrecking public property and tosing cars on poles and who has fallen on hard times and out off favour with the public. The when Hancock grudgingly agrees to an extreme makeover by idealist publist Ray embrey played by a funny Jason Bateman, a his life and reputation rise like a phoenix from the ashes and all seams all right again until he meets a women Charlie thereon character with similar characters powers to his and the key to his secret past the past that will have earth shifting consequences.

","Alright, let's get down to it, The Hobbit - Battle of the Five Armies!!This is peter Jackson's at his best which was inspired from Tolkien's works. a very busy action packed movie which is the leanest of all middle earth film it comes in at 2hrs11mins with Bilbo's last hurray to build up the tension with other dwarfs 3d is brilliant as you see the dragon I didn't see the last one in 3d so I let myself down as I would have loved more off the dragon in 3d with king Thorin and the rest of the 13 to help claim the lost city eirbor which had its dangers and very perilous situations they had along the way to this is there last stand after the dragon left the lonely mountain valuables behind so they could defend it but with the mountain comes a responsibility to for friendship, love despair and hope with Bilbo journey helps others to believe and not get caught in greed which could lead every one into danger but any way with the lake town we see from the last film the dragon was on his way there we see a very scary situation with these scenario this part has amazing 3d effects so we see Gandalf the Grey withering and the great sauron with his solders on top of the dark prison being help by a few old middle earths friends 3d is amazing here but scary with the all seeing eye from mount doom. so as the city of eirbor is getting reddy for treasure hunting there is a big battle coming with orcs elves birds and loads of humans and elves to fight this turns in to a a hour long battle but not boring it keeps things fresh as legolas and his girlfriend keep fighting in trilling battle but there is a twist in hers that I wont say but its very good fighting scenes its a thrilling finally of one last time I really liked the inclusion of Legolas and and how PJ cleverly linked 'The Hobbit' as a prequel to the LOTR series ian mckellan is good but he didn't get much time like LOTR but this wasn't about his journey that the hobbits and I really would watch it again, for the visuals and the fact that it is the last goodbye to Middle Earth 10/10 a classic old school film for the ages and this film should take in America for 3days about 85million which is would be a record opening for both LOTR and the hbbits if people go see the bridge between the two tolkins books one last time",10,27,47,18 December 2014

The Dark Knight Rises," rising through 8yrs of darkness to give hope to better legacy to live for
","The movie is set 8 years after the Joker incident so that anything related to the Joker need not be shown (RIP Heath Ledger). Nolan presents us a completely different Gotham. A different take on it. And how 8 years can change people. How the Harvey dent and joker incident can affect people and batman himself. In a time of peace, it is quite easy to plan and attack even an entire city. Everything is taken into concern. And it all adds up to one seemingly invincible villain. The logic is never lost at any point of time. The screenplay is penned to allow the impact of what has happened to Gotham and its people in 'The Dark Knight' and what could happen if something goes wrong now. so batman blamed for Harvey dent the joker getting really under his skin made him think of how far he takes his justice so much that the injuries sustained in dark knight but a cat bugler about everything has changed Gotham is free far all and mysterious figure from the league of shadows banes played by tom hardy and his mask and causes mayhem with Gotham and particular batman as he is strong as batman and causes a few injuries and a bomb that set to explode to destroy the dark knight his survival is utmost with bane and his gang destroying Gotham and cornering the police force and using Wayne enterprise technology for his gang but with scarecrow running the courts and lawlessness on the streets batman is chases and hunted with a new sidekick but his trusted butler Alfred worried about batman ideals and how far he would go find a young police man called dick robin Grayson to help him in his role to pursue justice only then can batman chase the bomb and have a better life dead or alive at 2hr41mins 10/10 mr Nolan hats off to perfect thrillogy",10,1,2,22 March 2016
Black Panther," A mother's mistake don't define who you are watching from the shadows Hidding the countries jewels in plain sight
","An all star African American cast with the creed director Ryan cooglar.
As wakanda is having an identity crisis with their land full of powerfull space rock called vibranium so as after tragic circumstances forces young Prince T challah to assume the wakanda throne after the aftermath in civil war where the king was killed from the blast. But the character Killmonger is distant and in conflict with the other characters.Erik Killmonger is based on his version in the comics (a Wakandan exile who seeks to overthrow his country), but incorporates elements of T'Shan (T'Challa's envious cousin) and the White Wolf (a relative of the Black Panther who becomes a villainous extremist and wears a Black Panther-styled habit).
The Prince has to face to ultimate test putting his fate of the country and the entire world at risk
But the prince's cousins with
Is greedy friend goes to Korea for to sell vibranium only for the young king to give chase finding them in a casino only to escape to follow them in a thrilling car chase and cgi special effects are stunning
. When two foes conspire to destroy Wakanda, the hero known as Black Panther must team up with C.I.A. agent Everett K. Ross and members of the Dora Milaje, Wakandan special forces, to prevent Wakanda from being dragged into a world war. To find the heart of wakanda
This shows the expansiveness of the mine and the symbolism of the Underground Railroad, which was designed to resemble heart valves for their fight for the heart of Wakanda.
As we saw the winter soldier in wakanda after cival war bucky is given the title of the White Wolf with a new arm. In the comics, the White Wolf was a white man who was adopted and raised in Wakanda; in the film, Bucky is not adopted but he is accepted by some Wakandan citizens.
. He is pitted against his own family the new king must rally his troops and release the full tech power of blank Panther to defeat his enemies and become an avenger and alsoThe Black Panther suit is upgraded in this film to bear mystic runes. This is based on the 'Doomwar' storyline, where T'Challa developed magical tactics to not rely on his nation's resources of vibranium.
The Wakandan war cry 'Yibambe' is Xhosa for 'hold strong'. Other possible translations include 'hold fast' or just simply 'hold it'; all of these translations are appropriate for their situation. This chant was also briefly recited by Nakia and the River Tribe in Black Panther
Vala' is Xhosa for 'close' when the warriors activate their shields, as in close ranks
After the climactic battle scene, there is a quick shot of the elders' room. M'Baku is seen amongst the other tribe elders. This shows that T'Challa united all five tribes of Wakanda.
Believe the hype the cgi is amazing.

There is a connection with film and the Guardians of the galaxyRed (Reality Gem): Hidden inside the Aether, it has the ability to transform matter into dark matter. First seen in The Dark World, thousands of years ago in a war where King Bor of Asgard (father of Odin) defeated Malekith, leader of the dark elves. In modern times, Dr. Jane Foster discovered it once again while studying gravitational disturbances in London, putting her own life in danger. During the events of the Convergence, Malekith briefly took control of it inside his body, rendering him near invincible. After Thor's victory over him, it was handed over to the Collector to avoid having two Infinity Stones together in the same place. The Collector's alliances and ultimate goal were unknown at this point.",8,1,2,10 August 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," scavenging a strenght through lost identity chasing a will to survives ones unknown past,
","I have been a been a big fan of star wars forever as I remember of the first 3 films from George Lucas with a new hope , empire strikes back and the return of the Jedi we were introduced to Han luc Leia, Chewbacca Ben and obi wan ken obi cp30 and r2d2 and Darth Vader with the force of dark and the light we all knew Luke was trained by Ben ken obi i they find out who Darth Vader is as we know Darth Vader sense about a child hidden from him so any way we come the prequels as the introduce a young an akin sky walkers training with obi wan Kenobi who has the powers and over the course of 3 films we watch as Anakin is turned by the lord sith and slowly changes him to the dark side and becoming Vader so with the new star wars comes a visionary director for recharging old films and exploding them onto the big screen I avoided the trailers so I wouldn't be disappointed this film has it all in it surprises mystery suspense nods to the characters that are related in some way this film takes place 30years after the events of return of the Jedi with Luke leaving something behind on a desert to be cared for I'm worried about how much I should actually say. Disney and Lucasfilm have been very clever in how the film has been marketed and for once none of the film's twists or surprises have been spoiled in trailers or advertisements leading up to the film. I can't even talk about the first line of the now famous text scroll at the start of the film this brought back fond memories of old star wars so the new film . In the wake of the destruction of the second Death Star and the apparent defeat of the Galactic Empire, a new army known as the First Order has risen in their place. The mysterious Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) leads a group of stormtroopers to the desert planet of Jakku to search for a particular item. What exactly the item is will not be spoiled here! They encounter a Resistance fighter by the name of Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and the resulting fire fight leaves Poe's droid BB-8 on the run and one particular storm trooper (John Boyega) having doubts about his place in the First Order. BB-8 soon encounters a scavenger by the name of Rey (Daisy Ridley this is her film ) and everyone sets out to fight the dark side and get BB-8 back to the resistance while encountering some old friends along the way and that's all I can say with wandering into spoiler territory. All the cast are on top form with the likes of Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher reprising the roles of Han Solo and Princess Leia as if they had never left. The new cast are perfectly introduced and immediately feel like they have been here all along with everyone's old favorites. That being said, this is absolutely Daisy Ridley's film as Rey. She gives the best performance of the entire film and I wish I could go on and on about it but it would spoil so much for anyone who hasn't seen it. Kylo Ren is a fantastic villain that has so much more depth than any of the Star Wars villains before him because he has his name that stands for something else . He can quickly go from being stoic and menacing, to lashing out in a fit of rage and trying to cut someone's arm off with a light saber. Domhnall Gleeson is great but doesn't get enough time to shine as the sneering General Hux, leader of the First Order's Starkiller Base. Surprisingly The Force Awakens is also one of the funniest films of the year. Some of the jokes have to do with throwbacks to there a few twist in this that will shock a few people the original films but many of them are just plain hilarious. BB-8's attempt to give a thumbs up might just be the funniest thing I've seen all year. I have seen some complaints that The Force Awakens is almost too similar to the very first film at some points with the plot. And yes, Skellig Michael absolutely gets its part in the film after all the press coverage the filming was getting all those months ago. While I can understand where they're coming from, for me The Force Awakens somehow managed to tread that fine line between fan boy service and fan introduction. It welcomes you back into the world of Star Wars but if you've never been a fan before it's just given you plenty of reason to stay and become one. I can honestly say The Force Awakens deserves to be seen by everyone and but to see the other films to under stand everything that happens in the universe here as to clues in the film go online to see I loved this and nostalgic as well fantastic action scenes and fighter pilots well what can I say if your not with the force now you will never be 2hrs15mins of pure heaven 10/10",10,4,37,5 January 2016

Godzilla," monstrous epic 3d Godzilla style disaster movie
",well here my review of Godzilla my 21st review my love of film never dies seeing how this they done this movie with the special effects laden movie I was going to see either X men or Godzilla I decided on Godzilla as the 3d looked amazingly done this is a film they should have done instead of Roland Emmerich movie his movie was good but this but disasters movies to shame the characters the first hour build up nicely the human story and the reason for Godzilla awaking up are well done the pacing is great in the movie the nod to the Japanese is great to keep it originality of the story~ Brian Cranston and Aaron Johnston do a good job as the hero of this film the fright scenes scare you as Godzilla is fighting his way around the pacific ocean the film feels like a play Station game call of duty in 3d you think you are join the fight to help save America from a disaster and make you want to join the marines army or navy great film totally different I cant give away the story to much because Godzilla is totally different and plot has a twist in a total opposite away that you would not expect I give it 9 out of ten for have a disaster movie for a change totally great by the way how would a sequel work I don't know. the director that done monster on 800000 budget brought tension and great story to that film .he brought his personality to this story of 160 million budget and he handles this direction well with haunting score and Godzilla and his enemies he doesn't like handles this film very well with loads of tension built up cities ruined its a great popcorn flick to watch for 2hrs highly recommended to all lovers of 3d disaster flicks on a truly epic scale,8,2,6,21 May 2014

","so we have a spy film with a difference in the tech modern world a contemporary retelling of king Arthur's knights for the modern age the film is kick ass meets James bond well its fun you will be smiling from ear to ear with the 80's soundtrack cool gadgets suave secret agents great acting matrix style kicking ass and brilliant story what sets this out from the rest loads of blood and guts tongue in cheek action doesn't take its self to serious so its fun and Michael Caine has equaled a record set by tom hanks an tom cruise on my most 100 mill movies it has great scenery fun characters especially from SAM Jackson and mark Hamill is back the intensity of this film might put people off so be warned this is my fifty first review and my 1st film of 2015 in march I love the cinema this been a blast from start to finish 2hrs long But it's also a fantastic action film with an amazing cast (Oscar winners Colin Firth and Michael Caine, plus Sam Jackson AND Mark Hamill) and spectacular, over-the-top fight-scenes that in some instances even rival films like 'The Raid' for their sheer visceral intensity. In short, if you're as fed up with lame wannabe Die-Hards and Terminators as I am, go watch this film 'Kingsman' seems to be pretty much the only antidote to the toothless, generic tripe Hollywood tries to pass for action these days. 9 stars for the film and the story, 11 stars for the balls to pull this off the way they did. = a perfect 10 'This movie will be to Bond what Kick-Ass 2010 is to superhero movies",10,3,10,18 March 2015

Two of these include Michael Jackson becoming the first human to clone himself and Britney Spears having her 23rd baby. The dates the film is set in the future span from 2017 to 2030 plus future designed cars wow the Director Frank Coraci, who also worked with Adam Sandler in directing The Waterboy and The Wedding Singer, makes excellent use of a technique that should be taken advantage of more often by more directors.He sets us up in the aforementioned first hour of the movie for laughs, and manages to do this quite a few times, and not just with the moments seen in the trailer like other comedies . And, based on one's presupposed knowledge of the typical Adam Sandler movie, one expects there to be a spiral out of control for Michael, arealization of the 'right thing to do' and everything to end happily with a monologue and one final punchline , all while remaining light-hearted and humorous. However, having this expectation makes the power and the drama of the movie's second hour so much more heartfelt and emotional not giving away the ending can he quickly decide if he can change his ways before what he has seen bring his family back 8/10 and Jonah hill gets a cameo",8,1,2,25 June 2015

So when she has a eureka moment after a failed excursion on her father's new girlfriend's boat, she quickly invents a household object that may just be her ticket out of systemic poverty.I don't think I'm giving much away by saying the movie asks its audience to hinge their emotional cache on a mop. The self-wringing Miracle Mop to be exact, invented by honest-to-God real person Joy Mangano. Leave it to director David O. Russell to find a decent story in the life of a QVC luminary and keep it just this side of rational. The prologue of the film lovingly dedicates the movie to 'daring women,' which Joy certainly is but Russell wisely omits the last name to give the audience a universality. This too can be your story of success if you have grit and a good idea. It's a great theme in in crazy movie . unlike Linings Playbook (2012) where the rushed, overlapping dialogue and melodramatic mugging serves to highlight the immediacy of, say dealing with the mob, here there's nothing holding us to the characters and their goals...except Joy. Russell seems to be aware of his own style and juxtaposes the lives on screen with an 80's era soap opera which consumes the life of Joy's mother. The parallel is interesting in theory Not usually the voice of hope, I really wanted to like this movie. A movie about the positives of hard work and entrepreneurship has not hit theaters since Pursuit of Happyiness (2006). Yet out of all modern directors working today, David O. Russell feels like a quixotic mouthpiece for such a hopeful theme.",9,1,4,7 February 2016

Joe positions his car in front of the Rig to slow it, while Max fights on I leaving the rest there so I don't ruin the rest 2hrs of pure hell and back well done to everyone 9/10 an epic crazy classic but charlize as max next time high five for feisty women everywhere she stole the show this film deserves to win 10 Oscars for its visuals ott acting and craziness that's all round",9,3,8,20 May 2015

13 Hours," In the critical chaos of civil unrest of the battle of Bengazi six men found a inner courage to what was right against the odds in an extreme environment to save lives.
","Telling this story needed to be done and done right. Amazingly, Michael Bay achieves true greatness with this effort. I'm overwhelmed because no one could have known Bay had this movie in him as a director. This film was like call of duty modern warfare with the night time battles with night vision googles. This film is a street warfare protect American land and a secret that nobody knew. Its two hours and 18mins and it's up there with war films at there best. It's riveting and exhilarating its like America last stand at the Alamo but modern, When everything went wrong six men had the courage to do what was right . you won't forget this film in 13 hours the secret soldiers of Benghazi they follow C.I.A personnel and ex military operators who fought back against the rebels who had wages battles to save lives. this film makes your heart race its so gritty puts you in the battle and and seeing the four walls and the soldiers on the roof of the embassy under attack from rpgs and suicide bombers and protecting the place against all that the imagery is brilliant and the graphics are so amazing. 10/10

Sully," a fairy tale in new York as a hero comes along to perfect a river landing
","In this 1hr 36min film its The story of Chesley Sullenberger, an American pilot who became a hero after landing his damaged plane on the Hudson River in order to save the flight's passengers and crew On Thursday, January 15th, 2009, the world witnessed the 'Miracle on the Hudson' when Captain Chesley Sullenberger, nicknamed 'Sully' & is portrayed by Tom Hanks glided his disabled plane onto the frigid waters of the Hudson River, saving the lives of all 155 aboard. However, even as Sully was being heralded by the public and the media for his unprecedented feat of aviation skill, an investigation was unfolding that threatened to destroy his reputation and his career With a Budget:$60,000,000 And with a gross off $124,628,672 in USA and 70 mill and counting this is tom hank 17live action 100 million dollar film Clint Eastwood is an amazing director and has a brought us another film a gritty real life true story that a the height of the financial crisis a miracle happened a real life fairy tale of new York from a captain who had his head screwed on and with two engines blown out by birds at 2900 feet and nobody has ever glides a plane to a perfect landing in 208mins this is Oscar worthy stuff especially from hanks who plays sullenbuger as hanks pieces together the moments of his flight and stresses about how other ideas of his might just find another plane crash in new York so with well capable co stars and first officer Jeff skilles a very good performance from Eckhart he should get best supporting actor nod for his role but saving all on board was the captain aim but captain life choices saved everyone and his previous flying experience proved to the investigators that human control can save the day and not flight simulators he go one shot and became a hero not a computer. In the end this movie is about heroes, not just Sully but everyone involved in the US Airways Flight 1549 water landing. From the well trained flight attendances to the rescue police on the water fairy. Its about the 155 passengers and the their accounts of what happen. It's about how sometimes we forget how to treat a hero, but true heroes will always shine though, and Eastwood tells the story as real as possible knowing that he has an incredible story here Photos of the real plane and rescue are shown during the credits. They are followed by a brief video with real people from that day including the passengers and Captain Sullenburger. As the credits roll, there is a reuniting scene with the passengers and crew. Another scene follows shortly with Sully's wife talking briefly about what has been going on at their home since the miraculous landing on the Hudson River What makes Sully exceptional is that Clint Eastwood lets the story tell itself. when a hero comes along and flies a plane and to land on water a miracle Specifically real with the water landing itself. Nothing is really taken out of content in the way Hollywood thinks and usually takes it.The event was dramatic enough without anything needed to be added to enhance that.",9,1,1,10 December 2016
The Martian," colonizing is one thing endeavoring to engineer a flyby rescue takes spirit
",".so heres a film of endeavor and hope ingenuity and heart pounding suspense from my favorite science fiction director ridley Scott he makes a claim for a instant classic in this genre he come really close very close to perfection its modern classic but just falls short due to a couple of slow moments so in 3d you get immersed in mars such in grossing stuff because it has 5films that have set huge benchmarks follow when it comes space missions like total recall a mission to mars and other ones that had mission go wrong Ron Howard's Apollo 13, Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity and Christopher Nolan's Interstellar and Apollo 11.and The Martian is like cast away on mars the technical aspects, visual effects and the performances are amazing you just get lost in the moment so we start During a manned mission to Mars, Astronaut Mark Watney is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew. the storm in 3d is awesome so if your stranded on a planet you should have majors like Mark Watney majored in Mechanical Engineering and Botany in college. he has his own mission control unit to use He also displays a markedly tasteful dislike for disco music. so with his one man a team on mars he goes around sciencing the s##t out of everything so colonizing mars is his mission to stay alive it fun engrossing watching his blogs so as the spaceship the Hermes on the way back the crew thinks he is dead this film has no spoilers as you know what happens but the journey you go on it don't matter but i wont give away certain plot points this film has great disco music cut into certain area of his adventure and like Wilson in cast away he has a certain technology guide to help his mission But the biggest reason we are ready to invest in The Martian .because its so believable. In the lead is the Martian himself he is like buzzlightyear in his suit, Every human being has a basic instinct: to help each other out. If a hiker gets lost in the mountains, people will coordinate a search. If a train crashes, people will line up to give blood. If an earthquake levels a city, people all over the world will send emergency supplies. This is so fundamentally human that it's found in every culture without exception. Yes, there are assholes who just don't care, but they're massively outnumbered by the people who do. ~ Mark Watney, The Martian i haven't read the book. ., Matt Damon makes for a believable protagonist whose fictional tale for survival is truly ingenious and he makes fun of his lonely time he is a one man a team action man with a plan with mcguivers or bear gyrils survival instincts in tow , his eyes and body language make sure we can never make light of his pitiable plight he has food for thought on how to survive as he is a botanist trials a scheme using a type of energy that is dangerous but as he realize that there is alternatives to energy supplies to get from a to b earth is watching wondering ho and learning to communicate through though full mirror imaging things he fly around thinking of home which makes the Even the background score is apt and enriching to the experience. And of course, the visual effects are mind- blowing runtime of nearly two and a half hours pass by easily. . the martian is no pushover with the experience and the musical score it has big shoes to fill . Yes, Interstellar and Gravity still scores over in this aspect, but The Martian is no pushover, thank you!. He is ably supported by a brilliant plethora of cast playing some wonderful characters. They include the steely crew commander played by Jessica Chastain and her motley crew of Kate Mara, Michael Pena, Sebastian Stan, Jeff Daniels's play-by-the-book NASA director, Sean Bean's empathetic flight leader, Kristen Wiig's bemused NASA public affairs agent etc. Everyone is great, but if I have to pick up my favorite characters, it would be Chiwetel Ejiofor's sardonic but helpful mission director Vincent Kapoor .they didn't rand Donald Glover in his small role of carefree astrodynamics scientist who knows the distance in his role to create a flyby to mars The climax sequence is truly harrowing, and the first thing I checked once I came out of the theater is to see If I still have any nails left to chew! so with the song life on mars booming in the backgroundMatt Damon's trip to Mars is a FANTASTIC lesson on self-belief, hope and humanity. its the best ridley science fiction since his alien its the best mars film ever and its this years best film so far with 6 academy nominations will Matt Damon win a academy award its touch because this is one hell of a film and with Leo doing his best work so Matt might just miss out . PS editors please introduce .5 on the scoring board for films thank you",9,2,58,2 October 2015
