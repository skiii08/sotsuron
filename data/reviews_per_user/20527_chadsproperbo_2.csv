Skyfall," Simply.... Amazing!
","James Bond comes back with a boom in the sequel of his inevitable series. Skyfall is simply the best, most stunning film to come out of British history. After Quantum of Solace which was easily the best; Skyfall did just the job, only missed a few tiny things. A lot of Skyfall was fighting, well, what a shock! James Bond? He doesn't fight? - Yes. But the violence is encouraged by lots of comedic action and some smart suspense scenes. Although it's not the best it's still shockingly brilliant and very smart. If you like the James Bond films, god you're gonna bloody love this one! It's amazing. The action, the infrequently nerve-crackling gory scenes, the funny touch behind it. This makes it the 2nd best Bond Movie yet. Bond is all about the action and the smartness, you get it all from Skyfall. Such an amazing movie it's unreal! I didn't want it to end. This is undoubtedly one of my favorite movies of all time and as at the end 'Bond Will Be Back' god knows what's in store for us next!",10,1,11,1 December 2012
Here Comes the Boom," Here Comes The BOOM! .....
","Here comes the boom is a film about a Teacher who wishes his school had more funding in which he decides to take up Boxing.... Hmm.... Yes, it's self explanatory. He's not very good. And it's very predictable. And because it's American, everything works out well... What a shock. However, I was cunningly surprised by the film. Overall it was quite good. Very aggressive, violent, made me jump back a few times and hilarious! There was some parts what kind of let the film down a little. The ending... Now I'm not one to spoil it so I'm not going to but for god sake.... This is like the symbol of American Boy Teen films. And it really did kind of ruin it...I must say, the consumer's really did enjoy it. The cinema was loud, full of people laughing. It obviously isn't the best film I've seen; nor worse. It's probably just in between. Hmmm... I maybe would consider this to a boy about 13/14+ (I'm that age myself) However older people, I'd give it a miss... :/",6,5,7,25 November 2012
