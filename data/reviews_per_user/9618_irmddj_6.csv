Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Well... It's another Tarantino.
","The first attempt to view Kill Bill 2 on DVD failed, as the rental store inadvertedly gave me Kill Bill. Second time around, I made sure there was a '2' on there. I settled in, a Texas Tea within my reach (how ironic) and fired up the DVD.And well over two hours later, I'm writing this review.Kill Bill 2 picks up where its prequel stopped: The woman who was brutally shot in the head by 'Bill' at the beginning of the first movie is still off to kill every last person who aided Bill in killing her and her soon-to-be-husband. She already killed two, and now there's three more on her list.The first thing which immediately becomes apparent is that the tone of the movie is completely different than in its predecessor. Instead of excessive martial arts scenes with lots of gore and blood spouting all over the place, we have a much more timid, carefully laid down plot which seeks to answer all questions the first movie raised. (Well, not all, like why Hanzo made a new sword for Kiddo, a.k.a. Mommy, played by Thurman.) Combat is limited to the strictly necessary, with the Final Fight being surprisingly short but to some extent quite predictable.Despite the good, artistic camera-work, at times gripping and evocative scenes (Kiddo being buried alive, Kiddo meeting her daughter) and good, to the point dialogue, the movie somehow failed to spark my interest. Perhaps because it is so tame in comparison to the first movie: remember, we are dealing with a *continuation* of the story. Perhaps because all the bad guys admit that Kiddo deserves her revenge: where's the fun in killing off the bad guys who admit to being bad? Okay, they certainly don't intend to put their heads on the chopping block willingly, but still. Perhaps because you know already that everyone is going to die a horrible death, and that of course, Kiddo will find Bill, and kill him. Perhaps she will die in the process, but kill him she will. Perhaps because about 1/4th into the movie, you know *how* Bill is going to die. Or, perhaps when you see Kiddo being shot in the breast by Bill's run-down bro, Budd. Excuse me, but if you can handle well over 100 well-trained swordsmen, you do *not* run into the line of fire of an ex-killer with booze for blood.There are plenty of little surprises and twists to the tale, so it takes a while to get to the end. But because you know what the end will, has to, must be, and because the movie takes on a completely different character, it becomes somewhat slow and boring. I am sure there are plenty of people who will be lyrical about the entire thing, citing the good character interplay, sneaky twists, the stark contrast with movie one yet holding up its own without effort, and lots, lots more. You can read it in the other reviews. I can certainly understand why those things have been, are being and will be said. Problem is, I am not plenty of people. On its own, good movie, make sure you see it. As a continuation of a story of brutal revenge... No.6 out of 10.",6,1,3,22 April 2005
Ocean's Twelve," Entertaining simplicity with lots of little twists
","After seeing this movie, which had me leaving the theatre in a very happy mood, I thought about writing a review for this site. So first I looked at the opinions of other people. And those caused me to scratch my head a lot. 'Drab European scenery'. 'All star cast just there to show off they're an all star cast'. 'Weird camera shots'. 'No plot'. 'The biggest heist is the fact that they've stolen my money'. 'Sequel, whaddayaexpect?' 'Horrible'. Etcetera.Erk. Are we talking about the same movie here? Somehow I get the impression people were thinking: well, Ocean's Eleven was about a masterful heist, so Ocean's Twelve must be about an even bigger one. Or perhaps they were expecting another Ocean's Eleven. But then it would have been called Ocean's Eleven 2, wouldn't it? Fact is, Ocean's Twelve is called Ocean's Twelve, and that might have been a subtle hint. Now, for the record, I have not seen Ocean's Eleven, so perhaps my view is a bit skewed. On the other hand, I am not burdened by the knowledge 'what happened before' and could just concentrate on the current installment instead.Short outline of the plot: somehow the victim (shady owner of a casino) of the Ocean's Eleven heist manages to locate the members of the team and threatens to kill them if they don't pay up the money they stole. With a fat interest, of course. No one has that kind money of money laying around, so the team needs another heist. But in the backs of their minds there is the nagging question: how did the owner of the casino find them all? As it turns out, while executing a small-paying robbery in Amsterdam to secure a big, fat-paying assignment (which would still not cover for the entire amount they owned, hinthint!), they were outsmarted by someone called the Night Fox, the most infamous crook alive. And it is precisely this Night Fox who, thanks to his conceited ego and careless remarks made by his mentor about who the biggest crook alive is, wants to take on Ocean's Eleven/Twelve team in a duel. Their goal: stealing a FabergÃ© egg. If the Night Fox wins, he will go down as the greatest crook alive. If Ocean's team wins, the Night Fox will pay the debt. Now of course the Night Fox is outfoxed, but how and where is something I'm not going to tell.If your first response to reading the above is 'Bweeach, been there, seen it', my response: ah, but have you seen how that tale is *told*? There's where the fun comes in. It's, just like the title of the movie, subtle. (And you honestly didn't expect the script to be about an even bigger heist, did you?) It's full of little plots to keep your mind occupied. The director dared to use flashbacks without a single word of explanation---you, the viewer, have to figure them out. Despite their vast technical skills, the team finds it tough to deal with the powers of the weaker sex. Despite the fact that they're thieves, they have a sort-of code of honour which they will not break; the morals of the detective out to get them all behind bars are questioned when she's shown to not be above a little two-timing herself. Quite hilarious are the scenes where Bruce Willis playing himself meets 'Tess' played by Julia Roberts who is faking to be Julia Roberts. It is not often you get to see stars taking themselves not-entirely-too-seriously, but still serious enough to realise they are playing a role in a movie. And there's lots more.All-star cast? Well, yeah. People more or less expect to see stars on the screen, don't they? Are there moments where, as one reviewer put it, a sign with 'applaud now' appears? Err, no. Except for Mrs. Zeta-Jones, who is dressed way too smartly for the detective role she is playing, they play their role, with no one really being singled out. They function as a well-oiled team with two leaders. There is no room for in-depth character development and long wow-look-at-me shots. And Mrs. Zeta-Jones is forgiven, because she is up against a team of bad guys on her own. In the end, when the Night Fox despite his masterful aerobics is shown for the pompous ass he really is, you realise the main gist of the movie: sometimes daring heists, no matter why they are performed, are not about complex intrusions, masterful computer hacks and other tomcruisery, but about simple, sneaky plots executed to perfection leaving the other parties involved none the wiser. (Not convinced? Well, it sure made three or four men at the end of February 2005 multi-millionaires when they drove away with $70 million dollars' worth in diamonds, without a single shot being fired, from, how ironically, the airport of Amsterdam.) The story may not be one of the best ever written, but it was told with style, flair and rhythm. I was quite po'ed that I had to watch it in a crummy little theatre with chairs which were too small for me, but the movie managed to capture me sufficiently to forget about cramped arms, legs and an aching back. That, by definition, makes it 'good' to 'very good' in my book.",8,0,2,13 March 2005
Ocean's Thirteen," Filling, but rather empty calories
","Ocean's 13 was pretty much a must-see for me and the girlfriend. So we bought tickets, and settled in.My response to this movie is lukewarm at best. The crew is losing their touch; it's becoming more of the same. This time it's not even about a heist at all, just payback. Oh wait, there is a heist in there too, a plot device if I ever saw one, just to make the villain(s) of Ocean's 12 look like their pompous arrogant selves again. Basically, it feels like all the scraps left over from the first two movies were put in a big meat grinder which was then subsequently turned on. Like a the real thing, the result is filling for a few moments, but it's not wholesome, and you definitely don't want to know about the ingredients which are in there.Even though the movie has an underlying plot/storyline, there isn't any sense of build-up or tension. Ocean's crew being Ocean's crew, you know that they are going to get away with it, so no points for originality there. And then it becomes a slow-to-start mixture of somewhat funny situations in which the crew is preparing their 'heist'. The movie felt like it was based on some general ideas on what to do, and that the crew were told to improvise to see what they could make of it. I was somewhat sorry as well as pleased to see Matt Damon's character Linus finally seeing some development: he's no longer the klutz of the group. And that was about the only truly original idea in the movie.And that is really all there is to it. Therefore I consider Ocean's 13 to be the weakest of the trilogy by far. Granted, it made me smirk, some ideas were funny, but it didn't capture me like 11 and 12 did. Exactly like that sausage: filling, but only for a short while.Go see it on DVD---it can wait that long. And make sure you see 11 and 12 before it, in that order.",4,1,1,6 July 2007
Saw," Saw it through, you won't like it one bit.
","The idea is definitely good; in fact, that's what made me buy the DVD cheap at a sale. Psycho killer makes people play a 'game' with their lives. If they succeed---often at great pain, loss of blood, the occasional limb, or the killing of someone else---they will be set free again, and appreciate life more. If they fail, well... Let's just say they didn't appreciate life enough, then.I'm not going to tell the story, hundreds of others already did so. I'm going to focus on what I felt as I was watching the movie. And that was basically nothing. It begins give minutes into the movie, when the doctor-character stresses in a totally unconvincing way that they have to cooperate to make it out alive. There isn't a single shred of mortal fear, of failure to reason properly, of distrust, or of whatever which makes humans human. *That* is the real scare you should get from such movies: to witness what happens when layers of sanity are silently but remorselessly stripped away. Instead, there's just grime, blood, sweat and dirty toilets. You know that the two main characters cannot kill each other because they are too far away from each other, and the only option they have to *make* the kill is by cutting off their own feet. Which is about the last thing they want to do---you really have to be desperate.So what is the last straw? Not being able to answer a phone after you hear a lot of shots fired, and fear for the life of your wife and child whom you did not really show any affection for throughout the movie, I kid you not. I am sure that this is some ultimate joke aimed at people who are addicted to that wireless leash: they'd rather cut their own foot off in order to answer it then to let it ring and let voice mail handle it. The scenes portraying this ultimate breakdown are pathetic and totally unconvincing, simply because you---as a viewer---already know what happens, so you cannot sympathise with the victim.The other 99% of the movie is just as bad. Flashbacks aplenty, sometimes even a flashback within a flashback, but this plot device doesn't really fit into this movie. They are just there to paint a picture of Jigsaw, but it doesn't really provide any clues as to solve the puzzle. Or rather, you learn that there is no other way to solve the puzzle save through what Jigsaw planned. In a really tense movie, the good guy manages to beat the bad guy by outsmarting him at his own game. A snowball has a better chance in hell of not melting than that happening in Saw.I only give this movie a 4 because the only time I sat up straight and could appreciate the entire affair was the last one, one-and-a-half minute before the end. Then a totally unexpected alternate plot line develops you did not see coming, and it shows the only good idea the writer/director/producer had. I turned off the TV shaking my head and wondering why they didn't make the entire movie like that.The psycho was such a nice idea to begin with. And it is really such a shame that it was ruined so expertly.",4,5,8,12 February 2006
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," The Hunger Games: Catching Z's
","Watching the second installment of the Hunger Games saga is like watching the fifth Harry Potter or the second Lord of the Rings movie. Annoyingly drawn-out, more of the same, not really worth the time save for a few important details which get used later on. Nothing really happens, it's all just gearing up for a grand finale which you know is coming, and which will pretty much rewrite the rules anyway. Yes, the setting feels more natural. Yes, the Games are deadlier than ever. There's more futuristic gizmos like... forcefields! Yes, there is more more mature character depiction. But do we really need to *see* all this? From the first movie it was already clear that Panem's government is a nasty and callous dictatorship which does not shirk away from sadism (in the form of the Games themselves by forcing adolescents to compete). The patterns of repression are boringly stereotypical, complete with anonymous masked soldiers with big sticks and military hardliners who have testosterone for blood. The entire movie could have been reduced to, say, Katniss and Peeta holding too many revolutionary speeches during their victors' tour; and Snow then (in a mildly interesting twist) accidentally killing Primrose, setting off the revolution. The effect is the same compared to what happens in the actual movie, but it only takes 15 to 20 minutes of your time instead of a gruelling 146. But then the audience wouldn't get to fawn at length over a good-looking and sportive natural female beauty, would they?I am reminded of Paul Verhoeven's The Running Man which I saw a long, long time ago. The Hunger Games are in many ways strikingly similar... and although The Running Man isn't perfect either, it at least gets one thing very right: over and done with in a single movie. And now I hear that the third movie in the Hunger saga is to be released in two parts. Yay. Why have the audience pay once for a story when you can get them to pay four times, eh, Mr Marketeer?Really, only see this at home. If at all. Or read the book—which by the way I haven't.",3,6,11,4 August 2014
Happy Feet," Happy Feet Want A Happy Story Too...
","I saw this movie at an IMAX theatre, mostly because it had been ages since I saw an IMAX-movie and I simply wanted to see what it was like again. Unfortunately, this movie isn't made for IMAX: this technology requires many grand sweeping overviews, looking over steep cliffs, and the like. There are moments in the movie when you feel the IMAX-magic, but they are far and few between and not really worth the extra price of an admission ticket.Onto the movie then: the CGI-animation is (of course) well done, with lots of attention being paid to hair and patches of wet fur. Down looks like down in this movie. The tracks the penguins make in the snow are another nice touch. The animation is fluid, although you have to keep in mind that penguins are not the most difficult animals to animate.Where I found the movie lacking was the story. The idea of penguins needing to have a song of their own, and that one little chick due to the carelessness of his dad when he was still an egg can only 'sing with his feet' is a little contrived, but okay---you need a background anyway, and this is as good as any. Unfortunately, the reason the little penguin is cast out (being different and therefore not one to appease the Great Guin who bestows food on the penguins) is not told very accurately. There's but a few hints that things are amiss, but when he is finally cast out it all of a sudden becomes his sole raison d'être. To that point (one hour into the movie!) the viewer is led to believe that Mumbles will somehow learn the other penguins that dancing is as good a way of singing as is having a good voice, so the shift in storyline is rather abrupt. He even rejects the most desirable girl penguin of his generation in his quest 'to bring back the fish'. Mumbles is captured, put in a zoo, and eventually begins to tap and dance for a little human girl. This allows him to return to the colony where he fulfills his quest by persuading the other penguins to dance, and thus more or less tell the humans that they should stop fishing in the region. And that's the end. Mumbles doesn't get the girl---she took another. The 'priests' amongst the penguins say nothing about their errors in judging Mumbles. None of the penguins is seen to thank the hero of the story. How a penguin who literally swam across the ocean is able to return to his colony as if nothing happened remains a mystery: he should be bored stiff in their world of songs.I don't like the way this story was told: it leaves me dissatisfied and full of questions. It trails around aimlessly, and when it finally hits on something worth telling, it is more or less hammered into place like a carpet which never seems to fit. There's lots of singing and dancing of course, but there aren't many tunes which get stuck in your head. It just goes to show that even with a team of excellent CGI-animators, you cannot expect things to work out as if by magic if there's no strong story framework to rely upon.I'm giving this a 5 out of 10: definite potential, but ultimately weak and not very interesting. I recommend you wait until the DVD release, if at all.",5,1,2,18 December 2006
