Scarface," Pacino in full-throttle!
","Arguably Al Pacino career role Scarface is the portrayal of a ruthless gangster, with no barriers who won't stop at anything.As good as Brian De Palma is and as good as this film is it would never be as good as its final result without Al Pacino in the title role. It is an amazing, one of the best portrayals of a gangster in film ( many of these portrayals belong to Pacino).This is a gutless, ruthless journey through the life of a penniless migrant who becomes a rich tyrannic, determined gangster and it one of the cult films of the early eighties. Michelle Pfeiffer also starres in quite a prominent role. Warning: if you think that this film won't be violent then I suggest you son't even consider the thought of watching it; this version of the film hides nothing.",8,2,4,11 August 2015
Inception," A mind bending and enthralling sci-fi action epic
","Despite being very ambitious, this masterpiece from Christopher Nolan centres around a few strong philosophical ideas about dreams and reality. Although complex it ticks the boxes with ease, much work has been put into the story line, every aspect of the plot, settings, cast and choice of characters has been thoroughly thought through. Warning: you may have to watch it twice although you probably won't because you will be paying full attention to DiCaprio's fantastic performance; perhaps the greatest of his career, Leo plays a man who navigates peoples mind in dreams. Not to mention the other members of the cast which include Ellen Page Gordon- Levitt, Ken Watanabe and a cunning Tom Hardy who are also fantastic.Christopher Nolan brings the audience yet another masterpiece; responsible for multiple films considered as some of the greatest films of the 21st century this is one of his best, redefining the genre of sci-fi action.",9,1,3,11 August 2015
