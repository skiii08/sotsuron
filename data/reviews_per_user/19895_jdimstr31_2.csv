The Blair Witch Project," A masterpiece of suspense and terror
","There is only one thing required to be spooked by this movie...an imagination. I read all these people saying that this is the worst movie they've ever seen. Oh, it wasn't scary, the people were stupid, it wasn't realistic, etc. Wrong, wrong, wrong! Those people missed the point of the movie entirely. You weren't supposed to be analyzing the peoples actions. You were supposed to experiencing what was happening to them. That's why EVERY second of this movie is shown through someone's point of view. That was the whole point behind the filming technique. You weren't supposed to be watching what was happening. It was supposed to be happening to you. Have you ever been lost? Heard a strange noise in the middle of the night? Been afraid in a situation that was completely out of your control? Fear is based purely on one thing...the unknown. Humans fear the unknown more than anything else. We fear dying because we don't know what it will be like. We fear pain because until it happens, we don't know what it will feel like. We fear loss because we don't know if we will be able to cope with that loss. That was the focus of the characters fears. They don't know what they are hearing at night. Who is watching them? What do the want? Why won't they show themselves? Now people complained (spoiler here) that when the characters discover neatly stacked piles rocks surrounding their tent one morning that that wasn't scary. Of ourse rocks aren't scary. They're rocks. The point is that someone was there. Someone, or something, was right outside their tent that night. They were there long enough to build those rock piles. Whatever was watching them had gotten that close to them, and they didn't even know it. Now THAT is scary. And that is the whold point of the movie. Things that are happening aren't sxplained. your imagination is let free to run wild. You think of the creepy stories told earlier in the movie and wonder what it is that is coming for them. We are all born afraid. But there are two kinds of fear: instinctive fear, and learned fear. We are born afraid of things like the dark, sudden loud noises, abandonment. We have to be taught to be afraid of things like, strangers, sharp objects, weapons. This movie plays on those primal fears. You can't cotrol what is going on. You are completely at the mercy of whatever is stalking you. So what if things aren't explained in great detail? You are left to think about the movie and draw your own conclusions. Roger Ebert said it best, 'The noise in the dark is scarier than what makes the noise in the dark.' My, and the movies', point exactly. Truly a great film that is guaranteed to give you a world class case of the creeps long after the movie has ended Just put yourself in their shoes and let your imagination do the rest. **** out of ****.",Null,0,1,27 May 2000
X-Men," An OK distraction
","Let's get one thing straight. Patrick Stewart is WAY too talented to be doing this kind of thing. He is excellent as Xavior, but his talents are still wasted. In an age when style counts more than substance, X-Men fares better than most comic book adaptions. It ranks better than any of the Batman films, but that's not so tough since they haven't made a good one yet. But this film makes the typical Hollywood flaw, it lets its' visuals and volume level get in the way of story and character development. Sure it loud, fast paced, and visually impressive. It makes for a good summer movie, and it's technical achievements assure it good sales when it hits video. But is there anything really worthwhile here? Not really. There is nothing within the characters or the story that really get to you. You simply do not care about the characters and their situations. You are not given the chance to. Instead, you're beat over the head with more meaningless, albeit impressive, action sequences. Unfortunately, we live in an age when that equates good filmmaking to mass audiences. Hollywood has only gotten the comic book translation right two times. The most recent was The Crow. It, like X-Men, was visually stunning. But The Crow made room for character development. You cared about what was going on. It had real emotion and an incredible performance by Brandon Lee. But the greatest comic adaption in Hollywood history is Superman. The original and its' sequel stand head-and-shoulders above all the others. They had incredible visuals and epic action scenes. But most importantly, they had character dimension. They all served a purpose to the story. The action served the story. They also remained loyal to the characters. Even the lesser Supmerman sequels, while not very good movies, remained faithful to the characters. If you've ever read an X-Men comic, you'll see many changes to the characters. They are either flat background characters that are thrown in because the audience expects to see them (Storm, Cyclops), or they are completely changed to fit into a modern movie. The biggest example of that is Wolverine. First off, he doesn't have the same demeanor, or accent, as the comic character. He was just over 5' tall, now he's over 6'. And he wore a bright spandex costume, not leather. The leather may be more 90's but it's just not true to the vibrant nature of the comic. So, all in all, I was very disappointed. It's just another flash in the pan. It will make a load of money, but will not stand the test of time. No one will remember this movie 20 years from now, except the fanboys whose lives revolve around X-Men. Still, it looks good so I give it 5 out of 10.",5,0,0,16 July 2000
