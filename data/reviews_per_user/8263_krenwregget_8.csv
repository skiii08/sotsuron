Insidious: Chapter 2," a bit of a mess
","After just having seen this film, I can tell you it's a convoluted hodgepodge of themes, styles and rip-offs from other films that ends up just a giant mess.Is it a ghost story? A haunting? A murder mystery? Paranormal investigation? Inter-dimensional time travel? It's all of these, which means it has a pretty big identity crisis, coming off as a schizophrenic jumble of half-realized ideas and tried, horror clichés.The jump scares are again plentiful, but are wasted on horror vets as we've seen all this before. The jarring audio cues are back from the first film, again letting you know via sudden, high-decibel jolts that THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE SCARY PART.The cast reprise their roles from the first film, including the duo of paranormal researchers who provide unnecessary comic relief and tend to suck all the tension out of any scene they are in.Insidious 2 suffers from too many things going on at once. I found I wanted to know more about Parker and his story than anything else but like many things in the film, it was never explained. There is also another tedious, open-ending to this film, no doubt allowing for a third installment to make more money.James Wan shows potential as a horror director and I quite enjoyed 'the Conjuring' but he's not in the same league as classic films such as 'the Exorcist', 'The Shining', 'the Others' and 'The Sixth Sense' and I'm not sure he ever will be. I guess we'll see.Oddly enough, the high point of both these films for me was the beautiful old homes and sets they shot in. I love that style of architecture and it was a real treat to spend some time there.",4,2,3,31 July 2014
John Wick," Best Fight Choregraphy in a Long Time
","In an age of comic book movies and seemingly endless reboots, along comes 'John Wick': an original film with an aging Keanu Reeves as a retired super-assassin brought back in to world he tried to leave for the best of action film reasons... REVENGE.What sets this film apart are the incredible fight scenes that are wide-shot, uninterrupted gun play extraordinaire... there's nothing else in Hollywood that comes close to this kind of combat choreography. This is close-range, brutally effective, 'tier one operator'-level stuff. You can tell Reeves dedicated himself to this role with vigor and the results are spectacular.The story is lean and slightly cliche as are the one-note Russian villains, but when the gun play and stunts are is this good, who cares. I could never buy Keanu Reeves in the role of a bad ass (the Matrix) but his his performance in John Wick is very satisfying and really sells the idea that this guy could kill everyone in the room with a pencil if need be.If you love action, do yourself a favor and watch this film. Thank me later.",9,1,1,2 September 2019
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," an absolute embarrassment to the Star Wars franchise
","the only reason this 'film' even ranks a 4 is because of Natalie Portman's mid-rift. Seriously though 'Attack of the Clones' ranks among the Star Wars holiday special and those awful Ewoks TV movies for being black eyes on an otherwise great group of films. Of course I'm referring specifically to the original trilogy.When I first saw 'The Phantom Menace' in 1999, I wanted to like it because I grew up and obsessed over the original films. I came away going... 'well, at least it can't get any worse, right?' Boy, was I wrong.'Attack of the Clones' makes 'the Phantom Menace' look like freaking Shakespeare, especially the vomit-inducing courtship scenes between Padme and Mannequin Skywalker, the scene with Obi-Wan in the diner and pretty much the whole arena battle with 3P0 chasing his own head. Hayden Christensen managed to cock up the most badass villain in film history, though George Lucas is as much to blame. You'd think this was his first attempt at writing.... well, anything. At that he was a 14. And a little slow.They even managed to make one of the coolest characters in the whole Universe less interesting by making Boba Fett a clone. Well, goodbye awesome back story that authors had spent time crafting for you in the novels...Is the entire movie horrible? Almost. Obi-Wan being pursued through an asteroid field by 'clone' Boba and his daddy is kind of neat, and.... that's about it. Yoda fighting Dooku is utterly laughable because it goes against his very character. He wouldn't fight and doesn't even carry a lightsaber, but hey we have some time to fill and an extra $4M in the CGI budget to blow, so let's do that.Of course there are plenty of people who say the old films were just as flawed and that we 'old timers' are blinded by nostalgia. They are entitled to their opinions even though they are wrong.Do yourself a favour. If you ever get the urge to watch this film, stop what you are doing, check that you've taken your meds and watch one of the originals instead.",4,0,4,1 August 2014
Insidious," Doesn't live up to its potential.
","This film falls under what I like to call 'commercial horror', that being produced by a large, Hollywood studio for as wide an audience as possible. In that, I guess it's a success. Where it does not succeed is providing the horror-savvy viewer with anything new or interesting.This film and it's director/writers borrow from other films in the genre (the Sixth Sense, the Shining, the Others, Poltergeist) but any seasoned fan should be able to guess where and when the scares are coming.The first half creates a decent tone but the tired, horror clichés tend to skirt away any real tension and the overuse of sudden, jarring musical/audio cues jolts the viewer more than any of the imagery. It's as if they didn't think the movie itself was doing a well enough job of conveying the frights so they decide to hammer you over the head with loud noise to indicate that THIS PART IS SUPPOSED TO BE SCARY!! GET IT???!!! The cast seem to be more horror stereotypes or caricatures rather than real people we can identify with and even Patrick Wilson, who is usually very solid, gets a little cartoonish towards the end. Things start to come off the rails in the third act as the film struggles to find its identity, especially when it can't decide who is really the villain: rip-off Darth Maul/goat man or the rip-off 'Woman in black'.If you are a horror newbie, you might enjoy this but for the 'smart mark' viewer, you've seen this before and executed better in other films.Is anyone else really tired of unresolved, open endings that allude to an obvious sequel? I know it's about trying to milk the marks for all you can, but I think it leads to lazy writing, and this film is proof.",5,0,0,31 July 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," how do I say this.... terrible?
","Where do I even begin? This movie is a complete mess from start to finish and contains too many problems to list.What's shocking is that several people read the script and then said, 'yeah, this seems like a good idea.' There are massive continuity problems, a nonsensical story, a laughable villain (actually more than one), bad acting, atrocious (that means really bad, kids) writing, groan-inducing dialog and relies on so many coincidences to push the story forward that it baffles the brain. In fact, the whole thing is an insult to anyone with a triple-digit IQ.I actually find it shocking that anyone could rate this film higher than a 6; I'm hoping those are all 13 year old boys who don't know any better. If you enjoyed this films and aren't 13, schedule yourself for an MRI immediately as you have suffered a recent brain injury.The first 'Amazing SpiderMan' was utterly forgettable. Unfortunately, I'll remember this one for a long time because it was so terrible.",4,5,12,4 September 2014
Evil Dead," not a bad horror film
","So I just finished watching this film and I quite enjoyed it, more than I figured I would. I'm not a die-hard ED fan but I liked the originals and I'd heard mixed reviews on this one but as a horror fan thought I'd give it a fair shake.The film looks great. It has a kind of hyper-saturated, rich, retro tone to it that adds to the eeriness of the setting. The camera angles and some of the framing also contribute to it's look and the sets/environments were well designed. There is a bit of shaky-cam during some of the action as well as some jump edits, but overall it wasn't too distracting.The story is, well.... we're talking about a horror film with demons and stuff so what logic is there to found in such things? It's passable enough to move things along, though there are plenty of horror clichés and people acting foolishly for no reason; perhaps you can blame their youth.Gore hounds should be pleased with this film as it surpasses the original in that regard; I found myself saying 'oh man!' more than once. There are a few scares and some tension but horror veterans will see it coming.What's missing is a likable protagonist. The film centres around Mia who is a drug addict, at the cabin with her friends in order to detox via the 'cold turkey' method. She is also the first to fall victim to the evil presence lurking in the woods (I guess they have nothing better to do?) so the lead role shifts around a bit and never really settles on anyone in particular. You think her brother might end up being the 'Ash' character, but he is a bit of a jackass and personally I was hoping he would die in some horrible way.Overall, it's a fun ride and one that I will take again, along with the original. In a market flooded with bad horror films, this one is a decent watch if you can separate it from the Sam Raimi classic.",7,1,4,29 August 2014
Drag Me to Hell," Finally.....
","It took Sam Raimi to bring fun back to the horror genre, and I'm so glad he did. In a sea of 'torture porn' and 'found footage' garbage, this is a rare jewel that makes you realize what you've been missing as a horror fan.If you're into Sam's other works, you will greatly enjoy this film as it hits all the right notes and contains many of his trademark moments and nods to his early films. It's light on the blood and guts compared to the Evil Dead trilogy, but I didn't miss it all that much because I was having too much fun with everything else.If you don't get black comedy, perhaps this film will confuse or disappoint you or come off as 'cheesy', but this is classic Raimi style and I love it. It's good to see many practical effects back in action and his camera work is as great as ever.I like horror films to be fun and this certainly fits the bill.",8,58,84,4 September 2014
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," still feels like 'diet' Star Wars... not quite the real thing
","I can only conclude that 'Revenge of the Sith' has such a high score because it's not a complete pile of steaming turd like 'Attack of the Clones' or an utter disappointment like 'the Phantom Menace'. If this was anything but episode three, it would be a terrific sci-fi action film but there is too much baggage attached to make it rise to the level of the original films.The main problem? George Lucas. His writing is pure garbage and his direction in anything but the action scenes is just as bad. It's a real shame because he'd be an awesome 2nd unit director as he really understands how to frame, follow and pace action but he cannot, I REPEAT, can NOT direct scenes with drama or dialog.Second: Hayden Christiansen is back as Anakin Skywalker and is utterly unconvincing playing the Jedi-turned-Sith. Every time you see him on screen you want to punch him in the face for being such a bitch.Third: frogger Yoda. It was a terrible idea in episode II and it's just as bad here. It's like GL has totally forgotten who Yoda is and what he stands for.However, for all it's bad, this film has a quite a bit of good. The opening space battle is perhaps the greatest ever put to film and the action scenes throughout the movie are really well conceived and shot. The film also looks excellent but the over-reliance on CGI makes many of the ground battles look like a video game, especially when compared to LOTR.Overall, this is easily the high point for the prequels. Unfortunately, that's not saying an awful lot.",6,1,1,2 August 2014
