Hereditary," This one scared me!
","It has been a long time since a movie truly scared me. Don't get me wrong, there have been many horror movies I have loved, but they didn't get to me like this one did. Ari Aster did a fantastic job in making a creepy vibe throughout the entire movie keeping you guessing whether what was happeing was a case of mental breakdown, or was it truly happening. I recommend giving this movie a look.",9,3,5,27 July 2019
Mother!," What did I just watch?!?
","This movie was recommended by a good friend and big movie buff, so I watched it. So glad I did. For all that happened on the movie, it simply is an allegorical story of the Bible. I didn't catch it at first...but wheni did, it changed the whole movie for me. Jennifer Lawrence did a great job as did Javier. And of course Ed Harris and Michelle Pffiefer! Not an easy movie to watch, but worth the time!",7,0,0,23 July 2019
