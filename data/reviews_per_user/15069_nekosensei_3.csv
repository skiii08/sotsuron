It," Kid stuff
","This is a veery watchable film that's well done in every department but I wouldn't call it horror, in the sense that the 1990 miniseries was horror. This felt more like a tween fantasy story. The miniseries is a dark, disturbing fable about how childhood trauma follows us through life. This is a kid-friendly buddy picture whose message is that you can defeat any bully by standing up to It. If the second half is just adult actors playing out the same trope it could get really annoying.",7,0,1,20 June 2018
Joker," Mediocre fanfic that's benefited from a sad bit of luck
","If the familiies of survivors of the Aurora shooting hadn't dared to pipe up to suggest that maybe an ultraviolent movie called 'Joker' portraying a murderous sociopath as a hero wasn't the greatest idea, triggering a backlash in which the alt-right felt it their duty to praise and promote the film as the greatest movie ever made (note the number of botlike 10/10 reviews surrounding this one), I'm guessing this picture would have come and gone by now. As it is, its spectacular first weekend box office has fallen off by an order of magnitude each following week, as word of mouth quietly overtook the fake hype crusade.I think this film would definitely go over better with a young or less movie literate audience that wasn't already familiar with all the movies it borrows from--most obviously 'Taxi Driver' and 'King of Comedy,' though I haven't yet seen anybody mention 'American Psycho,' from which it copped its have-its-cake-and-eat-it-too gimmick of suggesting that Arthur's antics are a figment of his imagination--OR ARE THEY?--after showing them to us as real. But beyond this, the really tiresome retread here is the whole concept of the antisocial, destructive man who is really a hero because...oh, never mind, it's not his fault, it's everybody else's somehow, and anyway isn't it cool the way he goes around wrecking everything? This isn't a revolutionary message, it's a socially irresponsible one. The use of music by convicted serial pedophile Gary Glitter on the soundtrack to me seals my belief that this was made on autopilot by not very bright people who never bothered to think through what they were putting on the screen.",5,1,2,26 October 2019
Jojo Rabbit," The Waititi version
","While the American movie world raved over the mediocre 'Joker,' Taika Waititi's latest slipped quietly into limited distribution to a chorus of critical yawns. We've seen SO many stories like this before, Schindler's List, The Book Thief, The Nightingale, yadayadayada. Who is this Taika again? The one who directed Thor: Ragnarok? Whateva!Except that in case you've actually been paying attention to Waititi's career--I mean, to the superb series of pictures he's made in addition toThor Ragnarok and What We Do In The Shadows--Jojo Rabbit is a superlative addition to the growing oeuvre of arguably the finest living film director working in the English language. If you haven't seen Boy, Eagle vs. Shark, or Hunt for the Wilderpeople (not to mention the Oscar-nominated short Two Cars, One Night that Boy is based on) you may well watch Jojo Rabbit with the blase attitude of someone who can't enjoy the pleasure that only comes from recognizing and grooving on the unique point of view of a first-class auteur. I'll add that every great Jewish artist must at some point grapple with the Holocaust, and I'm happy that Taika got to do it sooner rather than later, especially when he was still young enough to play the role of Jojo's imaginary friend Hitler and thus give the two fingers up to that contemptible mass murderer who is still so shamefully revered in so many places around the world, particularly here in the U.S. Go Taika!",10,7,21,2 November 2019
