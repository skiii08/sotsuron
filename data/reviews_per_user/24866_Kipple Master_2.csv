Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Absolutely Fantastic, except the script.
","Star Wars Episode 1 was an excellent movie, it had everything you could ask for in a Star Wars movie. The lightsabre fights were the best I have seen. My only problem is the script. There were many scenes in the movie which had greater potential to reveal more about the force and how it works, for example the Jedi Council scene.Some of the dialogue was hollow, it had no substance and most times it was just stating the obvious. George Lucas really needs help writing the script like with Star Wars A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back.Overall it was an exciting thrill ride. It is everything you expect in a Star Wars movie and a bit more",9,0,1,7 June 1999
Mission: Impossible II," Interesting, Fun and Just Plain Great
","This movie is a lot like Face/Off (1997) (also directed by John Woo). An action packed thrill ride which takes a little while to get started. It keeps you interested and alert. What happens between the beginning and the end is very hard to predict, the ending, however is exactly what I expected (Just like in Face/Off).Overall it's worth the money you pay to see it, just don't believe the reviews in the newspapers which say it has no plot (in Australia anyway) because it has a great plot with plenty of twists and turns, and of course intense action. 9/10.",9,1,1,6 June 2000
