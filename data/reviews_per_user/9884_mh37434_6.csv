10 Cloverfield Lane," Better than the first film in the Cloverfield franchise
","There are few films that I can honestly say are quite brilliant. This movie had so many layers to it, one can't help but love it. Even if you're not into sci-fi like me, you'll probably like it because it's a thriller and exciting.The movie is the second Cloverfield film, but there's no apparent connection to the first film at all, which indicates it takes place in a different universe or timeline, but it's still science fiction. So I guess that the Cloverfield franchise is similar to The Twilight Zone. One could theorize a way that this film could be connected to the last film, but it's all just speculation more than anything. It doesn't really matter, because this is still an entirely different story.The first film I saw in theaters when it first came out, I was more interested in seeing the Star Trek teaser trailer than the movie itself, and the movie was filmed in a way that made me feel incredibly sick. I never watched it again, but it was a cool story.That being said, this movie is better, it's filmed like a traditional film for one thing. This is John Goodman's best work by the way. The movie presents so many questions. I just loved it. Especially considering there was next to nobody in the cast, just four people in the whole movie I think. Not counting the photographs.Anyway, unlike the first movie, which was a monster film, this is an alien invasion story. Actually that's not even right. It's a story about a man who kidnaps a girl...that's not right...I really don't know what the movie is about, I just know it's awesome! Watch it...",9,2,4,28 March 2016
It," Great horror film...one of this era's bests...
","I believe I have said before that I normally don't like reboots, but not having any memory of the original 'It' makes me not really care in this case. This really was a fantastic film.There's jumps and laughs and even some sad scenes. It's not just horror, it encompasses a variety of emotion and brings me back to my childhood to a time when being a kid was like living a fantasy.Acting was top notch here too, these kids are great. Anyway not much more I can think of but check it out I mean it!!",8,5,12,8 September 2017
Interstellar," Awesome film!! Great science fiction!!
","Wow. I really don't know what to say about this movie. It just totally blew me away. I didn't really know what to expect, but I was looking forward to seeing it. Upon viewing it, I realized it's one of the coolest movies ever made. I saw it in IMAX with my Brother-in-law and another friend of mine, but my brother-in-law hated it, he said it made him depressed because of the situation with Matthew McConnahey's character and his daughter.Yes, I don't know how to spell his name. But that's beside the point. This film is one of those rare treats that just don't happen much anymore for science-fiction fans. Mostly you get action or horror movies, with a touch of sci-fi, in this, but this? It was hardcore. It had everything sci-fi is supposed to do, play with your brain, that's what a good sci-fi story should do.It also had that sense of realism that Christopher Nolan is well-known for bringing to his films. I felt the same way watching 'Inception,' and even more so with the 'Dark Knight' trilogy, which was totally about realism. In 'Interstellar,' I'm not saying that time travel or faster-than-light space travel is possible, but I feel like this movie done it in the most realistic and believable way imaginable.I remember hearing that this film was made by both Warner Bros. and Paramount Pictures, and because of that, I was kind of hoping that it might be some kind of prequel to 'Star Trek,' another Paramount film franchise. Yeah, I know warp drive came about differently in the Star Trek universe, but I thought maybe since this was the early days of interstellar travel, maybe they'd be unsuccessful and have to abandoned their work, and maybe that's what leads Cochrane to inventing warp drive. Anyway, I was just fantasying about more Trek oriented films since we don't get much these days.Needless to say, I'm pleased with the film, and I felt like it didn't need Star Trek to help it get in the air, I'm not sure how a sequel to a movie like this would work, I mean yeah, I suppose they could do further stuff in this universe but I don't see it adding anything to the story presented in this film. But if one comes, I'll be there.",9,1,3,15 December 2014
It Follows," A real horror movie - not just a lame visual spectacle...
","Being a huge fan of sci-fi, fantasy and horror, and all the other subgenres of speculative fiction, I have to say I enjoyed this film very much. It could have been just another silly visual spectacle that seems to be so common with films of this type these days, sci-fi movies are pretty much action movies, and fantasy films are mostly Disney-esque, and of course horror films are pretty much just slasher films only, filled with gore and not really scary at all.Now I'll have you know first off, that I was by no means terrified by this film, I have seen way too many horror films for really anything to have much of an effect on me. So for me, it's not the fear that's so gripping about good horror movies, it's the excitement and facing the unknown. Yep, this is a supernatural horror film, which to me is what horror is supposed to be. I think horror works best when it uses sci-fi or fantasy elements, such as alien monsters or fantasy creatures such as Ogres. That being said, this was not like the average horror film of this era, this is more of a throwback to the horror films from the good old days. Yeah, it's that good. It's not a slasher film, and really all of the characters in the movie are pretty likable, something not very common in horror movies in a while. It seems like there's always some jerk character that's a jock bully, and you already know he's gonna get killed because he fits that stereotype, you can just assume he'll be the first character that the monster kills.Thankfully, this film has no such character. Every character in the show is pretty likable. And the music is way cool too. I really don't know if the movie would have done so great if not for the music. It was really cool. I marked this review a spoiler one, and here's why, the monster is a -- well, we don't have a clue what it is. It could be an alien, imp, bogeyman, goblin...the truth is, it's never revealed. But it's drawn to sex, whatever it is, whoever she has sex with gets killed and then it goes after her again. But she's safe as long as she keeps passing it on, by having sex.The creature is invisible, except to those who it's after or has been after. In fact, it can have a variety of appearances. Yeah, it seems to be a shapeshifter. In fact, it once shapeshifts as this dude's mom and then rapes him. So the last thing he sees before he dies is mom raping him. Yeah, that scene gets an A+ for its' disturbing shock value. Anyway the monster...well...it keeps coming, it...follows. And yes, that's why the movie's called that. But don't judge the movie by its' somewhat silly title. I honestly remember I laughed last year when I first saw the trailer for it, I figured it was just gonna be another stupid lame teenager horror film. And yes, the characters are teenagers mostly but that's beside the point. It's a great film, I watched the DVD just yesterday and I think if you like traditional horror films, you'll like this.",7,4,11,21 August 2015
Logan," Touching and moving
","Trying to find a great film in the midst of all the clich√© films of modern times is hard to do sometimes, even among my favorite genres, and sadly yes, even within my favorite franchises.The Marvel Films are generally pretty good, and that is a lot of material. There's the Cinematic Universe with Avengers, then of course you got the Fantastic Four movies and Punisher films...did I leave anything out? Oh yeah...the X-Men movies have always stood out to me out of all the other Marvel films, because they had a tendency to be more sci-fi than superhero fiction. Not that I don't like superhero fiction, but X-Men has always been more sophisticated to me, and seeing this movie, and realizing it was going to be the last true X-Men film was kind of sad.There'll be others, but not with Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart. Technically this isn't an X-Men movie...not in the strictest sense. It marks an end to the Wolverine trilogy, and it is easily the best of the three.The franchise will never be the same. Even when more films are made, Wolverine won't be in it. I wasn't a fan of last years film so much either. I wasn't impressed with Apocalypse and it just really wasn't all that great of a movie. They did some cool stuff I suppose, but I feel like a lot of what X-Men films used to be about have been replaced with visuals and spectacular action sequences. Oh yeah, and Jennifer Lawrence of course. I really don't see where the film franchise is gonna go, especially since Logan can't even cameo anymore.But enough about the seemingly negative future that hasn't happened yet. Even if this is the end of the X-Men franchise as we know it, it went out in a blaze of glory. No post-credit scene, it was really an end, and a fitting one at that. I couldn't ask for a better story, although I have to admit I may have been a little disappointed we still didn't get to see Omega Red. In any case, I was happy with the family aspect of the movie, and I thought that there were a number of important scenes in the film...the family with the horses, the X-Men comics, and of course the convenience store scene. X-23 in her cute little sunglasses and munching on Pringles. That was hilarious. I can't explain it, but it was just very much a work of art.I don't know what the future has in store for this franchise, but here in the present, things are looking good. It was a great film. It was beautiful, bold and a little funny at times. Check it out.",10,2,6,7 March 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Absolutely fantastic movie!
","I rated this film ten. I realize that may be a little bit high because I only watched it once and I may have a different opinion upon the second viewing but considering I went in expecting to be disappointed, I'm saying that I really loved it.The more I think about it, and I've had quite a bit of time to think of it, while I was working last night I was thinking about it, and I can honestly say that the more I do think about it, the more I come to the realization that it was an awesome movie.A film like this has the potential to literally sink the Titanic. (yes that was a reference to the movie which to my knowledge is still the number one box office grossing film of all time) The reason I say this is because it's the first live action film to portray two of the most popular superheroes of all time. Even if the movie was bad it had high potential and it no doubt would have still been a success, just because of that.But I was just happy it was a great movie. I was skeptical about Jesse Eisenberg at first as Lex Luthor, and the trailers really sucked for the movie, but after watching the full product I can honestly say I loved it. Naturally I might change my mind later, as it really all depends if the movie is something I'd watch several times or not. But anyway, I want to see it again, and I loved Ben Affleck as Batman. I'm totally pro-Batfleck. Also, Superman is much more of a superhero now, and Lois, who was somewhat one dimensional in 'Man of Steel,' is actually very interesting in this film. And of course you already knew Doomsday was in it if you saw the trailer. When he and Superman fight to the death it is one of the most epic scenes in a superhero film. I also thought the same of the scene where Superman begs Batman to save Martha, which coincidentally is also Bruce Wayne's mother's name.Check it out, it rocks, I could go on forever, but I'm cutting off right there. Oh yeah, and I loved Alfred in this too. Check it out, like I said, I thought I'd be disappointed with all the negative reviews, just don't listen to them. I really don't understand the negative reviews, because the film just rocked to me. I'll have to watch it again though, and I hope I still love it after that.",10,6,12,27 March 2016
