","I went to see 'United 93' having heard excellent reviews. My expectations were, therefore, very high. I can only say that as high as they were, they were totally exceeded. This is a GREAT film.This movie (which is done in a documentary style, which is totally effective) grabbed me by the throat, and held me in its grasp until the very end. Indeed, I (and the other audience members) sat stunned in our seats as the credits began to roll. I wasn't aware of tears on anyone's part; the reaction was one of utter shock, of having been almost pulverized emotionally by the experience--an experience beyond tears.The thing about United 93 is its utter believability. I had the sense that THIS IS THE WAY IT HAPPENED. Naturally, no one can know what each person said, or did, during that unspeakable time. But there is no doubt in my mind...remembering, of course, that every witness to the actual events on United 93 is dead...that this is as close as one can possibly come to knowing what these tragic/heroic individuals experienced.I shall never forget this film.",9,2,3,7 June 2006
