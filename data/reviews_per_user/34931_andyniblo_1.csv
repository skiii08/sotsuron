Marie Antoinette," Erm...
","Right, here we go. The fact that i had to give this film a mark out of ten is unfair on my part. 1 is still too much. i feel infuriated and robbed of 2 hours of my life. f*ck you Sofia Coppola. here's why you suck: i don't know which story got shunned out of the way for you to masturbate on film for two hours, but i feel robbed of a possible genius who could have made something of substance and worth. you are not your father. get over it. f*ck even now, your father isn't your father.Coppola masquerades herself as an artist. but there isn't an artist of any kind in her. it's amazing how people who gave a good review to this film have been hoodwinked. suckered. stolen from. the one recurring theme in ALL of her films is that nothing happens and people just walk around for a while. the film has no story. the soundtrack is quite frankly ridiculous and i think that everyone is getting a little bored of American ignorance. but it's OK for US directors to change history to make money. to ignore important periods and events that formed the society in which we now live. isn't it?the American ability to forget is incredible, just as it is incredible that they can't let anything go. really, how many films about African slavery have there been? how many films about the slaughter of native Americans have there been? without a comedic twist might i add.i think that the reason Coppola focuses on such a bland time in Marie's life is because she really doesn't like her. I don't think she understands the character, and i also doubt her simple life experiences. for a film about a woman who probably got more wasted than Keith Richards, the sequences in which these activities are undertaken is devoid of any realism. i don't know how many times little miss Sofia got sh*t-faced and woke up with her head in a public urinal, but if she did it seriously doesn't show here.so, in a nutshell, rubbish, fart, balls and nonsense. excuse the profanity, but there aren't any nice words to describe this film. i suppose thats why we have swears.i don't think I'm alone in stating that the world wouldn't really be bothered if Sofia Coppola literally disappeared. the film going community are simply not waiting for another one of her tedious, repetitive and nauseating wastes of time.",1,7,12,21 February 2008
