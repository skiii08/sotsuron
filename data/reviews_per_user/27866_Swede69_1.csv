Hereditary," For Horror Film Connoisseurs
","I find it surprising that this film gets so many low marks. The only reason I can possibly fathom is that it's not filled with endless jump scares, standard cliche'd horror movie storylines and/or one-by-one character deaths at the hands of a standard boogeyman. If you like your horror a little deeper then read on.What you get is a fleshed-out story of a deceased grandmother who has influenced her mentally ill family members is the worst way possible. You will not be able to predict where it goes and the surprises in the film come fast and furious. To keep it short and sweet, I'm a fan of recent horror films like Annihilation, Mother!, It Follows, and Beyond the Black Rainbow as well as TV surreal/horror like Twin Peaks and Penny Dreadful. If these films are more your style then check out Hereditary. I was completely blown away and can't stop thinking about it.",10,7,12,27 August 2018
