The Incredible Hulk," this is way better than you think
","i really wanted to see this movie because i was disappointed with the first Hulk movie. and i feel safe to say that this movie deserves a 10 out of 10.Edward Norton plays Bruce Banner, a choice i did not see coming. i reckon he did a really good job acting his character. Liv Tyler was pretty decent as well and Tim Roth who played Emil Blonsky was good.i liked it how Bruce was in hiding for a long time and actually learnt ways to be able to keep himself relaxed so he wouldn't turn in Hulk.people say that the last i think bout 30-40 mins was a let down because it was just silly that The Abomination was destroying the city and that The Incredible Hulk had to fight and stop him. but i really liked the level of action that was in this movie.Of course Stan Lee has a cameo in this movie like he has done with the movies based off his characters but you also have a cameo of Lou Ferrigno...who is known to have started portraying the Hulk in the 70s TV series, he also does the voice of Hulk in this.good action, good acting, oh and you don't have to wait over an hour before you see The Incredible Hulk.",10,4,7,14 July 2008
Unbreakable," different but entertaining
","i saw bits of this years ago on TV and thought it was good. about 2-3 nights ago it was on again so i decided to sit down and watch the whole movie, and i'm very glad that i did.the movie is filmed as though it is a comic book come to life. dialogue and actions that would normally be put into each individual picture of the book. camera angles and the slightly blue coloured filter used throughout most of the movie add to this effect.the idea that the comic book characters of today are based off actual human abilities are somewhat exaggerated was good. that there are real heroes out there in the world, extending an arm to those in need. that some people out there have more to them then they know, but they have got to believe and develop their skills for hope to go further with their purpose.Samuel L. Jackson's character (Elijah...who suffers from osteogenesis imperfecta) has a somewhat strange obsession with comic books and their characters. believing that there is someone out there who is a 'superhero'. what he does to find this person is a scary thought but in the end finds him with Bruce Willis' character David Dunn.David finds it hard to believe this but his son, the true innocence of a child, fully believes in what Elijah is saying and becomes very upset that his father does not believe in himself. does not believe that he cannot be hurt.But every hero has a weakness and every hero has a villain as an opposite. this movie delivers these themes and this story very well.",9,0,0,9 June 2008
Underworld," alright but disappointing
","i watched this movie because I've always loved vampires, werewolves, etc for as long as i can remember so when i heard it was vampires and werewolves in a modern day world fighting it out i thought that it would be totally awesome.the bullets that each species used against each other were cool ideas but what i didn't like about the movie was they pretty much only ever used guns. and i was like, 'these guys are supposed to be extremely fast and strong, was the up and close fighting?' sad to not really see any of that.but i gotta say the main disappointment was how unconvincing the werewolves, sorry lycans, actually looked. i laughed a little at how bad looking they were.other than that the acting wasn't too bad and i especially liked the performance by Bill Nighy, i thought he was cool. the movie was definitely entertaining though.",6,0,1,2 June 2008
Dawn of the Dead," worth watching
","OK i bought this movie relatively cheap and was like, 'awesome a zombie movie'.i watched it at night to add to the atmosphere i knew the movie would create. i was really excited to see it because i hadnt seen many zombie movies before. the zombies were convincing too.i gotta say, the movie was quite entertaining. i mean its not original, but its definitely worth watching.the atmosphere of the movie was really well given.Ving Rhames i thought was just a totally awesome hero-type in the movie. and all in all the acting wasn't too bad.i liked the whole thing of holing up in a shopping mall for survival and then people starting to get on each other's nerves.even though how serious this movie was, there were actually some light funny bits which just really add to the experience of the movie, and a good one at that.i recommend to sit down and watch this movie maybe with some mates, or by yourself, but definitely at night-time, just adds to that atmosphere.",7,0,0,29 May 2008
Shaun of the Dead," brilliantly funny and gory and also touching
","i hired this movie (and now own) when i heard my friends talking about it often for quite a while. this movie is just brilliant.Shaun (Simon Pegg) is a guy with a lousy job, shares a house with two friends. Ed, who is an immature man who does not seem like he is ever going to grow up and has no job and Pete, who works and is absolutely fed up with Ed.Shaun has one last chance to make it up with his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) because she is sick of having to go to the Winchester (pub) every time they go on a date, and she feels as though Shaun is not being committed. Shaun, Ed, Liz and her two friends Dianne and David (Lucy Davis and Dylan Moran) are always together when they go on these 'dates' at the Winchester.well it doesn't work out with Shaun and Liz and they break up. Ed takes Shaun to the Winchester and this is when people start noticing some strange things.the next day the outbreak of zombies is revealed and Shaun devises a plan to rescue his mum and kill his step dad (Bill Nighy) and rescue his new ex-girlfriend Liz and wait the zombie epidemic out.there are a LOT! of funny scenes in this movie, i am not even really going to start because i won't stop.there are quite a few touching moments as well, especially when Shaun's step dad apologises and another one later but i don't want to spoil it.anyways this is a really funny movie, and some of the gross gory bits are actually made funny because of the atmosphere created. its a romantic comedy with zombies.",10,3,7,16 June 2008
Hostel," awful in everything
","i saw trailers for this movie and wanted to watch it because it looked like an awesome horror movie.after hearing things from friends saying how gory it is, it didn't bother me. i was in for the long haul, wanting to watch this movie.my mate lent me this movie to watch and i an surprised with myself for actually sitting through this trash. my dad was shocked that Quentin Tarantino would produce this movie.the first half is basically porn and the second half is just way over the top gore its disgusting. how something like this could be made is a question i suppose will never be answered.",1,0,2,10 June 2008
The Mummy," great mummy movie
","OK, hands down this movie is just awesome...Probably the best mummy movie.Brendan Fraser as the gung-ho Rick O'Connel is really funny and one of the characters that just makes this movie so great. John Hannah as Jonothan is good comic relief. one of my favourite seens with jonothan is when he is pretending to be one of the mindless followers of Imhotep.basically Rachel Weisz' character wakes up a mummy, Imhotep played by Arnold Vosloo (who i must say did quite a convincing job and i enjoyed his performance) and Imhotep sets plagues onto the land of Egypt and wants to resurrect his lost love.some people may find this movie has some scary parts in it, but its also a lighthearted movie in having comedy in it as well. you could say this is a horromedy.",10,7,9,24 May 2008
Nacho Libre," a good little movie
","mate lent me this and as i started watching it i found out it was a nickelodeon movie, but didn't stop me.this isn't an in-depth great movie. its just Jack Black being himself in a slapstick movie with a bit of crude humour and basically its just a good little entertaining movie.you watch it and kinda want Nacho to win because he's fighting for the benefit of the orphans ya know.Hector Jimenez was funny to watch and Ana de la Reguera made a good performance as well. And little Darius Rose as the cute Chancho are what made this film i reckon.",7,0,0,16 August 2008
Pitch Black," great watch
","i had seen the last 10 minutes of this film a few years before i actually watched it and i always remembered the scenes. it took me a while to find out what it was called but when i did i was ready to watch the whole movie.my brother and i sat down to watch this movie and we both really enjoyed it.Vin Diesal plays a slick killer (Richard B. Riddick), who has shining eyes that allow him to see in the dark, has just been captured by a small group of bounty hunters.the ship crashes onto a desert planet that seems to have no life, no water and oddly...three suns.not all of the acting is A grade but that is not enough to spoil the movie.they find out something strange that happens every 22 years that to their horror could just mean the end of their lives.so people find this movie has too many coincidences but i reckon thats what makes this movie great entertainment.",10,0,0,10 June 2008
Being John Malkovich," one weird movie, entertaining all the same
","mate said to watch this movie saying it was really good, so i did.John Cusack, almost unrecognizable at first, did a great job playing Craig Schwartz, a puppeteer who is getting no where and so gets himself a job filing at an office on the 7 1/2 floor...for short people.Cameron Diaz plays his wife who works at a pet shop and is a bit of a weird character, especially when Craig finds a door that is a portal to John Malkovich's head.I found the concept a good one, and it was slightly funny, it doesn't focus on being comedic. I did find the movie was getting weirder and weirder as it drew closer to the conclusion and some parts i think that could've been left out...but otherwise was an alright movie.",6,0,0,3 October 2008
Enchanted," instant classic
","i watched this movie just because it was put on and everybody else was watching it. i gotta say i'm glad i watched it, it was a great movie.starting off as cartoon animation classic Disney style with lots of singing and little animals that help the princess and talk to her. oh and not to mention the evil stepmother (but of the prince instead of the princess)Prince Edward (James Marsden) and and Princess Giselle (Amy Adams) are the two that fall in love and wish to be married straight away. but as Giselle goes to see Edward she is confronted by a hag reminiscent of the one from Snow White and i just laughed, and BOOM! she goes to the real world. where she meets Robert Philip (Patrick Dempsey).the Disney characters in the real world is a funny, but great mix as Giselle is always optimistic and believes in 'true love' whereas Robert tries showing her the real life. Pip the chipmunk is just laugh out loud funny and some of the stuff Edward does is too.Great memorable songs throughout.this movie is definitely one for the whole family and will be much enjoyed.",10,1,1,6 June 2008
I Am Legend," absolutely stunning
","I've seen this movie twice at the theatres and own the book so i am easily a fan of I Am Legend.there are quite a lot of differences between the movie and the book. but the movie pulled it off quite well, it was great.the emptiness of New York has a pure eeriness about it which is an awesome feel for the atmosphere.Will Smith is a great actor but his performance in this movie as Robert Neville is just a masterpiece. Having to entertain the audience on screen being the only human for over an hour. Showing us what his day to day life consists of, and showing us a semi-madness that his character has developed after being isolated for so long.like the book the movie uses flashbacks and in the movie they are well placed and give us those bits of information we need to put the pieces of the plot together.the disappointment with this movie is i reckon it actually could have gone on a bit longer to explore into the character of Robert Neville, exactly what he is doing and the stuff he is going through and what is happening to him. and the quick change for the last 30-40 mins of the movie, needed a longer transition but other than these this movie is definitely worth it and great.",10,0,3,3 June 2008
Transformers," pure awesomeness
","my mates and i were so pumped to see this movie. one of my mates actually kept looking on a website that had a timer countdown for the release.the three of us showed up 20 minutes before the cinema even opened and we were the first three to get tickets for the first screening in that cinema. the lights dimmed and we were going crazy it was awesome! we absolutely fell in love with this movie. one mate saw it about 6 or 7 times in the cinemas.the acting really was great. Shia LaBeouf is a very talented actor and one i have occasionally seen rising up through his acting career. he is very funny in a quirky way and just a great actor. i cannot picture anybody else as Sam 'Spike' Witwicky.Megan Fox was just hot and is a fairly decent actor herself. seeing Jon Voight was just cool and he is a good actor. my mate being a fan of Las Vegas couldn't wait to see Josh Duhamel in this movie and he is also a very talented actor.there are quite a lot of funny parts in this movie. like some of the stuff that Frenzy gets up to. some of the things the Autobots say and do and of course Shia.pointing out comedians Bernie Mac and Anthony Anderson in this movie i reckon just added to how great this movie was. Rachael Taylor was pretty good but i think she exaggerated her Australian accent a little, we don't all sound that bad. hehe.the convincing CGI used for the Transformers just blew us away. so convincing, so realistic. even so far as having light and other objects reflecting off their metallic surfaces.the music score is a masterpiece. it is very good. i wasn't sure orchestral music would work, but it did very amazing.this movie is just so jam packed with action its awesome. i mean come on, who doesn't want to see giant robots shooting and beating each other and the environment up? the movie doesn't focus massively on character development, which most people see as a flaw, but i found enough to be there it was great.",10,1,3,10 June 2008
Garden State," artsy awesomeness
","i was given this movie and told 'it's a very artsy movie you may not like it', quite the opposite.this movie was so good on quite a few levels.Zach Braff is a great director for this movie. his style and bringing things together and what the movie is about (also he is the writer) the movie is actually quite a funny movie, with subtle funny parts that not everyone notices.the soundtrack is great. always suits the mood Zach Braff plays Andrew Largeman a guy who is pretty much a washed up actor who didn't get anywhere. he returns home for his mother's funeral, after not being there for 9 years.He's been on lithium and other anti-depressants for the period prescribed to him by his pshychiatrist...his father,Gideon Largeman (Ian Holm)...but when he is back, he had decided not to take his drugs anymore and re-connect with himself with help from old friends and new ones. he learns the value of life and to love someone mainly with the help from Sam (Natalie Portman).the movie is extremely deep and very strong in delivering its messages. definitely a must.",10,0,1,6 June 2008
Saw II," more people, more traps, more deaths
","after quite a long time after seeing the first Saw movie and being very impressed with it, i finally got to watch the second one.i was pleased to see it was not as slow as the first one was, and also being quite different. this one you actually got to see Jigsaw's face (Tobin Bell). He has a lot more people in his game this time so a lot more happens.This time there are eight people in Jigsaw's trap and they must find a way out before they inhale too much nerve gas and die.enough background of each character was good and how each trap is for one specific person was interesting.it was cool that even though this time there was a whole group of police looking for the people, Jigsaw was able to keep one step ahead.one cop is particularly wanting to know where Jigsaw's victims are because one of them is his son, Daniel Matthews (Erik Knudsen) this movie has three twists towards the end, one i knew because i was told but the other two i didn't. you will truly keep guessing this movie until the end.",9,0,1,16 June 2008
Taken," makes you want to jump through a window...
","and tackle someone and shoot them.This movie has a slightly slow start, and you feel slightly sorry for Liam Neeson's character as things with life just all seem to go against him. Only to soon after have his daughter kidnapped in France as part of the sex trade.Neeson goes after her, after what would frighten any parent, hearing the kidnapping of his child whilst on the phone to her. Neeson stops at nothing to get her back.This is where the pace of the movie accelerates 10 fold. It does not stop. It just goes and goes. You have a feeling of satisfaction as each person is killed by Neeson, knowing what they support, thats what you want to happen to them.Then towards the end, Liam jumps through a window to reach them because there is no other way. You just wanna try it yourself.The action in this movie is great, the performances great, especially by Liam Neeson. I can't wait for this to come out on DVD, definitely a great watch.",10,4,9,4 October 2008
Saw," great twists and great idea
","i hired this movie for the mere fact that it was directed by two Australians and that not heaps of Aussie movies have gone too well and i also heard this was scary so i thought why not.i was glued to the screen the whole time, it was so great. Leigh Whannel was a good actor and i was amazed to see Carey Elwes in it. i had only known him to be in comedies and some others, but never a thriller/horror. seeing Danny Glover after being a fan from his earlier days in lethal weapon was a good surprise.this movie had so many twists that kept me guessing the whole time and each time i tried, i was shown to how wrong i actually was.the ending twist just makes your stomach turn and you feel amazed at the same time by how unexpected it is.great acting and awesome idea, i really enjoyed this. and it was also good because it wasn't so overloaded on the gore.",10,0,1,2 June 2008
Hancock," comedy,action,romance and drunk superhero!!!
","i had been excited for months to see this movie and when i finally did i did not find it any let down to my expectations at all.Hancock (Will Smith) ,a person with super powers should be a hero, which he is, and loved by the people, which he definitely isn't.after dealing with a crime costing 7 mill in property damage and saving the life of Ryan (Jason Bateman), Hancock goes to prison to turn over a new leaf from the advice of Ryan.the movie has many funny parts throughout and awesome action. many people say the last half of the movie ruined it, but i disagree. to me it made the film, and did a good job.",10,3,7,6 July 2008
Shooter," quite entertaining
","i sat down and watched this movie after my dad told my i should because he said it was a great movie, so of course i did.i liked the idea of what the movie was about and Mark Wahlberg is a good actor. but poor Danny Glover with his lisp, i'm sorry but i just could not take him seriously.the cinematography of the movie was stunning and the deliverance of the plot was good but to my disappointment i found the movie quite predictable and it was annoying my dad how i would suggest what would happen and he couldn't conceal that i was right.the movie is great entertainment and definitely worth watching, you won't be disappointed with what you see.",7,0,2,2 June 2008
Iron Man," delivers well and is lighthearted but serious at the same time
","i was absolutely pumped to go see this movie ever since i saw the trailer with the guitar riff to 'Ironman' by Black Sabbath. i warn you now you don't hear this song till the end credits. anyways with all that aside now comes the good bit.this movie opens straight up into the developing of Iron Man with Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) going through Afghanistan with a military escort. The escort is attacked and Tony Stark is kidnapped.the movie then goes to about a day earlier showing who the character of Tony Stark is, what he does and why he is so famous. and Tony is a real jerk to a lot of people. (in this part we get to see Stan Lee as Hugh Heffner...cool)fast forward quite a bit and Tony is back in America and realised how much damage his company is responsible of with making its weapons of destruction. so he sets out to perfecting the Ironman suit, which he had already made a makeshift one back in Afghanistan.after quite a few hilarious scenes of him perfecting his suit he finally puts on the red and gold suit everyone knows and slowly starts making a difference. the great change we see from Tony Stark at the beginning to the end is very well done and actually convincing. as though this person is actually going through these changes.Robert as Tony is a great choice, and he even looks like him. he delivers great. Gwyneth Paltrow...who i haven't seen in much, is actually quite good so don't fear she may ruin it. we see Terrence Howard as Col. James Rhodes who does a fine job, and there is a scene where he hints for something to be developed in the future of the marvel world. Jeff Bridges is great to. how he works over Tony and manipulates him.this movie isn't the highest action packed movie out there but when Iron Monger comes along there are some awesome scenes between him and Iron Man. a very very good comic book hero movie.",10,1,3,16 June 2008
