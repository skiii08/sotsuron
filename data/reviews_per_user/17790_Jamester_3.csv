The King's Speech," King George VI Stutters with Laughs, Giggles and Touching Moments at the Toronto International Film Festival
","Wow! I just saw this at the Roy Thompson Hall (TIFF) World premiere of The King's Speech with director Tom Hooper (great job), Colin Firth (great), Geoffrey Rush (outstanding), and the writer (excellent job!) present. Front row seating was actually really good.Let me frame this for you: this is a biopic of shy and stuttering King George VI in the years leading up to WWII. I didn't know he stuttered. And had a speech therapist. Interestingly, the screenplay writer wasn't allowed to put this on until the former Queen passed. 'Not in my lifetime,' she said. And so he waited 30 years to pass until he could. He was a former stutterer who said to himself, if King George VI could get over his stuttering, then so could I. And hence goes the story of overcoming this major issue (which has emotional and not merely physical roots) while connecting with his speech helper.The movie zones in on not only the stutter and magnifies the power and lack of power that the spoken word communicates (all subtext), but makes the story very human, and interesting as the film focuses on the King and Lionel Logue, his 'speech defects' therapist, for lack of a better and more accurate term.The movie flowed well with good story and excellent acting throughout that captured my attention and rewarded it with some funny and very honest moments sprinkled throughout.Geoffrey Rush was outstanding in playing a common man using his mind and full creative abilities to solve a man's stutter enough to deliver powerful speeches to resist during WWII.The funniest moment, I shall not reveal, but it has to do with how speech anti-stutter techniques were used. So creative. And honest. AND so funny.After one key speech, the audience in Roy Thompson Hall spontaneously started clapping. WOW! This was a nice movie. It could have pushed the emotional bar just a bit higher, but nonetheless stuck to its guns and gave an honest and good time. A strong 9/10.",9,54,77,10 September 2010
Brokeback Mountain," Powerful, Numbing
","I just saw this at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) to a packed house (with Ang Lee present for today's screening). And I have to say, it absolutely transfixed me and was worth the watch. Out of 24 movies I screened at the TIFF this year, this was the only one I rated a 10/10! Three things really stood out for me making this a stand-out of a film:1) HONESTY: Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal really pulled this off. I wasn't expecting performances so real and nuanced, and was warmly surprised. Kudos, also, to Mr. Lee for making such a poignant and refreshingly honest film!2) STORY: Great story-telling. In fact you're not actually being *told* a story. The story unfolds and the viewer watches what happens pulling you in. What a great experience! In fact, I want to experience this story again -- I'm going to look for the short story.3) NUMBING: In a thought-provoking kind of way. I left the theatre digesting the story even as I sat on the streetcar thinking about the characters. I cared for them, and wondered what could/might happen to them after the screen went black. My mind was playing out scenarios and in that sense, it was numbing, in a thought-provoking, emotionally heavy way.This is powerful cinema and is definitely worth checking out. It's the best Ang Lee film I've seen to date (I've seen most, but not all of his feature films).",10,1189,1624,12 September 2005
Capote," Capote -- wonderful opening sequences
","Overall, this is a good movie with some good acting moments and strong narrative. It was refreshing to watch the Capote character (wonderfully played by Philip Seymour Hoffman) come to life. In fact the opening sequences of the movie do a great job in setting the visual and period tone of the movie -- you quickly get a sense of societal views to blacks and gays in the 60s US. Very important given this is a historical piece that takes an in-depth look at the case and events leading to the writing of Capote's book, 'In Cold Blood'. It's told with suspense and holds the audience easily to the end.There were allusions to a 'love story' between Capote and one of the characters. I would have liked to see this aspect of the story fleshed out a little more, but still, there was enough in it to make its point.Overall, this was a good showing with a strong narrative, entertaining character interactions, and strong acting. I haven't read 'In Cold Blood', but for those who are interested in this, or of seeing a slice of Harper Lee's on the screen, this would be worth seeing.",8,18,35,12 September 2005
