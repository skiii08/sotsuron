The Ring," Everyone shall suffer...
","I'm not really a horror movie buff.I usually get scared most of the time,however I can handle a few scary films.But from the first few minutes of this movie I could tell that I was going to have nightmare's for months.And so I was right.There was probably five minutes of the entire film that I wasn't scared or covering my ears.Before I watched it,It seemed as though every single person in my class had seen it.They told me it wasn't THAT scary.When I finally turned it off,I wouldn't answer any phone calls nor I would look look at a T.V. for a week.Yes I'ts THAt scary in my opinion.If you want to look at disturbing imagery,a creepy,gruesome little girl killer come slithering out of a T.V. and tear an innocent person apart with her bare two hands GO AHEAD.",5,0,0,22 July 2005
Corpse Bride," Still Smiling at Burton's Talent...
","I gotta tell you.Animation films these days are just getting better and better.Tim Burton's directing and vision succeeds once again.For almost the whole movie,I could tell everyone in the theater was enjoying it.Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter were fabulous voices,the music and songs were just right for the mood,and the story was actually quite different from The Nightmare before Christmas.Altogether it made an enjoyable,clever and funny movie,that I think you will want to see over and over again.Take your friends.Family or relatives to see this classic movie.Trust me you will NOT be disappointed.Or at least I wasn't disappointed",10,220,329,3 September 2005
Edward Scissorhands," A fantastical masterpiece
","I have always loved watching Tim Burton's movies.His unique style is incredible,the way he visualizes his story's are great and the actors and actresses and crew he chooses are just perfect for his films.The story of Edward is truly amazing and is his best movie up to date.Jonny Depp plays an excellent role as the creation of a man who had scissors for hands because the inventor died before he could adjust the hands,Danny Elfman's strange Gothic music score is just right for the mood and the production designing by Bo Welch was again different and rather comical but fated the movie very nicely.I could go on for ever about the wonderful things about this movie but I won't.It's emotionally touching and beautiful-10/ 10",10,1,1,6 July 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Apparently I was wrong...An unexpected surprise
","I just saw this film in theaters and it was a LOT better than I thought it would be.When I first saw the teaser trailer for this I thought it would be terrible.Depp looked as though he imitated a version of Michale Jackson and the acting and directing looked pointless.Apparently I was wrong.Why the original movie probably was so popular was because Gene Wilder did a superb job as Willie Wonka{mind you I didn't like the it that much}.But you can definitely tell that this movie was done by Tim Burton.It was sort of different-strange but at the same time it was enjoyable and funny.The oommpa loompa's{or however you spell it} were however a bit too over the the top, and Willie Wonka's character didn't really suit the movie too much.But aside from that.It was smartly done-8/10",9,12,23,15 July 2005
