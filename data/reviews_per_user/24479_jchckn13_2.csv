It," Effective blend of emotional content, dark humor, and freaky material
","Blew away my expectations in a great way. I've never left the theater feeling this way about a horror movie. It was able to blend disturbing elements, dark humor, and creepy material almost seamlessly and it never did so without purpose for the story.There were moments where I felt the scene only happened for the sake of making a scare, but the plot made its connections effectively.The movie had a lot of genuinely amusing dialogue in it, which is what made it funny at times. The cast was fantastic and the characters were very well-developed and enjoyable; a rare element for films of this theme.There were hair-raising moments of terror in the film as well as a few uniquely effective old-school jumps scares, and these moments were spread throughout the film evenly.The character-driven narrative was easily one of the best I've scene in the genre and was fairly emotional at times.Overall it played as a fun and focused horror film with laughing, crying and screaming mixed together nicely. I highly recommend this movie if you can handle kids swearing and dying, excessive gore, and clowns with other freaky images.",9,5,13,9 September 2017
The Conjuring 2," An outstanding horror movie that is unrelentingly terrifying with some very clever surprises, but it also had a lot of heart
","The Conjuring 2 benefited greatly from strong supporting characters to outline an outstanding paranormal story. James Wan has delivered very effective shock scares and surprises that typically do not show up as heavily in other horror movies. The family, including Ed and Lorraine, are put into an eerie environment while not letting clich√©s take hold of their decisions. They supported one another, cared for each other, and didn't make dumb decisions that would put themselves in unnecessary harm's way. This element made the movie very enjoyable and absorbing.Now, with that said, the scares were much more effective. The tension of likable characters being in danger helped make the jump-shock moments feel more 'well-earned' rather than 'cheap'. Most of these moments came as a surprise, which I thought was almost impossible at this point, but James Wan continues to surprise me with his genius camera tricks and clever twists on where the typical jump scare would be. In addition, the atmosphere set up was very realistic, making the effect on you even more intense.If you like horror movies even a little bit, you will LOVE this movie. The intense scares are so worth it given the superior acting and themes represented among them.",8,1,4,13 June 2016
