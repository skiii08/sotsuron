Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Kill I Save II
","Let me set the stage for you.  My kid's away at Boy Scout Camp so my wife and I decide to go out to a movie.  'What will we see?' we ask each other. And so my wife comes up with the great idea 'Let's go see Kill Bill Vol. II. Now, I have enjoyed 2 or 3 Quentin Tarantino films in the past and this one was no exception. But then I got the bright idea of going to the video store and renting Kill Bill Volume I figuring, 'That picture was pretty good. Wouldn't it be great to see the first and then be up on the whole story?' Well, I needn't have bothered.  While the first volume of was a waste of time, the second film was a fun homage to a lot of films of the '60s and '70s and even '40s and '50s, the first film was nothing more than an excuse for some truly idiotic and gory violent scenes.  I never understood anyone having a love for the grindhouse movies, particularly those of the 1970s. However, Tarantino loves those things and it is totally lost on me.  My advice is to avoid the first part altogether unless you just like idiotic, bloody and utterly idiotic fight scenes every few seconds.  I still don't see what was so great about that Japanese rock band (The 5,6,7,8's) singing with their bad accents.  I didn't even think those chicks were so 'hot.'The one thing I will give to Volume I is an entertaining and witty fight scene between Uma Thurman and Vivica A. Fox just before the school bus arrives, but that's about it.  Of course, you might get a little confused with the end credits of the second part is that many of the people shown in me end credits are not in Volume II",Null,1,3,2 June 2004
Casablanca," Of all the classics in all the films in all the world, this is the best!
","This is a film that MUST belong in every video collection in the U.S. is not in the world. The stories about it's making are legendary from the constant rewrites to the apocrypha of casting stories.What is amazing to me, and the reason I believe it holds audiences almost spellbound in successive viewings, is the connection with the horrors of World War II was almost every single cast member.  Sidney Greenstreet had lost a son in combat, and a number of the cast members fled Europe to escape the ravages of a Hitler regime.  Even the evil Nazi character Major Strasser (played with relish by Conrad Veidt) had left Nazi Germany to escape  almost sure internment and possible death in a concentration camp. Here was a man who was a legend in German film history as the murdering somnambulist (a possible warning about the Nazi soldiers to come?) and because of the vicious anti-Semitism and racism of the Germany of the '30s and '40s, we in America and in Hollywood were given a great gift.Everyone in this film is fabulous, but it is the chemistry of Rick (Bogart) and Ilsa (Bergman) been truly holds the film together.  When I saw this film almost frame by frame in the limited book series of classic films that were produced in the late 1960s, I was stunned by the subtlety of facial expressions that conveyed so much of Rick Blaine's character by a marvelous actor Humphrey Bogart.  There is a reason why he was named the actor of the century.While every person in the film becomes a real flesh and blood presence, the story of Rick and Ilsa is the center of this cinema feast.I must confess that I have seen this picture so many times that I can recite every single line in the movie to the consternation of my wife who can't watch it with me anymore. The line that sticks out the most for me, and which against cheers from New Yorkers whenever it plays in the theater.  It is when Bogart says to the Nazis seated at his table, 'There are parts of New York I wouldn't advise you to invade.'  And what makes this line so memorable is that Humphrey Bogart did indeed star in another motion picture for Warner Brothers where that very thing formed the basis for the script.  That movie was 'All Through The Night.' I love this movie too, and I'm not even a New Yorker.There have been many attempts to revisit 'Casablanca,' but only the original makes you really feel what it was like to live through 'The Good War' in a faraway place like Casablanca in French Morocco.Even  though such trickery as midget airport workers, fog machines and cardboard cutout airplanes were utilized, this film convinces through its beautiful story with many layers, and characters that are so well realized.If you've never seen this movie before, shame on you and see it immediately. If you only seen it once, I believe you will come back to it more than once. This is just about the most perfect film ever made and it is a miracle that that is so considering that there were so many hands in the pie.  (Excuse me for my mixing my metaphors.  It's late, and I get emotional just thinking about this classic film masterpiece.)Play it again and again and again and again, Sam.",Null,177,229,11 August 2004
MASH," I heard a rumor there was a TV series with the same name but...
","Of all the movies of the 1960s, this by far is my favorite. A perfect example of a movie scrript that is so much better than the book. (Read it at your own peril. It is deadly dull and understandable why it was refused by so many publishers.)I was in Vietnam when this movie was released and the military almost stopped it from being shown in military theaters, but fortunately, we had a decent Supreme Court then and it survived the ordeal. Thank God, because this is a movie classic that was really about Vietnam when no one was allowed to make movies about Vietnam. Unlike the TV counterpart, this MASH was as cynical as it should have been, and the characters were real with incredibly memorable lines like that spoken by Margaret 'Hotlips': Houlihan, 'I wonder how a degenerate like that ever reached a responsible position in the Army's medical corps?' to which Father 'Dago Red' Mulcahy replied 'He was drafted.' Korea like Vietnam was a war in which the U.S. meddled in what was essentially a civil war, and in that they were the same more or less, but this movie's war was no different in the respect of the way the Army looked at their own soldiers. It's okay to send them off to be ripped apart by bullets so long as they had the medical staff to patch them up and send them back to the front lines. Naturally, the men would be cynical and hard-bitten.And while the military would not have allowed the long hair and Fu Manchu mustache of an Ellitt Gould, the film, I believe, makes the point that young people of that time were as much soldiers as any in combat. It also I think was done this way as a wink and a nod to this really being a movie about Vietnam. For me, Donald Sutherland and Elliot Gould will forever be THE Hawkeye and Trapper John. (It's also interesting that Pernell Roberts when playing 'Trapper John, M.D.' looked more like an older Elliot Gould than an older Wayne Rogers. I wonder if that TV exec or producer preferred the movie to the TV show.) I must have seen this film about a dozen times when it hit Tan Son Nhut AB RVN and refused to see Patton when it played at first, because I knew that IT was put there to counteract the anti-war sentiment of MASH. Which is also interesting to note that the author of the book didn't like the anti-war sentiment of either the film or the TV show, though I don't believe he ever sent back a single royalty check.I resented the softening of the Radar O'Reilly character on the TV show even though the same actor played the part both times. I STILL do. I liked the innocent looking yet, wickedly playful Radar of this film. Damn his grape Nehis.This is not to say I hate the TV show. I just wish the producers had sold the actors as different characters in the same MASH unit. Then it would work for me. I will admit to loving Colonel Potter but hating the insipid character of Cpl. Klinger.After all, 'This isn't a hospital. It's an insane asylum.' I couldn't agree with you more, Major O'Houlihan. War is Hell and insane. and this movie proves it while showing the military with all of its lack of compassion for the very soldiers it sends to fight them or patch them up. God forbid they should see a movie that tells it like it is.MASH rules, and anyone who does not see it as a great movie either never lived through the 60s, or just doesn't get it. War is not supposed to be fuzzy and warm with a laugh track. And there are so many elements of the film that gave it far more edge than any TV show would have allowed. The best thing Altman has ever done and I don't think he will ever top it.",10,5,12,29 May 2005
The Shining," Not to be overlooked but....
","Jack IS the film. Let me start by saying that i am no fan of Steven King, but the fact that Nicholson is ion this one, makes it more than worth seeing. For all you King fans who whine about it being different than the book, DUH! That's what Hollywood does. But it only helps. The problem with this film is that the mother (Shelly Duvall) and the kid (Danny Lloyd) are so damned annoying by their bad acting and that women's bug-eyed histrionic whining of hers that I was rooting for Jack Torrance to get them with the damn ax.I almost wish one could take Rebecca DeMornay and Courtland Mead from the miniseries and put them in THIS one. There is a particularly beautifully done scene that literally had me on the edge of my seat in the maze of hedges at the Overlook Hotel. Just the fact that Kubrick found a way to go from a shot of the miniature of the hedges to the actual hedges was just mind blowing for me. And the changes from the book (pay attention Steven King Fans) were GREAT! This made it a surprise even for those who had read the book. I won't give away the surprised for those who have not yet seen the film.Anyway, there are some genuinely frightening scenes in this horror epic and it still beats the hell out of the crop of slice and dice films calling themselves horror today.",7,1,3,3 November 2007
Big Fish," Suddenly I love fish!
","I won't even attempt to describe the plot of this wonderfully imaginative film. Many here have already done a splendid job of that. Suffice it to say that this story about a man's failing relationship with his father and trying to make the last opportunity before he dies to set things right is a magical adventure and a sweet ride. I even love little touches like seeing familiar set pieces from other Tim Burton films (the town from Edward Scissorhands and the egg cracker, for starters.) Granted. Burton can be a tad weird as a person, but no one can deny (although some people with no sense of whimsy or imagination have tried) that he is a genius of a storyteller, and here he does it better than he ever has before. This is Burton's 'Citizen Kane.' All the elements come together like a river flowing into the ocean of one's imagination. This big fish must be caught and let go for the next lucky viewer. And if you see it and don't like it, I would see a doctor about a personality transplant. Metaphors can be incredible things when employed just right. Tim Burton comes up the right bait and reels us all in, and we're glad to be caught off guard by his fantastic film-making prowess. See it and make it your new favorite film of all time.",10,0,1,3 March 2005
Groundhog Day," Deja-Vu All Over Again...and again...and again...
","I have said many times before that what makes a film classic is a re-watchability. 'Groundhog Day' ironically qualifies many times over. Bill Murray is just sensational as the ultimate curmudgeon who learns to change because he has to. Andie McDowell is not my favorite actress, but she truly shines in this romantic comedy classic. Now I could nitpick about somethings in the film like, like, 'How the Hell did he learn ice sculpture in such a short time?' but comedy is the ultimate suspension of disbelief genre, but I still would like to know who did those fabulous cultures, the credit you rarely see you in end credits. Even Chris Elliott who usually annoys me has his moments. heck, I even liked the pairing of Rick Ducommon and Rick Overton (the latter with whom I have had less than warm moments) has two mildly lovable drunks. if you have never seen the movie before, and you like clever and engaging comedies, I can pretty much guarantee that you will fall in love with this movie unless you are as cynical and the earlier Murray character in this classic. See it. Buy it. See it again... and again... and again... and don't wait until February 2nd.",10,1,3,12 February 2005
Thor," Marvel's original superhero Thor didn't have a beard.
","Except for this, I loved this movie. But I can't say it doesn't make me crazy. The casting is right... the story fun and riveting and the special effects superb. But what makes me nuts is Marvel catering to later generations of fans by making a black Nick Fury and ignoring the Peter Parker/Betty Brant romance and skipping right ahead to Mary Jane. Noe there is another Spidery pic with changes I don 't like. I am referring to an absence if J. Jonah Jameson. WTF? I am a connosseur of Marvel Comics going back to its beginnings, mind you.Still I did love the movie and look forward to seeing The Avengers movie.",7,0,0,10 May 2012
The Godfather: Part III," Eli Wallach and Joe Mantegna make this worth watching.
","I was fortunate to have been given a copy of this film before its release so I knew the story beforehand. Like the two films that preceded it, the story is based on real events and people. In this case, the Vatican and the mysterious death of Pope John Paul I. At this point, Michael Corleone is striving for a clean life in business as a philanthropist but it seems that they pull him back in. Eli Wallach is a.competing Godfather who Connie wants to deal with personally, Michael suddenly gas a half brother with his own violent agenda who is the collegiate son of Sonny Corleone and just as hotheaded. On top of this, he has it in for Joey Zaza, played expertly by Joe Montegna. Unfortunately, Sofia Coppola is absolutely amateurish and dull as Michael's daughter. The problems in this movie really.get in the way towards the end which.seems to go on forever. But, as I have mentioned, Eli Wallach (whom we just lost at 98) and Joe Mantegna make it all worth the price of admission. That, and a stunningly heartbreaking end scene are the high points of this epic.Al Pacino actually gives a measured performance as well. So to those who say this film 'sucked' your less than objective criticism is what sucks.",7,1,2,25 June 2014
