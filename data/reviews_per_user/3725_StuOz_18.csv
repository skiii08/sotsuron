Blade Runner 2049," Visually Wonderful But Far From Perfect
","Sequel to 1982's Blade Runner film.To make things clear at the start, I consider myself to be a massive science fiction fan, but I don't actually consider the original Blade Runner to be as wonderful as everybody makes out. There is nothing wrong with it but I personally don't like that dark, grim and nasty look in movies (the exception being 1989's Batman and 2008's The Dark Knight).So with that in mind, I guess I can't really be called an expert on BR 2049? But just to give my two cents worth on the subject, I would not call BR 2049 bad but I would not call it good. It probably would have been a better film if it just lasted about 90 minutes, instead of three hours. In fact, I got so sick to death of waiting and waiting for Harrison Ford to appear that, after about 90 minutes or two hours, I felt the need to press 'picture search' on the DVD so I could get to the point in the flick where he finally appears. But having said all that, all the later footage with Ford is just fine and wonderful to look at. So do see this movie, but don't be surprised if, like me, you feel the need to press 'picture search' on the DVD after a while. But once again, this review is coming from someone who was not too bit on the original Blade Runner so...",Null,0,1,4 May 2018
The Maze Runner," Ordinary People In An Extraordinary Situation
","Lads are trapped in a mysterious maze.I never expected this to be as good as it is! The Hunger Games is fine but this is better!Ordinary people stuck in an extraordinary situation...I am am sucker for movies/TV shows of this type. An Asian hero as well as an American hero here! Times have changed in Hollywood films!However, I was a bit turned off by the CG creature that attacks the lads...maybe I have just seen too many sci-fi movies to get taken in by such a monster...all monsters seem to look alike these days...give me a stuntman in a rubber monster costume any day?I love the ending, I love the retro musical score, the casting is outstanding, an all round good sci-fi thriller!",Null,1,1,15 May 2015
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Okay But Too Many Unknown Characters
","This is what happened just before Star Wars Episode 4: A New Hope (1977).This contains some wonderful moments with Darth Vader and a CGI version of Peter Cushing, it is worth a DVD rental for these things alone. It also begins so well with a wonderfully filmed sequence that lingers in the memory. But the bulk of the flick just does not feel like Star Wars as we see all these unknown characters.The Force Awakens (2015) made such an impact on me that Rogue One sort of felt like left overs after a wonderful meal. And the fact that this film was made at all seemed like over-kill of the Star Wars series...one film every three years is fine, but a flick every year is too much!In a word, Rogue One is just okay.",Null,1,5,3 January 2017
Interstellar," It Starts Cooking When They Get Into Space, Then...
","People travel through a wormhole.There is a view that any science fiction fan who does not like this film is just too thick to get it. Well, I have spent endless hours enjoying every episode of Star Trek (TOS, TNG, DS9) and 2001 so I don't think that puts me in the 'too thick' basket. And I am not saying I don't like Interstellar, I just think it is a very over-rated flick and the first 60 or 90 minutes of it will put you to sleep.However, once they get into space, the film starts cooking, for a while, then it all gets too confusing for words.Interstellar is not helped by the fact that the characters (with the exception of the oddly shaped robot) just do not appeal to the viewer. Yes, I know the 2001 characters were not that thrilling, and many will say it is all about the story, but I just think they could have found a more interesting bunch of characters to fill this l-o-n-g movie with. Perhaps the problem is not with the film but rather with me, I am very retro in my science fiction tastes. I would have been more happy if the above mentioned robot spent the whole flick saying: 'Danger! Danger! That does not compute!'(Lost In Space-style). See Interstellar for the film's second half and DVD picture search the first half.",Null,1,1,28 November 2016
Dark City," Twilight Zone-ish Gem
","A man has flashbacks of his past.This actually gets better and better with repeat viewings. It could best be described as a big, big budget Twilight Zone episode!The care and attention to detail that went into this production was incredible...I should know...I was an invisible extra in this film (at night I walked down some stairs in the area of Sydney Australia known as The Rocks).The cast, the costumes, the sets, the editing, the music and the story all come together to create a movie you will never forget. I still work in the Australian film industry today and I still bump into film-people who fondly remember that amazing movie done in Sydney called: Dark City.",Null,2,3,12 October 2016
Independence Day," A Knockout!
",Earth is invaded by aliens.1996 was the year of the alien invasion movies: Mars Attacks! and Independence Day. MA! was a comedy and ID4 was sort of straight but they were both fun flicks about aliens invading earth.Perhaps a less talked about element to ID4 is the wonderful doomsday music that plays when the massive ship starts to hover over earth before the attack. Today's movie-makers don't seem to bother with that kind of well played music when a film like this is made?ID4 is a knockout from beginning to end...so don't pay too much attention to those critics who take it too seriously.,Null,1,2,11 October 2016
2012," The Movie Begins Well Then...
","The world ends in 2012.It begins so well with the president of the USA being warned of danger to come. Other early scenes are just as well done. When the street falls apart I am on the edge of my seat. But as with many block busters of this century, we get totally stupid action scenes that turn a once semi-realistic disaster movie into a cartoon movie! They could have done better with the casting of the lead actor and the full-on CGI gets on my nerves. This is worth watching only if you have nothing better to do.",Null,0,2,20 July 2014
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Okay Movie
","Luke Skywalker is back, but has turned into a grumpy old cynic.
 
This movie is way too long and I did not care about several of the characters. Also, after nine movies the whole premise and battle scenes all seem a bit tired and worn out by now. But it is all worth watching for the great ending, Mark Hammill's acting and great set design using the colour red.In a way, it would have been best if the whole saga, and I mean every Star Wars-related saga, just ended at the end of 2015's The Force Awakens. With the death of Solo and the appearance of Luke.This would have left some unanswered questions about Luke but science fiction always leaves unanswered questions. It has come to the stage where I am not even sure if I will bother seeing the next Star Wars film...and I never thought I would say something like that.The Last Jedi is just okay.",Null,1,3,21 December 2017
The Dark Knight," The Joker Is Back
","Batman is back, this time up against The Joker.I love nearly all the various versions of Batman, from the B&W 1940s movie serials to the Adam West Batman series, to the 1990s stuff to these Christopher Nolan films.I must admit on first viewing I did struggle with Heath Ledger's take on The Joker, he was just so different (and younger) to the 1960s Joker and the 1989 Joker. But after a while I came around to loving Ledger's Joker!But having said all this, there in an uncomfortable grim feeling to watching the film today as most of us now know what Ledger went through to make this film role so good. This is the second Nolan Batman movie, the first one was just as good as this but the third one was very hit and miss. However, all three movies must be seen and enjoyed.",Null,0,1,12 October 2016
2001: A Space Odyssey," Music And Science Fiction
","A strange object is found on the moon.See it on the big screen! To all you young people reading this review, don't watch this movie on whatever portable device you use to watch movies with, that type of screening is all wrong for a grand VISUAL epic like this. See it on a large screen with the lights in the room switched off. Also, 2001: A Space Odyssey is a lot slower than any other sci-fi flick ever made...so don't expect explosions and smart ass characters. Once you understand that, you will like it.To me at least, music is a vital element to film, no sci-fi movie is totally complete without a good musical score, so obviously I am very happy with 2001 as the score is indeed one of the characters of the film.Has there ever been another 2001? Try watching the first season of the 1970s sci-fi series Space 1999, mainly the pilot titled: Breakaway. I can't confirm this fact, but I think someone told me that the two productions were so alike that Kubrick was considering legal action against the British producer of the series, Gerry Anderson.",Null,1,3,8 September 2016
Titanic," A Movie Everybody Must See
","The famous story of the Titanic is told.So much has been said about this movie, what can I add? I guess the first thing that springs to mind is the timeless appeal of the film. When I saw it a few times in 1997 there was question in my mind about the timeless element of the flick...would I still love it so much 20 (or 19) years later? Well guess what, I do.In fact, in some ways I like it even more now. Since 1997 has there been a movie where the production crew have actually built large sections of a massive ship just for a movie? And what about the wonderful musical score! Do we get scores like that today?Titanic is a movie everybody must see before they die as I don't think Hollywood will ever make a movie like this again.",Null,0,4,11 October 2016
War of the Worlds," Sci-Fi & Disaster
","There is something special about this film...my three viewings of it have brought huge joy. The original War Of The Worlds (1953) will always have a place but there is room for another version where the alien ships have towering legs and the score is done by John Williams (you must hang around for the end credits as the pumping old- fashioned Williams score finally plays without actors talking over it).Instead of the usual guy and gal we see in these block busters, it is father and kids. The three main players perform very well however during the early parts of the film before the lighting strikes it is a bit of a struggle to see Tom Cruise playing the concerned father (too soap-like). But once the 'storm' appears we just go along with the thrill ride...once that alien craft appears it improves!War Of The Worlds is a sci-fic movie, a disaster movie, an action movie, a movie about a family, a military movie, and a movie that shows that CGI effects are not always a bad thing when used the right way. And, as I mentioned before, the old-fashioned John Williams score is a knockout, it has shades of overly-dramatic Williams music done for producer Irwin Allen in the 1960s and 1970s. In a nutshell, War Of The Worlds is how a block buster should be made, you are in the hands of true movie-makers.Added note: Australian viewers might be interested in an early scene in this film when Oz is mentioned in casual conversation.",Null,2,5,30 August 2007
Kong: Skull Island," The Monsters, The Cast, The 70s References - Love It
","King Kong is back in....1973.I am a middle aged guy who often goes for the retro or retro-style of Hollywood epics. When 'Skull Island' was first advertised I just refused to see it in theatres,
thinking it was just another angry, too fast paced CGI flick for 16 years old boys - was I wrong about this movie! I love it.One of the best science fiction films of the 2010s, the CGI effects are fine, the cast is outstanding and the retro feel is well done.A great movie for all ages.",Null,0,0,26 June 2020
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Outstanding And Hard To Describe
","A hard movie to describe.A very hard movie to describe and review. I have always been big on the 1989 Batman movie so this sort of feels related to that, because Michael Keaton was in both. Also, I love the way this film attacks those mindless action block busters Hollywood makes these days.But there is so much more to it than what is said above. Those who describe it as another version of Hitchcock's Rope are really missing the point.Birdman is a movie I wish to re-visit every few months, and that does not happen much with me and 21st century movies...I can't even decide what genre I should define it with. Basically, this makes you feel like you are behind-the scenes of a Broadway show, you will love all the characters, you will love the script, and after a few viewings you will even love the ending. Outstanding!",Null,0,0,13 February 2018
Speed," Great Thriller With A Disaster Movie Feel
","A bus loaded with passengers has a bomb on it.A mixed group of people trapped together in a deadly situation. There is a guy with a hidden gun, the nerd, the cute woman, etc. Does this sound like a disaster movie? Yes, but people always label this flick as an 'action thriller'. Well, who cares, call it what you will.But just to back up my point even more, that scene where Reeves talks down the alarmed passenger with the gun, and then some other passenger jumps in to save things...well that sort of moment was done in several 1970s disaster flicks (for example 1970's Airport).Keanu Reeves, Dennis Hopper, the suspense of it all...Speed is knockout movie that you will want to see again and again!",Null,0,1,11 October 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Hollywood Awakens
","The first Star Wars film since 2005.Hollywood awakens! Great movies are still being made after all! The third best Star Wars movie after A New Hope (1977) and The Empire Strikes Back (1980).Seeing this film in a theatre in December 2015 really reminded me of my 1970s/1980s youth when I saw the original three movies. I don't think I will ever forget that feeling of walking out of the theatre and feeling like I was in the past. I think it was seeing Luke Skywalker at the end that really got to me, it gave me something to look forward to in a couple of years as it was obvious that Luke would be a key figure in the next film.But having said all this, I must admit that I made an encore screening of this film a few months later and I was less pleased with it, but don't read too much into that, maybe it is a movie you only see once and that is it?So thanks for the memories, thanks for the drama, thanks for Harrison Ford, I will never forget December 2015...and Star Wars: The Force Awakens.",Null,2,16,12 October 2016
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A Knockout
","A film that needs no introduction, a film I have re-watched an estimated 300 times in my lifetime, a film with a wonderful score by John Williams, also Darth Vader is great, the whole cast is fine however I never warmed to the two robots like everybody else did (which partly explains why I like Star Trek more), but still a knockout block buster! The five films that came after were all fine, and the great John Williams scores kept coming, but the others will never compare to A New Hope.Trivia: the origins of Darth Vader date back to a 1949 Columbia movie serial - Batman and Robin - which also had a deep voiced guy in black (The Wizard) making trouble. One 'chapter' of this serial is even titled: 'The Wizard Strikes Back' (sounds like The Empire Strikes Back).",Null,0,1,23 July 2014
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," A Must-See Movie!
","The second movie in the series.I fine film however I always liked the first 1977 flick the most.In my childhood I never liked Yoda as he always seemed to be exactly what he is: a muppet who can't stop talking! And the romance between the main characters sometimes seemed corny.But all the space battles are outstanding, all the stuff with Darth Vader is a knockout and John Williams does some of his best motion picture music ever!A must-see movie, however the next film, Return Of The Jedi, is very hit and miss.",Null,0,0,10 October 2016
