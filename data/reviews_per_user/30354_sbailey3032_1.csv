","The King's Speech is one of the best movies for 2010. After King George V, death and the abdication of his brother the King Edward VIII; the man who would become the next King is sent to see a speech therapist for his speech issues. With stammers on his speeches and in every day public, was suddenly crowned 'King George VI' of England. With help from an eccentric speech therapist, Lionel Logue, the two have become very good friends; all the up to Lionel's death. The King's speech is a wonderful movie, that needed to be told. A movie which people in ways could relate to. From stammers to being an outsider, this movie Will touch you in ways you never thought would.",10,0,1,8 February 2014
