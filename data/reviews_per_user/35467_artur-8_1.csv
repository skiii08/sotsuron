The Blair Witch Project," comments
","I don't understad whats all that hype all about  7.6 out of 10 ??? This is paranoia. This movie is total crap, makes no sense, boring, awkward, just some kids running around the forest with camera. Big deal. I should have spent my money on a hamburger or something else. Instead, I came out of the movie theater with a big headache (camera effects) This is what good marketting can do - sell crap and make big bucks.",1,2,3,14 September 1999
