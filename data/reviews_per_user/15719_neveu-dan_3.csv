Hereditary," Straight Up Nightmare
",When this movie started I found it really slow. I think I was expecting the usual jump scare horror movies. Once I realized this is an old school 70's style horror movie I started finding myself loving it. This movie is a slow burn and the visuals are simply amazing. It is part horror movie part are film. It reminded me of Suspiria and rosemary's baby...not action packed jumpscare a minute but still will leave you really uneasy throughout. I loved it,8,0,2,13 May 2019
Aquaman," Just a bad movie
","Just an all around bad movie. Really cringy dialogue throughout, bad cgi to the point that it just looks like they are standing in front of a green screen most of the time and just overall a really boring slow movie. I think the non stop superhero movies are starting to take their toll and this is what we get. Skip this movie at all costs",1,1,4,10 April 2019
Saw III," Awful
",I liked the first Saw...Saw 2 was not even watchable. This one is a bit better then Saw 2 but still awful. The plot is so predictable you'll know the ending within the first 20mins of the movie. And the movie is just plain boring. Granted there are some good gory scenes but they are thrown in parts where the movie is slowing down and I can't help but feel like they were thrown in because the script was so lame they needed to keep people interested. And get ready for 20mins of flashbacks just to make sure the audience knows what is going on.....nice idea but it just gets annoying. Unless you are comepletely retarded or 3 years old you will need these 20min long flashbacks that basically just insult your intelligence. People in the theater I was at were literally yelling ' WE GET IT ALREADY' at the screen .Seriously guys rent this one.,1,2,6,29 October 2006
