Casablanca," Superb!
","I can't recommend this movie highly enough.  If you're in a position to see it in a proper cinema, then make every effort to do so, as the subtlety of the lighting and set design doesn't quite make it through on video...There's not a single element of this movie that I can conceive of being improved upon.  The casting, direction, acting, score, lighting, script... All mesh together simply perfectly in a way I've never seen on any other movie.  Bring tissues - I'm a fat, cynical, 40-year old Scotsman, and I still cry every time I see it. :)",10,2,2,21 May 2002
