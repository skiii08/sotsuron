The Equalizer," Even better than I thought it would be!
","Most of the reviews on here seemed pretty favorable to this movie, but there were only a handful of reviews out seeing that the movie hadn't been released yet, and there were a couple of reviews that made me a little weary. But my wife's favorite actor is Denzel Washington so I decided to take her to see it opening night.To my surprise, I found this to be one of my favorite movies of 2014. The characters do a great job drawing you into their world. The Russian gangsters are great and the main bad guy is awesome (you know, in an evil bad guy way). Of course Denzel is incredibly engaging, but even the other characters are well done and draw you into the world.From the trailer it looks perhaps a little hoaky with the whole girl asking about the book he is reading, and some of the dialogue from the trailer makes you think this movie will be clich√©, but I found that they did a good job developing the characters and those scenes.If violence bothers you, don't go see this movie. But if you like a great, engaging action-drama movie and you want to see Denzel whip up on the Russian mafia, go see this!",9,51,105,26 September 2014
