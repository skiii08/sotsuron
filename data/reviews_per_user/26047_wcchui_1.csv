Hereditary," Masterpiece of mise-en-scène and well encoded mythological symbols
","A absolutely well directed film in terms of everything, couldn't find much to blame with. Although this may not be a good film for passive audience. Negative comments in majority focused on its script being slow-paced and boring. With out a doubt Hereditary does not include huge dynamics and dramatic scenes, but it is absolutely saturated in terms of how many message and symbols are encrypted through mise-en-scène. Not defending the director but slow paced storyline and editing does serve a purpose to give audience enough time to read all these rich informations in the background. One of the biggest different between films made before and after the French New Wave is about editing which construct the pacing of the film. Never wanted to use the word 'spoiled', but just failed to find another word to describe audience being extremely passive after quick editing started to happen in cinema. Comments of this film being hugely differed hugely by that person being in a passive role, or an active role who constantly decode its mise-en-scène. This film have so many information told by props and sound which demands some time to think and process. Would like to see audience going back to the cinema, watch it again but this time try to be active when there is no dialogue.Cinematography is absolutely stunning if anyone have studied cinematography and photography. As a example of mise-en-scene being extremely important in this film, models made by Annie (Toni Collette) in the very beginning of Hereditary served as a metaphor to hint audience that the whole stories and the fate of this family is entirely controlled by higher dimension which explained the first scene that audience perceived as a transition to model house to reality, but at the end of the story we are able to find out that it hinted that there is a evil that have observed them and manipulated everything so easily just like how Annie have entire control on how she wanted her artworks to look like. There are a lot of articles that have already gone through these hidden messages, I believe reading these articles online may help understanding and to appreciate the film more.One more thing is that I think that the ending of this movie deserve more appreciation and credits, not only twisted the whole storyline, create fear through Annie cutting her own neck, but also criticised patriarchy in religious especially in the bible. Being born as a female is so wrong that they have to kill Charlie but Paimon dosen't mind staying in a female body or at least it didn't try to kill itself in Charlie's body but other female followers just assumed that it is not right. Also it is interesting to see the Christianity being challenged by hinting that Christ is the king of devils/demons and this is also mentioned in some censored part of the Holy Bible.Cinema worth.",9,2,5,24 June 2018
