Hereditary," The real inner fear
","I Was 12 when i saw the Exorcist. Since then no other movie could match the inner terror i experienced.
Till now. 30 years later i am feeling the same deep painful horror that i could not imagine could happen.
From the most impressive soundtrack to the real dimension of all the characters, this movie makes an outstanding breakthrough.
it gets deep into your skin, crawling slowly to your mind. There's no place for hope or rationality.
It keeps playing in your head in a loop because the aftermath it's more powerful than the initial experience, as a shadow that doesn't go away.
it's said and done.
See you back in another 30 years.",10,1,3,11 January 2019
