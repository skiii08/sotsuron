Ford v Ferrari," So Good, You'll Cheer on Ford Over Ferrari.
","Released in the U.K. and other markets under the far better title, Le Mans '66, Ford v Ferrari is an exhilarating biopic telling of Ford's attempts to challenge and outdo the beloved cars of genius Enzo Ferrari in the world famous French 24 hour motor marathon.Seeking the prestige of the Ferrari badge, Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts), is humiliatingly rebuffed in his attempt to buy a controlling interest in the Italian motor manufacturer. In a fit of pique, he orders his executives to create a car that can turn the tables on Ferrari. Retired racing car driver now designer, Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon), is engaged by Ford executive Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) to do just that. Shelby in turn recruits the cantankerously bloody-minded British racing driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale) to put his foot to the floor and hopefully secure the chequered flag. The project is to be overseen by Ford Senior Vice President Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas).The film is centred on the dynamic between Shelby and Miles, their awkward relationship and history of confrontation ameliorating as they are both driven, no pun intended, to achieve victory. Their efforts are constantly frustrated by the unhelpful and self-serving Leo Beebe following his own agenda.Direction from James Mangold (Walk the Line) and cinematography from Phedon Papamichael are both first rate. The racing scenes are truly immersive and you smell the octane. Screenplay from the British pair Jez and John-Henry Butterworth with American Jason Keller, never gets bogged down in technical detail, it simply allows the story to flow, a story so engaging that the running time of two and a half hours never flags; it's not just for petrol heads. And it says much of Matt Damon's progression as a film actor that he easily holds his own in his many scenes with Christian Bale. Irish actor Caitriona Balfe as Miles's wife Mollie provides a strong foil to her husband's headstrong ways.Is the film slightly formulaic with stock characters? Maybe so, perhaps. Henry Ford II is shown as a bombastic bully, Leo Beebe an unctuous Uriah Heep-style sycophant. But when all other aspects of a film come together, who cares? Besides, most people love pantomime villains. And whether unwittingly or not, the film shows that maverick genius needs the boring business acumen and the politics inevitably attached to succeed. Both Shelby and particularly Miles are shown as pretty hopeless in their business dealings, neither would've got a car anywhere near Le Mans without the bean counters from Ford. The film is also mercifully free of modern day political analogies, concentrating instead on telling its tale without distraction.I have a feeling this film will become a perennial public holiday favourite.4.5*",9,3,6,17 November 2019
World War Z," Film by Committee
","Melbourne has not always been the dynamic and thriving multi-cultural metropolis it is today.Prior to an influx of peoples from Mediterranean countries, it was, by all accounts, something of a staid and dull Anglo-Celtic enclave, closed at weekends. When Stanley Kramer filmed the apocalyptic Melbourne-based film On the Beach in the late 1950s, its co-star, Ava Gardner, was quoted as stating that 'Melbourne was the perfect place to make a film about the end of the world.' It's now widely accepted that the story is erroneous and the delightful Ava made no such disparaging remark – not publicly anyway. However, the sentiment stuck as at the time it had a semblance of truth about it.It seems just as appropriate therefore, that in making a film about zombies, Marc Forster, should deem it fit to base the action in Wales. Sadly, it appears that this was the best and only good idea anyone behind the film ever had.A vehicle for Brad Pitt, who co-produced, the film barely contains any new idea or stroke of inspiration. This is film-making by numbers, giving the impression it was made to order by a committee of middle managers.The opening, all too familiar scenario, of Brad Pitt as Gerry Lane, a retired UN 'investigator', now a happily domesticated full-time father, being reluctantly dragged out of retirement for one last job in exchange for his family's safety really set the hackneyed tone for the rest of the film.As zombies worldwide infect the population through biting, desperate UN officials assign Lane as protector to British doctor Andrew Fassbach who it seems is the only person who might be able to detect the cause of the outbreak and thus discover a cure. After the early demise of Dr Fassbach, it falls to Brad Pitt, apparently with no medical training, to take over his work and save the world. It's a zombie film, I wasn't looking for realism, but, please, there are still limits. Besides, the North Koreans already seemed to have the perfect answer. Over a 24 hour period, they simply set up a program whereby their 23 million citizens had all their teeth extracted – no teeth, no biting, no infection. Simple.The scenes of mass panic with the zombie undead attacking panicking humans and piling themselves up against fortified walls in order to breach them gave the impression that this was a film based on a graphic computer game.The film appeared to be without subtext or purpose and it was difficult to retain interest or care about the participants.There were some humorous moments, though whether these were intentional or not was hard to gauge. But at least it provided the audience I saw the film with several laughs.The acting, the direction, the cinematography are all ordinary – I saw the film in 2D. The script is below par. The end clearly set the film up for a sequel and I'm since given to understand that two are planned. Whether they materialise remains to be seen.",5,3,6,9 July 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Enjoyable Hokum
","Does this sound at all familiar? Captain Kirk is insubordinate, disobeys orders and is demoted from his command. An emergency then manifests itself; Kirk is reinstated to his former office and sent on a dangerous mission with his loyal crew only too happy to have him back. There are then a series of adventures, setbacks and plot-twists as the film-makers toy with the audience, keeping them in suspense as to who might be the real baddies and who are the good guys.This is a romping and thoroughly enjoyable action film which is full-on in its run of over 2 hours and never allows any lull in proceedings. This is augmented by terrific CGI special effects, as you would expect. Don't expect to be bored at any stage of this visually spectacular film.But it fails to make the transition to 'classic of its genre'. The film's main weakness is the casting of Chris Pine as Captain Kirk. That he is easy on the eye is pretty much beyond dispute, but therein lies the problem. He does not convey the inner gravitas for the role he plays here. You can't understand how he could have risen to command in the first place, let alone been considered worthy of reinstatement following being stripped of that status. It's not helped either that were he to get in a fisticuffs with Justin Bieber, you'd be hard-pressed to know who you'd put your money on. The producers clearly want him to develop a Butch and Sundance style partnership with offsider Spock – the highly effective Zachary Quinto. But it's not working. I have no wish to be unnecessarily harsh on him – he has previously acted well, convincing as the feckless son in Bottle Shock. I just feel he needs a few grey hairs and some laughter lines, an indication that he's lived life and known disappointment.Benedict Cumberbatch has a clear run as the arch-villain John Harrison/Khan. He is flawless in his portrayal of an evil man seeking to wreck the world and stamp ruthlessly on anyone who prevents him from getting his own way. Still, Benedict went to Harrow School so I imagine that he was given the perfect education for such a role. (Yes I know that's a little unfair – Churchill went there too). Simon Pegg returns as Scotty and is given a series of one-liners which were a little over-laboured and failed in the cinema I attended to raise much of a laugh. Zoe Saldana also returns as the headstrong Lieutenant Uhura and interacts well with Spock with whom she is romantically involved.Take a couple of glasses of wine into the cinema when you go and see this film and you should enjoy it greatly.",8,2,6,3 June 2013
Lion," Not for the Cynical
","Lion is the story is of a very young Indian street boy (Saroo) separated from his mother and brother and falling into destitution after an involuntary train journey of 1600km takes him to the Bengal area of India where a different language is spoken. His life turns around when he's adopted by a loving and wealthy Tasmanian couple (Nicole Kidman, David Wenham) and flown to a new life in Australia. The film skips 20 years and we find Saroo, now played by Dev Patel, a happy and well-educated young man on the brink of a promising adult life. But a minor incident causes a flashback and he becomes obsessed with finding his original family to the detriment of his career and Australian relationships.The direction is solid and acting good - Nicole Kidman and Dev Patel particularly; the story rarely falters. Most films are manipulative to some degree, and Director Garth Davis occasionally lays it on a bit thick. But when you leave the theatre and find you're in a majority of the audience with swollen red eyes, who cares?",9,8,14,22 January 2017
American Hustle," American Hustle is a grand success at nearly every level
","The 'based on a true story' we so often see at the beginning of a film has been a recurring Bête Noire of mine for some considerable time. I have argued before that the licence it gives to film-makers is open to the widest interpretation. It is a specious use of language. It allows writer and director to re-frame events, dissemble, misrepresent people, and, if challenged on points of veracity, hide behind the fact that it was never claimed to be a truthful recall.The Butler was one of the biggest culprits in 2013. This film was based on THE true story rather than A true story - whatever the difference of the definite article might imply. The only problem was that most of the major events portrayed in the life of Cecil Gaines never happened – his mother's rape; his father's murder; his son in the Black Panthers; his son killed on active service in Vietnam. All poppycock.So David O. Russell's wonderful American Hustle had me on-side from the outset with its tongue in cheek advice at the film's beginning that 'Some of this actually happened'.Set in the 1970s, Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) is a con man skilled at depriving the needy from cash they can ill afford to lose. Not wishing to restrict his activities to the lower socio-economic demograph, he sells forged art works to the well-heeled as a lucrative sideline. Joining him in these activities is the seductive erstwhile stripper, Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), who poses as a royalty-connected member of the British aristocracy to give the operation some class. Their ill-gotten trade is broken by federal agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) who then turns the couple in order to ensnare corrupt politicians on the take whom he wishes to expose and incarcerate in furtherance of his career. DiMaso's inordinate ambition is hampered only by his lack of tactical nous as he has to rely ever more on the wily Rosenfeld.American Hustle is a grand success at nearly every level.The ensemble cast appears to be without a weakness: Christian Bale, with a heavy paunch and comical comb-over, always suggests that he is far more in control then he is letting on; Amy Adams, about whom I was scathing as the demure Lois Lane in Man of Steel, is pitch perfect as the cleavage-showing Siren oozing sex appeal – her ability to separate salivating men from their dollars was all too believable; Bradley Cooper with another comical hairstyle, this time a tight-knit perm, clearly enjoyed his role as the obsessive and flawed FBI man; Jeremy Renner as the well-meaning Mayor, Carmine Polito, (collateral damage in Cooper's crusade) came across as an oily and cheesy lounge singer as a reminder of an era before professional spin doctors homogenised the political class; Jennifer Lawrence as Bale's trailer trash and manipulative wife, aware of the lien she holds over her estranged husband, gave a fantastic performance of tragic comedy. An uncredited cameo from Robert De Niro exuding septuagenarian menace was the cake icing.Direction from David O. Russell was consistently fast-paced with no lulls in its 138 minutes and without ever being confusing. The cinematography and editing were first rate.It would be nit-picking to mention that the excellent 70s soundtrack was occasionally just a little overblown.But what raises American Hustle well over the bar is its screenplay from David O. Russell and Eric Warren Singer. Humorous throughout, the film has several laugh out loud moments while also delivering both dramatic impact and thought provoking concepts. As Christian Bale becomes ever more ambivalent about what he is being forced to do, he very deftly leads the audience to share his growing but tacit realisation that sometimes an end can very much justify the means. That the film is bound to have a final twist is never in doubt. If, when it comes, it is not totally innovative or unsurprising, quite frankly – who cares? The producers of American Hustle can start hiring the limos for Oscar night.",9,10,27,12 December 2013
Man of Steel," Superior Story Telling
","It can be all too easy to find massive plot-holes in most movies. I have a simple take on them. If they don't occur to me when I'm watching the film, then they're of no relevance.If a movie interests me, grabs my attention and entertains me, then I simply won't notice them as the film has me hooked. On later reflection, if I suddenly realise the implausibility of one or several scenarios, I'll shrug my shoulders, think it didn't bother me at the time so why should it now? I imagine that along with most people, it's only when a film is dull and fails to engage, that I sit in a theatre and shake my head at ridiculous developments.Man of Steel is riddled with plot-holes. Machine gun riddled. It has more holes than the Japanese flag following the Battle of Iwo Jima. You could plough a tractor through its holes. But I failed to think of one of them as I sat enjoying its good story telling.Actually, come to think of it, I did spot one very early on in the piece but quickly forgot about it. Jor –El, Superman's father played with good pitch by Russell Crowe, is in the throes of getting his infant son off the doomed planet Krypton. He dives into the sea, swims down a water channel through a glacier into a chamber holding the Codex – a skull-like object which holds the DNA of one billion Kryptonites (or is it Kryptonians?) He makes off with it. Straight away it struck me that there was very little security surrounding this recorder of Krypton life – no barbed wire, no infra-red rays, no unbreakable glass surround – not even a couple of minimum wage Group 4 Security guards. I imagine Sir Don Bradman's bat and baggy green cap has greater security at the Bowral Museum in Australia's outback than Krypton's biological memory.So with the Codex, Kal-El/Superman – soon to be Clark Kent, is jettisoned toward Planet Earth in a space-age Moses basket and the adventures begin.Being the first film in this re-boot of the Superman franchise, it is clearly required to spend some time setting up its characters and establishing its identity. But it does this not at the expense of moving the story along and never gets bogged down in background detail.On current evidence, the injection of humour is not high on the producers' agenda. And why should it be? Those behind this franchise appear to have confidence in their project and are not embarrassed to be telling the tale of Superman, despite a reluctance to name him so – even the 'S' symbol on his suit is explained as the Krypton for hope. The need for Roger Moore 007 one liners with a wink to the camera is not to be their style. The film in concept bears much similarity to the most recent Batman series, undoubtedly the influence of British film maker Christopher Nolan who was the driving force behind Batman and was instrumental in the development of this re-vamped Superman. Despite the lack of jokes, it never becomes pompous or overblown in its own importance.Henry Cavill who up till now is probably only best known for the roles he nearly but didn't quite secure – James Bond, Edward Cullen – seizes his opportunity and excels in the lead role, exuding boyish charm as the young Clark and square-jawed determination as the cape wearing super hero.Overall, the cast was effective although Michael Shannon as chief villain General Zod is slightly underwhelming and I would have liked to see Amy Adams display greater gravitas as Lois Lane – she was just a bit too demure to be convincing as a hard-nosed investigative journalist. Hopefully she'll raise her game for the sequels.The action scenes and CGI were impressive – I saw the film in 2D and, as with The Great Gatsby, a few shots were a little askew betraying its dual format.One more feature of the film is its religious symbolism – there's probably more Christian allegory than any film since The Narnia Chronicles. Russell Crowe is shown mostly as the spirit of Jor-El, living on after his physical death; Clark Kent refers to his '33 years on this planet' - 33 being the number of years it is widely believed Christ was on earth; General Zod appears to be an incarnation of Satan – his battles with Superman determining whether good or evil will triumph over the world. And the most blatant example was Jor-El on a spacecraft imploring Kal-El to return to earth with the words 'You can save them son, you can save them all' at which point Superman holds his arms out as if being crucified and falls through space down to the blue planet below. Had I paid more attention in Sunday School all those years ago, I could probably have picked up further visual metaphor. The film does not preach and I doubt this aspect will impinge on the enjoyment of card-carrying agnostics.The film is a marvellous start and I hope the sequels will expand and develop.",9,5,10,9 July 2013
Yesterday," Tunes and Cinematography Share the Honours
","Despite pre-release Australian reviews for Danny Boyle's Yesterday being decidedly underwhelming, it had a full house at the large theatre at which I saw it on a Sunday afternoon. Apart from a few young shavers, In my fifties, I was at the youthful end of the watching demographic - there were several blue-rinses.Yesterday tells of The Beatles becoming wiped from history after a 12-second world power outage. A young and unsuccessful songwriter from a sleepy English seaside town, Jack Malik (Himesh Patel), is seemingly the only person now alive who knows of the band and their catalogue, having received a concussion at the precise moment of the power cut. After realising he's not victim to a large scale meta joke, that The Beatles really have been expunged from memory in this parallel universe, he starts 'composing' their songs, ultimately to be lauded as the world's greatest songwriter. But does it bring him happiness and love?The idea is great, the execution less so.Screenplay is from Richard Curtis who seems to have been on auto-pilot during its writing. His CV in the last 30 years is beyond impressive, but we all have off days. Its well-worn and simple premise of guilt and unacknowledged love ran very shallow, its jokes often laboured.And too many of the support characters are plain annoying and irritating rather than endearing; sadly, the usually marvellous Sanjeev Bhaskar as Jack's Dad is the chief culprit in this regard. An extended support performance from Ed Sheeran stretched his limited acting experience beyond credibility.Likewise, in his first big screen outing, Himesh Patel as the film's star had difficulty imposing himself. His delivery of the Lennon-McCartney and Harrison songs was, however, generally impressive, a lack of tone only occasionally showing.Cinematography from Christopher Ross was first rate, the concert footage especially so. The mainly English locations showed that country in a good light - including a brief montage of Liverpool's exceptional civic architecture.The film is inoffensive, the soundtrack exceptional (does that need saying?), but ultimately extremely lightweight. But it's always going to be worth seeing for the tunes.",6,1,4,30 June 2019
Behind The Candelabra," Great Fun, Sad Lives
","The New York music critic, Lewis Funke, described Liberace's piano playing as 'sentimental as possibleall showmanship topped by whipped cream and cherries.' To the critics and discerning musical audiences,Liberace was little short of the Anti-Christ – a sort of talented André Rieu. But like Rieu, Liberace was unfazed by the vitriol that came his way. He gave a large swathe of the public – mainly blue rinse women of a certain age - exactly what they wanted, made no apology for it, and profited handsomely. Famously he responded that, upset at the criticism, 'I cried all the way to the bank.' He later amended this to say he went on to buy the bank.More serious for him was any implied suggestion that he might be 'a fruit' as homosexuals were then often disparagingly called. In 1959, Cassandra in the British Daily Mirror,described Liberace as being '...the summit of sex - the pinnacle of masculine, feminine, and neuter. Everything that he, she, and it can ever want...a deadly, winking, sniggering, snuggling, chromium-plated,scent-impregnated, luminous, quivering, giggling, fruit-flavoured,mincing, ice-covered heap of mother love.' Liberace sued for the implication and won the case, perjuring himself in the London High Court by denying his sexuality. It seems incredible now that anyone could have been in doubt as to Liberace's sexuality. Times were different then and by the mores of that era, Liberace had to ensure that his loyal fan base was deceived. Were the truth to have emerged, his career would have been ruined and he liable for criminal prosecution.Behind the Candelabra, as the title suggests, looks at Liberace's rather seedy and debauched private life from the 1970s when he was in his late 50s. His career had long since peaked but he could still command massive fees and audiences for his Las Vegas shows full of chintz, glitz and glamour. The film follows a standard, slightly old-fashioned, biopic formula not so different from The Glenn Miller Story of nearly sixty years hence. It details Liberace's relationship with a much younger man who he inveigles into his life as chauffeur, secretary, companion and lover, eventually and inevitably boring of him and moving onto someone new and younger. Neither of the main protagonists, Liberace (Michael Douglas) or his young lover Scott Thorson (Matt Damon), present as sympathetic figures –Liberace is portrayed as a manipulative ogre, petulant and spoilt in a manner unique to someone to whom nobody ever says no. Thorson is a chancer and user, happy to live a useless, lazy lifestyle as the toy-boy of a wealthy golden daddy, stealing from him as his drug habit spirals out of control. What raises the film above the ordinary is an ensemble cast whose acting and delivery without exception is supreme. Michael Douglas gives a pitch perfect portrayal as the ageing lothario. In the few scenes showing Liberace performing, he radiates the man's stage presence and charisma, contrasting his far from edifying off-stage persona. Douglas's miming of piano playing is also good though not always well synchronised.It is unfortunate that the film was not released to theatres in the United States, showing only on television, thus precluding Douglas from receiving an Oscar nomination which would be well deserved. Matt Damon, although far older than Scott Thorson at the time of his relationship, matches Douglas nicely as he moves from youthful naïvety to embittered and worthless gigolo. I've been less than kind about Damon's acting in the past when he did little more than recite lines. But he now seems incapable of putting in anything other than a strong showing. Though the film concentrates on Douglas and Damon, there is still plenty of opportunity for great cameos from a few well known faces. Dan Ackroyd has fun as Liberace's manager; the veteran Debbie Reynolds likewise as the devoted mother. Funnier still is Rob Lowe as plastic surgeon to the stars, Dr Jack Startz. Lowe's face is pinched, taut and lifeless resembling an Afghan Hound,personifying the specious vanity in trying to hold back the years. If Steven Soderbergh is to be believed, this is his last film after a 25 year career as a director. Should it be that he has lost the passion and has nothing more to contribute, then so be it. But I hope that proves not to be the case. Soderbergh has made some great films since his debut with Sex, Lies and Videotape; earlier this year his thriller Side Effects was a fine example of that genre. Let's hope he has a nice sabbatical and returns refreshed. Hollywood can ill afford to lose his talent.",7,0,3,5 August 2013
1917," Technically Brilliant, Emotionally Flat
","Much has been made of 1917's cinematography which, through very skilful editing, makes it appear that the film is shot in one continuous track. It's done extremely well, although there is a very clear, deliberate and unambiguous break slightly over halfway through.1917 is the latest film from director Sam Mendes, who co-wrote the script with Krysty Wilson-Cairns. Its story is of World War 1 lance corporals Schofield and Blake (George Mackay and Dean-Charles Chapman) who are commanded by General Erinmore (Colin Firth) to run a message to a battalion of 1,600 men to call off an attack the following morning which will result in their massacre.The film takes on the character of a portmanteau piece as the two messengers run into each episodic scene before moving on to the next one. Some of these scenes work better than others. And it has the drawback of too many shallow cameos from actors unable to bring any depth to their part. The one exception to this is the excellent Mark Strong as a gruffly benevolent and politically-savvy captain who clearly knows the best way to keep his men alive is by being supremely efficient at his job.The plot has soap opera elements to it - lance corporal Blake is told his brother's one of those about to be slaughtered. And there's plenty of contrived happenstance; suspension of disbelief is sorely tested more than once. The lingering doubt that the mode of delivering the message isn't perhaps the first option that would come to mind is never really dispelled. But perhaps the film's main failing is its emotional sterility, only at the end is it moving.Sir Sam is a director of deserved renown whose two recent films for the Bond franchise, Skyfall and Spectre, are amongst the best of that canon. And his skill as a director is shown in 1917; despite the negatives it remains a film with some great merit. I feel Sir Sam has simply allowed technical wizardry and the bait of Oscars to take precedent over storytelling. He's a good filmmaker. He has more good work inside him.",6,3,9,12 January 2020
Elysium," Lacking in Motivation
","Elysium is the follow up, much anticipated by many, to the critically acclaimed District 9 from South African-Canadian director and writer Neill Blomkamp.In the middle of the 21st Century, with the world now grossly over-populated and law and order seemingly at breaking point, the super wealthy have decamped to a satellite space station highly visible from earth, a utopian society free of poverty, illness and other such mundane woes.Meanwhile, the vast majority of earth's population lives in squalid, cramped slums seemingly based on the Favelas of Rio de Janeiro. Needless to say, the rich are all too keen to protect their enclave and any unauthorised vessels arriving from earth are duly dispatched by being blasted away.Jodie Foster stars as Elysium's ambitious and sociopathic Defence Secretary, as ruthless at advancing her own interests as she is at ensuring the purity of the over-sized Ferris wheel whose security is in her charge; Matt Damon is the working class drone desperately trying to access the other world for the treatment to cure his radiation sickness from which he will die in 5 days.There was clearly an interesting concept waiting to burst out here, an opportunity to explore themes of wealth, inequality, social status, health care and immigration, but sadly it failed on almost every level to build interest or have anything relevant to say.First, we saw so little of the societal structure or way of life on Elysium itself. Apart from Jodie Foster and a few other high ranking officials, the film showed us nothing of how this satellite was run. It looked as if everyone lived in a McMansion style-home – the type you find next to golf courses in Florida or on the Sunshine Coast. It all looked terribly sterile, reminiscent of the contrived town Jim Carrey inhabited in The Truman Show. We were not privy as to who cut the lawns, did the plumbing or washed the dishes. Superficially, the lives of these pampered people seemed hollow and totally unfulfilled – where were the galleries, the museums, the theatres or even a casino for those that might like that sort of thing? Frankly, the impoverished life on earth which was shown with enforced work in a fascistic environment seemed far more fulfilling.Further, Matt Damon's motives for getting on Elysium were totally selfish. All he wanted was to save his own skin. Granted, there was then concocted an unconvincing love interest and a wish to save his childhood sweetheart's little girl but this too was just parochial. Where was the burning anger borne from social injustice, the wish to better the lot of all humankind, the working class warrior on a mission? And when the film's final denouement came it was head in a sick-bag time.The script and dialogue were banal, as was Jodie Foster's delivery. Matt Damon worked harder to bring some interest to his character but he was up against it – but at least he tried.The CGI was good – but that's pretty much a given in any well-funded Hollywood film these days. Close up camera work was appalling, non-stop wobble vision which made action sequences confusing. This camera style is so unnecessary and it really is beyond comprehension as to why film-makers persist in its use; in small doses it can be effective but when near constant it produces a feeling of nausea.It is so disappointing to be relentlessly negative about a film but when they are as lacking as this one, the positives can be hard to find.",4,431,689,16 August 2013
The Wolf of Wall Street," Morality? You Be the Judge
","It has been a major criticism of The Wolf of Wall Street that its main protagonist, the anti-hero, Jordan Belfort (Leonardo Dicaprio) is not seen to truly get his come-uppance. There has been a suggestion that the film is a glorification of his lifestyle and practices, that it, through not outwardly condemning them, tacitly supports them.Such moral condemnation of literature and film is hardly new. The now largely forgotten Somerset Maugham – the most popular writer in the English language for much of the first half of the Twentieth Century - often faced similar criticism. Maugham's response never wavered. It was not his job as an author, he would state, to set the world to rights. He based his characters on people that he knew. He wrote of, and embellished, their faults and shortcomings. It was for his readers to make their own judgements and determine what was right, and what was wrong.Director Martin Scorsese and scriptwriter Terence Winter seem to have adopted a similar line. They have simply told their version as they saw it: the story of a man corrupted by greed whose habit was fed by those who were only too keen to invest greedily in schemes where they thought they could make a quick, easy buck. It is ironic that many of those who now complain Belfort is portrayed too sympathetically were those investors prepared to do anything to get money apart from work for it. If Scorsese's film has a moral lesson, it is that people should not be seduced by the thought of soft profit. I suspect also, that Scorsese is of the opinion that nothing much has changed since the balloon went up with the GFC, that the fault lines remain in place for history to repeat itself. Wasn't it Sir Winston Churchill who stated that the only thing history ever teaches us, is that nobody ever learns from it.So I would recommend you go and see The Wolf of Wall Street and make your own judgement as to its morality – don't rely on others to make that judgement call for you. It is a great piece of film-making which runs solidly for three hours during which the pace never slackens or dulls. It fascinates for its whole duration. Direction, script and cinematography are all spot on and the acting complements it well.Leonardo Dicaprio is always at his best when playing larger than life characters and here is no exception. His charisma oozes from every pore and is essential to his characterisation – what conman was ever successful by being dour and self-deprecating? His skillful piece of acrobatic acting as he opened his car door with his foot when out of his mind on Quaaludes was laugh out loud funny.The rest of the cast also rise to the occasion and there is a wonderful comic cameo from Joanna Lumley, as Belfont's aunt by marriage, whose major scene with Dicaprio is great fun, very much a highlight. Special mention also to Australian actor Margot Robbie as Belfont's second wife who holds her own opposite Dicaprio and never lets her accent slip.Two criticisms – one more serious than the other.The debauchery and female nudity were overdone. The solitary scene of a musical band of bare torsoed men seemed to be a contrivance and inserted simply to deflect such criticism. Much of the female nudity seemed only there for male titillation.And a minor criticism of the otherwise excellent Jonah Hill, as Belfont's sidekick Donnie Azoff. Azoff was clearly a near chain-smoker. Yet Jonah Hill never looked comfortable holding a cigarette and was obviously faking the inhalation. Smokers (and ex-smokers) easily pick up on this and it's a distraction. Odd that the many, many scenes of coke snorting looked wholly realistic.I have my doubts as to whether The Wolf of Wall Street has the gravitas to become a classic, but it is a highly enjoyable romp giving a good snapshot of the 'greed is good' culture which remains with us and is surely lurking, ready to bite with even greater effect next time round.",8,2,4,1 February 2014
Macbeth," Strong Adaptation
","Studying Macbeth at school, I recall not being convinced when an army camouflaged itself with trees to bring Birnam Wood to Dunsinane thus enabling the witches' prophecy. For me, it always conjured an image of the Dad's Army platoon on manoeuvre in an English wood with twigs in their helmets. I doubt my rejection of this plot device ever caused Shakespeare to turn in his grave.Nonetheless, director Justin Kurzel seems to share my misgivings. In an innovative way he adapts the text to improve greatly this scenario; it is cinematically spectacular while simultaneously bringing with it the portent of death. No spoilers, but it's a highlight of a film which is very well-paced and quite deliberately, with this exception, relentlessly dour in its approach – no glamour, no humour. The cinematography is subdued, the acting understated. It couldn't be further removed from Olivier's glorious Technicolor Henry V which, for me, remains the greatest screen Shakespeare.

The Great Gatsby," Cinematic Hyperbole a Matter of Taste
","There is a key scene in The Great Gatsby, your reaction to which will probably determine whether you love it or not.For the first 30 minutes the eponymous Jay Gatsby is a missing enigma. Teasingly and tauntingly you see him fleetingly in long shot through a far distant window; there are a few close ups of his right pinkie sporting an out-sized signet ring; he is gossiped about, alluded to and referred to, at ever more frequent intervals so that, just like the shark in the original Jaws, his presence becomes greater and more intense by the very fact of his absence from screen.And then it happens. We gate crash one of Jay Gatsby's regular opulent parties. The grounds in West Egg are overtaken by the whole of New York society, clearly aware that mass ostentation is the only rule of attendance. The camera draws us upon him. As Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue builds and bursts in its sublime crescendo, The Great Gatsby is suddenly there before us, smiling inscrutably, raising his cocktail glass in salute as the night sky behind him is suddenly aflame with the greatest firework display ever seen outside of China.If you sit in your chair, mouth agape, goose bumps covering your whole being, silently lip-syncing 'WOW!!!!' you will undoubtedly love the whole film. If, on the other hand, you consider this cinematic hyperbole to be, well, perhaps just a teensy-weensy bit over the top then this may not make your Film of the Year shortlist.For this scene neatly encapsulates Baz Luhrmann's whole take on this enterprise. The film is, to all intents, a cartoon. Live action maybe but a cartoon nonetheless. Gatsby's palatial mansion with its fairy tale turrets and fountains is straight out of a 1940s Disney animation; New York and its hinterland of The Valley of Ashes look more like Batman's Gotham City and even the flashback scenes to World War One's Western Front appear to have been lifted from the 1980s comedy satire, Blackadder Goes Forth. The film gains nothing from being in 3D and having seen it twice I preferred the 2D version, although a few shots were a little askew betraying its dual format.There is not a shred of subtlety or nuance to be found in the entire 143 minutes. That is not Mr Luhrmann's style. Indeed, I imagine The Great Baz waking up in a cold sweat in the middle of the night in a momentary fear that someone, somewhere might just be able to draw their own conclusion from a scene he believed he had nailed down to be totally beyond interpretation. It is his film and you will see it his way or not at all.Leonardo DiCaprio pretty much nails Jay Gatsby; it's the sort of role in which he excels, for Dicaprio always looks like a movie star – a disadvantage when you try to play mundane but perfect for larger than life characters. The usually excellent Carey Mulligan however, whose haunting performance in Shame I rate as the best I saw all last year, fails to fire as Daisy. It's difficult to be convinced that she could motivate the intense love rivalry between Gatsby and Tom, played as a single note with a never ending scowl by Joel Edgerton. Tobey Maguire has the unenviable task of having to deliver large chunks of the film in narrative – a device which suggests Mr Luhrmann was unsure how best to drive the story.The soundtrack is deliberately anachronistic, modern day hip hop preferred to jazz. Quite what this is supposed to achieve is beyond me. F. Scott Fitzgerald himself coined the phrase, The Jazz Age, and the film's setting is crying out for a superior jazz score.The film never fails to fill the entire screen. It is a big film. It will not bore you. You may love it. You may not.",5,0,3,9 July 2013
