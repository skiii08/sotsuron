Skyfall," It was the Best of Bonds; It was the Worst of Bonds
","Do not miss the first 10-15 minutes of Skyfall. It's one intense and well-executed action sequence followed into another. Do not miss the middle of the film, for one extremely well-done, satisfying and unique casino scene.And, then there's the rest: A mixture of some taught drama, some not-so-taut drama, and some totally pedestrian and unworthy-of-a-Bond & nonsensical action scenes. Worst of all, the final battle of the movie is in one of the latter group: something you've seen countless times before in B-grade action movies with far less-important stars and characters.I've found it's a problem when a movie doesn't know how to play to its strengths and instead tries to switch modes: if you start playing drama too rigidly, your mind goes into 'analytical mode', and then when over-the-top action is presented, as a viewer you start noticing every technicality and lapse of logic. Skyfall suffers from that, and I largely place the blame on director Sam Mendes, who seems to linger and ponder just a little too long on many scenes. It also suffers from an inane running thread about him being 'too old'. Considering they signed Craig for many more Bond movies to come, this is a most curious plot contrivance, and totally unnecessary. They could easily have just extrapolated that his injuries at the beginning of the movie were severe enough to have physically damaged him. They didn't need to make this another Wrath of Khan with constant references to, 'Are you still capable, Mr Bond?' Were it not that Craig is still so engaging as Bond, and is supported by such great co-stars and characters (such as Ben Wishaw as the new Q, Naomi Harris, Ralph Fiennes and Judy Dench), Skyfall might rate a couple points even lower.Lastly, while the epilogue is certainly an interesting setup for the next film...you'll either feel a heavy case of deja vu, and/or that it's been a big, long 3-picture journey just to come full circle.",6,2,10,8 November 2012
Iron Man 3," Uneven, Surprising, sometimes disappointing, but ultimately quite intriguing
","For 3 films now, Marvel has taken a character which most people were not privy to and turned him into an A-list action vehicle. And they've done this with Iron Man by incorporating the best of the Classic IM comics (Gold/Silver age) and the modern 2000's IM comics. And in so doing, they've been challenging and surprising us consistently along the way. What Iron Man fan would've ever expected the speech that Tony Stark gives at the end of Iron Man 1 to go the way it did...in the FIRST film? Who would've thought that they'd actually find a way to realistically depict the 'suitcase suit' as they did in IM2? Or incorporate SHIELD so seamlessly (including its otherwise preposterous carrier, as in Avengers)? So, you have to really go into these Iron Man movies with an open mind, because you never know what to expect...and maybe never more so than Iron Man 3. Make no mistake: there is at least 1 character that is so drastically changed from its comic origins that it will likely upset a lot of fans. And it took me out of the movie for a few minutes while I tried to reconcile it with my own preconceived expectations. Ultimately, I'm OK with it, for the reason that I hope people think of the real world for a moment, and the parallel veiled political statement it makes.And this movie is filled with a lot of wry statements like that. It is even more of a 'thinking man's Iron Man' than the first movie. If you're a Golden Age IM comic reader, you really need to challenge yourself about what Iron Man always was: one of the deepest, 'thinking man's' comic books. Fantastic Four was crazy fun, Spider-Man was wisecracking action, Avengers all-out battle. So, on this note, I think Iron Man 3, for all it's ups and downs, actually delivers brilliantly.This is not a wall-to-wall action fest, but rather a character-driven dramatic ride that gives Downey, Paltrow, & Cheadle plenty of screen time to explore their characters. It's nice to see Rhodey get some real heroic moments this time, and Cheadle has now clearly taken ownership of the role, making us completely forget that 'other actor' who played the part the first time.There are laughs, there is suspense, drama, and yes some slow parts. But, Iron Man 3 certainly bakes its cake and knows how to pull it out of the oven at the right time for a rousing finale spectacle. And, this time, the inventive villains (which 2000's-era comic fans will know & enjoy) are a refreshing change-of-pace from the 'metal vs metal' of the previous two films.",8,0,4,4 May 2013
Interstellar," A Movie That Thinks It's More IMPORTANT Than It Is
","If you thought Prometheus was ground-breaking, thoughtful, scientifically-plausible sci-fi, you will love this. This is another hollow, vapid 'sci-fi' flick written by people who obviously don't love the category. They're so busy trying to explain everything, as if they're embarrassed by the very concepts they're presenting and don't want to be considered 'out there' and still want to hang with the cool kids.There are so many incredibly & laughably stupid and boring moments and decisions in this movie, that it is very hard to resist the urge to describe them verbatim. Understand, this is also hard to accomplish when the whole movie is staggered, Jenga-like, on plot twists.I consider Memento, Insomnia, and The Prestige to be Nolan's best films. Inception was overwrought and over-hyped, but enjoyable. I thoroughly enjoyed The Dark Knight Rises, even though aware of serious plot holes and a borderline-excessive runtime.For me, Interstellar is the worst of Inception (thinks it's more clever and important than it really is) and the worst of Dark Knight Rises (excessive runtime and damaging plot holes), without the fun or grounding of either.From its overdone, overlong opening on Earth, those 40+ minutes make you wonder how a movie named 'Interstellar' is ever going to get into space. McConaughey as Cooper is a former NASA astronaut, now just a farmer trying to sustain his crops, son and daughter in a near-future Earth wherein the planet is dying from a not-well-explained or illustrated depopulation and blight. It doesn't help anything that the actor has recently made those embarrassing Lincoln commercials and then to see him talking 'deeply' while driving a truck.Right from the outset, within mere minutes, the only thought that runs through one's mind is: Has Nolan forgotten how to edit his films? Seriously, the whole first quarter or third of the movie is just a very contrived setup for the space adventure that follows.As I stated, it's hard to be more-specific about the movie, and even certain characters and stars, without revealing key plot points. Cooper's daughter, Murphy, is a critical element of the story, as is the family home and (don't ask) the bookcase in her room. But, as much as the movie (or its makers) thinks that you're never going to figure out all of its secrets, they're actually quite obvious (if preposterous) just by knowing that everything is predicated on plot twists.There are some interesting moments when things move into space, and some scenes that resonate regarding the expansive loss of time (relative to that experienced on Earth) for the 4 travelers on a mission to find a new home. But, that connection those scenes make with the viewer are nearly instantly lost because they are nearly all intertwined with stupid writing decisions. Why only 4 travelers? How could they possibly have enough fuel to travel to so many places when earlier expeditions made 1-way trips to only 1 place? Why would the crew split-up unevenly? Why wouldn't Earth send 2 women and 2 men instead of 3 men and 1 woman, when there's a chance they won't be able to return? At least, in a worst-case scenario, if all survived, and they did find a sustainable planet that they couldn't return from, they'd be evenly-paired and (if 1 woman had medical issues) they'd have a better chance to sustain the species.You might think I'm nitpicking on this, but I assure you: this is something the movie itself gets you actively thinking about (species propagation) because of the 'Plan B' option of the mission. (Yes, it is referred to as such in the movie.) Perhaps, most crushing to a real sci-fi fan, the film plays extremely loose with physics and depicts worlds which are made less-interesting than they first appear. With the ice world, in particular, there is a concept about its construction which is suggested...gets your imagination running beyond what you're seeing with the special effects, and then that cool vision is very shortly robbed from you.And that, perhaps, is this movie's worst crime: Robbery. It robs you of your time, which is excessive but would be forgivable if it didn't also rob you of your soul and your imagination. Unlike a masterpiece of cinema like 2001: A Space Odyssey, which opens your mind and lets you ponder what is happening, Interstellar never misses a chance to tell you EXACTLY what it wants you to believe. Even to the very most revealing parts of the end. And, that the movie dares to suggest an opportunity for a continuance of the story...I'm sorry, this film was only slightly more intelligent and entertaining than the dreadful Transformers: Age of Extinction. As preposterous as that may sound, Interstellar is clearly cut from the same 'blockbuster cloth', without as much mindless action. As imperfect as Oblivion and Elysium were, they were at least attempts at 'thinking man's sci-fi'. This is really just a very flimsy father/daughter love story wrapped over to hide a bunch of sci-fi nonsense that its own producers were self-consciously embarrassed of....And then there are the robots. --The most inexplicable, ridiculously-designed robots ever to grace sci-fi cinema. There is a moment, in a scene set in a shallow ocean, where we suddenly see the full capabilities of the robots, but it plays a bit like R2-D2 actually having booster jets in the Star Wars prequels, but never having or using them in the chronologically-later movies. If you do torture yourself by watching the Blu-ray, have an extra laugh by watching the making-of documentary on how they articulated these implausible robots using practical effects.",1,16,30,5 April 2015
Man of Steel," MOS Tries to fly high, but his boots are stuck in lifeless mood
","While I've always been more or a Marvel fan than DC, I had some high hopes for MOS based on the recent trailers. It really looked like Warner Bros had successfully emulated the Marvel magic that Disney has been trotting out, blockbuster after blockbuster.And, for a time, MOS works. It's certainly not lacking in the casting department: I think all are just excellent choices, and all did the best they could with what they were given. Henry Cavill completely owns the role, just as Christopher Reeve before him. Amy Adams is a sweet, tough, smart and gorgeous Lois Lane.But, this is a seriously flawed movie, with drama front-loaded & rushed into the first half of the runtime, and the back half being a mindless monster-mash of invincible enemies fighting an equally invincible hero, amidst an overwhelming scale of destruction that makes you wonder, 'Just exactly what did Superman actually save or protect?' Unlike Iron Man 3 or Avengers or Thor, which gave us powerful heroes and chaotic destruction, but with a balance of well-written comedic relief and just outright ...moments to breathe, Man Of Steel grabs you, slams you into your chair, and keeps relentlessly punishing you into submission (especially with the thunder of IMAX and visual impact of 3D).It sounds like a good thing, and it surely looks the part. There are nice twists to the setup between the characters, especially between Lois and Clark; an inventive approach to his weakness; beautiful modernization of Krypton, his suit, his father, and so much more. The Hans Zimmer score is rather adept, considering the sidelining of the iconic Wiliams theme. So why is it all so...empty? I think it's because for that second half of the film, it's just immovable objects pointlessly smashing into each other (like the most disengaging parts of the action in the original Richard Donner Superman II). Imagine the tussle between Iron Man & Thor in Avengers, but played-out for 60 minutes instead of 5 minutes, without any fun quips. And, it feels so unpopulated, as if they couldn't afford enough extras. Whereas in Transformers 3's Chicago under siege, or Avengers' ransacked NY, it really felt like these were living cities being attacked, at times in MOS it feels like the only inhabitants of Metropolis are the handful of 'important' people at the Daily Planet.Add to that a very disappointing solution to the main villain, especially after the length & scope of battle. The only other thing I can say without giving anything directly away, is that you'll know exactly how much confidence Warner Bros actually has in this film, the franchise, and any related franchise, by how the end credits are handled.",Null,0,0,14 June 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," It was the Best of Spidey's; it was (almost) the Worst of Spidey's
","Here we are again: I wrote a similar headline for the similarly-frustrating Skyfall a couple of years ago. I didn't expect to find another overlong, hopelessly uneven movie I had such high hopes for this soon. Maybe I shouldn't say 'high' hopes: I had my fears going-in based upon the trailers and the abundance of villains, so my expectations were pretty well-metered before the opening scene. TASM2 is, at the end of the day, a fairly punishing, draining watch. Unlike the stellar Captain America: The Winter Soldier, which precedes it by just a couple of weeks and had me instantly wanting to see it again as the credits closed, TASM2 left me dreading the thought of ever sitting through it again...DURING the big battle scene in the final quarter of the film.Was it ever as bad as Sam Raimi's King of All Bad Superhero Movies, Spider-man 3? Thankfully, no. I WOULD watch this again any day over that fine mess. But TASM2 is just so up-and-down, yo-yo, through-and-through. There are so many great action sequences & web-slinging rides through the city, which really make IMAX 3D the only way to see this (if you're not going to heed my warnings). There are absolutely wonderful Spidey quips & small heroic touches ripped out of the comic pages just for you (I wont spoil these gems; they're part of the 'best of Spidey's I refer to). The interaction between Garfield & Stone as Peter Parker & Gwen Stacey is even better than the first TASM, and really seals their great love affair with a silly smile on your face. Also, I enjoyed the briefly-played, but well thought-out friendship between Parker and Harry Osbourne. Dane DeHaan gives a great performance (at least, before he rather abruptly transforms).But, amidst all that, we get the lamest villain origin in Electro since Jim Carrey as The Riddler in Batman Forever. Why did Jamie Foxx have to play Max Dillon as a total societal outcast, complete with overstuffed pocket-protector? And, considering how sleek everyone else who works at Oscorp is, how in the world did he ever get hired? If he's as intelligent as they make him out to be in very short, broad strokes, why is he ultimately such a painful imbecile? Add that dreadful portrayal to the big fight scene at the end, in a location apparently impervious to damage. Spidey swings his way to it in a few minutes with ease, but another character is able to DRIVE there through a city in a blackout gridlock in what would have to be comparatively LESS time. Immediately, you are able to sense the sucker punches to come as some of the absolute worst of plot-contrivances.Some people are commenting that Giamotti as The Rhino is the most interesting villain in the film, for all of his very brief scenes. I was not that enthralled, since his performance is so way over-the-top. But, it does showcase an element which consistently makes Sony & Fox & most DC films bad, whereas Disney Marvel & Christopher Nolan Batman films consistently shine: Rhino is a real villain. He likes to steal, has no shame in it, and he's just a bad dude.I challenge you to name a single other Spider-Man movie villain (from ANY of the five films) that isn't 'reluctant' or a victim of unfortunate circumstance. From Iron Man to Thor to Captain America to The Avengers, Disney Marvel films are unafraid to depict REALLY BAD GUYS. No apologies. They might be multi-layered, but that comes more from their general (twisted) belief structure, and less because life just handed them a raw deal.TAMS2 sets up a lot of threads for more big-name villains in the next installments. Here's hoping we get at least one with a character who with full knowledge and with no regrets, decides to 'don the evil'; because the 'villain takes unadvised serum or makes unadvised mistake'-routine is way last its prime in the Spidey films.",4,13,27,4 May 2014
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Amazing Balancing Act
","My initial thought as the credits rolled was: Not quite as good as the first Avengers, but...' And, that 'but' was immediately followed with 'I have to see it again, because there are more layers here that I wasn't able to completely appreciate and absorb' in the midst of all the depicted chaos.Sometimes, you just have to wonder what it really IS that people want. Do not buy the words of those saying that this has a thin story. While the basic premise is fairly simple, Ultron is a unique and fairly complicated villain. There are 3 other new characters (Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch, Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Quicksilver and Paul Bettany as Vision). While they could've had more development and screen-time in a much longer movie, they are solid enough to enjoy.Which leads to the summary title of this review: the film is really an amazing balancing act. I'm not sure how director Joss Whedon does it, but he's able to take a thousand moving parts, join them and make them interesting, drop wallops of action on top, AND even add dashes of subtlety that will bring you back for more. Which leads back to the beginning of my review: there are issues he throws out with ease around 'the responsibility of being a superhero' (the impact on what it means to their everyday lives), 'what it means to be a robotic slave', and even 'what it means to be a new type of AI'. None of these things are dwelt upon indefinitely, but this is the 'richness' that Whedon brings to his 'superhero cake'. It's not as deep in those tones as Captain America: The Winter Soldier was to 'the danger of government having too much spy power', but it's what makes the movie MORE than just a pile of punching and bashing.For longtime comics fans, the origin of Ultron and the Vision are altered somewhat...but in a way that I can't fault Whedon for. While I was maybe a little dissatisfied in the change to Vision, on counterpoint, there were a couple of really cool things done with his genesis. And Bettany in the full garb is another fantastic 'ripped from the page' embodiment of the comics. At the end of the day, unless they were going to spread the origin of these characters out across multiple movies, the way it is handled is just completely sensible from a point of narrative.So, while I still think that (for now) I'd rate Avengers: Age of Ultron a little below the first Avengers (which really was lightning in a bottle, and finally such magnificent proof that 'Yes, it IS possible to have so many heroes in one enjoyable movie')...I'm anticipating that successive viewings will eventually raise that score, potentially above the first. There's just so many fine layers to Whedon's Superhero Cake.",9,0,3,3 May 2015
The Dark Knight," 'The Dark Knight' should be named 'Life With Batman'
","This movie should be named 'Life With Batman', because by the end of it you will have felt like you've spent half of your life with Bruce Wayne & Co. I am really surprised that there are SO many glowing user reviews here. This movie has its moments, but it really is WAY TOO LONG & SELF-INDULGENT!!! I generally like comic books & comic book-movies, but Dark Knight really misses the mark for me. Someone should've had the courage to tell Christopher Nolan to reign this in a bit and trim things down. I had already set low expectations for this, as it is the usual over-hyped sequel. For a while the movie pleasantly surprised me and exceeded my expectations handily. Foremost, I did not expect Heath Ledger's performance to be as good as the hype. But, he definitely did pull off a brutal & realistic portrayal of a terribly disturbed psychopath. The scenes with Joker should have stayed. The 'extra stuffing' should have been trimmed (namely a whole mid-movie sub thread with Two-Face, and unnecessary exposition with Gordon & others).While 'Batman Begins' was a flawed but excellent movie, 'The Dark Knight' is a flawed but monolithic schizophrenic of a movie. From an early scene with 'copycat' heroes & villains, to bad Two-Face makeup & his unbelievable subplot; this is a movie that wants to be 'so Serious', but should take its own advice from Joker: 'Why So Serious?' --This was a problem that peeped its head out in the first movie (an incredibly realistic portrayal of Batman, marred by silly fantastical leaps-from-reality like 'remote control bats' to 'Batmobile indiscriminately crushing cop cars --the good guys-- to save his girl'). In this movie, these type of moments are multiplied 10-fold and really do a disservice to all the good scenes that ARE in the film.Performances are all up-to-par, with Ledger stealing the show, but Maggie Gyllenhaul really PALES in comparison to Katie Holmes. (What, did Cruise have her under lock-and-key like the tabloids say?) Katie is way cuter & sexier, and just a better fit for the role. Here again, in the utter sincerity of the acting, this just makes the end scenes with a hopelessly silly melodramatic plot device make fun of all those great Caine, Ledger, & Bale performances that came before it.I wish I could make my own cut of this movie. With some judicious splicing (and some large removals of Two-Face scenes), this movie could be a 90min wild ride with standout performances & great cat-and-mouse play between Batman & Joker. Instead, it's an overlong ode to Hollywood excess and over-indulgence that (in its end, although no were near AS bad) eventually reminded me of Spider-man 3's 'lost ways'.",4,12,33,19 July 2008
Elysium," Elysium isn't the Paradise of Movies, but it's Solid Entertainment
","Is Elysium the masterpiece of thought-provoking sci-fi cinema of 2013? No. Is it the masterpiece of action and spectacle of 2013? No. Is it terrible or a total letdown? No.And given that, it's a much more entertaining 'thinker' sci-fi than Oblivion, which was really trying too hard and overstuffed with convenient clichéd or fortuitous plot devices. In comparison, the only similar type of plot device that made me really groan was the defense mechanisms of the Elysium space station: a rather laughable construct used just to force the allegory of today's illegal immigration problems in the USA.Matt Damon and Sharlto Copley give strong performances as opposing characters. For the most part (except for a couple of brief scenes), continuity is maintained well for the deteriorating state of Damon's character's health. Their first battle has exhilarating staging.Personally, I really enjoyed Jodie Foster's full-tilt aristocrat, but I can see where some will be turned-off by her accent and execution. I think she pulled it off.Outside of the above, and where Elysium falls down a bit, is that no one else is very memorable. There's an underground resistance leader (Diego Luna) who's solid, but a bit of a cardboard character, and William Fichtner puts in a short deliciously loathsome performance as an Elysium elitist. But, Damon's love interest, Alice Braga, is 'just there', and there is a needless subplot involving her injured daughter which really plays more as the standard abhorrent 'child in distress' cliché.While you get a glimpse of the disparity between the Haves and the Have Not's, you really don't get to see that much of the 'star of the show' (Elysium itself), and the story feels a bit empty being focused primarily on the 3 main stars. Fleshing out the plot is sacrificed for action at the end of the day. Which is not to say the movie is bad overall. It's a decent watch, and pretty stunning in an IMAX theater. It just could have been more.",6,2,4,11 August 2013
Prometheus," Of the caliber of an Aliens VS Predator movie
","Ridley, please hear this: If this was really YOU ...something you thought was going to be great...and not just you wanting so bad to do another Alien movie before you die that you didn't care what mess the script was like; then please STOP NOW before you put your hands in the Blade Runner cookie jar (as is rumored) and ruin that for everyone, too! Everyone else: There's no 'science' in Prometheus, only re-warmed 'fiction' that a 2-year old could write better, and it's use of 'horror' consistently arrives with unintended chuckles.Outside of Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender, the movie could have served just as well with splice-in's of actors in 50's B-movie roles. And that amazingly includes Charlize Theron, and also the normally-capable Guy Pearce in age-makeup that barely betters that of the Back to the Future series.I do facetiously appreciate Idris Elba's sudden, out-of-character & random 'exposition scene' sandwiched just past the mid-point of the film. You know your story is a lost-cause when it's not thorough and deep enough to force people come to the conclusion on their own, and you just don't have any patience left to try and nurture that understanding because now it's time to 'bring it on' (the action).The creatures all look completely fake and unbelievable, including those that may look familiar to you. Think Alien3's level of monster-believability. Not only that, but there's a complete lack of consistency between how the creatures in this film adapt. And I'm referring to that as it pertains WITHIN this film; not in comparison to the other Alien movies.And don't worry: you'll have PLENTY of time to contemplate all the nonsense going on, too. While the original Alien probably holds to this day as having had the best suspense of ALL the Aliens movies (including Cameron's sequel), here Ridley seems to just be waiting/hoping/praying for something to happen. Knowing that it was going to be a 2:15 min movie, I happened to glance at my watch when I was hoping it was near the end, only to realize that only an hour had passed. (!) I don't even give Ridley credit (as some are) for astounding visuals. Remember the intense, lonely feeling of landing ON a totally alien planet when the Nostromo sets-down in the original Alien movie? (A feat never since executed as well again by anyone.) --As you might suspect from the commercials...don't anticipate that here.Probably, the worst of it all is in the last half-hour when it feels like they made-up the script as they went along. You WILL have the feeling of one of those poorly-executed prequels where the writers are desperately trying to shoehorn the story to match the movie that comes after it. Needless to say, there is one HUGE, honking continuity error (that at first seems like they might have got right). To me, it was this moment when I finally KNEW for certain that I had just watched an Alien VS Predator -class movie, and not a groundbreaking piece of cinema from an accomplished auteur like Ridley Scott.",1,14,24,9 June 2012
