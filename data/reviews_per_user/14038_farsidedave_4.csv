The Ring," scariest film ever?
","SPOILERS BELOWit had too much wrong with it, not consistent enough, does the girl come out of the tv to finish the video viewers off?, how did the video get made in the first place?, little things that didn't link anything together, too much like the sixth sense with all the staring into space images, pretty rubbish actually the more i think about it, funny really as when the sixth sense first came out it was the twist at the end that got people and even when you watch the film again after a while which i have done it still manages to shock, if i watched the ring even today after seeing it on dvd yesterday it would do nothing for me at all, avoid i reckon",Null,1,2,20 March 2003
Finding Nemo," What's all the fuss?
","am i missing something?, after the toy story 1 and 2 which got better and better then monsters inc which seemed to move it on, then shrek which did the same, well finding nemo looks to me that's it aimed squarely at kids where the others are too but with lots of tilts towards aldults with the jokes the kids won't have a hope of getting, i think i laughed out loud just the once and if we do get to buy it on DVD then i couldn't imagine watching it on my own, which i am more than happy to do on DVD now with all the toher disney stuff, maybe it's more of a merchandising thing now that it is aimed at kids so much that the adults have just become a sideline on the eventsnot much to fault on the animation, just where is the story?3, maybe 4 out of 10",Null,2,3,18 October 2003
Final Destination 2," Absolute tosh
","SPOILERS BELOWreally, what a load of rubbish, the first one, for what it was i felt was pretty good, a cut above the usual teen movies but after the deaths just seeming to be more gruesome for the sake of it (i mean the lift scene?), well sorry but when the girl got killed by the air bag it was time to say goodbye, no stars, even for the time of the film i just about managed to sit throughplease, no FD3!!!",Null,0,1,6 November 2003
28 Days Later...," Seen it at last (contains spoilers)
","Only got to see it as the wife wants to see the sequel and made the mistake of looking at the rating before watching it....for me the plot holes let it down, but if you are prepared to overlook them to some degree and just enjoy the film then it does work on some levels.The use of the digital video cameras for me was a highlight..it gave an exceptional look to the film and the score also added to the tension and the effect too...viewing a deserted London and a traffic free motorway was an experience in itself, the story?, OK, but then again don't look too deep...best to just sit back and enjoy the ride. For me though it took up until the survivors were 'rescued' by the soldiers for the film to come to life, definitely the second portion of the film was far more superior to the first and things got much better from them on.I like Danny Boyle's work, always have and the look and sound of the film was a major highlight, it gave our cinema sound system an excellent work out but looking at the film as a whole only lets me rate it as a 6...maybe it would have been different if I would have not looked at the ratings first and expected more...but I have the DVD for a week so it will be getting watched again.",6,1,2,19 May 2007
