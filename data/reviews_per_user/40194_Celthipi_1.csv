The Blair Witch Project," The most creatively genius horror movie ever!
","I have been watching horror movies for nearly ten years on a regular with my best friend.  This is easily the scariest movie I've ever seen and I don't think I'll be seeing anything this scary for a long long time. The images are still with me and will remain with me forever.The simplicity of this movie makes it beautiful and believable. It makes it easier to put yourself in their place, and often you can't tear yourself out of their place.  I have seen grown men reduced to tears because of the fear this movie generated. It has been a long time since I had to have my best friend sit right next to me during a movie, but she did during this one.",10,2,5,20 March 1999
