Minority Report," Absolute Beauty!
","I was busy whining to myself about why nobody writes positive comments for any movies on this site - then I realized I wasn't about to write anything myself.  Maybe it's just more fun to bitch.Anyway - this movie rocks.  Great off-beat story, set in an awesomely bizarre futurescape.  What's not to like?**** out of *****",9,0,0,21 February 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Gollum is freaking well awesome!
","My friends say this movie mucks about with the original story too much.  I haven't read the novels, so I can't comment on that - but even if my mates are right, should it really have ruined the entire film for them?The movie has much to commend it, even if it's true that Pete Jackson has done more cutting, pasting and meddling than the hard core fans may have liked...1) Top notch battle sequences.2) Likeable hard-ass mythical characters. (My sister is wrong - Aragorn does have the edge over Legolas in my opinion.)3) An awesome CGI character to keep you amused.My one criticism of the trilogy thus far is the musical score.  It's only okay - it needs at least two more easily identifiable recurring motifs. Anyway, that's my only gripe - who cares whether it's really elves or pixies or spirits of the forests who come to the rescue at Helm's Deep.",7,0,1,8 January 2003
