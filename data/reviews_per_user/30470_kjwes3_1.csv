The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Good not great
","The biggest reason this movie and the next won't be as good as the first 2 is because of the books. The first 2 books had the games to make it action packed. The last book (and the last 2 movies) are just not as spine tingling as before. So, I give Mockingjay an 8/10 just because it was a good movie- just not the 9/10 I would give to the first 2 HG movies. The cast do their usual great work, in a situation much different than the previous films. Direction was good, and I thought angles of camera shots were well placed. I pity the movie goer who walked into the theater not realizing this was a book 3 movie. I would have been so lost without having seen the first 2, and it really helped that I read the books.",8,22,58,22 November 2014
