Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I demand payment
","This could be the worst movie ever made.  Lucas screwed up bigtime.  (1) there was no story and (2) the acting was horrible.  Face it, I was lost before the movie even got under way!  During the whole 'Episode I: blah blah blah' introduction, Lucas used big words and didn't make a whole lot of sense.  There was no bad guy in the movie (oh yeah, there was a total of 5 minutes and 15 seconds of shots / references to Darth Maul).This is a movie that you would expect from Disney.  And Jar-Jar?  Can you say 'sight gag?' If I want sight-gag humor, I'll watch all the sitcoms these days.Bottom line, you need more than just graphics to make a movie and sight gags to make a movie.  This one lacked Heart & Soul.",1,19,38,3 August 2000
The Matrix Reloaded," great movie
","Saw it opening night, loved it.Forget the narrow-minded 'it didn't meet my expectations' reviews, I think the Wachowski brothers did it their way, and it turned out how they meant for it to be.  The first Matrix was left so open, and it was such an imaginative movie that the sequel would be different in everyone's mind. And the 4 year gestation period between the 1st one and the second one pushed expectations higher.  I think it would've helped if this one came out in '00 or '01, right after the first one.  That would've definitely won more people over.I love the Wachowski brothers vision of the future, this puzzle is slowly coming together, and can't wait for the third one.",10,0,0,20 May 2003
X2: X-Men United," great movie
","This is a really short review.GREAT movie.  If you like the first one, see this one, you will not be disappointed.  Action packed, and there's reason for all graphics/actions sequences.",10,0,0,20 May 2003
