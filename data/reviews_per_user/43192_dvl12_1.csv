Come and See," a masterpiece
","This movie captivates to tell us the story of Belarus during WWII. Simply mesmerizing, brutally real, highly visual truth. It doesn't leave a good impression, but it shows how broad human nature is. Both, the evil and the good. Highly recommend watching it to anyone interested in history and the art of filmmaking.",10,2,2,21 October 2017
