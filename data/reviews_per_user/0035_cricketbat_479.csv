"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Meh
","A fun romantic comedy that made me want to work out. Nothing special, but not a waste of time.",6,0,0,3 January 2020
Ford v Ferrari," An educational and engaging ride through history
","I didn't know anything about Ford's history with 24 Hours of Le Man, really, but Ford v Ferrari does a good job of conveying of how important it was to those involved. Christian Bale's portrayal of Ken Miles is particularly impressive, making him both aggravating and sympathetic at the same time. This film is educational, engaging and it gives us the epic Batman vs. Jason Bourne fight scene we've all been waiting for.",7,4,6,21 December 2019
The Blair Witch Project," A horror film wrapped in an art film
","The Blair Witch Project is a horror film wrapped in an art film. It's high-class horror that doesn't rely on cheap jump-out moments and gory deaths. It's all about creating an atmosphere - and if you're watching it with the right people in the right conditions, the atmosphere is terrifying!",10,2,4,6 August 2018
The King's Speech," A well-made feel-good film
","The King's Speech is a well-made feel-good film. Colin Firth does an excellent job playing the part of a stuttering monarch, and the friendship between Firth and Geoffrey Rush feels genuine. I probably would have enjoyed it more if I had more knowledge about British history, but this movie is definitely worth watching.",8,0,0,10 July 2018
Despicable Me 2," On-par with the original movie
","Despicable Me 2 is on-par with the original movie. It's entertaining, it has some clever animation, but it's nothing spectacular. My kids absolutely love the minions, though.",6,0,0,21 September 2018
The Mask," Goofy, silly, dark fun
","I loved The Mask when it first came out. It feels a little dated now, but I still enjoy it, and it still appeals to kids. This movie is an odd mixture. The goofy story bounces along without any care, but it also has a darker and violent side that I didn't really notice as a kid. Still, it's easy to see why this movie helped catapult Jim Carrey into stardom.",8,1,1,26 August 2019
Insidious: Chapter 2," Suffers from more-of-the-same syndrome
","Insidious: Chapter 2 suffers from more-of-the-same syndrome. The scares are very similar to the first movie (and other horror films), which makes them pretty predictable. That being said, it still does a great job of frightening its audience, despite its flaws. Yes, the plot is kind of a mess, but if you're looking for a good movie to creep a group of friends out, this should do the trick.",6,0,0,11 October 2018
Moneyball," I don't like baseball. I don't like math. However, I still liked Moneyball.
","I don't like baseball. I don't like math. However, I still liked Moneyball. They could have easily shaved off a half-hour from this film and it's completely inaccessible for those who don't have a fundamental understanding of baseball, but it has solid writing, solid acting and even though it's primarily a crash course in statistics, it's still interesting.",6,1,1,20 July 2018
The Avengers," An entertaining and satisfying film
","The Avengers is an entertaining and satisfying film. I was worried that, with so many characters, the story would be messy or rushed, but everyone seemed to get equal time and the plot flowed smoothly. This movie mixes pulse-pounding action with sharp-witted humor, and it does it well -- but who would have expected less with Joss Whedon at the helm?",8,0,1,10 July 2018
Blade Runner 2049," I like this sequel more than the original
","Blade Runner 2049 is dark and haunting. Denis Villeneuve immerses you in a dystopian future with his hypnotic soundtrack and captivating visuals. Plus, this movie is able to stand on its own while building on the existing mythology. The runtime is longer than it should have been, but this is one of the rare cases where I like the sequel of a movie more than the original.",8,3,14,28 December 2018
Angels & Demons," Seems rushed
","It's hard to try and put an entire book into one movie, and that's why Angels and Demons seems rushed and contrived/confusing at parts. However, this film actually improves some parts of the book - which was impressive. It's an enjoyable movie, but probably only if you enjoy Dan Brown's books in the first place.",7,0,1,16 August 2018
First Man," Orbits around an emotional center
","First Man is a testament to the brave souls who risked their lives to achieve something great. This movie gives a gritty, gripping look into the process of going to the moon, but it orbits around an emotional center, which helps it from getting too detached or scientific. This is an inspiring story that may inspire a whole new generation to want to be astronauts when they grow up.",8,0,2,31 December 2018
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," It starts in the middle of a story and it ends in the middle of a story
","The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 is not a standalone film. It starts in the middle of a story and it ends in the middle of a story, and, frankly, there's not much to this story. This movie is filler to get to the finale. It also doesn't give Jennifer Lawrence much to do aside from stare at things and say 'Peeta' over and over again. It's not a bad movie, it's just not a complete movie.",6,1,1,31 October 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Better than the third, about the same as the second, not nearly as good as the first
","Better than the third, about the same as the second, not nearly as good as the first - Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides takes way too much time setting everything up and then doesn't really deliver in the end. This movie has some entertaining moments (like the mermaid scene), but the rest of the movie feels flat and forced. I think it's high time this franchise be put to rest in the depths of Davy Jones' locker.",5,0,1,20 July 2018
Men in Black 3," Better than the second installment, but not as good as the original movie
","Men in Black 3 is better than the second installment, but not as good as the original movie. Josh Brolin does such a good job playing Tommy Lee Jones that it's easy to forget they're different actors. And who knew that Jemaine Clement would make such a convincing and intimidating villain? Yes, this movie is full of plot holes, but it's a fun ride and it fits well into the Men in Black mythology.",7,0,2,10 July 2018
Howl's Moving Castle," Takes a sharp left turn into Crazy Town
","Howl's Moving Castle starts off well, but then it quickly takes a sharp left turn into Crazy Town. Don't get me wrong, I like Miyazaki's imaginative films, but this movie doesn't have the heart of Spirited Away, nor does it have the whimsy of Ponyo. Watching this film is like watching a bewildering dream. The animation is still superb, though.",4,1,9,5 October 2018
Gremlins," Silly, dark fun that you don't find in most movies today
","Gremlins is, in a word, fun - the kind of silly, dark fun that you don't find in most movies today. However, this movie also brings an original mythology to the table, and it has some amazing visual effects and puppetry. It's obvious some scenes are filler, but this movie doesn't stretch out the plot too far. Gremlins is an entertaining horror/comedy for the entire family. . . as long as you fast-forward through the Santa Claus story.",8,0,1,21 September 2018
The Incredible Hulk," Not that incredible, but still entertaining
","The Incredible Hulk doesn't feel like an MCU movie. It's dark and not as polished. But it's an entertaining enough movie. The acting was good, the special effects were good, however it just wasn't. . .incredible.",7,0,1,15 April 2019
Your Name.," A beautiful and unique film
","From the animation to the story to the music, Your Name is a beautiful and unique film. I found myself completely engaged almost the entire time. The plot gets a little muddled near the end, but it's still emotionally satisfying. I'd like to watch this movie again, especially now that I know what's going on.",8,0,1,28 December 2018
Captain Phillips," A realistic and suspenseful movie
","Captain Phillips is a captivating film. I've grown accustomed to seeing hostage situations in movies end with super-human characters using martial arts or something like that, so it is almost refreshing to see a regular guy just try to survive one. Plus, this film gives the pirates some humanity without making them too sympathetic. All of these elements, along with the excellent acting, make this a realistic and suspenseful movie that is well worth your time.",8,1,1,21 September 2018
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It's all about the lightsaber battle
","I know we were all excited for this episode to come out. And I know that we were all bugged by what George Lucas did to our beloved trilogy. But this is actually a pretty fun film -- the lightsaber battle between Darth Maul, Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon is one of the best of the entire series and makes up for most of Lucas' other mistakes in this movie, in my opinion.",7,0,1,30 August 2018
Sucker Punch," Visually and audibly incredible
","If you want to test out your Blu-ray player, HDTV or surround sound system, then Sucker Punch is the movie for you. This movie is visually and audibly incredible, but it suffers from a weak and, at times, confusing plot. Zack Snyder has a talent for directing action, but he should stick to adapting other people's stories.",5,1,2,22 July 2018
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," This isn't a good movie - if you think it is, you're lying to yourself.
","Thank you, RiffTrax. Without you, I couldn't have made it through The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1. This movie is awful, plain and simple. The acting and dialogue are terrible, as I've come to expect with this franchise, and it's an incredibly boring movie. You can practically hear the filmmakers stretching scenes out so the razor-thin plot could be spread over two movies. The only redeeming quality of Breaking Dawn - Part 1 is the visual effects that were used to make Kristen Stewart look terrible. This isn't a good movie - if you think it is, you're lying to yourself.",2,1,4,10 July 2018
10 Cloverfield Lane," A clever, suspenseful and unique thriller
","The best part about 10 Cloverfield Lane is that it keeps you guessing. John Goodman does a fantastic job of portraying a character you don't know if you should trust or not, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead is a conflicted and effective protagonist. This is a clever, suspenseful and unique thriller that is definitely worth a watch.",8,0,0,27 December 2018
The Sound of Music," A timeless classic
","This film is long. This film is kind of boring in parts. This film is cheesy. But it's hard not to love The Sound of Music. The songs alone will bring a smile to your face and the story is engaging, uplifting and suspenseful. This film is a classic, and deservedly so.",8,0,0,26 March 2019
The Expendables 2," Pure, adrenalized fun
","The Expendables 2 is completely ridiculous and totally cheesy - yet I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy this movie. Yes, the acting is terrible. Yes, the dialogue is worse. Yes, the characters are flat, and no, the plot doesn't make sense, but there's something irresistibly entertaining about this chaotic homage to action movies of the past. This movie is pure, adrenalized fun, and it's much better than the first installment.",6,0,0,10 July 2018
Source Code," Don't think about the story too much or holes will begin to appear
","Source Code is a fun movie - think Quantum Leap meets Groundhog Day. However, don't think about the story too much or holes will begin to appear. The best thing you can do is turn off your brain, appreciate the solid performances by Jake Gyllenhaal and Vera Farmiga and enjoy the ride.",7,0,0,26 July 2018
Skyfall," I will gladly accept Skyfall into the Bond canon.
","A good Bond movie? Yes. The best Bond movie ever? No. Skyfall gives us more traditional Bond movie moments than its two predecessors do, and it seems like it's attempting to steer the franchise back in that direction - which makes me happy. However, it's very slow and drawn out. They could have cut out a half-hour from Skyfall and it would have been a sharper, better Bond film. Still, I will gladly accept Skyfall into the Bond canon.",8,4,7,10 July 2018
The Hangover," Not as funny as everyone makes it out to be
","The Hangover is entertaining, but it's not as funny as everyone makes it out to be. The movie plays a continual game of 'top that' where the next piece to the puzzle has to be more outrageous than the previous one - and it gets kind of boring after awhile.",5,0,2,3 August 2018
Iron Man 3," Nowhere near the greatness of the original Iron Man film
","Iron Man 3 starts off strong, but it gets weaker and weaker as the movie moves along. It seems to depend on smoke (witty dialogue) and mirrors (cool action sequences) to distract audiences from the convoluted storyline and the occasional plot hole. Even Robert Downey Jr., as entertaining as he is, seems to be coasting through this film. Plus, in the end, they try and quickly wrap everything up in a tidy trilogy package and it just doesn't work. This movie is on par with Iron Man 2, but it's nowhere near the greatness of the original Iron Man film.",5,0,2,10 July 2018
Spartacus," An impressive epic drama
","My only real issue with Spartacus is its length. The filmmakers could have easily shaved off an hour of this movie, but they wanted to show off their sets, their costumes and their extras. However, it's obvious how influential this movie was. This is an impressive epic drama that is definitely worth a watch.",8,2,4,27 December 2018
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Why do I keep watching these movies?
","Why do I keep watching the movies in this franchise? I don't care about the characters, the story is convoluted and at times it is so full of CGI and green screen that it feels like I'm watching a cartoon. Even the action sequences in Resident Evil: Afterlife are repetitive and boring. Play the games, don't watch the movies.",4,1,5,27 December 2018
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," This movie gets nearly everything right
","There's a reason that E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial is one of the highest grossing films of all time. This movie gets nearly everything right. Steven Spielberg does a great job of balancing sentimentality and comedy, while also generating a sense of wonder. Plus, the visual effects still hold up after over 30 years. It's a bit slower than I remember, but, nevertheless, this is a film for the ages.",9,3,4,27 December 2018
It," Not that scary, but still quite good
","It isn't especially frightening, but that doesn't mean It's not a good horror movie. It is. I was impressed by the young cast and by the unsettling visual effects. The story feels a little repetitive, though, and Pennywise didn't cause the dread in the pit of my stomach that I got from Tim Curry's version. Still, I'm looking forward to seeing the second half of this story.",8,0,1,31 December 2018
Casablanca," Actually does live up to the hype
","Casablanca is a classic film that actually does live up to the hype. This really is one of the greatest films of all time. It has a compelling story, interesting characters and superb acting. Plus, it has stood the test of time and will continue to be endlessly quoted, referenced and parodied.",10,4,4,17 August 2018
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," It takes itself too seriously when it should have been campy, dumb fun
","I wanted to like Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. After all, I like Lincoln, I like vampire stories and I like the writings of Seth Grahame-Smith - but this movie is oddly boring. It takes itself too seriously when it should have been campy, dumb fun. Plus, the action sequences are cartoony and, for the most part, tiresome. Benjamin Walker is good as Lincoln, though.",4,1,2,10 July 2018
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," A technical marvel with an engaging story
","Who Framed Roger Rabbit is more than just a technical marvel, as it seamlessly blends live action with animation in a way that stands far above any other attempt. It's also an engaging story with iconic characters. Despite the goofy premise, this film has a heart and a sense of realism. If you haven't seen this one yet, give it a chance, p-p-p-please?",9,0,0,10 May 2020
Lifeboat," Think 12 Angry Men on the ocean.
","Think 12 Angry Men on the ocean. This Hitchcock thriller kept me guessing on who I should trust and who was in charge. A bit slow in parts, but, hey, that's how life would be stranded at sea.",7,1,1,22 August 2018
In Bruges," Quirky, humorous, dark and brutal
",This film walks a tightrope between being quirky/humorous and being dark/brutal. Colin Farrell gives a very impressive multifaceted performance. I don't know why this didn't get more publicity.,8,0,1,30 August 2018
John Wick," This revenge film is unapologetically brutal
","Every now and then, it's nice to watch a movie like John Wick. This revenge film is unapologetically brutal, and it gives us a protagonist that is single-minded in purpose and extraordinarily good at what he does. It's a simple and satisfying action flick. I could see John Wick going toe-to-toe with many of the classic action stars we already know and love and I welcome him with open arms (and a concealed side arm).",8,2,3,31 October 2018
Kung Fu Panda," Surprisingly good
",Highly entertaining! The animation was superb and it was full of funny moments as well as intense action. Very well done!,8,0,0,4 January 2020
Chinatown," Well-done film noir
",A very well-done film noir. This murder mystery was intriguing and was always a few steps ahead of me. I didn't see the ending coming. This film will probably get better with each subsequent viewing.,8,0,1,17 August 2018
A Star Is Born," Great songs, good performances, average story
","This is the first version of this movie I've seen out of the four options available currently (1937, 1954, 1976, 2018). I'm not sure why this movie keeps getting remade, because the story is fairly basic. I did enjoy the music, though, and Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga give good (though mumbly) performances. At the end of it all, however, I was left wondering, 'what was the point?' I think this movie may have been overhyped.",6,0,0,27 April 2020
Gravity," Gravity isn't just a movie, it's an experience
","Gravity isn't just a movie, it's an experience. It's an experience of sight, it's an experience of sound and it's an emotional experience, as well. This film makes you feel like you are drifting among the stars, instead of just showing you a story set in space. The visual effects are unique, awe-inspiring and terrifying, and while the plot is simple, there is beauty in its simplicity. I've never seen a movie quite like Gravity.",9,31,47,21 September 2018
Lone Survivor," Brutal and impressive
","At first, Lone Survivor felt like just another run-of-the-mill soldier movie, but then it took a turn I wasn't expecting and ended up being quite inspirational. This film in brutal in a variety of ways, and it features some very impressive stunts and solid performances. It may not be 100% accurate, but this movie still makes you appreciate the men and women who fight for our country and the good that still exists in this world.",7,1,3,27 December 2018
Wind River," An intense and thought-provoking crime drama
","Wind River is an intense and thought-provoking crime drama. Jeremy Renner & Elizabeth Olsen prove that they're more than just Hawkeye & Scarlet Witch while showing off some actual acting chops. And while the plot is fairly simple, Taylor Sheridan does a great job of creating an atmosphere and building tension. I look forward to seeing more work from him as a writer and director.",8,1,1,28 December 2018
The Death of Stalin," Humor so dry, you'll think it's a drama
","The Death of Stalin is a comedy for historians. I applaud this movie for the satirical take on a serious subject, but I have to admit that a lot of the humor went over my head. The jokes are so dry that, at times, it feels like you're watching a straightforward drama. If you're interested in the history of Soviet politics, you'll probably enjoy this spin on it.",6,1,3,17 February 2019
Mulan," Mostly good, sometimes great
","Parts of Mulan are great. Most of Mulan is good. The soundtrack is the source of the most nostalgia for me. There are parts of this film that I'd forgotten, so it was fun to watch it again with my family. Also, I think I enjoy Eddie Murphy as Mushu more than I enjoy Eddie Murphy as Donkey.",7,0,0,22 March 2020
Wayne's World," A time capsule of the early 90s
","Wayne's World is, essentially, a time capsule of the early 90s. It's amazing how much influence this movie had on music, on comedy and on pop culture in general. Unlike many other SNL sketches, this one actually works on the big screen. This movie is random, it's ridiculous and it's hilarious.",10,0,0,25 July 2018
Star Trek," A fun ride, but lacks depth
","A fun ride, but it wasn't as emotionally gripping as I had hoped. It started out very promising, but soon turned into a generic space action film. Maybe it got talked up too much to me. Maybe I needed to be more of a Trekkie to fully appreciate it. I enjoyed it, but I wasn't wowed. I could have done with more Simon Pegg and less Tyler Perry, though.",7,0,3,22 August 2018
Train to Busan," A solid PG-13 foreign zombie flick
","If you're looking for a solid PG-13 foreign zombie flick, Train to Busan is a great choice. It drags a bit at the beginning, but the undead are quick and horrifying, and the story keeps your adrenaline pumping once it gets going. It's not overly gory, either. This movie relies on the hopelessness of the situation to frighten you. I'd happily add this to my collection of zombie movies.",8,4,8,31 December 2018
Darkest Hour," Like eating your vegetables
","The Darkest Hour is a 'vegetable' movie-it was good for me to watch, even if I didn't enjoy it as much as other movies. The deliberately slow pace tried my attention span, but I felt like I learned a thing or two. Gary Oldman disappears into the role of Winston Churchill, and his supporting cast gives this film a sense of realism. I felt like I was watching a documentary at times.",6,0,3,28 December 2018
The Maze Runner," A good adaptation, but not a great movie
","The Maze Runner is good, not great. I understand why they made certain changes to the story, to make it play better on the screen, but other changes just seemed unnecessary. The young actors did pretty well, though, and the scale of the set was impressive. Also, much like the book, this movie can't stand on its own, so I look forward to see how they do the next installment.",6,0,0,11 October 2018
Memento," A mind-bender that will keep you glued to the screen
","Memento is an absolute mind-bender. Even after multiple viewings I still am not certain as to what actually happened. Nevertheless, the story is told is such a unique and compelling way that it keeps you glued to the screen the entire time. Christopher Nolan's story would have been interesting enough told in a straightforward way, but telling it backwards & forwards at the same time was as stroke of genius.",9,1,3,22 January 2020
Inglourious Basterds," More serious and deeper than most Tarantino films
","This film is more serious and deeper than most Tarantino films, but it still has his fingerprints all over it. Most of these stars go to Christoph Waltz, who plays a character who is both terrifying and entertaining. Colonel Hans Landa is the reason to watch this movie. However, I found it disturbing how the Nazis are portrayed as evil because of their blind hatred toward all Jews, and yet we, as an audience, are asked to blindly hate every German associated with the Nazi party.",7,1,2,15 August 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Feels like Star Wars, still not great
","Rogue One: A Star Wars Story got the look of the original trilogy right. Plus, this movie is pretty entertaining during the third act. However, the beginning feels disjointed, the middle drags and the characters are mostly one-dimensional and forgettable. This is a harmless addition to the franchise that gives us a different (and slightly less interesting?) perspective of the Star Wars universe.",6,1,2,27 December 2018
Captain Marvel," A disconnected movie about a disconnected character
","While there are definitely some entertaining moments in Captain Marvel, the film overall feels flat and rehearsed with a cobbled-together storyline. The filmmakers really try to make you care about what's going on by shoehorning in a connection to the MCU, but it was difficult to emotionally connect to the plot and characters. It's not a bad movie, it just doesn't bring anything really new to the table.",6,6,10,22 April 2019
Coraline," Every gothic girl's dream
","This movie is every gothic girl's dream - a quirky atmosphere, a strong-willed, but misunderstood female protagonist, a dark story, Victorian architecture, French music, etc. But while the animation was superb and the 3-D experience was fun, I thought that the story fell a bit flat.",6,0,1,8 January 2020
Dawn of the Dead," One of the best horror movie remakes ever
",This is one of the best horror movie remakes ever. Zack Snyder takes Romero's idea and runs with it - along with the fast zombies. Dawn of the Dead does a good job of making you wonder what you would do in an apocalyptic situation like this and how long you would survive. A fun watch for any horror fan.,9,2,3,16 August 2018
Iron Man 2," The B-reel of the first Iron Man movie
","Iron Man 2 seems like it is the B-reel of the first Iron Man movie. It is fun to watch, but it doesn't have the same fresh feeling as the original. The action is exciting, but the story drags and it introduces too many characters for any real character development. I would probably watch Iron Man 2 again, and enjoy it again, but I don't plan on owning this one.",5,0,0,10 July 2018
World War Z," This movie has nothing to with the book
","Color me surprised - I actually liked World War Z. This movie has nothing to with the book, so I don't know why they insisted on calling it by the same name, but it's a bona fide zombie movie that I would be happy to add to my collection. There's also something to be said about the fact that it manages to be horrifying without being gory. I feel that blood and gore are a crutch for many zombie films of today. Yes, it has its flaws, and yes, they should have called it something different, but this is a fun and intense horror movie. I did not expect that.",8,2,3,21 September 2018
Passengers," Evokes a sense of real fear, not manufactured horror
","Maybe it's because this movie was talked down so much, but I enjoyed Passengers. The original premise evokes a sense of real fear, not manufactured horror, and the two likeable actors make for a likeable pair of characters. And even though the third act isn't as strong as the rest of the story, this is a science fiction film worth watching.",7,0,1,28 December 2018
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Not funny enough for my tastes
","It's too long, too vulgar (even when edited for television) and not funny enough for my tastes. The Dracula musical is the highlight of the movie. I like Jason Segel. I like Kristen Bell. I like Mila Kunis. However, this movie just doesn't work for me.",4,0,1,25 July 2018
The Hunger Games," This is a powerful, well-made drama.
","I am very impressed with The Hunger Games. Of course, I love the book, so I wonder how enjoyable it would be to someone who doesn't know all of the background. The story is compelling and the violence is suitable for the subject matter -- it isn't excessive or gratuitous. Jennifer Lawrence once again proves herself as a talented actor, and the supporting cast is enjoyable to watch, as well. This is a powerful, well-made drama. Please stop associating it with Twilight.",8,0,1,7 July 2018
Zootopia," I can say this movie is 'cute' because I'm a bunny
","Zootopia is a cute movie (and I can say 'cute' because I'm a bunny) that deals with some complicated social issues. At times the intended message can come across as heavy-handed, but for the most part this film keeps things light and fluffy (like a bunny). The voice acting is strong and the animation is well done, so even without the heart of Pixar, this is a solid Disney movie.",7,1,1,27 December 2018
The Impossible," If you're not sure if your tear ducts are working, watch The Impossible
","If you're not sure if your tear ducts are working, watch The Impossible. This movie will inspire terror, despair and, perhaps most of all, hope. However, this movie doesn't feel sappy or emotionally manipulative. The acting is superb -- even the child actors give amazingly realistic performances -- and the special effects are horrifying. This is an amazing true story brought to life on the big screen, and it is a good reminder of what truly matters in this world.",8,1,2,10 July 2018
Argo," A well-made movie based on a fascinating true story.
","Argo is a well-made movie based on a fascinating true story. No, it isn't 100-percent historically accurate, but it presents the plot in a way that works on the screen. This drama is also subtly comedic, and it features excellent acting by the entire cast. Out of all the 2013 Oscar nominees I've seen so far, Argo is definitely the Best Picture.",8,0,1,10 July 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Yo-ho! Yo-ho! A pirate's life for me!
","I remember when I first heard that they were making a movie based on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, I was very skeptical. However, the first time I saw it, it blew me away, and it still holds up after all these years. None of the sequels have the same magic this one does. The Curse of the Black Pearl is unique, it's thrilling, it's comedic, it's everything you want an adventure movie to be. Drink up me hearties, yo-ho!",10,1,2,24 September 2019
Star Trek Into Darkness," Not as fun as its predecessor
","Star Trek Into Darkness is a fun movie, but not as fun as its predecessor. There are some major flaws in this film, not the least of which is a stubborn pacifistic stance that results in the loss of hundreds of lives. Most of the movie focuses on an eternally immature Kirk and a bland Spock, while skimping on a fantastic villain played by Benedict Cumberbatch. Plus, the movie spends too much time winking at the Trekkies in the audience. Let's hope they've gotten all of that out of their system for the next movie.",6,0,1,21 September 2018
12 Angry Men," This is truly a classic.
",I'd like to see a modern movie try to stay in one room almost the whole film while keeping it practically in real time and have the same power and emotion as 12 Angry Men. This is truly a classic.,8,0,0,30 August 2018
Beauty and the Beast," One of the Disney greats
","One of the Disney greats. Beauty and the Beast has memorable music, dramatic moments and fun characters. Plus, Belle is the hottest Disney Princess. That's right, I said it!",10,1,1,22 August 2018
The English Patient," I am questioning why it won Best Picture
","I didn't hate The English Patient as much as Elaine Benes, but I am questioning why it won Best Picture. This film is long, drawn-out and fairly boring. Yes, it has great production value, but the story isn't as compelling as it thinks it is, and I couldn't identify with any of the characters. I think the 1996 Best Picture award should have gone to Jerry Maguire or Fargo, instead.",4,0,6,20 July 2018
Public Enemies," The actual history of John Dillinger is much more interesting
","How can a big-budget movie about a real-life bank-robber, starring Johnny Depp and Christian Bale be this bland and boring? It's surprising how little I cared about the characters and the plot. I read the actual history of John Dillinger after seeing this movie and I found that to be much more interesting.",4,3,4,6 August 2018
The Babadook," A subtle, atmospheric horror movie
","The Babadook does a great job of making its audience feel uneasy. This film creates a subtle, atmospheric horror instead of relying solely on jump scares. The acting is also quite good. Noah Wiseman is a little terror and you can't help but worry about poor Essie Davis' sanity. The ending could have been better, but this is a unique and unsettling scary movie.",7,0,0,23 November 2018
Us," Us is scary, but Us doesn't make a lot of sense in the end
","Suspenseful, thought-provoking, confusing-this is Us. Jordan Peele's second stab at horror films has a fantastic set-up, but I feel like he painted himself into a corner in the final act. He created so many questions that he couldn't possibly answer them in a satisfactory manner. Therefore, he left it open and made it artistic instead of logical. It may not make sense at times, but this movie is still a terrifying ride that's worth a watch.",7,1,4,29 October 2019
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Playing the video game is much more fun
","Prince of Persia is trying to be the new Pirates of the Caribbean, but it fails. It doesn't feel like a video game adaptation, but, honestly, playing the video game is much more fun than watching this movie. It's adventurous, but it's bland and cliched. I was expecting more from this movie.",4,2,5,16 August 2018
Knives Out," It feels familiar, yet it keeps you guessing
","I've missed movies like Knives Out. This old-fashioned whodunnit isn't remarkably clever or witty, but it manages to present a variety of interesting characters/suspects in a way that feels familiar, yet keeps you guessing. I do wonder about rewatchability, though. Now the mystery has been unraveled, I doubt this movie would be as entertaining upon subsequent viewings.",8,2,4,14 December 2019
Spider-Man 2," A realistic drama set in a superhero world
","For me, Spider-Man 2 is the best movie of the series. It is a realistic drama set in a superhero world, and it can appeal to anyone who feels they're being spread too thin. The CGI may not hold up very well and Sam Raimi likes to add a certain element of 'cheese' to all of his films, but it's a well-made and entertaining film.",9,1,3,6 August 2018
The Irishman," Like listening to an old man tell an interesting story
","Watching The Irishman is, appropriately, a lot like listening to an old man tell a story. It drags on a little too long and sometimes it loses focus about where it's heading, but it's interesting stuff. And after it's over, you're glad you listened to it. This movie feels like an epilogue for Martin Scorsese's work, featuring his favorite subject matter and actors. This film didn't blow me away, but it's still a well-made organized crime drama.",7,5,8,29 January 2020
127 Hours," An amazing story, told beautifully by Danny Boyle
","127 Hours is Aron Ralston's amazing story, told beautifully by Danny Boyle. James Franco gives a very believable performance as Ralston and it's hard not to get caught up in it all. This high-quality film is upbeat and uplifting, despite the grim subject matter. Well done, Mr. Boyle.",9,0,1,26 July 2018
Pirate Radio," Gets lost in the middle
","Pirate Radio is a unique and interesting film. However, it feels more like a series of scenes instead of one continuous movie. This movie has a strong beginning and a strong conclusion, it just gets lost in the middle. If nothing else, I was thoroughly entertained by the soundtrack.",5,0,1,30 August 2018
Batman Returns," Darker and even more Burton-y than the original
","Tim Burton's return to the Batman universe is darker and even more Burton-y, featuring a compelling story and unforgettable performances from Danny DeVito and Michelle Pfeiffer. When I first saw this movie, I thought it was too crowded with villains and there wasn't enough of the Caped Crusader, but over time I've come to appreciate and enjoy Batman Returns almost as much as the original.",9,1,5,31 March 2020
Finding Nemo," Better, now that I know everything's going to be okay.
","Finding Nemo is very stressful for me. So many things go wrong for poor Marlin and Nemo. Nevertheless, this emotional rollercoaster features stunning animation, heartfelt performances and some clever comedy. I like watching it now that I know everything is going to be okay.",7,0,0,2 January 2020
Creed," Only really gets interesting when Rocky Balboa enters
","Creed only really gets interesting when Rocky Balboa enters the movie. I didn't care as much about Adonis and his story - I just wanted to know more about what was going on in Rocky's life. The fight sequences are well done, though, and there is some real emotion in this film. I think of this movie as more of a footnote in the Rocky story than as an official part of the Rocky series.",6,1,1,23 November 2018
The Great Dictator," An odd mixture of silly slapstick and serious social issues
","It's strange to think that The Great Dictator was made before the US entered World War II and before the world knew about the extent of Hitler's atrocities. This movie is an odd mixture of silly slapstick and serious social issues. It's an important film, historically, but Charlie Chaplin's first venture into talking pictures hasn't aged as well as his silent movies.",6,1,2,23 November 2018
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Stupid fun
","X-Men Origins: Wolverine is stupid fun. The director, it seems, was so concerned about squishing every cameo, action sequence and plot twist into the rushed film, that he forgot to make it somewhat believable and/or coherent. This adamantium apple fell pretty far from the tree.",5,0,0,16 August 2018
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," The comfort food of romantic comedies
","When it comes to romantic comedies, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days is like comfort food. It includes all the ingredients you've come to expect in movies like this, and it feels welcomingly familiar. Yes, it's cringe-worthy at parts, but I found myself laughing out loud more than I thought I would. Kate Hudson is hilarious, and Matthew McConaughey plays well off of her performance. If you're a fan of rom-coms, this is definitely one you should look up.",8,2,3,4 February 2020
Hot Fuzz," A clever parody of action films
","Hot Fuzz is full of a lot of fun, over-the-top action movie and smart comedy, but it doesn't entertain me like Shaun of the Dead does. It drags on a little and the plot is a bit muddled. It's a clever parody of a variety of action films, though, so if you're a fan of those types of movies (which I am) then you should definitely look this one up.",8,0,0,6 August 2018
Rise of the Guardians," I'm not sure why it failed at the box office.
","Rise of the Guardians is surprisingly entertaining -- and most of that is due to an interesting villain. Jude Law as Pitch Black is calm, collected evil, and it's fun to see how much he savors that role. This movie also has a clever take on traditional folklore and the animation is unique and engaging. I'm not sure why it failed at the box office.",7,0,0,28 December 2018
Ed Wood," An interesting and strangely inspiring film
","An interesting and strangely inspiring film. Martin Landau's portrayal of the famous Bela Lugosi was quite impressive. It's a bit slow, and the story wasn't as compelling as I had hoped, but it's a fascinating look into the life of this unique filmmaker.",5,2,3,22 August 2018
Home Alone," It still makes me laugh and it still makes me feel the Christmas spirit.
","It's hard to separate my feelings when watching Home Alone now from the pure joy I felt when watching this movie as a kid. I know there are flaws, I know there are plot holes, and I know the acting is over-the-top at times, but I still love this movie. It still makes me laugh and it still makes me feel the Christmas spirit. I plan on making this film a holiday tradition as soon as my kids are old enough to know they shouldn't reenact certain scenes.",10,1,2,21 September 2018
About Time," This isn't just a love story, it's a life story.
","Every now and then, a film comes along that changes the way I think about life. About Time is that kind of movie. This pleasantly unique film isn't just a love story, it's a life story. It showcases a variety of relationships that go beyond the traditional rom-com stereotypes. The story is uplifting, the acting is excellent and the humor is plentiful. This movie made me want to be a better person, and I'm very glad I saw it.",10,23,27,21 September 2018
Spotlight," A well-made and heartbreaking film
","Spotlight is a well-made and heartbreaking film. The actors, Mark Ruffalo in particular, do a great job of expressing the range of emotions required for such a sensitive topic and the story, though hard to watch, is absolutely compelling. I'm not bothered that this won Best Picture.",8,1,2,27 December 2018
Terminator Salvation," This belongs grouped together with Terminator 3
","The special effects in Terminator: Salvation are superb, but they spent most of their budget on visuals, apparently, and didn't spend much on the script and/or acting classes. This belongs grouped together with Terminator 3 - another sequel that wasn't as scary as the original Terminator and not as fun as Terminator 2.",5,1,4,6 August 2018
Insomnia," A genuine thriller.
","A genuine thriller. This film presents a story that is compelling and conflicting - where the 'good guys' aren't that good and the 'bad guys' are somewhat sensible at times. It's a bit slow in parts and it may be too dark for some people's tastes, but overall I would recommend it.",8,0,0,30 August 2018
Aquaman," DC went 'full Marvel'
","I feel like DC went 'full Marvel' with Aquaman. This movie is a light-hearted action/comedy that feels like a dramatic shift from the dark and brooding films that came before it in the DCEU. The storyline doesn't bring anything new to the origin story table, and the acting is hit and miss, but the visual effects are impressive. This isn't one of my favorite superhero movies, but it'll be a fun one to watch with the kids.",6,0,2,31 December 2018
My Neighbor Totoro," Definitely geared towards children
","My Neighbor Totoro is definitely geared towards children, but it's still another fun look into Miyazaki's creative mind. I really enjoy how the two sisters interact with each other -- it feels real. The story is simplistic, but my kids enjoyed it and that made me happy.",6,0,2,3 August 2018
500 Days of Summer," Not your average romantic comedy
","(500) Days of Summer is not your average romantic comedy. In fact, I don't think it belongs in the same category as a romantic comedy - it has a completely different feel to it. It has a fantastic soundtrack and Joseph Gordon-Levitt does a great job of playing the broken-hearted everyman. So what if Zooey Deschanel annoyed me? I liked this movie and I would recommend it to others.",8,2,3,3 August 2018
Deadpool 2," It's a fun and irreverent time
","I enjoyed Deadpool 2 just as much as I enjoyed the first movie. However, much like the original, I wonder how this sequel will hold up on subsequent viewings when the jokes aren't as surprising. My ClearPlay filters definitely got a workout cleaning this film up, but there was still plenty of humor to be had. It's obvious Ryan Reynolds is having a good time making these.",8,2,3,28 December 2018
X-Men," Paved the way for Marvel's meteoric rise
","X-Men is a little slow to start, but it soon gains momentum and pulls together a well-made superhero movie. This film paved the way for Marvel's meteoric rise in Hollywood. It stays true to the characters and doesn't try anything too crazy with the storyline. It's a straightforward origin story with excellent visual effects and a good ensemble cast. Hugh Jackman, I apologize for doubting you could be Wolverine.",8,0,0,30 August 2018
Spider-Man 3," A good movie with some really bad parts
","Spider-Man 3 is a good movie that is marred by some bad parts. Those few cringeworthy moments really throw off the balance and bring the whole film down. Nevertheless, there are some enjoyable sections, and the visual effects are well done. I don't hate this movie, but it's a prime example of a movie wasting its potential.",5,2,2,18 May 2020
Thor: Ragnarok," A humorous, colorful, energetic popcorn flick
","Thor: Ragnarok is a humorous, colorful, energetic popcorn flick. It's definitely more comedic than the previous films. However, most of the humor comes from characters acting differently than expected-to the point where they don't seem like the same superheroes we've gotten to know. It's not as solid as the original movie, but it's stronger than Thor 2 and, despite its flaws, it is a lot of fun.",7,1,4,28 December 2018
Yes Man," A few uncomfortable and unnecessary parts
","An interesting story and some funny moments mixed in with a few uncomfortable and unnecessary parts. It was entertaining though, and it made me think about how much I say 'no' to things in life just because I'm scared to try something new - and that impressed me.",5,1,2,30 August 2018
Resident Evil: Extinction," Better than the second installment, but it's not as fun as the first
","Resident Evil: Extinction is better than the second installment, but it's not as fun as the first one. There are some scary and intense moments, but other parts drag along slower than one of the undead. It's predictable and unrealistic, but it's entertaining enough.",6,0,2,6 August 2018
Midnight in Paris," A romantic comedy for intellectuals
","Midnight in Paris is a romantic comedy for intellectuals. Humanities majors will probably get the biggest kick out of it - giving smug looks to each other as each author and artist appear on the screen, nodding knowingly at the obscure references and inside jokes. Me? I spent most of the time looking up each character on my phone. However, that being said, it is still enjoyable. The story is interesting and I like the message of the movie: don't idolize the past, enjoy the present.",6,0,0,20 July 2018
A Bridge Too Far," Impressive parts that don't quite come together
","A Bridge Too Far is impressive in scope and scale, but the remarkable pieces don't come together in one cohesive whole like I hoped they would. This is a series of battle vignettes with a bunch of characters that you don't really get a chance to relate to because they're only on the screen for a few moments before their cameo is finished. The war scenes are well done, but the story-like the actual events this movie is based on-could have benefited from better planning.",6,1,1,24 June 2020
Zodiac," Tries to condense over 30 years of history with no definite ending
","Zodiac is an ambitious film. It tries to condense over 30 years of history with no definite ending into one cohesive movie. And, for the most part, it succeeds. The story is compelling and the cast is strong, although some characters feel unnecessary and the pacing is very slow. It's an interesting movie to watch, but I don't know if I'd ever want to watch it again.",6,1,1,23 November 2018
The Prestige," Pay close attention
","The Prestige is a mind-bender. Even if you've seen this movie before, you still have to pay close attention each time you watch it. It's a dark, tragic and cautionary tale with engaging performances from the whole cast. Christopher Nolan knows how to tell a story.",8,0,1,28 December 2018
The Terminator," Still a solid horror movie
","Yes the clothing, music and special effects are a bit dated, but The Terminator is still a solid horror movie. James Cameron (pre-huge ego) does a great job of telling a unique science-fiction story in a way that is accessible to non-science-fiction fans. It's no wonder that this film put Arnold Schwarzenegger on the map.",9,0,1,26 July 2018
Ready Player One," More than just a nostalgia-fueled adrenaline rush
","Ready Player One is more than just a nostalgia-fueled adrenaline rush. It has heart, a compelling story and ideas that don't seem too far from reality. The fact that this movie has amazing visuals and more Easter eggs than you can possibly catch in one viewing doesn't hurt, either. I haven't read the book yet, so I feel like there's more to the story, but this film is a lot of fun for any fan of pop culture.",8,0,2,28 December 2018
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Makes espionage seem dreadfully dull
","This just goes to show that just because a film features Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, Tom Hardy and Benedict Cumberbatch does not make it good. Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy mumbles along for what seems like an eternity and makes espionage seem dreadfully dull. The moments of suspense or intrigue are few and far between and, frankly, not worth the wait. I'm surprised this is the movie that got Gary Oldman an acting nomination - he did fine, but this is far from his best performance.",3,1,5,20 July 2018
The Hateful Eight," Engaging, but self-aggrandizing
","I think I would have enjoyed The Hateful Eight more if Quentin Tarantino would have stopped taking victory laps throughout the movie. I liked the story, but I felt like the film is trying to show off how artistic and shocking it could be at every turn, and constantly patting itself on the back. It's a bit gruesome for my tastes, but I did appreciate the acting, the score and the cinematography.",7,0,1,29 January 2019
"I, Tonya"," Dark, funny and absolutely fascinating
","I don't know if I buy everything they're selling in I, Tonya, but I sure enjoyed the way they presented it. This movie gives a different perspective on the story we all heard about back in the 90s in a way that keeps you engaged and entertained. Allison Janney is horribly delightful, and Margot Robbie disappears into the role of Tonya Harding. This film is dark, funny and absolutely fascinating.",8,0,0,28 December 2018
Molly's Game," Jessica Chastain's performance is this movie's ace in the hole
","Molly's Game has the witty, fast-paced dialogue you'd expect from anything written by Aaron Sorkin. However, Sorkin's directorial debut starts losing steam near the end. He should have tightened it up a bit. Nevertheless, Jessica Chastain's performance is this movie's ace in the hole. She makes you believe that she could pull off an operation like this. This film isn't a flop, but I wasn't all in while watching it, either.",5,3,6,28 December 2018
The Adventures of Tintin," It's like Indiana Jones, but, you know, for kids.
","I don't know why The Adventures of Tintin didn't get an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature. The animation is as interesting as Rango's, the voice work is as good as it is in Kung Fu Panda 2 and it's just a better movie than Puss in Boots. It's not a great film, but it has some fun action sequences and an entertaining story. It's like Indiana Jones, but, you know, for kids.",6,0,0,7 July 2018
Moana," A memorable movie with beautiful music and stunning animation
",Moana is a memorable movie with beautiful music and stunning animation. Disney is hitting on all cylinders this time around. I loved the story and Moana herself is particularly endearing. And who knew The Rock could sing? This has definitely earned a place among the Disney animated classics.,10,0,2,28 December 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Exactly the movie I wanted it to be
","Spider-Man: Homecoming is exactly the movie I wanted it to be. It's fun, it's funny and it's cleverly tied in to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Tom Holland plays Peter Parker perfectly, while Michael Keaton is excellent as the villainous Vulture. This film gives me a lot of hope for the future of the Spider-Man franchise.",9,0,1,28 December 2018
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," A silly comedy about a very serious subject.
","What can be said about this movie? It's a classic. One of the great films. A silly comedy about a very serious subject. If you haven't seen this one yet, it's about time you did.",8,13,20,30 August 2018
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Just as strong as its predecessors
","Contrary to what others may say, I feel that this film is just as strong as its predecessors. It has the highly entertaining battle at Tatooine at the beginning and the epic battle between father and son at the end. It's just sad that this movie was the most butchered by Lucas in the re-release.",10,3,6,11 October 2018
Fast & Furious 6," WAY too much Letty
","I think the true enjoyment of Fast & Furious 6 depends on an emotional investment with the characters that I just don't have, even after watching all of the previous movies. The story was convoluted, the acting was wooden and the car chases felt lackluster. I can see why others may like it, but I didn't. Although that could just be because this film featured WAY too much Letty. Who knows?",4,1,2,28 December 2018
MASH," A series of bland jokes and predictable sketches carelessly cobbled together
","Believe it or not, I've never actually seen a full episode of the TV series M*A*S*H. However, if it's the same type of humor as the movie, I don't think I'll like it that much. Perhaps the comedy would have worked better if this film featured college frat boys, but these were grown men- combat surgeons, even-acting like a bunch of perverted teenagers. This movie is a series of bland jokes and predictable sketches carelessly cobbled together-and it hasn't aged well.",4,2,3,3 December 2019
Pan's Labyrinth," Hauntingly beautiful
",This dark fairy tale for adults is hauntingly beautiful. Pan's Labyrinth is visually stunning and creates memorable characters and unforgettable horrors.,8,1,2,17 August 2018
Megamind," Something was missing from this animated feature
","I liked Megamind, but I didn't love it. I can't quite put my finger on it, but something was missing from this animated feature. Nevertheless, it's got interesting characters, great voice work and fun animation. I recommend seeing it once - you may just love it.",7,0,0,10 July 2018
Alien," A groundbreaking view of extraterrestrial life
","It's much slower than I remember, but Alien is still a solid horror film and a groundbreaking view of extraterrestrial life. Those facehuggers still cause a visceral terror to come over me every time I see them. It's amazing what Ridley Scott and his team accomplished on a relatively small budget. It has been copied many times since, but Alien has permanently (and rightly) embedded itself into science fiction history.",8,0,2,21 September 2018
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Grim, tragic, unsettling and bloody
","A grim and tragic film about what happens to people who just can't let go of their grudges. Tim Burton does an excellent job of adapting this musical to the big screen. NOT for the faint of heart, though! This film is ultra violent and bloody.",8,0,0,8 January 2020
Horrible Bosses," A little too over-the-top
","Horrible Bosses has some funny moments, but it is a little too over-the-top for my tastes. The crude and vulgar language is so prevalent that it is distracting. The performances are impressive, in particular Kevin Spacey and Colin Farrell, but I can't really recommend this movie.",4,1,3,20 July 2018
The Polar Express," The book is better
","The animation of The Polar Express is superb! The story, however, was much better in the book. The elements they used to stretch out the plot didn't work for me and I wonder how much children will actually like this movie.",5,2,3,16 August 2018
The Best Years of Our Lives," A powerful film that deals with the hardships some war veterans have adjusting to civilian life
","The Best Years of Our Lives is a powerful film that deals with the hardships some war veterans have adjusting to civilian life. It is a well-made movie and it features a number of powerful performances - in particular Harold Russell as Homer Parrish. However, the run time is unnecessarily long (172 minutes) and the story drags in certain scenes. It's a Wonderful Life may be the most memorable film of 1946, but this Best Picture winner is definitely worth watching.",7,2,4,31 October 2018
The Town," A solid crime movie with plenty of suspense
",Ben Affleck does a surprisingly good job as an actor and the director of The Town. I've come not to expect too much from him. It's a solid crime movie with plenty of suspense and action and good performances all around - who knew?,7,1,2,26 July 2018
Underworld Awakening," Why don't I like these movies?
","Once again, I feel like I should like the Underworld films more than I do. I love werewolves, I love vampires and I love Kate Beckinsales, plus the action sequences in Underworld: Awakening are pretty fun, but, overall, this movie just left me cold. It starts in the middle of a story and it ends in the middle of a story and there isn't much story in between. I just don't get it. Why don't I enjoy these movies?",4,1,2,27 December 2018
Suicide Squad," The trailer was more fun than the movie
","Suicide Squad is fun. Unfortunately, it's not as fun as the trailer made it out to be. This movie succeeds when it comes to creating the stylized look and feel of a comic book, but the frantic pacing and the flimsy plot fall a bit short on the screen. Nevertheless, Margot Robbie does a great job as Harley Quinn and Will Smith is effective as Deadshot. Leto's Joker, though, feels like a missed opportunity. I was entertained by this film - it's just not the game changer I hoped it would be.",5,1,1,27 December 2018
Shutter Island," A unique mind-bending experience
","Shutter Island is a disturbing, yet interesting film that does a good job of convincing the audience that they are crazy. Confusing edits, combined with deliberate continuity errors create a unique mind-bending experience. However, the film felt fairly contrived and it was, in parts, quite predictable.",6,1,2,6 August 2018
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," A superhero movie with a political thriller backdrop
","Captain America: The Winter Soldier gives us a chance to see The Captain as a real superhero, and it exposes some of his vulnerabilities, as well. This movie offers up an intimidating opponent against the backdrop of a political thriller. There may be a few too many one-liners in this film -- everyone is a comedian -- and there are some plot holes that you'll politely have to ignore, but overall this is an enjoyable superhero movie with plenty of action.",8,0,1,21 September 2018
Life of Pi," A wonderful adaptation of an excellent novel.
","Life of Pi is a beautiful movie, both visually and thematically. This film reminded me of how much I enjoyed the book. Also, I was impressed with Suraj Sharma who carried his first movie mostly on his own. The CGI is cartoony at parts, but it's easy to get lost in the story and forget that most of what you're seeing is nothing more than visual effects. This is a wonderful adaptation of an excellent novel.",8,0,0,10 July 2018
Tangled," Welcome back, classic Disney!
","Tangled is a cute, cute movie. The animation is brilliant, the characters are fun and the story is entertaining. I could easily see this being performed on Broadway. Where The Princess and the Frog missed, this one hit. Welcome back, classic Disney!",8,2,2,26 July 2018
Doctor Strange," An entertaining paint-by-numbers superhero movie
","Doctor Strange is a paint-by-numbers superhero movie, but it still manages to be an entertaining ride. The visual effects are what set this film apart. There is plenty of eye candy to enjoy as the story rolls along - and no, I'm not referring to Benedict Cumberbatch. If you've liked the previous 13 movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, then you'll probably like this one, too. If you're wanting something different, though, you may be disappointed to find that they've stuck to the formula.",7,1,1,27 December 2018
Interstellar," Not my favorite Christopher Nolan film
","Interstellar is a well-crafted, deep-thinking film full of amazing visuals and a story that sparks conversation with others, but it's not my favorite Christopher Nolan film. Even though the odd pacing may have been intentional, it made the film seem sloppy to me. There were some parts that they sped through, whereas other scenes seemed to drag on for decades. Objectively, I can appreciate what this film has to offer, but it's not one that I'd choose to own and watch repeatedly.",6,0,0,11 October 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Complex characters with evolving motivations
","One of my favorite things about Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, Missouri is that I had no idea what was going to happen. The cast is full of complex characters with evolving motivations and the story is unique & compelling. Also, despite the serious subject matter, this film is darkly comedic. Well done, Martin McDonagh.",8,0,2,28 December 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Better than The Last Jedi, not as good as The Force Awakens
","I hoped The Rise of Skywalker would fix the mess that was The Last Jedi, but it seems that Episode VIII was just too big of a disaster to clean up. This movie frantically jumps from scene to scene, striving to put right what once went wrong, without any real stakes or suspense. Everything feels flat and emotionless. It also tries to tie up all the loose ends left in the sequel trilogy but becomes tangled in its own web. This was a step back in the right direction for Star Wars, but sadly it's too little and too late.",5,15,34,19 December 2019
Pacific Rim," This film's strengths are the fight scenes and the comedic relief of the scientists
","The little boy in me loved Pacific Rim! Seeing giant robots battle giant aliens is simply pure entertainment. However, the adult in me noticed that this film's strengths are the fight scenes and the comedic relief of the scientists - the rest of the movie is a clichéd dramatic bore. Still, I was impressed with how much story they were able to cram into a relatively short amount of time. Guillermo del Toro once again proves that he is one of the most creative directors of our time.",6,0,0,21 September 2018
American Sniper," This movie makes you think about some harsh realities
","Even though American Sniper focuses on Chris Kyle, this movie makes you think about the harsh realities that all of our troops have to face almost every day. Bradley Cooper does a great job losing himself in the role of Chris Kyle - he's almost unrecognizable. The first half of this movie is a little weak, but the second half makes up for it with intense dramatic moments. Plus, in the end, it made me that much more grateful for the brave men and women who deal with the horrors of war to ensure our freedom.",8,19,27,31 October 2018
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The dialogue is among the worst I've ever heard
","This is the weakest film in the original/prequel Star Wars series, as I see it. The story is muddled and forced, the acting is weak and the dialogue is among the worst I've ever heard ('I've been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life. ' -Amidala and 'This is such a drag.' -C3P0 to highlight a few). That being said, it still has an amazing arena lightsaber battle (Yoda was a little hokey) and it was interesting to see how the Stormtroopers came to be.",4,1,1,6 August 2018
Lion," Heart-breaking and heart-warming at the same time
","It's unusual for a film to be heart-breaking and heart-warming at the same time, but Lion does just that. This is a gripping drama with powerful performances from the entire cast. My one complaint is the pacing. If the filmmakers would have trimmed 10 - 20 minutes out, specifically during the second act, the movie would have been stronger for it. However, this story is one that needed to be told, and I'm glad that I got to see it played out on the screen.",8,0,0,28 December 2018
Gone Baby Gone," A well-directed, well-acted and emotionally complex film
","Gone Baby Gone is a well-directed, well-acted and emotionally complex film. It's not an easy movie to watch, but it presents its gritty reality in a way that makes it hard to look away. The actors, especially Amy Ryan, disappear into their roles and heighten the sense of realism. The film also brings up some interesting moral dilemmas that are sure to be a catalyst for conversation. Well done, Ben Affleck.",8,0,0,23 November 2018
"Monsters, Inc."," An original story with excellent animation
","One of the best Disney/Pixar partnerships. The comedy in this film is sharp and witty and the sweet moments are very touching. It's an original story with excellent animation. Plus, Boo is just adorable.",10,0,0,17 August 2018
Ant-Man," A lot of potential, but it doesn't deliver
","Ant-Man had a lot of potential, but it doesn't deliver. Despite the occasional moment of coolness, this feels like another factory-made movie mold from Marvel. It's easy to see where the plot is going and the jokes are just as predictable. I almost liked this movie, but the performances are lackluster and the plot holes pile up to the point where I am unable to just ignore them. I can't help but wonder if Edgar Wright's script would have been better.",5,0,0,23 November 2018
21 Jump Street," Funnier than I thought it would be
","21 Jump Street is funnier than I thought it would be. This re-imagining of the TV series hits all the right points when it comes to parodying movie cliches and character stereotypes. It's more crude than it needed to be (ClearPlay muted most of the movie), but I was pleasantly surprised with how entertained I was during it. Plus, the big cameo appearances are genius -- pure genius.",7,1,1,20 July 2018
Bridget Jones's Diary," Ended up being slightly relatable
","I know I'm not the target audience for Bridget Jones's Diary, and it did take me a while to warm up to this movie, but I did end up liking it. The characters became somewhat endearing to me and the storyline ended up being slightly relatable. This isn't a movie I'd ever watch on heavy rotation, but I'm glad that I finally saw it.",6,0,0,28 December 2018
Captain America: The First Avenger," An entertaining set-up
","Captain America: The First Avenger is, essentially, a 2-hour setup movie. It has some good performances and fun action, but it almost seems like they are rushing through this movie so they can get to The Avengers movie. Also, I like Cap, but it does seem odd to root for a superhero who is pretty much a poster boy for the advantages of steroid use.",8,1,2,7 July 2018
The Godfather: Part II," Better than the original? Maybe.
","The Godfather II takes two compelling stories and weaves them together. Once again, Francis Ford Coppola makes a film that is interesting and emotional. Better than the original? Maybe - it's one of the few times that you can argue that point.",9,0,0,17 August 2018
10 Things I Hate About You," Too immature for its own good
","10 Things I Hate About You is too immature for its own good. It's as if the filmmakers wanted to make the leap to raunchy R-rated teen comedy, but were too scared they'd lose the tween audience, so it falls awkwardly in between the two. There are parts of this movie that I like, but if you're looking for a good film adaptation of Shakespeare's famous comedy, I'd recommend watching 1967's The Taming of the Shrew starring Elizabeth Taylor & Richard Burton instead.",5,1,3,4 February 2020
Nightcrawler," A world of voyeuristic vultures running around recording other people's pain for profit
","Nightcrawler is an intense movie. Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as the sociopathic Louis Bloom is absolutely terrifying. Most of the suspense comes from wondering just how far Bloom will go to succeed. This movie exposes a world of voyeuristic vultures running around recording other people's pain for profit. Plus, it is also a commentary on the ratings-hungry media as well as those who consume it. This is a well-crafted film.",8,0,1,31 October 2018
Léon: The Professional," Interesting and intense
","The Professional is interesting and intense. Jean Reno and Natalie Portman make a good team on film and Gary Oldman is terrifying. I had a few issues with the plot and characters, but overall I'm glad I saw this film.",7,0,0,17 August 2018
Oblivion," Visually stunning with an amazing soundtrack
","Oblivion isn't a perfect movie. It's predictable and more complicated than it needs to be. Nevertheless, this movie is visually stunning and the original story feels refreshing among all the sequels and remakes of today. Plus, at 50 years old, Tom Cruise is still able to lead this sci-fi action movie, which is pretty impressive. Many people disliked this movie, but I would watch it again.",8,2,2,27 December 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," A well-written Wikipedia article with a fantastic soundtrack
","Bohemian Rhapsody is a well-written Wikipedia article with a fantastic soundtrack. As it jumps from moment to moment in Queen's history, there doesn't really seem to be anything tying the scenes together. And the drama that finally comes in at the end is almost completely manufactured. I also went back and forth on Rami Malek's performance being good or it being an SNL impression. Nevertheless, I enjoyed this movie, if only because it was like listening to a greatest hits album.",7,1,2,20 February 2019
Bird Box," Better than The Happening, not as good as A Quiet Place
","Bird Box is like a better version of The Happening, but a lesser version of A Quiet Place. This original sci-fi thriller does a great job of creating a suspenseful environment, but I think the filmmakers were hoping viewers would turn a blind eye to the plot holes and inconsistencies. The story, while interesting, creates more questions than it does answers. Nevertheless, this movie made an impact and I enjoyed the ride.",7,3,7,8 January 2019
Burn After Reading," Too dark and too cynical
",Not my favorite Coen Brothers' movie. It was too dark and too cynical to be considered quirky or even funny. Brad Pitt's character was the only exception.,5,0,2,4 January 2020
Watchmen," An emotionally complex superhero story
","Watchmen is an emotionally complex story that does not pull any of the punches. The acting is excellent, the characters are believable and, visually, it is amazing. Having never read the graphic novel, I walked into this film semi-blind. I was worried that I would be completely lost, and there were parts that I had to re-watch, but I was very impressed.",8,0,0,17 August 2018
Hot Rod," Funny, but comes off as half-baked
","Hot Rod has some pretty solid jokes in it, but the movie as a whole comes off as half-baked. I feel like the plot was created solely to string the gags together. I laughed a lot, though, and the soundtrack is a lot of fun. I can definitely see why some people love this movie.",6,0,1,21 September 2018
Baby Driver," Edgar Wright is one of the most creative directors of our time
","With Baby Driver, Edgar Wright has, once again, proved himself as one of the most creative directors of our time. This movie is refreshingly original. It's an action/musical hybrid, complete with carefully choreographed car chases and gunfights timed to a toe-tapping soundtrack. It's darker than I thought it was going to be, but I still couldn't stop smiling the whole time during this film.",8,0,1,28 December 2018
Justice League," A step in the right direction for the DCEU
","Justice League is getting a bad reputation, but I don't think it's deserved. Sure, it has its shortcomings, but it's on par with most of the Marvel movies. This film has fun action, a good sprinkling of humor and it mostly stays true to the superheroes we know and love. It's definitely a step in the right direction for the DCEU. I accept you with open arms, Justice League, despite your flaws.",7,9,15,28 December 2018
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Starts the Lord of the Rings adventure off on the right foot.
","The Fellowship of the Ring is an impressive film because it introduces Middle Earth in a way that appeases both newcomers and die-hard fans. There is a lot of story to cram into the beginning of this trilogy, and this movie does it in a way that doesn't feel overwhelming. From the casting to the sets to the visual effects, The Fellowship of the Ring starts this epic Lord of the Rings adventure off on the right foot.",10,1,3,4 February 2020
Man of Steel," I wanted to like this movie more than I did.
","The first half of Man of Steel is a great movie -- the second half, however, is only mediocre at best. Oddly enough, the most boring parts of this movie are the fighting scenes, which is strange because Zack Snyder normally knows how to direct action sequences. Also, this movie tries to be too dark for its own good, so when they try for lighthearted humor, it feels out of place. I wanted to like this movie more than I did.",7,0,1,30 August 2018
28 Weeks Later," A bit sloppy
","28 Weeks Later packs almost the same rage-infected punch of the original. While the camera work is a bit sloppy and the storyline is fairly predictable at times, there are some genuine moments of shock and terror in this movie.",6,0,1,16 August 2018
The Thing," A thrilling mix of suspense and visual horror
","The Thing is a thrilling mix of suspense and visual horror. The special effects in this movie are ahead of their time, and the scares still hold up pretty well over 30 years later. This adaptation of John W. Campbell's short story is more faithful than the 1951 film, The Thing from Another World, but it also adds some originality. This is a well-made horror movie.",8,1,3,7 July 2018
21," It went over my head, but I still enjoyed it
","The methods they use are definitely over my head, but the story (which is based on a true story) was fascinating. However, I wasn't dazzled by the climax/resolution. A little predictable and formulaic at times, but it's enjoyable.",6,0,0,3 January 2020
The Revenant," Raw and brutal and powerful
","If you ever want to convince someone to not go camping, The Revenant would make a pretty effective argument. This film is raw and brutal and powerful, and Alejandro G. Iñárritu makes you feel like you're freezing and suffering alongside the characters as you're watching it. Leonardo DiCaprio pulls out some of his best acting chops, while Tom Hardy completely disappears into John Fitzgerald's despicable boots. This may not have won Best Picture, but it is certainly one of the most memorable films of 2015.",8,1,1,27 December 2018
Bridge of Spies," Could have told the same story in a shorter amount of time
","Bridge of Spies is a well-made film, but it feels like Spielberg could have told the same story in a shorter amount of time. Tom Hanks is his usual, likeable self and Mark Rylance plays a unique character, but I'm still not convinced he should have won Best Supporting Actor. I think I would have liked this movie more if I was more informed and more interested in Cold War politics.",5,0,0,23 November 2018
Split," I'm of two minds regarding this movie
","I'm of two minds regarding M. Night Shyamalan's Split. This movie is not his best work, and it's darker than I anticipated. However, it feels like another step in the right direction. It's obvious that James McAvoy enjoys playing the different personalities, and he does a fantastic job with that role. If you like Shyamalan's earlier films like Unbreakable and The Sixth Sense, then you should avoid any spoilers and go see this movie.",7,0,0,27 December 2018
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Surprisingly entertaining, considering nothing really happens
","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is a surprisingly entertaining movie, considering nothing really happens in the story. It's intense and dramatic and, at times, humorous. However, I don't know if it will hold up as well during subsequent viewings and it can't really stand on its own. Nonetheless, this is a well-made movie that is an excellent set-up for the finale.",8,1,2,15 August 2018
Kung Fu Panda 2," The story is weak, but the voice acting is strong
","Kung Fu Panda 2 is fun. It doesn't have the same heart or whimsy as the first movie, but it's a fun family film. The story is weak, but the voice acting is strong and the animation was excellent. Rango may have been more unique, but this movie definitely deserved the Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature.",7,0,0,3 August 2018
Hugo," The second half is better than the first half
","I appreciate the fact that Hugo is a love letter to early film history, but that doesn't excuse it from being tediously drawn-out. The characters' constant refusal to share information with each other is the only reason the already thin story is allowed to drag on. The second half is better than the first half and there are some good performances and fun visuals, but I wasn't overly impressed with this film.",6,1,1,7 July 2018
Doctor Zhivago," How is this one of the highest grossing movies of all time?
","Doctor Zhivago is impressive in scale. . .and that's about it. This film features remarkable sets, a variety of locations and plenty of extras, but the plot is incomprehensible and there is a lack of chemistry between the actors. Plus, they play the same sappy music for the entire 197-minute run time. How on earth is this one of the highest grossing movies of all time (adjusted for inflation)?",4,0,1,26 December 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Look out! Here comes a truly amazing Spider-Man movie.
","We really didn't need another Spider-Man movie. After all, the franchise has been rebooted so many times that the timelines are starting to get muddled-which is why Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse works so perfectly. The film deals with multiple dimensions in a palatable & pleasing way. The animation is uniquely superb and makes you feel like you're watching a comic book. Plus, the story feels like a classic Wall-crawler adventure. Look out! Here comes a truly amazing Spider-Man movie.",10,1,3,15 January 2019
American Beauty," A pessimistic view of the world created by nihilistic people
","American Beauty is a pessimistic view of the world created by nihilistic people. This self-indulgent film believes that everyone is unhappy, but that some people hide it better than others. The acting is fine, the cinematography is good, but the story is what really fails this movie. People still talk about The Matrix, The Sixth Sense and Fight Club - all of which were released the same year as this film - but no one is still talking about American Beauty, the 'Best Picture' of 1999.",2,3,10,23 November 2018
Wanted," A cross between Harry Potter and The Matrix, but not as good

Warrior," Makes you feel conflicted about who should win
","Warrior is an impressive movie. It's not every day that you find a story that makes you feel conflicted about who should win. The fights are raw and realistic without being excessively violent. Plus, Warrior has as much of an emotional punch as it does actual punching. My wife and I both enjoyed this film.",8,1,1,7 July 2018

Terminator 2: Judgment Day," A sequel that's better than the original
","Terminator 2 is one of the VERY few instances where the sequel is better than the original. The special effects of this 90s action flick are still quite impressive and the new story builds well on the first one. It's exciting, it's dramatic and it's even humorous at times - to me, this is where the Terminator franchise ends.",10,0,4,10 July 2018
Apocalypse Now," Not your average Vietnam war film
","Apocalypse Now is not your average Vietnam war film. It isn't about all the politics behind the war, it focuses on the individuals in the war. The plot, adapted from Heart of Darkness, is somber and intriguing. At times this movie drags, and, at other times, it is too mad for its own good. However, you can't deny it's a wonder of filmmaking.",6,2,6,15 August 2018
Disturbia," Rear Window for teens
","I've said it before and I'll say it again: this is Rear Window for teens. They watered down the plot, added some action, a new soundtrack and some sexual references and came up with something that is entertaining, but not amazing.",5,2,4,16 August 2018
Silver Linings Playbook," One of the most unique romantic comedies I've ever seen
","Silver Linings Playbook is technically a romantic comedy, but I hesitate to lump it in with all of the other cookie-cutter rom-coms out there. It is one of the most unique romantic comedies I've ever seen. Plus, it doesn't have that pretentious 'quirky for quirky's sake' feel that many independent films do. Bradley Cooper is surprisingly good in his role and Jennifer Lawrence is impressive as always. This is an intelligent movie with an entertaining story about broken people who are trying to help each other become whole.",8,2,3,30 August 2018
Ender's Game," Feels a little rushed
","Ender's Game has a lot of material to cram into one movie, so it feels a little rushed. Plot points are glossed over, character arcs are limited and the timeline gets a little muddled. The visual effects are great, though. The Battle Room scenes, in particular, are very well done. This isn't the best adaptation of Orson Scott Card's novel, but it's probably as good as we're gonna get.",6,2,3,21 September 2018
Monsters vs. Aliens," A fairly entertaining film

Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," This movie doesn't know what it is
","The problem with Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters is that it doesn't know it's audience. The R-rated content just doesn't seem right for the silly premise and material. Additionally, the gadgets and weapons feel like something out of a futuristic action flick. I like the look of the witches, though, and there are some enjoyable moments. I don't think it's a good movie, but I also didn't hate it as much as I thought I was going to.",5,3,4,7 October 2019
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Too complex and too dark for its own good
","Maybe it was the convoluted storyline, maybe it was the complicated family relationships, maybe it was because of the Swedish names, but I had a hard time following what was going on in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Most of time, I just had to take the characters' word that they figured something out. I also had to some reading afterwards. I liked this murder mystery, but it just seemed too intricate (and far too dark) for its own good.",6,1,1,22 December 2019
Rocky IV," An exhilarating, montage-driven 80s popcorn flick
","The peaks of the Rocky franchise are the first movie and the fourth movie. Rocky is the Academy Award-winning drama and Rocky IV is the exhilarating, montage-driven 80s popcorn flick. Yes, this is a silly movie, but Ivan Drago is an intimidating opponent, and I think we all shed a tear or two when Apollo died. If nothing else, this movie gave us one of the best workout soundtracks ever - thanks, Rocky IV!",8,6,7,31 October 2018
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Dances between sharp political satire and Coen-brothers-style farce
","The Men Who Stare At Goats is an entertaining film as you're watching it, but, after it's over, you really don't know what to make of it all. Most of the time I spent wondering how much of it is based on actual events. This movie dances between sharp political satire and Coen-brothers-style farce. It doesn't really go anywhere, but the ride is fun.",5,3,4,6 August 2018
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," An adrenaline rush right from the beginning
","Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation is an adrenaline rush right from the beginning. It features so many fun gadgets and impressive stunt sequences that you don't really care when the story requires a suspension of disbelief. This movie doesn't take itself seriously, and that is why it succeeds. After all, this franchise isn't about realism, it's about accomplishing the impossible and looking cool while doing it.",8,0,0,23 November 2018
Spider-Man," Just what a superhero origin story should be
","Spider-Man is just what a superhero origin story should be. Sam Raimi does a fantastic job of showing us the vulnerability of Peter Parker while displaying the awesome power of Spider-Man. And Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin makes a formidable foe for the web-slinger. Yes, they rebooted the franchise, but I still think that was unnecessary because this movie holds up well.",9,0,0,30 August 2018
Dunkirk," An experience of sight and sound
","From the very opening moments, Dunkirk is a tense film that doesn't ease up until the very end. Christopher Nolan does a great job of making this movie into an experience of sight and sound. Dialogue isn't as important, because the visuals and the soundtrack drive the emotion. I wanted a little more of an emotional payoff, but this is a solid film and is well worth your time.",8,1,3,28 December 2018
The Machinist," Christian Bale's performance is overshadowed by his bare-bones physique
","The Machinist is a dark, disturbing and thought-provoking film.

Ratatouille," Features one of my favorite animated movie moments of all time
","Not only does Ratatouille do a fantastic job of portraying the joy of eating, but it also features one of my favorite animated movie moments of all time (the childhood flashback scene). Yes, the premise is goofy and, yes, rodents are actually pretty disgusting, but that doesn't make me love this movie any less. This is one of the Pixar greats.",9,10,12,28 December 2018
The Amazing Spider-Man," Doesn't really add anything new to the franchise
","When I first heard about this reboot, I wondered 'Why?' Then, after seeing some press about it, I decided to give it a chance. After seeing the movie, I can now confidently say, 'Why?' Don't get me wrong, I think Andrew Garfield makes an excellent Spider-Man and I always like seeing Emma Stone act, but this movie doesn't really add anything new to the franchise. In fact, at times it feels like the same movie as the first Spider-Man. I like The Amazing Spider-Man, but it's not really that. . .wait for it. . .amazing. Boom! See what I did there?",6,2,2,10 July 2018
The Lego Movie," Happy to be along for the ride
","The Lego Movie is entertaining. Only about three of every six jokes land, but at least they're swinging for the fences. My kids were completely engaged in this movie, and I was happy to be along for the ride. The voice acting is well done and the animation is clever. This film could have easily turned into a commercial for Legos, but it didn't, thankfully. I would definitely watch this movie again.",8,0,0,11 October 2018
Now You See Me," Loses a lot of its magic once you start examining it
","Much like an illusion, Now You See Me loses a lot of its magic once you start examining it. The inconsistencies and plot holes begin to pile up and the movie starts to become more annoying than alluring. It does a good job of explaining the tricks it can explain, but ignores the ones it can't. Plus, this movie has a great main cast that it chooses to ignore for most of the film. I wanted to like this film more than I did.",5,0,0,21 September 2018
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Merges the old cast with the rebooted cast in such a clever way
","As a cinematic experiment, X-Men: Days of Future Past is pretty impressive. I can't think of another film series that merges the old cast with the rebooted cast in such a clever way. Even though this film has its flaws-time travel is a tricky subject, after all-overall it's a fun experience. X-Men 2 is probably still my favorite of the series, though.",8,0,0,11 October 2018
Captain America: Civil War," One of the best movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe
","Captain America: Civil War is a lot of fun. This film expertly juggles action, drama, humor and multiple character storylines in a way that almost makes you almost forget that this is the longest Marvel movie to date. The plot is compelling and the actors play well off of each other. The ending isn't as satisfying as I had hoped it would be, and you have to have seen at least Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Avengers: Age of Ultron to fully understand what is going on, but overall this is one of the best movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",8,0,0,27 December 2018
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Fifty points from Hufflepuff for this half-baked idea
","I almost enjoyed Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. This movie came so close to being a welcome addition to the Harry Potter franchise. However, Newt Scamander isn't a very likeable protagonist, the CGI beasts look less than fantastic and the story falls apart in the second half. Also, this film is darker than some may expect - it's the same tone as the later movies in the Harry Potter series. Where's the whimsy? Fifty points from Hufflepuff for this half-baked idea.",5,0,1,27 December 2018
Spirited Away," An imaginative new world with fantastic characters and creatures
","Spirited Away presents an imaginative new world with fantastic characters and creatures. It reminds me of movies such as Labyrinth and Alice and Wonderland, where the bizarre becomes acceptable and reality is easily suspended. This film won't be enjoyable for some (it's very odd), but Miyazaki's folkloric fantasy is undeniably unique.",8,0,1,6 August 2018
The Conjuring 2," Scarier than the actual events
","The Conjuring 2 doesn't rely on jump scares, gore or CGI to frighten you, it creates an atmosphere of terror that surrounds you almost the entire time. And yet, at the core of this movie, you have remarkable performances by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga to keep you from losing all hope. It's a strange, yet satisfying mix of chilling and uplifting. James Wan knows how to direct horror films.",8,0,1,28 December 2018
Tropic Thunder," Funny and over-the-top
","An over-the-top, in-your-face satire of Hollywood and it's obsession with war movies. Stellar performances from all the actors and the story was a lot of fun. The funny thing was, I was watching this on a ClearPlay DVD player so a lot of this film was muted. :)",7,1,1,4 January 2020
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Fast-paced fun with amazing visuals
","Maybe it's my love for video games (ok, it IS my love for video games), but I found Scott Pilgrim vs. the World to be very entertaining. It's fast-paced fun with amazing visuals and an original storyline. I know this movie isn't for everyone, but I sure enjoyed it.",7,1,2,15 August 2018

The Usual Suspects," There's a reason this film is legendary.
","Even when you know how it ends, The Usual Suspects is a compelling and suspenseful movie.

Inside Out," It doesn't have the emotional depth that I've come to expect from Pixar
","Inside Out is a fun concept, but it doesn't have the emotional depth (yeah, I went there) that I've come to expect from Pixar. I just wasn't as engaged with this movie as I have been with other Pixar ventures. The animation is fabulous, though, and my kids seemed to really enjoy this movie. I liked it, but I probably won't watch it again.",6,1,4,23 November 2018
Yesterday," I believe in Yesterday
","In My Life, I've always been a fan of The Beatles. There's also Something about Danny Boyle's and Richard Curtis' work that I like, so my enjoyment of Yesterday was almost inevitable. The story, the music and the performances all Come Together in this film, along with its uplifting message that All You Need Is Love. This movie is not a Revolution of filmmaking, and I might not want to watch it Eight Days a Week, but I Feel Fine about recommending Yesterday, and I've Got a Feeling others Across the Universe would feel the same.",7,1,2,18 September 2019
Resident Evil," Feels like a fresh take on the zombie genre

Avengers: Endgame," A well-made and well-deserved victory lap for the MCU
","Avengers: Endgame is a well-made and well-deserved victory lap for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It ties in many different storylines from previous films and allows you to reminisce while also saying goodbye to characters you've known and loved. This film has some flaws, of course, but it also made some bold choices and surprised me a number of times. I laughed. I cried. I loved this finale to the Infinity Saga.",9,6,13,24 April 2019
Quantum of Solace," I'm tired of tortured Bond
","A typical action movie, but not a typical Bond movie. While this film is full of explosions, chases (foot, car, boat AND plane), excitement and adventure, it's missing the novelty and newness of Casino Royale, but it's also missing the tongue-in-cheek humor of all the other Bonds - so it just felt like it was lacking something. I'm tired of tortured Bond. Bring back the confident, dry humor Bond with gadgets!",6,1,1,22 August 2018
Independence Day," Is there a movie more American than Independence Day?
","Is there a movie more American than Independence Day? This 90s action flick still holds up well today. Yes, there are some ridiculous moments in this film, but there are also some truly thrilling moments and moments of pure, unabashed patriotism. It features a fun script, an entertaining ensemble cast and a variety of settings. Independence Day is what a summer action blockbuster should be.",8,1,3,31 October 2018
The Dirty Dozen," A compelling plot with interesting characters played by good actors
","I can see why The Dirty Dozen is a classic - it's memorable. This film has a compelling plot with interesting characters played by good actors. This movie is also unapologetically violent, showcasing the horrors of war, yet it doesn't feel dark. It has its shortcomings, but The Dirty Dozen deserves its place on the shelf of iconic war movies.",8,3,5,21 September 2018
Legends of the Fall," Not that romantic, not that epic
","Legends of the Fall takes forever to get where it's going, and when it finally gets there, it makes you question whether it was worth the wait. The scenery is beautiful and the acting is well done, but the story is bloated and bland. This film isn't the romantic epic it thinks it is.",4,2,6,27 December 2018
District 9," Complex and interesting
","District 9 has a first-time director and a cast of unknowns, yet it manages to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with many of the big-name movies. The performances are excellent, and the characters, as well as the story, are complex and interesting. Plus, it blends 'news footage,' documentary-style footage and traditional filming almost seamlessly. I'm impressed.",8,0,1,15 August 2018
Mamma Mia!," Probably better on stage than on the screen
","Some things work better on stage then they do in film. This is OBVIOUSLY made for the stage and it didn't translate well on the screen. It was awkward and tedious in parts, and I didn't think the song lyrics matched what was going on, at times. Amanda Seyfried did a wonderful job, and I love the music of ABBA, but this movie confused and annoyed me.",4,0,1,4 January 2020
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," More action-packed than the first installment
","The Hobbit: The Desolation Of Smaug is more action-packed than the first installment, but this movie suffers because it can't stand on its own. The events of this film are all building up to a climax that isn't resolved, which leaves the audience feeling unsatisfied. The visual effects are spectacular, though. Smaug, in particular, looks (and sounds) fantastic. I look forward to seeing how this trilogy wraps up, but I still don't think Peter Jackson needed to divide the book into three movies.",7,0,0,21 September 2018
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Focuses on style rather than substance
","Much like its title, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is too long. It also focuses on style rather than substance. There is some remarkable cinematography in this film, and the score is hauntingly beautiful, but the plot wanders and drags and the movie suffers because of it. It may have piqued my interest about the life of Jesse James, but I doubt I'll ever watch this film again.",4,1,7,27 December 2018
Toy Story 4," Good, except it feels like an unnecessary epilogue to a fantastic trilogy
","I liked many things about Toy Story 4, except the fact that it came after Toy Story 3. Toy Story 3 was such a perfect conclusion to the iconic trilogy that this feels like a tacked-on epilogue. I enjoyed the characters, I thought the story had some clever moments, but I just would have preferred it if they would have changed a few minor details and made this movie occur between Toy Story 2 & Toy Story 3.",7,2,2,5 November 2019
Batman Begins," Well done, Mr. Nolan!
","Batman Begins is a great example of what a reboot should be. It honors the source material, yet creates something that is new and exciting. This movie is a bit slow at the beginning, but it manages to pick up the pace and create thrilling scenes and dramatic tension -- all while remaining anchored to a realistic world. This movie helped me better understand why Bruce Wayne becomes Batman and why the criminals fear him. Well done, Mr. Nolan.",9,0,0,3 August 2018
Twilight," A laughable drama for teenage girls
","This movie is laughable. Bad dialogue, bad acting, cheesy (though entertaining) special effects. Teenage girls will love it, though, because Stephenie Meyer wrote a trashy romance novel and made it into a teenage fantasy film just for them. It's just a shame 'grown' women are obsessed with it as well.",4,2,5,3 January 2020
Wreck-It Ralph," I enjoyed Wreck-It Ralph more than I thought I would
","I enjoyed Wreck-It Ralph more than I thought I would. Even if the trailer spoiled most of the funny stuff, this movie features a heart-warming story about accepting who you are. The animation is literally full of eye candy, and it features enough nerdy video game references to keep me happy. Yes, Wreck-It Ralph has some flaws (e.g. Sarah Silverman); however, as I learned from this movie, we should try to look past the flaws and see the good.",8,1,1,10 July 2018
Bridesmaids," Actually has a heart
","I was surprised to find that Bridesmaids actually has a heart. It features solid writing, actual drama impressive performances. Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy and Rose Byrne all do a fantastic job. It's just a shame that all of the good this movie has is surrounded by crude jokes and persistent vulgar language. I honestly think it would have been better without it - it's just a cheap way to get a reaction.",8,1,2,20 July 2018
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," An enjoyable re-entry into Middle Earth
","The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is an enjoyable re-entry into Middle Earth. It's fun to see familiar faces and places from the Lord of the Rings movies, and see how these two series tie together. However, while I have watched the LOTR films multiple times, I don't know if I can do the same thing with this one. The starting is exasperatingly slow and the movie is longer than it needs to be, considering how much of the book it covers. The visuals are great, but the story is stretched too thin. I like this movie, but I don't love it.",6,1,1,10 July 2018
Before Sunset," I appreciate it, but I don't like it.
","I appreciate Before Sunset for what it is -- a sequel made nine years after the original, set nine years after the original, starring the same two actors and following up on the events of the original -- but that does not mean I liked it. The conversations in this film were not as interesting as the first movie, and I did not want the two romantic leads to get together anymore. Yes, it feels very realistic, but who wants to listen to people complain about their life and their marriage for over an hour?",4,2,3,5 October 2018
Non-Stop," The plot only moves forward because of miscommunication
","The problem with Non-Stop is that the plot only moves forward because of miscommunication and people acting stupidly. I know that happens a lot in movies, but it happens so much in this one, that it feels forced. However, despite the ridiculous ending, this movie does a great job of making you suspect everybody. So at least it has that going for it.",5,0,3,11 October 2018
How to Train Your Dragon 2," This movie takes itself too seriously
","In How to Train Your Dragon 2's defense, I watched it at a drive-in movie theater, which automatically lessens the rating by at least half a star, due to audio/visual quality issues. This movie packs some good emotional punches, and the animation is appealing, but it just isn't as funny as the first film. And I think that it's because this movie takes itself too seriously that I didn't like it as much as the original. It's still worth a watch, though. My kids really enjoyed it.",6,0,3,11 October 2018
The Grand Budapest Hotel," The dialogue is quick and the humor is brisk
","The Grand Budapest Hotel definitely has that quirky charm that we've all come to expect from Wes Anderson movies. The dialogue is quick and the humor is brisk during this flashback within a flashback within a flashback. Plus, it's impossible to dislike Ralph Fiennes' portrayal of unflinching propriety in the face of disagreeable circumstances. This is probably in my top three Wes Anderson movies.",8,2,3,11 October 2018
Seabiscuit," This horse racing movie drags
","Seabiscuit gets bonus points for not being your typical 'inspirational based on a true sports story,' but it does seem to drag on a bit. It's enjoyable, but it's not one that I would want to watch over and over again.",6,0,0,16 August 2018
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," I wish they wouldn't have given so much away in the trailer.
","I love the premise of Tucker & Dale vs Evil, and the execution (pun intended) is great. However, I wish they wouldn't have given so much away in the trailer. Almost every major joke and plot twist is revealed in the preview, which lessens the impact when you actually see it onscreen. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed this film. It features great performances and an original story. I would definitely watch it again.",8,1,1,7 July 2018
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," A bit contrived and repetitive
","If I had to rank the Mission: Impossible movies, it would be 1, 3, 4 and then 2. Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol had a lot of cool scenes and fun gadgets, but the story was a bit contrived and it seemed repetitive. Still, it was a fun ride and I'd probably watch it again.",6,0,1,7 July 2018
Foxcatcher," The film seems to focus on the most uninteresting parts of the story
","Foxcatcher is based on a tragic and fascinating true story, but the film seems to focus on the most uninteresting parts of the story. I found the actual news articles to be more engaging than this movie. Nevertheless, Foxcatcher is almost worth watching for the subtle, yet dramatic physical changes to Steve Carell's and Channing Tatum's appearance, as well as their performances. Those two do a really good job.",5,0,1,23 November 2018
It Follows," Only scary if you are frightened by awkward pauses and stupidity
","It Follows is only scary if you are frightened by awkward pauses and stupidity. It's like the filmmakers knew their actors were terrible and their dialogue was awful, so they avoided having the characters talk as much as possible. The plot doesn't make sense and it is constantly breaking its own rules. The stalking monster is creepy in theory, but around the third or fourth time the characters run away from it, the premise gets old. The most horrifying thing to me is that some people actually like this movie.",2,2,5,23 November 2018
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," A good example of how to reboot a movie series
","Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a good example of how to reboot a movie series. It plays off the original idea, but it has a unique storyline along with plenty of homages. And even though the plot loses its way for a bit in the middle of the film, the conclusion is quite impressive -- even with the obviously animated primates. This film has invigorated this franchise once again.",8,1,2,11 October 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," This movie can't really stand on its own, but it's still epic
","Avengers: Infinity War does a good job of taking moving parts from the 18 previous Marvel films and putting them together into one, cohesive machine. Each superhero gets his or her chance to shine, and Thanos holds his own as the antagonist. This movie can't really stand on its own, but is has an epic feel, as well as enough humor & action to keep fans of this cinematic universe entertained.",8,1,2,28 December 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," An unfettered, nostalgia-fueled ego trip
","What Once Upon a Time in Hollywood could have really used was someone on set to tell Quentin Tarantino no. No Quentin, you shouldn't show multiple extended scenes from fake movies (and real movies) that don't really move the plot forward. No Quentin, your nostalgia for a bygone era isn't a good reason to make the audience watch characters drive around and listen to music for hours. I really like pieces of this movie, but I didn't enjoy it as a whole.",5,4,7,9 January 2020
Gone Girl," What a crime thriller should be
","I like it when a movie can keep me guessing until the end, and Gone Girl just did that. Most of the time I didn't know where this film was going, and each new twist and turn was a surprise. You can't help but get pulled into the story. The actors all gave excellent performances, as well. I don't think I'll ever be able to look at some of them the same way again. This movie is what a crime thriller should be.",8,2,2,11 October 2018
Django Unchained," Most of the movie is great
","The first three-fourths of Django Unchained are much better than the last fourth -- which is a shame, because most of the movie is great. The last act of the movie, though, has a darker tone and seems to be nothing more than an attempt for Tarantino to quench his bloodlust. Characters are found guilty by association and dispatched without reason or remorse. I'll probably watch it again, though, if only to enjoy Christoph Waltz's performance.",7,0,1,30 August 2018
Get Out," Captivating and uncomfortable
","Get Out is unique, captivating and, at times, absolutely uncomfortable. I wasn't sold on Daniel Kaluuya as the lead initially-he seemed kind of wooden-however, by the end, I was completely sold on his performance. And the rest of the cast adds to the suspenseful ambiance of this film. Jordan Peele has proven himself as a hilarious comedian, now he can also check the box next to talented writer/director.",8,0,2,28 December 2018
Drive," A slow movie with a fantastic soundtrack
","Drive is interesting, but it's too slow for its own good. Most of the time is spent with the characters silently staring at each other as the cool synthpop soundtrack plays in the background. It wasn't that I was expecting an action-packed adventure - I knew what this film was going into it - but it still felt tediously drawn-out. Or maybe I shouldn't watch these types of movies when I'm sick.",4,1,3,7 July 2018
Aladdin," No real diamonds in the rough here
","The problem with the live-action version of Aladdin is that it seems to be trying to 'fix' things in the animated version that don't really need fixing. In fact, the changes they made weaken the story. The updated versions of the songs made me miss the original ones, and the new songs were completely forgettable. While Naomi Scott was fine, and Will Smith didn't annoy me, there were no diamonds in the rough. This film, overall, feels absolutely unnecessary.",4,2,2,9 September 2019
Insidious," Instead of blood and gore, it relies on suspense and the unknown
","Insidious feels a lot like an old-fashioned horror film. Instead of blood and gore, it relies on suspense and the unknown to create a sense of fear. It takes a while to get going, and the final act will disappoint some (it's a bit bizarre), but it if you're in the mood to be scared, this movie will do the trick.",8,0,0,26 July 2018
Bolt," Flat and drags on a bit
","Bolt is a cute movie, but it lacks the story, clever humor and emotion of Pixar animated features. Much like Meet the Robinsons (another Walt Disney Animation Studios solo venture), the plot seems flat and drags on a bit. However, it does have some funny moments and children will be entertained by it. Bolt isn't a bad movie, it's just not a great movie.",6,1,4,16 August 2018
Frozen," If only the plot of Frozen were as clever as the animation and characters.
","If only the plot of Frozen were as clever as the animation and characters. This movie is fun to watch and the music is entertaining, but the story is too simplistic and somewhat contrived (yes, I know this is based on a fairy tale). I still enjoyed it - it's just not one of the greats. But who knew that Kristen Bell had such a good singing voice?",8,7,9,21 September 2018
Room," Horrifying, beautiful and amazing
","Room is horrifying, beautiful and amazing. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay both give very powerful performances that deserve every accolade they've received. Plus, the story is absolutely riveting. This film makes you feel all sorts of emotions. It's not an easy movie to watch, but it is well worth your time.",10,2,5,23 November 2018
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Inspiring and creative
","The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is inspiring and creative, and I appreciate creativity and being inspired. The exotic settings and the unique soundtrack enhance the viewing experience. I do feel like it should have been funnier, though. I don't know if it will hold up during subsequent viewings, but this movie is an entertaining ride the first time through.",8,3,3,21 September 2018
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," My favorite chapter of the Lord of the Rings trilogy
","The Two Towers is worth watching just to see the Battle of Helm's Deep. It is one of the most impressive battle sequences to hit the big screen. But then there's so much more than that-this movie also features amazing special effects with Gollum, dramatic political tension in Rohan, and fantastic moments with the Ents. This is probably my favorite chapter of the Lord of the Rings film trilogy.",10,0,1,4 February 2020
The Incredibles," Possibly my favorite Pixar movie
","The Incredibles is possibly my favorite Pixar movie. I love the animation, I love the voice work, I love the humor, I love the story - it's just a lot of fun. Watching this movie not only entertains me, but it also, strangely, makes me want to be a better person.",10,0,0,10 July 2018
The Mist," The ending feels like a bad joke
","The Mist, like so many Stephen King adaptations, has a great setup, but falls apart near the end. Yes, people will act irrationally during a crisis, but when almost every character consistently makes stupid decisions, it begins to feel ridiculous. Plus, the CGI was a little cheesy and the ending feels like a bad joke. This movie does have some good scares, though, and I can see why some people would like it.",5,2,3,26 July 2018
A Quiet Place," Don't talk, just watch it
","Wow! This film is intense! A Quiet Place is a smart and ambitious horror film unlike any I've seen before-and I've seen a lot of scary movies. It's consistently suspenseful, and it has a strong emotional core due to powerful performances from the cast. Listen, even if you're not a fan of horror, you should still give this sci-fi drama a chance. It's definitely worth watching.",10,0,0,28 December 2018
The Bourne Legacy," Shouldn't have been a Bourne movie.
","The problem with The Bourne Legacy is that you can only really appreciate it if you have a strong background with the Bourne series, but if you love the Bourne series then this movie won't satisfy you. It adds new elements to the story which may bother the Bourne worshippers. However, it's an interesting experiment of a sequel and it has some pretty entertaining moments. It's not a bad movie, it just shouldn't have been a Bourne movie.",6,0,1,21 September 2018
22 Jump Street," The humor is crude and predictable
","I like that 22 Jump Street is very aware that it is a sequel, but I didn't find this one to be as funny as the first one. The constant stream of improvised moments dialogue makes the humor almost predictable. And it's much more vulgar than it needed to be. The end credits sequence is hilarious, though. It's almost worth watching just because of that.",5,1,2,31 October 2018
Cars 2," Mater is like Tabasco sauce, a little bit is fine, but too much is overpowering.
","Even though Cars 2 is a Disney/Pixar production about espionage, it's sadly quite boring. I think part of the problem comes from the fact that they rely on most of the humor coming from Mater - and that doesn't work. Mater is like Tabasco sauce, a little bit is fine, but too much is overpowering. This movie just doesn't have the heart that other Pixar films have.",4,2,2,25 July 2018
Kick-Ass," Would have been better as a PG-13 movie
","I feel that Kick-Ass would have been better as a PG-13 movie. Sure, this would have upset the comic book fanboys, but the strong, vulgar language and intense violence are distractions from the heart of this movie. At its core, this is an inspiring film about humanity rising to its full potential and it's a fresh take on the superhero genre. The acting, plot, costume design, art direction, cinematography and soundtrack are all very well done, but I think the general public didn't embrace this movie because it is, simply, too much.",8,0,2,3 August 2018
Unknown," A bit far-fetched
","Unknown surprised me. I knew little about this movie, aside from the fact that it stars Liam Neeson (which was enough to get me to watch it), but it's entertaining. It does a good job of messing with your mind and making you feel as disoriented as the protagonist does. However, it's a bit far-fetched, and as much as I like January Jones, she's not a very good actress. Nevertheless, it's worth a watch.",6,0,0,26 July 2018
Ghostbusters," A timeless classic
","There aren't many movies better than Ghostbusters. This film expertly balances itself right between the horror genre and the comedy genre. The chemistry of the main three characters is undeniable, and when you throw in interesting side characters (such as Rick Moranis as Louis Tully), every scene is a delight to watch. The story is original, the effects are impressive and the jokes are funny - in short, Ghostbusters is a timeless classic.",10,10,10,27 December 2018
Gran Torino," Offensive, violent, charming and uplifting
","How can a film be offensive and violent, yet charming and uplifting at the same time? I don't know, but Gran Torino sure pulls it off. Clint Eastwood plays a despicable character, yet you can't help but like him. It shows what a good actor Eastwood is - even if the rest of the cast struggles. I didn't expect to like this movie as much as I did.",8,0,0,27 December 2018
The Hurt Locker," Manages to make practically every scene suspenseful
","The Hurt Locker manages to make practically every scene suspenseful. It has a realistic feel (I'm a civilian, so I don't know better) and strong performances all around. It also had practically no political agenda, which is rare in Iraq-related films, and I appreciated that. However, they could have cut out a half-hour or so - it's a bit slow and repetitive.",7,4,5,6 August 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," It's time to give this franchise a proper burial at sea.
","None of the Pirates of the Caribbean sequels have the same magic as the first movie, including Dead Men Tell No Tales. The visual effects are stunning and I like how they wrap up some plot points from earlier movies, but the story is too convoluted, the characters are tedious and the humor falls flat. It's time to give this franchise a proper burial at sea.",4,1,2,28 December 2018
X-Men: Apocalypse," A bland villain in a weak X-Men movie
","X-Men: Apocalypse is good, but this movie franchise has does itself a disservice because the plots and characters have become so muddled that it's hard to remember which story goes in which timeline. Apocalypse is a bland villain, and the end-of-the-world destruction is impressive, but overdone. Plus, the attempts at humor feel out of place and don't land. This is the weakest of the rebooted series so far.",6,1,2,27 December 2018
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," A disjointed mess
","The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a disjointed mess. It has moments of amazingness, but it jumps around from plot point to plot point with too many characters and too many subplots. I do think that Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone worked well together, though, and the ending was actually pretty good. If this movie was a half-hour shorter, it might have been better for it.",5,0,2,11 October 2018
Ex Machina," An intelligent sci-fi thriller
","Ex Machina is an intelligent sci-fi thriller that puts you in a constant state of unease. This film has an intentionally slow and methodical pace that creates a mood and builds suspense. It has a limited cast, but each actor plays their part well. I didn't know where this movie was going to go and I liked that. It's not one I could watch over and over again, but I wish there were more original films like this one.",8,1,2,23 November 2018
Back to the Future Part III," A solid final chapter to the trilogy
","Back to the Future: Part III is the weakest piece of a strong film trilogy, but it's still a good movie. Even though the jokes are a little tired and the story is somewhat flimsy, this allows the characters to grow and develop and ties up the franchise nicely. Not many trilogies have pulled off as solid of an ending as this one.",8,4,4,15 January 2019
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Terrible acting, ridiculous dialogue and an incoherent plot
","Being slow, dull and boring is bad enough, but New Moon also features terrible acting, ridiculous dialogue and an incoherent plot. I watched it with Rifftrax and I was still miserable! Believe it or not, this movie was worse than the (already bad) first one. Seriously, how can people say they actually like this series?",3,0,0,15 August 2018
Patton," Doesn't feel like a three-hour movie
","Patton doesn't feel like a three-hour movie, which is saying something. This is a very well-made film. George C.

I might actually agree with the Academy on this Best Picture winner.",8,3,4,11 October 2018
The Illusionist," Not as PRESTIGE-ious as other movies
","One of main problems with The Illusionist is that is tries to stay grounded in reality, but the illusions are too fantastical to believe. It's also too melodramatic. This movie feels like a soap opera, both in story and in acting. I tried my best to not compare this film to The Prestige, which was released a couple months after The Illusionist, but this is definitely the weaker of the two.",5,2,5,17 August 2019
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," Beautiful, nightmare-inducing animation
","Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind is a beautifully animated, nightmare-inducing film. I thought the story was fairly weak and the message was somewhat heavy-handed in parts, but the visuals are going to stay with me for a long time.",6,1,1,18 March 2019

Coco," Feels like Disney trying to do Pixar rather than Pixar being Pixar
","Coco is a nice movie, but it feels like Disney trying to do Pixar rather than Pixar being Pixar. It's missing the heart & humor found in early Pixar movies and ends up being fairly bland. Most of the songs are forgettable, as well, which is strange since this movie is all about music and not forgetting things. At least Coco is slightly better than Book of Life.",6,4,10,28 December 2018
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," The story is just as entertaining as the visuals.
",Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs isn't just 3-D eye candy - the story is just as entertaining as the visuals. This movie has clever and quick comedy that appeals to both children and adults. It's silly and sweet and a lot of fun. I'm betting this becomes a family favorite.,10,0,0,15 August 2018
1917," A simple story told in a magnificent way
","1917 is a simple story told in a magnificent way. The cinematography is like a well-choreographed dance, moving from scene to scene almost seamlessly. This film tugs at your heartstrings during some parts, then makes you hold your breath during others. Trust me, once this movie starts, it's hard to take your eyes off the screen.",8,1,1,22 March 2020
Lincoln," Made me think less of the real Abraham Lincoln
","Lincoln may be an interesting film for some, but not for me. I didn't like it. This movie seems like it's nothing more than a vehicle for Daniel Day-Lewis' monologues, with filler lines from other characters in between. People argue, Lincoln interrupts and tells some random anecdote for five minutes straight as the camera slowly zooms in on him, and then everyone else nods after he finishes. Plus, this movie made me see Lincoln as just another egocentric politician instead of a hero. It's too long, it's too boring, and it's too bad that this film made me think less of the real Abraham Lincoln.",4,3,4,10 July 2018
Sing Street," I love this soundtrack!
","Sing Street is an entertaining watch for anyone who wanted to be in a band when they were younger. Plus, this movie is full of classic 80s music and toe-tapping original tunes, which is a bonus. It's a slower film with a simple plot (the runtime is padded with full-length songs), but the kids do a good job with the acting and I found myself smiling through most of it. If nothing else, you should at least listen to the soundtrack.",7,0,0,27 December 2018
Million Dollar Baby," Great performances all around
","Hilary Swank didn't annoy me as much as she usually does, so Million Dollar Baby must have been a good movie. However, it didn't emotionally engage me as much as I thought it would and I kept looking at the clock - which is never a good sign. Great performances all around, but I think there were a couple other films in 2004 that were more deserving of the Academy Award for Best Picture.",8,1,2,10 July 2018
Event Horizon," Relies more on shock and terror than suspenseful horror
","I have mixed feelings about Event Horizon. I liked the beginning when it was 'The Shining in space,' but I was less impressed when it turned into 'Hellraiser in space.' In the end, this movie seems to rely more on shock and terror than suspenseful horror, which is disappointing - it had the potential to be an intelligent thriller.",4,2,4,21 September 2018

"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Constantly tries to tell you how important it is
","I think that if Good Night, and Good Luck had stopped trying to tell me how it important it was for thirty seconds, I might have been able to contemplate why it was important. This Academy Award-nominated movie feels like a student film and plays like a dry newsreel. I think the only reason this film got so much attention was because of the political climate of the time.",3,0,2,31 December 2018
Big Hero 6," Really has nothing to do with the original comic books
","Big Hero 6 is fun. There are plenty of plot holes, half-baked ideas and clumsy dialogue, but there are plenty of cool hero moments that will keep the kids entertained. Baymax is a great character and I'm sure we'll see more of his antics in the inevitable sequels. I do wonder why Disney decided to call this movie Big Hero 6, though, when it really has nothing to do with the original comic books.",7,2,3,11 October 2018
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Not as fun or as frightening as the original
","Resident Evil: Apocalypse didn't quite work for me. It isn't as fun or as frightening as the original. There are some entertaining moments as well as some scary ones, but, for the most part, it's a cliched mess of action sequences.",4,0,3,16 August 2018
Dumb and Dumber," One of the funniest films of all time
","I'll say it: this is one of the funniest films of all time. Few films can make me laugh each time I see them, but Dumb and Dumber manages to do just that. Yes, it's over the top and a little too crude at parts, but it really is, and will continue to be laugh out loud funny.",10,9,12,17 August 2018
Grave of the Fireflies," This beautiful film will haunt you
",Grave of the Fireflies is a heart-breaking story told in a beautiful way. It shows humanity in the face of war as well of the perils of pride. The characters feel realistic and the music enhances the mood of each scene. Warning: this film will haunt you for a while.,8,0,0,23 March 2019
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Excellent performances all around
","A strangely beautiful film about Nazi Germany. Excellent performances all around, especially by the two young stars of the film. This tale has an innocent feel to it, but it is equally disturbing.",8,1,1,10 July 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," A big stumble backwards
","I didn't like Star Wars: The Last Jedi and I'm sorry. It seems as if the filmmakers were so focused on cool visuals and clever-sounding lines that everything else suffered. There are plot points that don't make sense, dramatic scenes which are undercut by out-of-place humor, and inconsistent characters. After the prequels, I felt like The Force Awakens was a step in the right direction, but this movie is a big stumble backwards.",3,14,18,28 December 2018
Brave," Maybe I'm just holding Pixar to too high of a standard.
","Brave is kind of bland. It doesn't have the same heart, wit or power that other Pixar films have. It's just a regular, old animated family film. It's entertaining, but it's not one that I would put up in the realm of Toy Story or Ratatouille. Maybe I'm just holding Pixar to too high of a standard.",6,0,1,10 July 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy," A daring experiment for Marvel
","I really liked the main characters in Guardians of the Galaxy, but this movie has a cookie-cutter story. It's easy to predict what's going to happen because we've seen it a dozen times. The visual effects are excellent, though, and I laughed a lot. This was a daring experiment for Marvel, and I think they succeeded, I just don't think it's as great as everyone is making it out to be.",7,1,1,11 October 2018
The Last Emperor," An educational movie
","The Last Emperor feels like an educational film. I feel like I learned some new things about Chinese history, and I got to see some places I've never seen before, but it's not a great film. Even though the locations and costumes are impressive, the story is very flat, the acting isn't great and the editing is sloppy. I think the only reason this won Best Picture is because it was the first movie authorized to film in the Forbidden City.",5,0,3,21 September 2018
Clash of the Titans," Don't think about it too much
","If you're going to watch the new Clash of the Titans, make sure you do it on a big screen in high-definition. The amazing visual effects will distract you from the clumsy dialogue and contrived storyline. It's quite different from the original, but it's still a fun movie to watch - just don't think about it too much.",5,0,0,15 August 2018
Jurassic World," Doesn't quite reach the heights of the original
","It's about time they finally made a sequel to Jurassic Park! Jurassic World is a logical and acceptable continuation of the story that started over 20 years ago. However, even though there are plenty of sweaty-palm moments, it doesn't quite reach the heights of the original. Some of the storylines seem forced, and the dinosaur effects aren't any better than they were in 1993. Nevertheless, I'm glad they finally made a sequel to Jurassic Park. Yes, it would have been foolish of them to make any sort of ridiculous sequels with gymnastics or talking raptors.",8,0,2,23 November 2018
Paranormal Activity," It feels like it's trying too hard to be scary
","Paranormal Activity definitely has a creepy feel, but at times it feels like it's trying too hard to be scary. They use sounds and simple special effects to create an eerie mood, but then the mood is shattered by some bad acting or a cheesy 'Boo!' moment. Worth a watch, but don't expect Blair Witch quality.",7,0,0,6 August 2018
The Adjustment Bureau," A very interesting idea, but only an average execution
","The Adjustment Bureau has a very interesting idea, but only an average execution. The visual effects are well-done and both Matt Damon and Emily Blunt give believable performances, but the film as a whole has a bland feeling to it. It's good, it's just not great.",6,0,0,3 August 2018
Logan," Feels appropriate for the character's final chapter
","Logan is brutal and grim, but this film feels appropriate for the character's final chapter. Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart both do an amazing job playing the mutants we know and love in their twilight years, and newcomer Dafne Keen is quite impressive as X-23. This isn't just a good superhero movie, it's a well-made drama.",8,3,4,28 December 2018
Avengers: Age of Ultron," A good (and somewhat darker) continuation of The Avengers' story
","The Avengers: Age of Ultron is a lot of fun. It's stuffed to the brim with action and witty dialogue. James Spader makes a good villain, as well. Don't look too closely at the plot, though, or you'll see plenty of holes. Plus, when you have so many jokes in a movie, some are bound to miss. The first movie is the better one, but this is a good (and somewhat darker) continuation of The Avengers' story.",7,0,1,31 October 2018
Hotel Transylvania," Harmless Halloween fun
","Hotel Transylvania is harmless Halloween fun. It's not as clever as Nightmare Before Christmas and it's not as nostalgic as Mad Monster Party, but my kids liked it and it isn't too scary for their age group. It's a simple story with amusing animation. I recommend it as a good 'horror film' for young children.",6,1,1,10 July 2018
The Dark Knight," Not just a good superhero movie, but also a great film in general
","After multiple viewings, this film still packs a huge emotional punch. It's a dark film that doesn't revel in being dark - it gives you hope for a better world. Heath Ledger's portrayal of The Joker is, as many have said, spectacular - you laugh at him while praying a man like him doesn't really exist. Christopher Nolan has, once again, delivered a masterpiece.",10,0,1,12 July 2019
Annie Hall," Shouldn't have won Best Picture
","I'm not a big Woody Allen fan, and I don't care that much for Diane Keaton, but I like Annie Hall. I enjoy the creative way the story is told. The jumping around in time and the breaking of the fourth wall set it apart from most other romantic comedies. It's a unique and entertaining film, but it still shouldn't have won Best Picture over Star Wars.",6,2,4,5 October 2018
Men in Black," Even if someone used a Neuralyzer on me, I don't think I could forget this movie.
","It's easy to enjoy Men in Black. It may be a little dated now, but the story is unique, the effects are still impressive, and the comedic chemistry between Will Smith & Tommy Lee Jones is undeniable. Even though the sequels have taken a little of the luster off the franchise, the original film will always be one of my favorite sci-fi comedies. Even if someone used a Neuralyzer on me, I don't think I could forget it.",9,1,3,4 February 2020
The Graduate," I don't really understand why this movie is considered such a classic.
","While I can appreciate the directing and the cinematography of The Graduate, I can't really relate to the characters or the story. I understand why Anne Bancroft got an Academy Award nomination, but Dustin Hoffman mumbles and wanders his way through most of the film. I don't really understand why this movie is considered such a classic.",5,1,3,31 October 2018
Singin' in the Rain," Whimsical and educational
","Singin' in the Rain is a whimsical and, I'd say, educational musical. This movie portrays some of the struggles that came with the introduction of talking pictures in a way that keeps a song in your heart and your toe tapping. What a glorious feeling it is to see Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, and Debbie Reynolds show off their talents in this iconic film.",8,0,0,3 December 2019
Puss in Boots," Puss in Boots is better in the Shrek movies.
","I think I would have liked Puss in Boots more if it were a straight-to-DVD release. I guess I just expect more from movies I see in theaters. Don't get me wrong, it is entertaining, but it isn't as funny as I thought it was going to be. Even my kids seemed lukewarm about it. Puss in Boots is better in the Shrek movies.",4,0,3,20 July 2018
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," A stunning movie you'll never forget.
","Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a creative, well-made and thought-provoking film. Michel Gondry presents the story in a very unique manner while Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet carry the film with believable and memorable performances. It may be confusing at first, but trust me, you won't regret watching this movie.",10,0,0,10 July 2018
Taken," A refreshing vengeance movie
","Even though it's fairly predictable film with a long string of coincidences, Taken is a refreshing vengeance movie. Every now and then it's fun to see the good guy pummel the bad guys and come out completely unscathed. So turn off your brain and enjoy seeing Liam Neeson play Jack Bauer.",8,1,1,17 August 2018
Alice in Wonderland," Seems like it's missing something
","So much time is spent on the bizarre in Alice and Wonderland that it loses an emotional connection with the audience. Tim Burton does a fantastic job of creating an otherworldly feel and memorable characters, but the story seems like it's missing something. Still, it's fun to watch.",5,0,0,15 August 2018
Avatar," A cookie-cutter plot
","I don't think that I'll like Avatar that much if I see it again and it's not in 3-D. The visual experience was fun, but I really had no strong emotional connection to the characters or the story (or the trees, for that matter). The special effects are great, but beyond that it is just a cookie-cutter plot.",5,1,6,15 August 2018
Chariots of Fire," How did this movie beat Raiders of the Lost Ark?
","I appreciate the message of Chariots of Fire, but the film itself is dreadfully dull. It presents a series of half-baked characters and jumps from scene to scene without any real drama or emotion. The only thing truly memorable about this film is the opening theme song. I expected a lot more from the Best Picture winner of 1981. How did this movie beat Raiders of the Lost Ark?",4,4,6,21 September 2018
Drag Me to Hell," Deals with the demonic, but never becomes satanic
","Drag Me to Hell is one fun horror movie! It has some predictable moments but, for the most part, it is quite unique. Sam Raimi does a good job of adding humor without diminishing the terror. This movie does not rely on blood and gore for the scares and it was refreshing to see a movie that deals with the demonic, but never becomes satanic. I definitely want to see this one again.",8,1,1,6 August 2018
The Artist," I wanted to like The Artist more than I did
","I wanted to like The Artist more than I did. I love silent movies and I was excited to see this Best Picture winner. However, I may have built it up too much in my mind. It's enjoyable, but it didn't grab me like I expected it to. The cast does a great job, the visuals are beautiful and I love the references and homages to the silent era. The story, however, is overly simplistic and it seems to drag. It may have been my fault, though, I watched it when I was tired -- never a good idea.",7,0,1,7 July 2018
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Good riddance, Twilight.
","The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2 is seriously boring. Nothing happens for the entire movie, but, don't worry, it's all building up for the much anticipated finale when. . .nothing happens. For most of the movie, characters stand around, stare at each other and occasionally recite lines. The only eventful part of the story is nothing but a cheap fake-out. Without Rifftrax, I wouldn't have made it through this terrible film. Good riddance, Twilight.",2,2,4,21 September 2018
Invictus," An interesting mix of sports and politics
","Invictus is an interesting mix of sports and politics, but it lacks the passion of either subject. The film feels flat even though the subject matter is intriguing. Also, it's hard to get caught up in a game that you don't understand.",6,0,0,15 August 2018
Mission: Impossible," The technology is dated, but the thrills aren't
","The technology may be dated in Mission: Impossible, but the thrills aren't. This is a solid espionage movie with unforgettable sequences and plenty of twists. Yes, the plot is a little overly complicated, but there's a reason this film created an entire franchise: it's highly entertaining to see Ethan Hunt and his team take on a seemingly impossible mission.",9,0,2,26 January 2019
La La Land," Here's to the ones who dreamed up this film
","La La Land offers a stunningly beautiful portrayal of the joy of falling in love, as well as the agony of trying to follow your dreams. This throwback to classic musicals features an impressive opening number and powerful performances from both Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. It gives us the sweet without being too sappy and shows us the bitter without being too pessimistic. Here's to the ones who dreamed up this film.",9,2,3,27 December 2018
Saw," A psychological thriller and not just torture porn.
","Believe it or not, this one is actually a psychological thriller and not just torture porn.",6,0,2,10 July 2018
Mama," Works better as a drama than a horror movie
","Mama almost works better as a drama than a horror movie. I kept forgetting to be scared because I was concerned about the family dynamic. The visual effects are impressive, and the acting is pretty good, too. Jessica Chastain once again proves her versatility as an actress. The story kind of falls apart at the end, but overall this is a pretty entertaining film.",6,1,1,21 September 2018
Super 8," This film has a throwback feel to the classic adventure movies of the '80s.
","Maybe it's just nostalgia, but I really liked Super 8 - it helped me relive my childhood. There are some plot points that don't make sense, and the ending is kind of weak, but it reminded me of all the time my friends and I spent making movies back in the day. This film has a throwback feel to the classic adventure movies of the 80s and it features great performances by both the kids and the adults. Fun stuff.",8,0,2,7 July 2018
Sinister," A bit too grisly for my tastes
","Is Sinister scary? Definitely. Is it a good movie? I'm not so sure. It's a bit too grisly for my tastes, and the plot depends on people making dumb decisions. However, I do appreciate that this movie doesn't rely on jump scares. Sinister is a slow-burn horror movie, but at times it's too slow for its own good. Plus, the ending doesn't explain a lot, and it doesn't really make sense. Nevertheless, if you're looking to get creeped out, this movie should do the trick.",5,0,0,23 November 2018
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Captures a lot of the same magic as the original
","Home Alone 2 captures a lot of the same magic as the original. That could be because it's basically the exact same story, but it also brings some new stuff to the table. Tim Curry is a delightful foil for Kevin's antics, and it's fun to see the cast all back together again. It may be a copycat sequel, but if the formula ain't broken, don't fix it.",8,0,0,31 December 2018
Up," Those first 15 minutes...
","Pixar, apparently, can do no wrong. This clever and imaginative film was both funny and touching. Kids will love the fun characters and the adventure while the adults will love the quirky humor and the heartfelt story. This movie truly is fun for all.",8,0,0,30 August 2018
Rio," Colorful and lively, but forgettable
","It doesn't have the memorable music of Disney, nor does it have the heart of Pixar, but Rio is still a fun movie. The voice actors fit their parts well (Jesse Eisenberg plays his normal, neurotic self) and the animation is colorful and lively. And I always like it when a movie uses a little Portuguese. Plus, the kids loved it, so it was fun for everyone.",7,0,0,26 July 2018
The Fly," Possibly better than the original
","I'm not normally a fan of body horror, but The Fly is a well-crafted and horrifying movie. Jeff Goldblum is very convincing as a mad scientist, and the visual effects still hold up disturbingly well. I'm a fan of the 1958 film - it's a classic - but this may be one of the few times when a remake is arguably as good, if not better, than the original.",8,1,1,27 December 2018
Invincible," This is the Western Family version of Rudy.
","Invincible is a pretty standard 'inspirational sports movie.' It has all of the familiar characters, plot lines and dialogue that we have grown accustomed to in movies like this. This is the Western Family version of Rudy. It's not exceptional, just acceptable. Plus, I was surprised to find out how much this movie differs from the actual life of Vince Papale.",6,1,1,26 July 2018
Groundhog Day," I can watch this film over and over and over and over....
","This film isn't just a quirky and original idea, it also a fascinating point of view on humanity and how we react to various situations. Plus, it has a positive message and an uplifting conclusion. This film is one of the greats.",10,2,3,4 January 2020
How to Train Your Dragon," Talked up too much
","I liked How to Train Your Dragon, but not as much as everyone else seemed to. Maybe it was just talked up too much. The animation is unique and the characters are interesting, but the story felt flat and I found myself checking the clock at times. This movie entertained me, but not as much as I thought it would.",6,2,5,15 August 2018
Limitless," An entertaining ride with delightfully disorienting visuals
","Limitless is fun. The premise is pretty ridiculous, but it's an entertaining ride with delightfully disorienting visuals. I do wonder about the message of this movie, however. The moral of the story seems to be, 'drugs can make your life better, just don't get addicted.'",8,0,0,7 July 2018
Don't Breathe," A different type of horror movie
","Don't Breathe does a great job of creating suspense, even if it may fall short in other areas. This movie requires some suspension of disbelief, but, honestly, what horror film doesn't? The story feels original, the acting is good and it gave me the chills multiple times. In short, this is worth a watch if you want to be entertained by a different type of scary movie.",8,0,1,28 December 2018
Beauty and the Beast," Makes me want to watch the cartoon
","Watching this Beauty and the Beast remake is like watching a stage play of a movie you love. It's kind of fun to see the characters in real life and to notice minor alterations but, in the end, you kind of wish you were just watching the original film. This isn't a bad remake, it's just an unnecessary one.",6,3,4,27 December 2018
Sicario," Sicario is stressful - very, very stressful.
","Sicario is stressful - very, very stressful. And the scariest thing is that this film doesn't seem too far detached from reality. Emily Blunt gives a powerful and emotional performance, and Benicio Del Toro is mesmerizing as the mysterious Alejandro. This is not a movie that I can pop in anytime and enjoy, but it is a well-crafted piece of cinema.",8,0,0,23 November 2018
The Descent," I won't be spelunking any time soon.
",The Descent started to frighten me long before any creatures showed up. This movie plays on multiple fears at the same time and that's what makes it effective. It also takes its time to build up suspense before it gets to the truly gruesome parts. I don't think I'll be going spelunking any time soon after watching this film.,8,3,5,28 December 2018
Jack Reacher," I did not expect to like Jack Reacher as much as I did.
","I did not expect to like Jack Reacher as much as I did. It looked like another run-of-the-mill action movie with a nonchalant hero. However, I found it to be quite entertaining. Tom Cruise won me over as the titular character, and the story is compelling. This movie is unapologetically brutal, yet it feels somewhat refreshing among the bland action films of today. Well done, Mr. Cruise - you surprised me.",8,0,0,21 September 2018
Les Misérables," Vive Les Mis!
","If you're a fan of this musical, you'll be a fan of this movie. Les Misérables adds a new dimension to the story many of us already know. However, I wasn't impressed with some of the vocals. Yes, I know that the live singing allows the actors to portray more emotions, but at times the raw singing was just distracting. The acting is superb, though, and I found myself getting caught up in the emotions of the characters. Vive Les Mis!",7,1,1,10 July 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," I think I like this sequel more than the original
","From the opening credits to the final battle, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is highly entertaining. I think I like this sequel more than the original. It's a bit silly for adults, and it's a little too dark for children, but it feels just about right for teenagers. Is it a perfect movie? No. Do all the (many) jokes land? No. That doesn't really matter, though, because if you just sit back and enjoy the ride, you'll realize this is precisely what a summer blockbuster should be.",8,1,2,28 December 2018
The Da Vinci Code," A good movie, but a better novel
","The Da Vinci Code is a good movie, but it's a better novel. I'll be the first to admit that it's not easy to cram 454 pages into a 148-minute story, though. Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou are kind of bland in their roles, which is why Ian McKellen steals every scene he's in - he's having fun. Even with its flaws, this is an interesting an engaging ride through the world of history and folklore.",7,0,0,27 December 2018
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," A wonderful adaptation
","I loved seeing the movie come to life on screen. Sure, it doesn't include everything from the book, but that's practically impossible.",9,1,3,16 August 2018
Thor," A good setup for The Avengers film
","Thor feels a little uneven. There are moments when it is a clever, dramatic and well-paced movie and others where it's cliched, rushed and dull. Nevertheless, this film is an enjoyable ride for either long-time Thor fans or novices of Norse/Marvel mythology. Plus, it is a good setup for The Avengers film. Ker-Smash!",8,1,1,7 July 2018
The Happening," Not that good, but not that bad
","Not as bad as I expected. I actually found this movie to be kind of creepy and fairly entertaining. It's not M. Night's best work, but I don't think it deserves as bad of a reputation as it got.",6,1,1,3 January 2020
Castle in the Sky," A bizarre storyline with surreal characters and beautiful animation
",Castle in the Sky is exactly what you'd expect from a Miyazaki film. It features a bizarre storyline with surreal characters and beautiful animation. It's easy to get caught up in this world of flying cities and sky pirates and suspend your disbelief. It's a simple and magical story.,7,0,0,31 December 2018
The Shape of Water," Undeniably unique
","The Shape of Water is undeniably unique. The production design, cinematography, visual effects and score make you feel like you're in another world. The story, however, feels a little watered down. It takes an interesting concept and stretches it a little too thin, while patting itself on the back for being so artistic. I really enjoyed watching Sally Hawkins' and Doug Jones' performances, but this isn't Guillermo del Toro's best work.",7,2,5,28 December 2018
The Untouchables," A gangster movie a cut above most other gangster movies
","It took a special kind of team to create The Untouchables. With Brian De Palma directing, David Mamet writing the screenplay, music by Ennio Morricone, and iconic performances from Robert De Niro & Sean Connery, this gripping drama rises above most other gangster films. Some moments may feel a little cliched, and no, it's not historically accurate, but this movie is definitely worth watching, if only to see the train station scene.",8,0,1,18 February 2020
The Fountain," Beautiful & boring
","The Fountain is beautiful and boring. It features stunning visuals and an amazing soundtrack, but the story is confusing and the performances are a little corny. Honestly, I feel like this movie is too smart for its own good. It knows how artsy it's being, which makes the whole thing feel a little smug. I don't feel like I wasted my time watching it, but I probably won't be watching it again.",4,1,4,28 December 2018
Zombieland," Mixes sheer terror with belly laughs
","Zombieland is a fun, fast-paced, entertaining movie that mixes sheer terror with belly laughs. It also brings some fresh ideas to the zombie genre table. This film is no Shaun of the Dead, but it's darn close. Oh, and in case of a zombie apocalypse, take note, Columbus's rules WILL come in handy!",9,1,2,3 August 2018
It's a Wonderful Life," Should we watched every Christmas season

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," A good adaptation of the book
","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets may be one of the weaker movies, but it's still a good adaptation of the novel. It cuts out a lot, but it keeps the essentials.",6,1,1,16 August 2018
American Made," Too long and feels repetitive
","American Made starts off interesting enough. And Tom Cruise is likeable, as usual. But this movie drags on too long and feels somewhat repetitive. Also, upon reading the real story, it's kind of disappointing to realize how many liberties the movie took after claiming to be based on true events. It's worth one watch, but probably not more than that.",6,3,5,28 December 2018
The Witch," Occasionally spellbinding
","The Witch is truly spellbinding when it comes to cinematography and the use of sound. It makes you feel unsettled when nothing is happening at all. However, after it's over, when you start to examine the story and the characters, it all starts to unwind. It seems like an experimental film, intended to evoke emotion rather than tell a story. I'm not saying it's not effective, I'm just saying it wasn't for me.",5,1,1,2 October 2019
When Harry Met Sally...," Captures the anxieties of friendship and romance.
",When Harry Met Sally is a classic comedy. It's from a magical time when Billy Crystal could be a romantic lead and Meg Ryan was adorably not plastic. The dialogue is quick and witty and the characters are believable and likeable. Rob Reiner does a great job capturing the anxieties of friendship and romance.,7,4,6,10 July 2018
Zero Dark Thirty," Not overly political
","Zero Dark Thirty may have a slow, tedious beginning, but the ending is absolutely riveting. It feels very realistic, even if it may not be 100% accurate. Plus, it gives you an idea of what we had to go through to find Osama Bin Laden. It's not overly political, either, which is nice. I don't know if I'll watch it again, but I'm glad I saw it.",8,1,3,30 August 2018
Crazy Heart," Great soundtrack, mediocre movie
","Jeff Bridges gives an excellent performance, but Crazy Heart feels a LOT longer than it actually is. The story drags along and only Bridges and the authentic-sounding songs keep it alive. Don't expect much and you won't be disappointed.",5,1,3,15 August 2018
Hercules," It's all about the Hades
","Hercules is a good Disney movie with a great villain. Hades really is the reason this film is a cut above average. There are also some memorable songs and some fun moments. I can't put my finger exactly on why this movie doesn't ascend to the Mount Olympus of Disney classics, but it's an entertaining introduction to Greek folklore, nonetheless.",7,0,1,10 May 2020
All Quiet on the Western Front," I can understand why this was voted the Best Picture.
","It's easy to see how All Quiet on the Western Front inspired the war epics of today. From the sets to the performances to the special effects, this is an impressive film. It is, however, a little surreal to watch a WWI movie with Germans as the protagonists, made in 1930, when WWII was only a few years away. I can understand why this was voted the Best Picture.",7,0,0,31 October 2018
12 Years a Slave," Doesn't deliver the emotional impact I was expecting.
","The actual history of Solomon Northup is a tragic and captivating story, but 12 Years a Slave doesn't deliver the emotional impact I was expecting. The film starts out well, but then it plateaus until the end of the film, and even the ending is subdued. This movie has a very realistic feel to it, though, and the cast, in particular Chiwetel Ejiofor, gives excellent performances. I'm glad I saw it, but I'll probably never watch it again.",6,2,3,21 September 2018
There Will Be Blood," Daniel Day-Lewis dances to the beat of a different drum
","There Will Be Blood dances to the beat of a different drum, and it's the unusual way Paul Thomas Anderson tells this story that makes it worth watching. It really is a unique film. Daniel Day-Lewis is absolutely compelling as the charming, yet repulsive protagonist, and you really don't know who to root for as the movie progresses. I don't know why I waited so long to see it, but I'm glad I finally did.",8,0,0,28 December 2018
Joker," A well-made drama grounded in reality, yet riddled with delusional fantasy
","Joaquin Phoenix had some big shoes to fill after such performances by Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson, Mark Hamill, and Heath Ledger, but his take on the Joker is definitely one to watch. In fact, it's almost impossible to take your eyes off the screen because you're worried Arthur Fleck is going to sneak up and attack you. This origin story of the Clown Prince of Crime is a well-made drama, grounded in reality, but riddled with delusional fantasy.",8,1,4,8 January 2020
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Great performances
",This is a well-made film. Jack Nicholson gives a great performance (it's before he got too full of himself) and it felt very real at times.,6,0,0,30 August 2018
Edge of Tomorrow," A creative and entertaining action-packed thriller
","Edge of Tomorrow is a creative and entertaining action-packed thriller. How did this not do better at the box office? It's much better than most of the sequel-driven drivel that Hollywood is churning out these days. The premise of this movie is unique and whenever the formula starts to get tired, they change it up or throw in a new element. Plus, the performances are well done -- I like seeing Tom Cruise as the reluctant, inexperienced hero. This is probably my favorite film released in 2014.",9,0,1,11 October 2018
Whiplash," I was completely drawn in by the movie and felt all sorts of emotions
","Whiplash is a story without a real hero. J.K. Simmons is a terrifying villain and Miles Teller is a self-absorbed masochist. That being said, this movie is absolutely compelling. I've never been in a band and I'm not a jazz fan, yet I was completely drawn in by the movie and felt all sorts of emotions - mostly fear, panic and anxiety. I hope to never encounter someone like Terence Fletcher in my lifetime.",8,0,0,31 October 2018
Bram Stoker's Dracula," A disappointing adaptation
","Dracula was disappointing. The filmmakers spend so much time focusing on visual effects (which were impressive), that other areas of the movie suffer. Most of the performances are either flat (*cough*Keanu*cough*) or over the top, and the film itself seems disjointed. Call me old fashioned, but I prefer Tod Browning's Dracula or F.W. Murnau's Nosferatu to Coppola's attempt at Bram Stoker's novel.",4,4,6,25 July 2018
August Rush," Simply a vehicle to get from one musical number to the next
","August Rush is a cute little film featuring some really good music, but at times this movie feels like it's simply a vehicle to get from one musical number to the next. The story drags and the ending isn't as satisfying as it could have been, but it's a heartwarming tale, sure to satisfy some people out there.",6,0,0,6 August 2018
"Hail, Caesar!"," A bunch of half-baked ideas jumbled together
","Hail, Caesar! is amusing. However, it's not the same level of entertainment I expect from a Coen Brothers film. The actors all seem to having a good time, but the plot comes off as a bunch of half-baked ideas jumbled together. Nevertheless, I enjoyed this love letter to the golden age of Hollywood.",5,0,0,27 December 2018
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," You've probably heard many of the jokes already
","Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is a completely ridiculous, yet very hilarious movie. There are so many quotable lines in this movie that even if you haven't seen it, you've probably heard many of the jokes already. It's a great balance between situational comedy and absolute absurdity. Plus, there's even some actual story mixed in with the humor. This is one Will Ferrell movie that I think hits the comedy nail right on the head.",8,0,0,21 September 2018
Ice Age: Continental Drift," I'm just tired of this series
","I bet Ice Age: Continental Drift hoped to distract viewers from its shortcomings with the cool 3D special effects. However, since I saw this one in 2D, the attempted misdirection didn't work. This movie stretches a simplistic storyline on for far too long, and it isn't that funny. I don't know if all the humor was used up by the first three movies or if I'm just tired of this series. I did like the Scrat sequences, though. He's still got it.",4,1,1,26 July 2018
American Gangster," Drags on for over two and a half hours
","It was interesting to learn about the true story behind the film American Gangster. Plus, once the film got rolling, it was quite entertaining. But, for the most part, this movie mumbles along as it drags on for over two and a half hours.",5,1,3,15 August 2018
Stranger Than Fiction," Live life to its fullest!
",A wonderful film about living life to it's fullest. Will Ferrell gives an amazing straight-laced performance and Maggie Gyllenhaal is just adorable. This film has a positive message and tells it in a compelling manner.,8,1,1,8 January 2020
The Wrestler," It felt like I was watching someone else's home movies
","While Mickey Rourke gives a spectacular and realistic performance of a former celebrity down on his luck, the film wasn't that compelling to me. It felt like I was watching someone else's home movies at certain parts. Maybe I was just expecting too much with all the buzz surrounding it.",6,0,1,6 August 2018
Dark Shadows," Not one of Tim Burton's best works.
","Dark Shadows starts out fun, but it falls apart in the second half. As the end nears, this film takes a darker, more serious tone, which doesn't feel right after the fairly humorous beginning. It also throws in a bunch of seemingly irrelevant plot points and twists as the end nears. Nevertheless, it is visually entertaining and it has some some entertaining moments -- it's just not one of Tim Burton's best works.",4,0,1,10 July 2018
Hancock," Up, up and average
","Hancock could have been better. I liked it, but they glossed over some plot points I wanted to know more about and they seemed to rush the second act. I think they should have made the first half into its own movie and saved the second for a sequel.",6,0,0,3 January 2020
Kong: Skull Island," I wouldn't mind a Kong sequel.
","If you're craving an action-packed creature feature with plenty of special effects, then Kong: Skull Island is your movie. The plot doesn't make a lot of sense, the dialogue is sloppy, and the impressive cast is almost completely wasted, but, there are plenty of fun monster moments to keep you entertained. I wouldn't mind a Kong sequel.",6,1,3,28 December 2018
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," The weakest of all Peter Jackson's Tolkien adaptations
","The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is the weakest of all Peter Jackson's Tolkien adaptations. Even though this is the shortest of the Middle-earth movies, the story drags on as if it were the longest. But I guess that's what you get when you stretch out one book into three movies. In addition, the battle scenes are so computer generated that they look like in-game cinematics. It's a shame that this film series had to end on this note.",5,3,3,31 October 2018
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Best one of the prequels
","Revenge of the Sith is the best one of the prequels. There is emotion and power in this episode far beyond Episode I and II. Plus, there are a lot of lightsabers in this one. More lightsabers = better, in my opinion.",6,0,2,22 August 2018
Shooter," Tries to be too political.
","The downfall of Shooter is that it tries to be too political. It was working as a straight-forward action movie in the beginning, but then it kept throwing in mumbled discussions of patriotism and terrorism amidst the shooting and the explosions and the cliched dialogue. This movie would have been much better if it didn't have a political agenda.",4,0,3,10 July 2018
The Lion King," Long live the King!
","This is one of the best Disney movies of all time. The story is compelling, the characters are memorable and the music is moving. The Lion King is entertaining to both children and adults. Long live the King!",10,1,1,6 August 2018
Inception," If your brain is feeling flabby, take it to Inception for a good workout.
","If your brain is feeling flabby, take it to Inception for a good workout. Christopher Nolan, once again, tells a fascinating story in a very unique way. I also applaud Nolan's decision to not do this film in trendy 3-D. I'm sure I will be thinking (and dreaming) about Inception for days to come",9,0,1,6 August 2018
Murder on the Orient Express," A bland and somber whodunnit
","Based on an Agatha Christie novel and featuring an impressive ensemble cast, Murder on the Orient Express should have been a thrilling ride. Instead, this movie chugs along the same tracks we've seen before, without any real excitement or cleverness. It also fails to explain how Poirot comes to his conclusions and, therefore, the viewer must assume he just figured it out somehow. This is a bland and somber whodunnit.",5,0,0,2 January 2020
The Secret Life of Pets," Borrows most of its tricks from other animated movies
","The problem with The Secret Life of Pets is that we've seen it before. This movie borrows most of its tricks from Toy Story, Oliver & Company, Flushed Away and other animated features that came before it. It doesn't really have anything to make it stand out from the crowd. This isn't a bad movie, it just isn't anything special.",5,0,2,28 December 2018
WALL·E," Impressive storytelling, but overhyped
","I think I was expecting too much from this film. It had been talked up so much that there really was no way it could live up to its reputation. I liked it, but I wasn't wowed by it. It's impressive how they can say so much with very little dialogue, but I felt it dragged in parts. However, young children kids will really like it.",8,0,1,17 February 2019
Finding Dory," Finding Nemo Lite
","Finding Dory feels like Finding Nemo Lite. It looks a lot like its predecessor, but it's missing a lot of the charm and emotion. This movie just feels like it's going through the motions. It's likeable, though. The animation is engaging and some of the new characters are interesting. At least it's better than Cars 2 -- then again, most movies are.",5,0,2,27 December 2018
Arrival," Feels like a realistic response to an extraterrestrial encounter
","Arrival seems very plausible, which is why it works. It feels like a realistic response to an extraterrestrial encounter. This isn't an action-packed alien invasion blockbuster -- it's a deep-thinking drama about trying to understand the incomprehensible. Amy Adams carries this movie, and Jeremy Renner isn't annoying. This is slow, but smart science fiction.",8,0,2,27 December 2018
The Blind Side," A heartwarming inspirational sports movie
","The Blind Side is a heartwarming inspirational sports movie. The performances were believable and enjoyable. Also, the filmmakers do a good job of not being overly sentimental. It's always refreshing to see a story where mostly good things happen without too much negativity.",8,0,1,15 August 2018
Parasite," Bong Joon-ho's drama/thriller/comedy is definitely worth seeing
","It's hard to nail down what type of movie Parasite is, but this drama/thriller/comedy is definitely worth seeing. Bong Joon-ho tells this story in a way that keeps you engaged and keeps you guessing, with protagonists you can't fully like and antagonists you don't really hate. Even though I may not agree with every decision this film makes, I enjoyed the journey and I'll be thinking about it for a very long time.",8,10,14,31 January 2020
Rango," An animated movie that isn't afraid to get ugly
","Rango is an animated movie that isn't afraid to get ugly. The characters have a unique look and some of the animation is very realistic. The storyline isn't anything new, and it's definitely not for younger children, but it's a fun little movie with excellent voice work that is worth watching. . .once.",6,0,0,10 July 2018
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Too artsy for its own good
","Birdman is definitely creative. However, I feel like, at times, this film is too artsy for its own good. The cinematography is compelling and pulls the viewer relentlessly from scene to scene -- it's impressive to watch. The performances are also very strong. But it seems like when the filmmakers couldn't figure out where they wanted the story to go, they would throw in randomness and hope the audience would think they were being profound. Frankly, I think Best Picture should have gone to Boyhood.",7,1,1,31 October 2018
The Big Short," I'm not smart enough to fully understand it.
","I appreciate that The Big Short tries to dumb down the housing crisis of 2008, but, apparently, I'm still not smart enough to fully understand it. A lot of this movie went over my head, but I grasped the generalities and it kept me entertained, so I applaud it for that. This film also featured some great performances by the cast, who lose themselves in their respective roles. This movie is a downer, but it's an educational downer.",Null,156,166,26 December 2018
The Conjuring," An effective horror movie
","The Conjuring is a laundry list of haunted house clichÃ©s, but somehow it still manages to be an effective horror movie. It's effective in the atmospheric terror, it's effective in the jump scares -- it just works. This film gives you protagonists that you care about and an antagonist that is truly frightening. Plus, the actual story of The Warrens is fascinating, as well. Overall, this is a great scary movie.",8,0,0,5 October 2018
Platoon," Not much different from other Vietnam War dramas
","Platoon is a good film, but it doesn't really do much to separate itself from the rest of the pack of Vietnam War movies from around that time. Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe give great performances, even if the rest of the cast is fairly one-dimensional. I guess this Best Picture winner is deserving of that award, even if my personal favorite movie from 1986 is Ferris Bueller's Day Off.",6,0,3,26 December 2018
Prometheus," Creates more questions than it answers
","Prometheus is visually spectacular, but, in the end, it creates more questions than it answers. The writers spent so much of their time trying to be deep or philosophical that they forgot to fill in plot holes. I do applaud the filmmakers for choosing practical effects over CGI when possible, though, which helps create a sense of horrifying realism. However, when you start to really think about the story, the loose ends start to show and this movie falls apart.",5,1,2,21 September 2018
Halloween," There is something utterly terrifying about the masked Michael Myers
","Halloween is a classic. It may have spawned a slew of gory slasher movies, but this movie is actually quite tame in comparison -- it focuses more on suspense than blood. So even though it's slow, dated and predictable, this low-budget movie hit a nerve and started a trend, and you gotta respect that. Plus, there is still something utterly terrifying about the masked Michael Myers.",7,1,1,6 August 2018
Wonder Woman," A welcome addition to the DC film franchise
","It would be easy to pick apart Wonder Woman, but I don't want to -- I enjoyed myself too much while watching it. Gal Godot is completely believable as the title character, and Chris Pine plays a good second fiddle. It's a pretty standard origin movie, and the rest of the supporting cast is a bit weak, but this is definitely a welcome addition to the DC film franchise.",8,3,4,28 December 2018
Despicable Me," Good, but feels like it's missing something
","Despicable Me features fun characters, fantastic animation and a lighthearted story. I liked it. That being said, it feels like it is missing something. It was entertaining, but the characters are flat and the plot lacks development. Still, it is a fun movie to watch.",7,0,0,26 July 2018
Back to the Future Part II," One of my favorite sequels
","Back to the Future: Part II is a lot of fun. It's especially entertaining now to see the distant future of 2015. And even though this film isn't as strong or groundbreaking as the original movie, and it can't really stand on its own, it's still one of my favorite sequels of all time.",9,0,0,7 January 2019
Marriage Story," So realistic that it's uncomfortable
","Is it possible to simultaneously dislike and really like a film? Because that's how I felt about Marriage Story. The dialogue was so well written, and the performances were so realistic that I felt uncomfortable watching the story unfold. It was as if I were intruding on some strangers' very personal experiences. And yet this movie also features warm humor and a positive message. I hope to never experience the pain of divorce, but I'm glad I was able to experience Marriage Story.",8,5,9,31 December 2019
1408," Messes with your head
",A fun and creepy psychological thriller. It reminded me of some actual nightmares that I've had. Make sure to check out the alternate ending - I can't decide which I like better.,7,0,1,3 January 2020
Raging Bull," A bit overrated
","It's interesting how the protagonist of Raging Bull is almost completely unlikeable, yet you still want him to succeed. Robert De Niro does a great job of losing himself in the character of Jake LaMotta, and this is before Joe Pesci went full Joe Pesci, which is interesting to see. Plus, Martin Scorsese tells the story in a unique and stylized way. This movie may be a bit overrated, but I definitely feel like it should have won the Best Picture in 1980 instead of Ordinary People.",8,0,0,27 December 2018
The Iron Giant," Plays on every boy's dream: to be friends with a giant robot
",The Iron Giant is a fun little movie. I can see why Pixar asked Brad Bird to direct their animated feature. This film has a heart and it plays on every boy's dream: to be friends with a giant robot.,7,1,2,6 August 2018
The Woman in Black," A paint-by-numbers horror movie
","The Woman in Black is a paint-by-numbers horror movie. You know what you're getting and you can see the scary coming from a mile away. It does have some fun jump out moments and some hair-raising creepiness, but it's nothing new or special. Daniel Radcliffe isn't out of his Harry Potter shadow yet (I kept wanting him to blast the ghosts with his wand), but this horror movie is a good start.",6,0,1,20 July 2018
X-Men: First Class," A fun mix of actual historical events with a comic book storyline
","X-Men: First Class is a fun mix of actual historical events with a comic book storyline. There are some bothersome inconsistencies between this film and the other four, and it was fairly long, but overall it was an entertaining ride with good performances and some fantastic visual effects.",8,1,1,26 July 2018
The Wolverine," Spends too much time trying to be a drama
","How can a movie about Wolverine fighting ninjas and giant robots be boring? I don't know, but it is. The Wolverine spends so much time trying to be a drama that it forgets that it's an action film based on a comic book. Hugh Jackman still plays the character well, but Wolverine seems to work best on film when he's part of a team with loner characteristics instead of just being a loner.",5,1,1,21 September 2018
The Dark Knight Rises," The weakest film of a great trilogy
","Much like the final Harry Potter movie, The Dark Knight Rises is good, but it's not the best of the series. This final installment ends the trilogy well. It gives us inspiring heroes, intimidating villains and plenty of dramatic action. However, some important plot points seem glossed over, there are some cheesy moments and Anne Hathaway's role seems a little out of place. Nevertheless, I liked it and I will be proud to have all three of Nolan's Batman films in my collection.",7,2,2,10 July 2018
The Croods," Could have used more inspired humor
","It's one long cliché and it could use more inspired humor, but The Croods isn't bad. Emma Stone is charming (no surprise there) and Nicholas Cage does a pretty good job, as well. This is a fun movie with creative animation that the family can enjoy together.",6,0,0,21 September 2018
Black Panther," A compelling story, unique settings, cool visuals and interesting characters
","I was worried that people were only saying Black Panther was good because they were afraid to say it was bad, but it's actually a well-made & entertaining film. It has a compelling story, unique settings, cool visuals and interesting characters-Michael B. Jordan, in particular, makes a great villain. It's not the best Marvel movie ever, but it's definitely in the top tier.",8,1,6,28 December 2018
Creed II," Needs more Rocky & Drago
","When I first heard that this movie was about the son of Apollo Creed facing off against the son of Ivan Drago, I thought it sounded cheesy. However, Creed II does a good job of making that premise believable and dramatic. Still, I wish this movie had more of Sylvester Stallone and Dolph Lundgren in it. Nevertheless, this continues to be a well-made extension of the Rocky story.",6,0,1,17 February 2019
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Spends too much time on parts that don't matter
","If you liked Man of Steel, you'll probably like Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice. It has the same darker tone and, unfortunately, some of the same problems. This movie features moments of awesomeness, but it tries to cram too many plot points into the story and spends too much time on parts that don't matter. Ben Affleck makes a good Batman, though, and Gal Gadot holds her own as Wonder Woman. I liked this film, but I'm a little disappointed because I wanted to like it more.",6,0,2,26 December 2018
The Emperor's New Groove," Boom, Baby!
","I know that this isn't considered one of the Disney 'Classics,' but Emperor's New Groove has some of the sharpest humor of any animated film that I know. It's a fun watch for both children and adults.",10,3,4,17 August 2018
The Greatest Showman," The music is great, the story is simplistic
","The Greatest Showman is much like P.T. Barnum's shows-the music, choreography and presentation are spectacular, so even if the story is simplistic and the performances are hit & miss, it's still an entertaining movie that makes you smile. This isn't a deep, dramatic film for critiquing adults, it's a fun musical for the whole family with memorable songs and a good message.",8,0,0,28 December 2018
Monsters University," This sequel isn't necessary, but it's worth a watch.
","Monsters University is an entertaining expansion of the Monsters Inc. universe. It's not as clever as the original movie, but it's fun. This film seems to be focused more on plot than on humor, which is a little disappointing. Monsters University has a run-of-the-mill college misfit storyline, but it adds a few new twists to keep it somewhat fresh. Even though this sequel isn't necessary, it's worth a watch.",6,0,0,21 September 2018
Ben-Hur," This film is literally epic
","They literally do not make films like Ben-Hur anymore. From the elaborate sets to the exquisite costumes, to the deliberate Christianity, to the hordes of extras, this film is epic. The chariot race, in particular, is spectacularly executed. There's a reason Ben-Hur is both the Best Picture of 1959 and the highest-grossing film of that same year - it's simply amazing. It's really long and it's fairly slow at parts, but it's still amazing.",8,2,3,11 October 2018
Toy Story 3," The most dramatic of the three Toy Story films
","Toy Story 3 is definitely the most dramatic of the three Toy Story films. There isn't as much humor as there was in 1 or 2, but this movie packs a powerful emotional punch. Congratulations to Pixar for making an amazing trilogy! Also, congrats to Pixar disproving my 'Curse of the Number 3' theory.",10,3,4,15 August 2018
Trainspotting," A frantic, bizarre, hilarious and horrifying movie
","Trainspotting is a frantic, bizarre, hilarious and horrifying look into the life of drug addicts. The pacing of this film grabs ahold of you at the very beginning and doesn't let go. The story pulls you along, whether you want to follow or not. Plus, through the course of the movie, you end up simultaneously loving and hating the main characters - which is an impressive feat. In short, choose to watch Trainspotting.",9,0,2,27 December 2018
Before Sunrise," An interesting experiment in film
","Before Sunrise is an interesting experiment in film. The whole movie hangs on the dialogue and the chemistry between the two leads. There isn't much to the story -- it's all about the conversation. It works, but it's not a film that I would watch over and over again. I'm glad I watched it, though, and I'm interested in seeing the sequels, as well.",6,1,1,21 September 2018
The Deer Hunter," Hasn't held up very well
","It takes a really good film to make up for being a three-hour movie. The Deer Hunter doesn't quite hit that mark. The entire first hour could have been cut down to ten minutes and the third hour is bleak and hopeless. The second hour is pretty intense, though. I think that this won Best Picture because it was politically controversial at the time, but it hasn't held up very well - aside from the acting, which was quite good.",5,5,8,21 September 2018
Saving Mr. Banks," I'd rather watch the actual Mary Poppins Disney film
","Saving Mr. Banks offers an interesting viewpoint of how Mary Poppins was made into a movie, but unfortunately, I didn't really care about the characters. Emma Thompson does a fantastic job, because I couldn't stand P.L. Travers, and I felt like Tom Hanks' Walt Disney is just another smooth salesman trying to pull one over on Mrs. Travers and close the deal. It's fascinating to see how much drama there was behind the scenes, but I'd rather watch the actual Mary Poppins Disney film.",6,1,3,11 October 2018
Jojo Rabbit," The delightfully dark comedy is verboten, but refreshing
","Watching Jojo Rabbit is a peculiar experience. At times, this film is delightfully irreverent. Then suddenly the story becomes emotionally poignant. And then somehow it swings back to the silly again. The dark comedy feels almost 'verboten,' but it's also kind of refreshing to see material like this in our increasingly hypersensitive world. Plus, Roman Griffin Davis gives an impressively nuanced performance as the titular character. I don't know how or why this movie works, but it truly does.",8,1,3,11 December 2019
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Offbeat fun for children and adults
","Fantastic Mr. Fox is, in a word, unique. The stop-motion animation is just as interesting as the quirky dialogue and unconventional story. Fantastic Mr. Fox is Wes Anderson's first venture into family-friendly fare, and I think he did a fantastic job (pun intended)! This movie is offbeat fun for children and adults.",7,0,1,16 August 2018
Thor: The Dark World," Don't think about it too much
","Thor: The Dark World is visually entertaining. It presents a bunch of new worlds (with unpronounceable names) along with interesting technology and advanced weaponry. However, the story is a bit choppy and the jokes seem like they were shoehorned in after the script was written. Additionally, it reduces Loki from being a cunning antagonist to being the comic relief. As long as you don't think about it too much, I think you'll enjoy this movie.",6,0,0,21 September 2018
Moonrise Kingdom," May be too quirky for some people's tastes
","Moonrise Kingdom may be too quirky for some people's tastes, but I found it endearing and entertaining. The filmmaking is definitely that of Wes Anderson, complete with sharp, witty dialogue and interesting sets and shots. It's not Anderson's best work, but it captures young love in a way that not many people have in film.",6,1,1,10 July 2018
Midway," Feels like a made-for-TV movie
","Midway feels like a made-for-TV movie. It's full of cliched dialogue, acting, and plot points. When most of your movie hinges on the lead actor's performance, and that performance turns out to be melodramatic and cheesy, you've got a problem. Also, the visual effects were inconsistent, swinging from impressive to corny. This isn't a bad movie, but it's going to be easy for me to forget about it.",6,2,4,11 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Easily the fourth best movie of the franchise
","Star Wars: The Force Awakens is easily the fourth best movie of the franchise. It fits in just below the original series, but it is definitely better than any of the prequels. The acting is well done (unlike the prequels), and it offers a good mix of practical effects and CGI. This film isn't without its faults, but it continues the story in a compelling way that feels like a natural continuation of the saga. I would happily watch this movie again and I would gladly add it to my movie collection.",7,3,35,23 November 2018
RED," Completely ridiculous, but absolutely entertaining
","RED is completely ridiculous, but absolutely entertaining. Even in its most dramatic moments, this movie does not take itself seriously. Ignore the plot holes, forget the unrealistic circumstances, turn off your brain and just enjoy this film for what it is: fun.",8,1,1,26 July 2018
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," A fitting finish to the Harry Potter series
","Although I am bothered by some of the changes they made from the book, this film is a fitting finish to the Harry Potter series. It packs a powerful dramatic punch and shows how far our characters have come from the original movie. I'm sad to see the series go, but it was a great ride.",8,1,1,3 August 2018
Unbroken," I don't want to blame it on Angelina Jolie's directing, but. . .
","While the story of Louis Zamperini is truly amazing, Unbroken doesn't quite reach the bar. This movie is missing the heart of the book it is based on. The acting is fine, the sets are good and the visual effects are well done, but it doesn't have the emotional punch that it needed. I don't want to blame it on Angelina Jolie's directing, but. . .",4,2,3,31 October 2018
Final Destination," Laughable writing and the sub-par acting
","Final Destination probably would have been scary, if it wasn't for the laughable writing and the sub-par acting. If you don't quite understand what's happening in the movie, don't worry, they'll spell out each and every detail for you.",4,1,2,15 August 2018
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The epic conclusion to one of the greatest film trilogies of all time
","The Return of the King is an impressive film because it wraps up the Lord of the Rings trilogy in a way that is satisfying for both fans of the books and those who have only seen the movies. This finale is a rollercoaster of emotions, with impressive sets, elaborate costumes, and eye-popping visual effects. The Lord of the Rings was already a great novel, but it has now become one of the greatest film trilogies ever made.",10,3,5,4 February 2020
The Purge," Too preachy to be scary
","The problem with The Purge is that it's too preachy. The premise is great, but the brainwashed, cult-like mentality of the country seems so far-fetched for a story set less than a decade away. It has some intense moments, though, and it sparked some interesting conversations. I'm glad I saw it, but I'll probably never watch it again.",5,1,2,11 October 2018
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," This movie is long, but it doesn't feel watered down or stretched out
","From the acting to the sets to the special effects, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is an exceptional film. This movie is long, but it doesn't feel watered down or stretched out - there is plenty of story and action to fill the time. Plus, Jennifer Lawrence doesn't have to carry the movie on her own. The supporting cast does an excellent job, as well. This film can't really stand on its own, but it's still a fun ride and a well-done adaptation of the book.",8,1,1,21 September 2018
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Catch you later, Bill & Ted!
",I have a hard time watching this movie objectively because of the positive associations it has with my childhood. I watched it a lot back then. It's just a lot of fun. This is an upbeat movie with layers of humor. You can't help but be happy while watching Bill and Ted on their most triumphant adventure through time.,10,2,3,16 August 2018

","The first 20 minutes of Godzilla are pretty good. Then the movie drags on with bland acting and a weak story for about an hour until it returns to 'pretty good' status in the last 20 minutes. It never achieves greatness. Even the big monster fights, which should be really cool, are almost completely obscured by darkness and smoke. It's impressive as a visual effects demo reel, but Godzilla is only mediocre as a movie.",5,0,1,11 October 2018
Looper," We need more movies like Looper.
","Looper is a clever film. Time travel is always a sticky issue, but this movie embraces the impossibilities and invites the audience to just enjoy the ride. And whatever flaws this movie has, it makes up for it with its creativity. Plus, Joseph Gordon-Levitt makes a great Bruce Willis. We need more movies like Looper.",8,0,2,10 July 2018
Heat," Drags on much longer than it should have
","Heat has some really intense moments, it just takes a long time for them to happen. This film drags on much longer than it should have. It did add a little more to the heist movie genre, though, and it was fun to see DeNiro and Pacino playing off of each other.",6,2,3,15 August 2018
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," It's just a good movie -- ask anyone.
","I've said this film is one of the greatest films of all time, and for good reason - not just because I'm a geek (which I am), but because if the impact it had on pop culture and society in general. Sure, George Lucas is a nut now, but in 1977 he created a story, characters and even lines that have been referenced and even copied again and again for over 30 years! Plus, it's just a good movie -- ask anyone.",9,1,1,11 October 2018
50_50," This film succeeds is because it feels honest
","50/50 could have been a dark, bleak movie or a sappy, manipulative fairytale. Instead, this film manages to walk the fine line between drama and comedy quite well. It presents a realistic look at a life-changing event, with excellent performances by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Anna Kendrick. Seth Rogen plays his usual, irreverent self. I think the reason that this film succeeds is because it feels honest.",8,0,0,20 July 2018
What We Do in the Shadows," A fun twist on the vampire genre
","What We Do in the Shadows is a highly entertaining take on the vampire genre. The cast of this mockumentary obviously had a good time making it, and it shows. This movie isn't non-stop laughs, but there are plenty of humorous moments to enjoy. I will definitely be thinking about this movie the next time I see a vampire onscreen.",8,0,0,27 December 2018
Deadpool," We'll see how well it holds up
","Deadpool is a lot of fun. The humor is quick and the jokes are quite entertaining. However, once you look past the shock value and the self-awareness, you realize that the plot is pretty standard superhero fare. I also felt like this movie relied too much on gross-out comedy to evoke reactions from the audience rather than being clever. I liked this movie, but we'll see how well it holds up after subsequent viewings.",6,0,0,27 December 2018
Cloud Atlas," A bunch of mediocre storylines cobbled together
","Cloud Atlas is a bunch of mediocre storylines cobbled together in a way that makes it seem like it's something clever. It's not. It's definitely ambitious, but I think the only people truly enjoying themselves during this bloated and pretentious movie are the makeup artists who, apparently, had an unlimited budget for rubber noses.",4,2,7,28 December 2018
Kingsman: The Secret Service," A fun throwback to the gentleman spy type of movies
","The reason that Kingsman: The Secret Service works is because it doesn't take itself too seriously. This movie is a throwback to the gentleman spy type of Bond movies, complete with fun gadgets and outrageous villains. This film is also very aware that it is an over-the-top spy movie and it embraces that fact. The dialogue is witty, the action is impressive and it just feels refreshing. It is also a bit more vulgar than it needed to be, though.",8,0,0,23 November 2018
Tarzan," I love the soundtrack
",To sum it all up: Tarzan is a fantastic soundtrack wrapped up in a mediocre Disney movie.,6,0,0,5 October 2018
Easy A," Loses a lot of steam in the second half
","I'm conflicted about Easy A. The story is interesting, but the plot is uneven. It loses a lot of steam in the second half. Emma Stone is fantastic, as usual, but the rest of the characters are mostly flat and uninteresting. Also, for a movie that portrays a strong 'don't judge' message, it sure judges Christianity pretty harshly.",5,2,3,3 August 2018
Fast Five," With Fast Five, the Furious film franchise reforms itself
","With Fast Five, the Furious film franchise reforms itself. It's not far superior to any of the others, but it's no longer just a movie about cars and racing, it's a heist movie. . . with cars and racing. Plus, it seems to be a little more self-aware of how ridiculous it is, which I can appreciate. Although I still don't see how these movies have made so much money.",6,1,2,28 December 2018
Green Book," Best film? Debatable. Good movie? Definitely.
",Green Book is anchored in two wonderful performances by Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen. Their characters are complex and nuanced and it's the relationship between these two characters that keeps you engaged. It's also interesting to see Peter Farrelly direct something that isn't as goofy as his previous movies. This story felt unique and was able to address the subject of racism in a way that didn't feel cliched or cartoonish. Is it the best film of 2018? That's debatable. But it's definitely enjoyable.,8,0,2,27 February 2019
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Just when I thought these Twilight movies couldn't get any worse
",Just when I thought these Twilight movies couldn't get any worse. Even less happens in Eclipse than happens in New Moon. The only thing worse than the acting is the dialogue - which was apparently written by an angsty teenager who has never talked to another living person in real life or read an actual book. Thank heavens I had Rifftrax to help get me through this movie.,2,0,0,10 July 2018
Click," Hits the right emotional buttons, but misses on humor
","Click hits the right emotional buttons, but unfortunately those poignant moments are undercut by persistent juvenile humor. It's just hard to take this movie seriously when it's trying to be serious. I have no complaints about Kate Beckinsale in this movie, though. She did a great job, as always.",6,4,6,28 December 2018
John Wick: Chapter 2," An obvious set up for a third movie
","John Wick: Chapter 2 is just as fun as the original, action-wise, but it unfortunately cannot stand on its own. It picks up right after the events of the first film, and the ending is an obvious set up for a third movie. Nevertheless, the fight scenes feature amazing choreography that is brutally entertaining, and I look forward to seeing more of John Wick's story unfold.",8,0,2,28 December 2018
Annihilation," One great scene, the rest is pretentious & confusing
","Aside from the stunning visual effects and one horrifying scene, Annihilation isn't worth your time. The actors all seem as if they are sedated, and this film kind of functions as a sedative as well. The interesting moments are overshadowed by an intentionally confusing and pretentious plot. I hate to say it, but this sci-fi experiment is a failure.",4,2,5,28 December 2018
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," A well-made vampire movie
","I was pleasantly surprised by Interview with the Vampire. Aside from the semi-Twilight-vibe, it's actually a decent drama. And Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt and Kirsten Dunst give some excellent performances. I'm not saying I'm an Anne Rice fan or anything, but it's a well-made vampire movie.",8,0,1,25 July 2018
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," 'Lucas Strikes Again'
","They should title this one 'Lucas Strikes Again.' Once again he managed to create a compelling story (though he didn't write the screenplay OR direct it) where the bad guys keep winning throughout the entire film! I only wish that I could go back in time to see how people reacted when Darth Vader's secret past was revealed -- oh well, that's what I have kids for. Shhh! Don't spoil it for them!",9,0,0,11 October 2018
Minions," Obviously made for small children
","I don't get Minions. I don't understand how this movie became one of the highest-grossing films of all time. It's certainly not as clever or as funny as the Despicable Me movies. This movie was obviously made for small children. My kids got a kick out of it, but I honestly don't think I laughed out loud once. Minions strikes me as the type of movie parents will put on for their children before quickly exiting the room.",4,0,0,26 December 2018
Aladdin," Fun story with entertaining characters and an incredible soundtrack
","Aladdin is a fantastic film. Sure, some of the jokes are dated now (some of them were dated back then), but over 20 years later, this movie still holds up quite well. It's a fun story with entertaining characters and an incredible soundtrack. This easily makes the top ten list of my favorite Disney movies of all time.",10,0,0,11 October 2018
Incredibles 2," A worthy sequel, but not a great one
","Incredibles 2 is good. It's not great, like the original, but it's still good. If I had to pinpoint the missing ingredient, I'd say that while this movie has plenty of action and humor, it's missing the heart. It just doesn't have the emotional depth that the first film did. That being said, it's still a worthy sequel to my favorite Pixar film. I guess I just expected more.",7,2,2,28 December 2018
Inside Llewyn Davis," The music is better than the movie
","Inside Llewyn Davis features beautiful, soothing music...and that's about it. The story really doesn't go anywhere, and yet I still stayed interested. I guess that's a credit to the acting and the filmmakers. This isn't one of my favorite films by the Coen brothers, but it's definitely not the worst one.",6,1,5,28 December 2018
Saboteur," Could have used a better editor
","Saboteur is another of Hitchcock's movies about an innocent man, wrongfully accused, on the run. What sets this movie apart from the others is its finale on the Statue of Liberty. Nevertheless, this film suffers from some issues with editing, where some scenes run too long, and other scenes are cut too short or not included at all. It's a good movie, but it feels like it was rushed to production.",6,1,2,31 December 2018
The Cabin in the Woods," Horror fans will enjoy the ride
","The Cabin in the Woods is a bit confusing at first, but if you hold on tight and pay attention, you're gonna enjoy the ride. This film eviscerates slasher movie archetypes and presents audiences with a unique and, frankly, smarter horror movie -- complete with Joss Whedon's trademark wit and clever writing. Plus, the climax won me over with a horror reference smorgasbord. I wasn't sure at first, but the more I think about this film, the more I like it.",8,2,3,7 July 2018
Spectre," The best Daniel Craig Bond film
","Spectre is, in my humble opinion, the best Daniel Craig Bond film. It feels like classic James Bond, instead of the Bourne-Bond hybrid we've had in the last three films. It's not without its issues, but this movie is entertaining enough that I was willing to turn off my brain at parts and just enjoy the ride. Welcome back, Bond. We've missed you.",8,6,8,23 November 2018
Braveheart," A compelling drama with powerful performances
","Is Braveheart historically accurate? No. Is it a compelling drama with powerful performances and amazing production value? Yes. There is a reason that this film is still on the forefront of so many people's minds almost two decades after it was made - it holds up very well. The story is inspiring, the setting feels authentic and the soundtrack is absolutely beautiful. I don't think Mel Gibson made this movie to be included in the history books, I believe that he made this movie for the same reason that most directors make movies: to tell an interesting tale in an entertaining way.",10,2,5,5 October 2018
Joy," Bizarre and somewhat unpleasant to watch
","The first half of Joy is bizarre and somewhat unpleasant to watch. I don't know if the filmmakers are intentionally trying to be off-putting or if it's just an artistic misfire, but if you can make it through that part, the last half is actually pretty good. Jennifer Lawrence once again proves that she can really act when given the right material. However, I can see why this movie didn't do better with audiences.",6,1,2,28 December 2018
Moon," Well-thought-out, well-written and well-made
","Moon is absolutely fascinating. Sam Rockwell carries the film practically all by himself. It's a bit slow, but the pacing is an integral part of the movie. It's classic science fiction without all the flashy special effects. This is a well-thought-out, well-written and well-made film.",8,1,2,15 August 2018
Happy Feet," Made me want to club a bunch of penguins
","Happy Feet made me want to club a bunch of penguins, and I don't think that's the reaction the filmmakers were hoping for. This movie starts out annoying, then it gets boring and then it becomes really preachy. The songs are corny, the voice acting is cheesy and the story is clichéd and awful. Seriously, Academy? You picked this as the Best Animated Feature of 2006?",2,0,3,28 December 2018
Her," Doesn't feel that far from reality
","Her is great science fiction because it doesn't feel that far from reality. The setting, the technology and even the clothing styles seem like they could actually exist in a few years. Joaquin Phoenix carries this movie on his shoulders, and his relationship with Samantha, though artificial on a number of levels, feels realistic. They could have cut 20 to 30 minutes from this movie, however, and it would have been better for it. It tends to drag on in parts. Still, this is a film worth seeing -- because it may be our future.",8,0,0,5 October 2018
Slumdog Millionaire," Part game show, part drama, part romance
","Slumdog Millionaire deserves the praise it has gotten. Part game show, part drama, part romance - this film can appeal to anyone. It manages to be horrifying, humorous, upsetting and uplifting all at the same time. A very well-done film that I will see again and would recommend to almost anyone. Finally, the Academy Awards got something right.",10,0,0,16 August 2018
The Nice Guys," Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling make a pretty good duo
","The Nice Guys is clever, but not as clever as it thinks it is. I'm always happy to see an original story in the midst of the sea of sequels, however, this film is unnecessarily complicated. The plot actually detracts from the movie at times. Still, Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling make a pretty good duo. I'd like to see them work together again.",6,1,2,27 December 2018
Mad Max: Fury Road," Confusing, unsettling and absolutely entertaining
","Mad Max: Fury Road is confusing, it's unsettling and it's absolutely entertaining. Even though this is a sequel, George Miller has given us the most unique film of 2015. It really is like nothing you've seen before. Plus, this movie is filled to the brim with impressive practical effects and remarkable stunt work. This is an adrenaline-fueled ride through the mind of a crazy person, and I was happy to be a passenger.",8,0,1,23 November 2018
Hacksaw Ridge," An emotional and brutally beautiful film
","I was worried that Hacksaw Ridge was going to be preachy, but instead I found myself completely caught up in this emotional and brutally beautiful film. Andrew Garfield does a great job of making you think he's both completely foolish and totally reasonable as Desmond Doss. This is the story of one man sticking to his convictions, while allowing others the same privilege -- and I really appreciated that.",8,2,2,27 December 2018
Warcraft," Zug zug!
","Warcraft is yet another failed attempt at adapting a video game into a movie. Aside from some interesting animation, this film doesn't have much to offer. The story is predictable, the action is bland and the humor falls flat. Do yourself a favor and find a copy of the old Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness DOS game instead - it's much more fun than watching this movie. Zug zug!",3,1,4,27 December 2018
Pocahontas," One great song wrapped in a mediocre movie
","Pocahontas is one great song wrapped in mediocre movie. After The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, it seemed that Walt Disney Animation Studios could do no wrong, but this appears to be when Disney passed the torch of quality films with heart over to Pixar, since this came out the same year as Toy Story.",4,0,4,11 August 2019
The Social Network," A fascinating take on the origins of Facebook
","The Social Network presents a fascinating take on the origins of Facebook and the social media craze. David Fincher does a spectacular job of creating complex characters that go from despicable to likable and back in a matter of minutes. From the story to the acting to the soundtrack - this movie excelled. I was surprised by how much I liked this film, even with all the hype surrounding it.",8,3,4,3 August 2018
Back to the Future," Great Scott, Robert Zemeckis! You invented a classic!
","Back to the Future isn't only a great comedy and a thrilling sci-fi adventure, it's also one of the greatest movies ever made. Marty and Doc are timeless characters in an enduring story about standing up for yourself, taking charge of your destiny and matchmaking your parents. Plus, the years have only added another layer of nostalgia to this time-travel tale. Great Scott, Robert Zemeckis! You invented a classic!",10,3,4,28 December 2018
Goodfellas," An engaging film that keeps you guessing
","Goodfellas is one of those films that I felt like I needed to see, but never really wanted to see. I'm not a big fan of gangster movies and I've never really understood Hollywood's obsession with the mafia. However, I have to say that I was impressed. This film covers almost 30 years of the life of Henry Hill in an engaging way that keeps you guessing. Plus, the performances of Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci and Robert DeNiro are iconic. This isn't a film I plan on repeatedly watching in the future, but I am glad that I finally saw it.",8,0,0,27 December 2018
The Great Gatsby," Surprisingly similar to the book
","Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby is surprisingly similar to the book -- which means that it's well made, but it's also slow and depressing. Leonardo DiCaprio does a great job as the charismatic, enigmatic Gatsby, and his parties are beautiful chaos. I liked it, but, much like the book, I don't think I'll revisit it repeatedly.",6,1,1,21 September 2018
The Proposal," Just another romantic comedy
","The Proposal is yet another romantic comedy about two people who hate each other at first, but then grow to like each other through a series of wacky/zany/crazy events! And yes, it does have the obligatory rom-com chase scene at the end. This movie does, however, have the added bonus of Ryan Reynolds, who is always entertaining.",6,0,0,6 August 2018
13 Hours," Not your typical Michael Bay movie
","13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi isn't your typical Michael Bay movie. Yes, it has explosions and cheesy dialogue, but it's much more grounded than his usual fare. This is an intense film and the performances (including a very non-Jim-Halpert John Krasinski) make it feel more realistic. It's hard to watch, considering the true story it's based on, but 13 Hours is a movie worth seeing.",8,2,4,27 December 2018
Warm Bodies," A different twist on the zombie genre
","Warm Bodies is harmless fun. It's a new twist on the zombie genre that features pretty good acting from the cast, especially Nicholas Hoult. The movie did feel a bit rushed, though, and some plot ideas aren't fleshed out (ha!) enough. The story isn't as sappy as I was expecting, but it also isn't as funny as I was expecting, either. Warm Bodies could work as a gateway movie to get certain people to watch other, better zombie movies.",7,1,1,30 August 2018
The Birds," An effective horror movie for children
","This movie is not that scary for adults, but The Birds is a very effective horror movie if you want to frighten your children. This Hitchcock thriller offers plenty of suspenseful moments, and holds up surprisingly well, considering the visual effects of the time and the subject matter. My kids will never look at a seagull the same way again.",6,2,3,31 December 2018
Sully," A story stuck in a holding pattern
","Sully is an inspiring movie about a real American hero. However, for the majority of the time, this film feels like it's in a holding pattern (pun intended). It circles around the same plot points with no real sense of progress until the end. Tom Hanks, Aaron Eckhart, Aaron Eckhart's mustache and the rest of the supporting cast all give strong performances, though, and the scenes with the crash are pretty powerful. It was easy for me to like this movie, but I didn't love it.",6,1,2,27 December 2018
Princess Mononoke," I couldn't get caught up in the story.
","Princess Mononoke is a unique insight into Japanese folklore and the mind of Miyazaki, but it didn't quite work for me. I wanted to like it - the animation was impressive and the creatures and characters were memorable - but I couldn't get caught up in the story. This film wasn't for me, though I understand why others might like it.",5,3,8,20 July 2018
Jurassic Park," An impressive movie that made a lasting impression
","Jurassic Park still leaves a big impression decades after it first stomped into theaters. Even though some may say the visual effects seem a little dated now, this film still stands strong because it has an engaging story, interesting characters, exhilarating action, and heartfelt moments. I really enjoyed showing Jurassic Park to my kids, and I have a feeling this film will be appreciated for many more years to come.",10,0,2,14 February 2020
Beetlejuice," Takes the bizarre and makes it mundane
","The reason Beetlejuice is a fantastic film is because it takes the bizarre and makes it completely mundane. Tim Burton creates a world where you accept everything he throws your way because that's just the way it is. And while Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis keep the film grounded, Michael Keaton-who is often imitated, but never duplicated-adds just enough insanity to make this an iconic macabre comedy.",10,1,1,31 December 2018
Alien: Covenant," A satisfying mix of horror and drama
","Alien: Covenant is a satisfying mix of horror and drama. Michael Fassbender does a great job as Walter & David, and who knew that Danny McBride could play a serious role? Even if you haven't seen any of the other films in the Alien franchise, you can probably still appreciate this movie for what it is -- scary.",8,7,10,28 December 2018
The Martian," A nice balance of science, drama and humor
","I liked The Martian. This film has a nice balance of science, drama and humor. Matt Damon is able to hold his own on his own and the rest of the cast rounds out the story nicely. It drags at times, there are some pretty big plot conveniences and the visual effects sometimes look a little cartoon-y, but overall this was a very compelling film to watch.",8,0,0,26 December 2018
The Fighter," Not your average boxing movie
","The Fighter isn't your average boxing movie. This film features an interesting look into family ties and their importance and impact. Christian Bale gives a very impressive performance as Dicky Eklund - I had to keep reminding myself that this was the same guy who plays Batman. This film takes a while to get going, and it feels a lot longer than it is, but it's still very well made and deserving of praise.",6,0,0,10 July 2018
Up in the Air," This film has a realistic feel with idealistic tones
","Up in the Air deals with complicated emotions, relationships and people, yet still manages to keep a semi-lighthearted attitude. George Clooney plays the charming lead quite well (as usual) and Anna Kendrick's performance is right up there with the best of them. This film has a realistic feel with idealistic tones - I liked it.",8,0,1,6 August 2018
From Here to Eternity," Filled with unlikeable characters doing unpleasant things
","Aside from the final 20 minutes, From Here to Eternity is mostly a waste of time. It's filled with unlikeable characters doing unpleasant things. It also presents the military as a bunch of stubborn and selfish drunkards who had nothing better to do than fight each other and sleep around until the attack on Pearl Harbor. I don't see how this film won Best Picture.",4,2,6,31 October 2018
Furious 7," Ends with a touching tribute to the late Paul Walker
","Furious 7 is surprisingly entertaining. It's like this movie has accepted what it is, so the acting is hilariously melodramatic and the action sequences are unapologetically over-the-top. And then the ending turns into a touching tribute to the late Paul Walker. I'm still not a fan of the franchise, but this movie is one of the few that is worth a watch.",7,0,0,28 December 2018
The Godfather," Overrated? Maybe a little bit.
","Overrated? Maybe a little bit, but this is really a very well-made film that features wonderful performances. The pacing of this film will drive some crazy, but The Godfather isn't afraid to take its time and let us get to know the characters. This is an iconic movie though - no doubt about that.",8,0,0,6 August 2018
