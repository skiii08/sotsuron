The King's Speech," Awful and unoriginal
","The movie had no colour, other than brown, black and white. It was depressing to watch. If this is honestly how England looked back in the 30s, then just DON'T MAKE A MOVIE ABOUT IT. Why on Earth would we want to be reminded about how colourless and boring the world was? I did like 'The Godfather' though, it felt much less claustrophobic, and it was based near the same time period. This movie made me feel so enclosed, and trapped, and I couldn't even finish watching it. I ran out of the theatre 15 minutes early, but my parents explained what happened. Nothing interesting happened in the movie. Somebody has a speech impediment, SO WHAT? TONS OF PEOPLE HAVE SPEECH IMPEDIMENTS! TONS OF PEOPLE WERE ABUSED IN THEIR CHILDHOOD! THAT'S NOTHING NEW AT ALL! This movie looks like it was made in the 70s, but even if I watched it in the 70s, I still wouldn't like it. As I mentioned before, it made me feel claustrophobic. This may be because there were only 2 major settings where more than 2 minutes of footage occurred, or maybe because of the lack of colour. Although I think it's because of the horribly tiny and simple story.",1,5,21,8 October 2015
