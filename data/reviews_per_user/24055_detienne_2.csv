Mission: Impossible III," Just like Star Wars new episodes, number 3 is the ONLY good
","This movie is great for more than one reason. This first reason is M:I:III is the third of a very poor series. The first movie was insulting for the original TV show (the betrayal of Jim Phelps, the very reduced team). The second movie was just ridiculous (too much masks, no team except for Luther, too much Cruise, beyond unrealistic fight scenes). After this, I swore I will not see the third movie but when I saw the cast, I changed my mind. I was right. The third movie is very good and, compared with the 2 first, it's excellent. The second reason is the cast: what a perfect cast! So up to date! Hoffman is the bad guy we was needing, Monaghan is the girl everybody wants since 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang', Simon Pegg is the funny guy of the moment since 'Shawn of the dead', Jonathan Rhys-Meyer had to confirm he was a good choice for the perfect 'Match point', Ving Rhames'role change to become THE Cruise's buddy what is enthusiastic, we've missed Laurence Fishburne since Matrix: What a good cast for the year 2006! The third reason is the very good choice in the organisation of the narration: the first scene is stunning and then it's the calm and after the increase in tension with a lot of action during all the time. You can't see the time running. The forth reason is the explanation of what was always lacking (how they make the masks) and the eludation of what is common in all action movies (what is the lethal weapon which threaten the world: who cares? Let's destroy it!). In few words: I love this movie. Go and see.",8,4,8,4 May 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," With this movie, when you didn't read the books, you cannot understand why so many people read them!
","The movie is really interesting for the restitution of the landscape...only if you haven't seen the first opus. The characters are incredibly boring or predictible: there is no hero, no frightened but courageous people, no desparated quest, no impossible mission because everything is so obvious. The evolution of Gandalf is explained with five words and it's over. The battle is such boring than you laugh when Gimli says few bad jokes and just after you feel ashamed about it. The Ents are the most efficient way to sleep I've never seen; the scene in front of the Mordor's Gate (when they hide themselves with their coats) is unbelievable (even if the explanation will be found with the third movie); Faramir's behaviors have no sense, and Legolas isn't a fighter, he's a surfer!Fast food, fast movie.",3,0,1,26 December 2002
