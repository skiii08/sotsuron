Hereditary," A Total Apology of the Satanic and Satanism
","If you want to see a horror movie, you should not consider this one. It's not horror: it's nothing but satanist's propaganda.As in other movies of the same type (the Witch), there is nothing good, and I'm talking about the LITERAL sense of the word: every character has nothing but flaws: either they are proud or lustful or selfish or neurotic. The all face terrible destinies but you are supposed to feel no sympathy for any of them. They are horrible people who deserve horrible deaths.And that is exactly what satan thinks about the human race.The movie leaves you with a very bad aftertaste and makes you feel bad from the inside out. Skip it, even if you are not a Christian: it's a full fledged satanic movie.",1,1,7,4 April 2020
