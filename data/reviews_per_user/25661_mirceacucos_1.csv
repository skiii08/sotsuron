Mission: Impossible III," i lose my time watching this 'movie'
",Only big tam-tam for this movie. Nothing to see or to impress in movie. I am sorry for lose my time watching this 'movie'.. better slipping in that time..:) Tipical Hollywood business.. big budget for advertising and the movie is almost zero. I don't have what write to complete minimum length for comments (10 lines of text). This is all about Mission impossible III. Don't lose your money and time like me..:) You will be lucky if you don't sleep in cinema.. And after this movie is no problem if you want to drink something to forget..:)) Shame for Tom Cruise.. i see better movie whit this guy.. But.. for money.. play anything...,1,0,1,12 May 2006
