Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Better than the older three movies
",I loved the work that they did bringing the characters and worlds to life.I think the movie is very detailed with it's many scenes.In my opinion it was better than the old three.The whole movie looks better.I can't wait to see the next two editions when they come out.,10,0,2,12 April 2000
