Walk the Line," Best Actress?
","OK...let me start by saying that I have almost no knowledge of Johnny Cash, and never heard of June Carter before this movie was released. I FINALLY got to see this movie on DVD, and it was very good, but I just can't believe that Reese Witherspoon won the Oscar over Felicity Huffman in TransAmerica. I think Whitherspoon did a wonderful job and definitely was deserving of the nomination, however when compared with what Huffman accomplished in her role, it wasn't even a close second. The way my nay-saying friends explain it is, 'but she SANG!' Which is great, but if we are talking about giving away the award based on voice manipulation, again, I think Huffman wins. I think mainstream America got it's way on this one.As a side note, (remember I don't know much about Johnny Cash), the film didn't do anything in the end to resolve the impression that he was a socially-stunted, skirt-chasing, fall-down drug addict, who essentially embarrassed June Carter (on stage) into marrying him. Sounds like a guy any of us would tell a girlfriend or daughter to stay far away from. Because it is stated that they remained married for many years, until dying within a few months of each other, we can assume that he cleaned up his act for good...but if you look at it logically, she actually placed herself and her daughters in a very precarious situation. I know romance is romance, especially when it comes to the Hollywood ending, but if it had been my best friend, I'd have told her she was CRAZY!",8,1,3,4 April 2006
The Greatest Game Ever Played," We loved it - but keep in mind, it's Disney!!!
","I took my two daughters, ages 13 and 8 to see this movie last Saturday, and we all really enjoyed it. We are not big sports fans, but the movie is quite universal in it's theme. In the tradition of Miracle and Rocky, what it's really about is being from the wrong side of the tracks, sticking to a goal, and following your dreams even when everybody says you're crazy. It's Disney. It's a feel-good movie, so if you don't want to feel good, skip it. I read another review where the writer stated to go see 'The Constant Gardner' instead because it's much better. I can't wait to see 'The Constant Gardner' because I heard it's incredible, but I'm not sure we can get more apples to oranges than in trying to compare these two films. If you don't feel like thinking too hard one afternoon, and are looking for a reason to smile, go see it. The best part for me was during a scene where Vardon's ball was stuck in a puddle, and one of the spectators loudly whispered something snide within his earshot. My younger daughter, who is about as non-violent as they come, whispered to me 'He should hit him with that stick.' Priceless :o)",8,2,6,4 October 2005
La Vie En Rose," Nice Values. Pathetic. (spoilers)
","What on earth was up with the five minutes or so at the end of the film making a footnote of the fact that Edith Piaf had lost her only child several years prior to meningitis? We spend an enormous amount of time on her relationship with Marcel Cerdan, whose death is clearly made out to be the most pivotal point in her life, yet the fact that her child died is nearly insignificant in the film. I'm not sure if this represents how seriously screwed up Ms. Piaf's values were, or that of the film's creators, or that of society in general, but how deplorable - that the most tragic event in her life was the death of her married lover, not of her child. Thank goodness most women in the 'real world' have better values than what is represented by Ms. Piaf's character in this film.Perhaps I'm just simple minded, or have had too easy of a life, but I have absolutely no desire to spend two hours and twenty minutes of my time watching another person's utter train wreck of a life. This movie made me sad for the memory of Edith Piaf...how embarrassing to live an entire life and make such lovely music only to be portrayed 40 years later as merely a spoiled, drug-addicted puppet with absolutely no redeeming qualities. And if this portrayal is accurate, why oh why would we celebrate her life by making a movie about it? I'm not saying everying should be Disneyfied and I understand that tragedy is long standing cinematic tradition, but for my money, I'd rather see movies about women who actually managed to overcome the obstacles in their lives, and not simply succumb to them. There are so many positive stories out there to be told, why must we wallow in such dreariness?",2,10,27,30 July 2007
The Breakfast Club," Not nearly as good as I remember (and AWFUL for girls)
","I rented this movie to watch with my 15 year old. I was a college freshman the year it was released and I haven't seen it since. I remember it making some big powerful statement. Well, I ended up feeling pretty embarrassed watching this with my kid. All it really did this time around was make it clear how far we've come with representing youth cinematically since people like Cameron Crowe have come on the scene.The Breakfast Club now seems amateurish, laughably overacted and over-scored (Judd Nelson's speech about this family beating on him) and just well, again, pretty embarrassing.Additionally, it offered a pretty sh**ty message for young women. Molly Ringwald ends up sucking face with a guy who verbally abuses her all day...and Ally Sheedy ends up with a guy who would have been embarrassed to be seen with her until Molly Ringwald made her into a mini-me. Geez, makes you realize how an entire generation of supposedly liberated women ended up marrying guys who treat them like garbage, and are now addicted to plastic surgery.I think the only thing the Breakfast Club is good for anymore is to look back upon, roll our eyes a bit and be proud of how far we've come!",4,96,181,12 March 2008
