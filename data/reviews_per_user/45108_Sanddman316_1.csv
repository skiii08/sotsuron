The Longest Yard," Good, entertaining , and funny...
","Not a typical Adam Sandler movie as for his character-he's not his typical billy madison, happy gilmour-self but it is still a funny movie. The reoccurring Macdonald's 'cheeseburger' character was hilarious. If a wrestling fan you will notice 3 wrestlers in it-Stone Cold Steve Austin, Goldberg, and Kevin Nash. The football game was action packed. Besides being funny it was 100% entertaining and well worth the admission. The movie itself was about 2 hours long and not being a big fan of MTV itself they did do a great job of making this movie. Oh yeah, in the beginning scenes with Courtney cox her breasts looked phenomenal. :-)",8,14,29,13 June 2005
