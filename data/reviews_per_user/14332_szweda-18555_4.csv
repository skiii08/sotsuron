Hereditary," Dire disappointment jumbled mess
","Sixth Sense part 2? Not a chance. Not a patch on that quality movie that I have seen several times such is its enjoyability and I also read the novelisation last month to remind me how good it all was. So along comes another horror movie on the streaming service that I heard a lot of fuss about so I add it to the watchlist...
But!
Three goes it took to wade through this confusing mess but I was determined to reach the finale. Why did I bother? Save yourself 2 hours of precious life time and watch Cinemasins take on it via YT.",2,1,4,27 June 2020
Passengers," Glossy Twaddle
","Chris Pratt is always watchable but I can't think of him without thinking of Parks and Rec. What is Andy doing in space? Where are April and Ron? This movie just about gets by without them but the supporting cast is pretty, pretty slight that is, just two and a half really. In fact the 'half' is half the fun...
Maybe the best way to engage with this film is to not think too hard and just play a game of spotting the movie allusions like The Shining and Silent Running maybe TV too like Red Dwarf.
Hate to think how they expected us to swallow the plot such as it is tho. In fact Andy sorry, Jim, is the monster stalking the lonely corridors of a deluxe space ark with his steerage class wristband. No wonder he feels aggrieved and yearns for a friend. He finds one but he is just another serving appliance, a glorified drinks machine...
Maybe he is not a monster. After all what would any of us do in this extremely unlikely situation of having the pick of your next mate? Why, we would pick the cutest we could find of course... On a tangential thought, what would we make of this plot were the roles swopped, Lawrence the first passenger to be woken up...?
Anyway, there was enough here to suggest it for a rainy Sunday afternoon but while it entertains it also irritates hence my low score. It was too long too. And why the title? Kind of simplistic and unhelpful... Iggy Pop's song is not heard in this movie so don't worry. Whether you liked the ending is down to you but I thought it was a bit inevitable and flat... it could only ever end in tears so think twice when you sign up for that 'colony world' exit from manky Planet Earth!",3,1,3,17 April 2019
Sicario," Pretty.... disappointing
","Yes there is much eye candy on show here with beautiful landscapes in between some nasty nasty men doing baaaad things to themselves and each other. Some kind of government people come along and talk amongst themselves then go and have a look but remember to bring along some heavies with guns just in case. Not only that their cars have really good suspension so bumps don't matter to their teeth or tools. Once they have had a good look around they go back to queue jumping... oh I missed a bit as they get to use the fancy firearms on some underwhelming locals for some reason. Meanwhile, a girl cop hides on the back seat looking bewildered but never mind the nice beefy men gather round to show how tough they are and she doesn't have to do anything.. then some other things happen involved underground shenanigans and bad stuff like drugs they shouldn't be having. Along the way there is some swearing and sweating maybe a little grunting but not really enough to fill 120 minutes of our time and attention. Poor little Ms Blunt getting hornswoggled into this disappointment... go watch Narcos or Escobar for some proper fun...",2,2,5,2 December 2017
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Surprisingly bad given the cast and budget
","Another of those movies I am glad I did not waste my money on (saw it on ITV last night) and if I had not had the flu and needed something to do to while away a couple of hours I would resent the waste of the time.
Where to begin to try to make sense of the mess that it all seemed to me. Having also seen Spectre last weekend (again thanks ITV) comparisons are inevitable. Sadly, the Kingsman comes nowhere close either as some kind of comic book to film parody or attempt to 're-invent' this long-established genre (that does not need it on the strength of Spectre). 
Others have picked out the worst excesses of this movie so no need to repeat them here suffice to say none of these I found entertaining - and after all, is that not the point of a movie? And while it has extreme violence (yes, really off the scale) and f-bombs aplenty mostly c/o Samuel L, the only nudity was tacked on at the end in such a slipshod tawdry way I watched the credits in disbelief. 
The Bond films got it right more times than wrong, Kingsman never came close. Now there is a sequel but thanks to ITV I shall not be visiting the theatre to see that nor paying for a download. Do yourself a favour: instead of watching this travesty and insult to your intelligence, dig out an old Roger Moore Bond film and see a master at work.",2,1,2,7 January 2018
