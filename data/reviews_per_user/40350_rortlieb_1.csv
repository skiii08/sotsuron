Requiem for a Dream," A movie that you don't want to see, but you can't stop watching.
","Requiem For A Dream is the only film that I have ever seen that has actually pained me to see.  It's not that the acts that these young people are put through, its that they are so human.  This film truly transfers the pain of the characters on the screen to the people in the audience.Jennifer Connelly gives a stunning performance.  I have never seen her go through such a transfermation of character as she did in Requiem.  She is truly fit for the role, and she should be given her due kudos.  Not to slight any of the other actors in the film.  Marlon Wayons and Josh Leto give great performances as well and the women that plays Leto's mother in the film is stunning.  She truly goes insane.I would say that Requiem is definitly not for the weak at heart or those with a weak stomach.  It is though one of the most captivating films that I have seen, and it is not to be forgotten.",Null,1,1,25 July 2001
