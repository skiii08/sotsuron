Alien 3," Take My Advice: Watch The Special Edition, You Won't Be Disappointed!
","Few movies have gotten the controversy and attention that Alien 3 has gotten. Mixed views on the film have and continue to surface. Some love it for its focus put back towards the horror genre. Others find it disappointing by seeing it as a movie that doesn't do anything new with the series as they see it as a bit of throwback to Alien. Judging from the stars I'm sure you can figure out which camp I'm in.Let me be clear on one thing though, if you really want to get the best experience out of Alien 3 watch the special edition. While I enjoyed the theatrical release it was just so easy to tell how people didn't like it, as it's the more boring version. The special edition of Alien 3 actually catches your attention and gets you interested in the outcome of the movie. So if you didn't like Alien 3 and are reading my review thinking I'm just another person liking it because it's an Alien film watch the special edition yourself, you'll see why so many love it.Alien 3 takes place on Florina 161, a planet with an unstable atmosphere. Because of the harsh conditions on Florina 161, the few inhabitants have to stay underground most of the time. They also have to keep their heads shaved due to a lice outbreak on the planet. Ripley's ship crash-lands on this planet and she finds herself among the prisoner inhabitants of Florina 161, who are made up of rapists, serial killers and psychopaths. Conflicts brew upon Ripley's arrival and the arrival of a new, faster and more agile alien.So, why is Alien 3 such a great film you ask? Well, even though it's not an original twist to the franchise after the first Alien film, I'm actually glad that it's not an action film. While was the real trump card of Aliens, it was mostly because it was a different take for the movies. Alien 3 goes for a grittier and more suspenseful take compared to the in-your-face action and it works surprisingly well. While Alien 3 won't scare it'll still have you interested in what happens throughout the film till the end.As a master of suspenseful and thematic thrillers, David Fincher's touch to the gritty and dirty tone for Alien 3 shows very nicely. I'll also admit for a movie that didn't have a script when production began, the plot and flow of the movie goes very smoothly. One thing that might surprise you in Alien 3 is that it actually has a sense of humor even though it's a pretty serious and religious film. While the movie won't make you do much more than chuckle a bit in these areas it does help the film escape some moments that may seem a bit too serious.Alien 3 also has some strong performances to help the movie flow better. Weaver is once again Ripley but even after getting her head shaved you can still easily tell it's her. You've also got actors playing the prisoners of Florina 161 that help to compliment the serious tone. The viewer will even start to grow a connection with these deranged serial killers because of the situation they are in with the alien hunting them down. This effect works very well and makes Alien 3 arguably as good as Aliens, if not better.Against what seems like impossible odds towards being a good movie, Alien 3 actually comes out as a great movie. Every time I watch Alien 3 I love it even more than before, and the ending (which should've really ended the series) remains as touching as ever. If David Fincher is reading this then he must know that he has nothing to be ashamed of in this movie, it's excellent!",9,3,5,16 February 2006
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Makings of a Good Film Are Present, But Are Sparingly Realized
","One could argue that the Star Wars prequels were potentially destined for disappointment after the enormous impact the original trilogy left behind. In-spite of this (whether accepted or not by audiences), the prequels were met with less-than stellar reception; particularly the first two. Regardless, the films were released and are here to be viewed and, naturally, judged. So, how does the first chronological episode stand up in this mind's eyes upon recent viewing? Not exactly good or bad.To lead things off, let's start with the story; which feels good one minute and then insignificant the next. While the more politically involved segments (obviously to appeal to older viewers) are actually rather good, other story pieces (Anakin's introduction, the Gungans' inclusion, medi chlorians, etc.) feel weak and almost, if not completely unimportant. What's most unfortunate about the story, however, is that it's easy to see and find the concepts of a far more interesting worthwhile story, but the film tends to dodge the possibilities of utilizing these parts. While doing so could've brought the runtime to a borderline of three hours, it's better to have a film be long and more complete than short and feel like a tease.Similar can be said towards the characters. For the most part, the main characters aren't given much, if anything to work with (Qui Gon Ginn, Obi Wan Kenobi, Darth Maul, Anakin, Palpatine/Sidious in particular). As a result, most of the characters feel wooden; even the likable Liam Neeson and commendable Ian McDiarmid feel under-utilized. Along with Palpatine, the lack of real script material provided to Maul and Anakin really hurt the film. While Anakin is supposed to be this abnormally gifted child he really doesn't seem this way, especially with Jake Lloyd saying some ludicrous and at times unnecessary lines (such as him basically playing 'kid commentator' in the Naboo starfighter) which, combined with his annoying voice don't exactly make him feel like a convincing beginning portrayal of Anakin succumbing to the dark side.If anything, this film feels more like Natalie Portman's film as Queen Amidala (with Keira Knightley convincingly playing her decoy). Portman actually manages to have a fairly strong screen presence as opposed to the others. She (along with Knightley) manages to be one of the few convincing and seemingly adequate characters. Then there's the oh-so ever-hated Jar Jar Binks who, despite receiving every conceivable condemning possible, isn't nearly as bad as made out to be (well, from my standpoint). If anything, it's his character's slang and dialogue that are annoying rather than his character (which can be attributed to the other Gungans as well).Probably the film's single greatest strength is the design concepts and how they're handled in the film's technical presentation. For one, the film looks great, the battle scenes are nicely shot (and fun to watch, especially Darth Maul's lightsaber battle) and the artistic style is top-notch with some breathtaking and elegant images. And as if it needed an introduction, the score still holds up well and strong, even during the slow parts it manages to really sell the mood when played.Unfortunately, what really tears the film apart is that it doesn't feel like much of a start, especially in regards to Anakin Skywalker's character. It's rather odd that Jake Lloyd was chosen for this role since his previous films didn't show much talent (Jingle All the Way anyone?) and that's just the case with this movie. Despite how hard he and the producers may have tried, he more times than not comes off as annoying and nothing like the kind of character we'd expect to eventually become Darth Vader. While him leaving his mother behind is supposed to be the initial set off for his path to the dark side, this is barely even emphasized in the film. As a result, Lloyd's presence as Anakin can almost be disregarded due to his usually annoying or unnecessary significance compared to what the film truly focuses on.What The Phantom Menace shows is that containing hints of potential in a film simply isn't enough. When simply implying (sometimes in an easy to neglect kind of way) upcoming events throughout an entire film, it becomes too easy to look at the film as a little more than a tease. This is why films such as this, The Matrix Reloaded and Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest simply didn't work save for a couple aspects (which, conveniently enough is the action and effects in regards to all three). There's some good in this film and the action scenes are quite good and fun, but ultimately it's a film that promises so much more than it delivers. This isn't a horrible film since the action is very well-executed; but action and effects don't carry a film alone.",4,1,2,3 March 2009
Alien: Resurrection," Resurrection 'Borrows' Other Alien Attributes For Its Entertainment Purposes
","Most could say that the Alien series was better off with the end of Alien 3. But this is Hollywood we're talking about, so they'll be wanting to toss out another Alien movie just for the heck of it. While Resurrection shouldn't have been made to start with, it actually does a good job at being a decent movie entertainment-wise.Sigourney Weaver is back as Ripley, who's somehow resurrected after over two-hundred years. How this was possible after Ripley pretty much burnt to death in Alien 3 I don't know, but the movie doesn't explain this much or at all. This actually works to Resurrection's strength since it doesn't try to be a smart movie anyway.Since critics and other audiences didn't like the direction David Fincher did of making Alien 3 a suspenseful more than action flick Resurrection has been give the 'Aliens treatment'. So don't expect much more than a movie that has military action scenes with aliens involved. While this doesn't make Resurrection much more than an action movie with the name Alien slapped on the aliens look as cool as ever and the action is satisfying.The acting in Resurrection is below-average, but that's expected as this is the fourth installment in the Alien series. There isn't much logic in Resurrection but it doesn't try to create much logic. Instead, the movie just focuses on two things, action and humor. Not a smart move in part of the Alien movies but I like how the direction was executed.Alien fans shouldn't be too disappointed by Resurrection, it's got some fun action scenes. And since the over delivery of the movie is better than your typical fourth installment in a movie franchise it should give them even more reason to say that Resurrection wasn't half bad.",6,6,12,19 February 2006
Beauty and the Beast," An Absorbing, Magical Piece of Art
","I, like several others, grew up with films like this as a child, and this was one of those that always stood out. When I first saw it I was about five and I think you can tell that a few of the scenes scared me quite a bit, given the Beast's anger-filled scenes with the darker parts of the film. But seeing the film again for the first time in over ten years it was both refreshing and easy to still remember.The story, style and execution all feel like something out of a Shakespearean play, and while I've never been much of a fan of old William I do tend to like other stories that have similar styles to him, which I will admit to being both a testament to this film and Shakespeare. One of the film's strongest points is that it easily manages to make several emotions arise out of the viewer, ranging from laughter to sorrow and several others (with a fair number of these instances coming out of the most briefest of scenes, a very rare case for any film). There are several scenes in the film that are both serious and dark with others that are light and funny; it seems that for every serious moment there's a scene of clever comic relief to balance the mood out.While I was certainly curious and excited to see this film once again now that I would understand it much easier, one part that I wasn't looking forward to were the singing sections, with me not being a fan of musicals. There actually wasn't as much singing in the film as I remember, I'd say about 40% to 50% of the movie is singing with the rest being dialogue. Even though I can't say that the songs were exactly necessary to the film they do compliment the given scenes very well and while this may be the case with any musical film, the singing sections of this film give it a personality in a positive way, unlike several others.If there was any word I could really use to describe this film it would likely be ironic, not due to anything in the movie itself but more how it compares to others. What's ironic is that this film has a heart and the characters, despite being computer animations and creations with little visual detail (compared to the CGI-heavy films by companies like Pixar) and half the characters being enchanted utensils they still come off as far more human than countless actors in several live action films. Heck, even the Beast comes off as one of the more human characters once his inner feelings and emotions start to come out. If it's not clear by now, the voice-acting in this film is simply superb and, along with the film's beautiful and magical art style is probably its strongest point.Of course that's not to say every other aspect is any less worthy of praise, because this film is one that almost feels like no number of compliments would be enough to justify it. The story, style, acting, score, music, pacing and really every other aspect you could pinpoint in this film are nothing short of superb. If there really is anything that I could say holds the film from perfection it would be that the ending feels rather rushed. While there really isn't much more they probably could've done with the last five minutes beyond what there was it still felt like it went by rather quickly compared to the rest of the film.But this is really the smallest of complaints and something that really does little to detract from the film. When you hear someone say that this is a film for all ages, they're not lying, anyone of any age can love and appreciate this film with ease. This film, along with a number of others, show that Disney were truly at their best before 21st century. With the exception of maybe Pinocchio and The Lion King I can't think of any other film with the same style and genre that is as magical and marvelous as this. If you haven't seen this film in a while or at all and are struggling to find a good film for the whole family, be sure you keep your eye out for this one.",9,2,2,8 July 2008
Superbad," It Doesn't Get Much Funnier Than This
","Probably the biggest surprise for me with the movies released this year so far was that a comedy was the best film I had seen, the award going out to Knocked Up. Not since The 40 Year Old Virgin had I laughed so hard at a movie before, and Knocked Up had more than enough outrageous moments to make it shine. But now there's a new comedy out and not only does it prove to be superior to Knocked Up but it manages to be one of the funniest comedies released, period. My friends, welcome to the masterpiece that is Superbad.This comedy follows three seniors who could easily be labeled in the 'Loser' section or whatever you'd call the low class of students. There's Seth, who's basically the outgoing leader of the pack who tends to talk a load of smack about just about everyone. Closest to him is his high school friend Evan, who basically fills the shy guy part. And finally, there's Fogell who you'll come to know as McLovin; think of him as the idiot who will crack you up in all his scenes.But back to the plot, which starts off with Fogell talking about how he'll get a fake ID which Seth's 'love interest' Jules asks him to buy booze for her. Before long Evan tells his dream-girl Becca about the scam and he becomes involved too. This then climaxes to a collection of totally outrageous events that hold our heroes from getting to the big senior party. But regardless of the point in the film, Superbad delivers tons of laugh out loud, crude humor that is sure to quench your thirst for great comedic entertainment.The story and series of events in the movie is more-or-less an American Pie meets Harold and Kumar path. You've got some guys trying to get to salvation ala Harold and Kumar and hopefully get into a girls' pants ala American Pie. The movie also goes for a Knocked Up approach by being longer than most comedies, stretching to be just under two hours. While the film does have it's share of dull moments, the longer runtime ultimately brings about more laughs.While many comedies tend to struggle with keeping the laughs consistent while keeping things interesting, Superbad manages to pull this off with ease. And it's not just the pacing and laughs it does well at, the film also does an excellent job in making you love each character. While Michael Cera's character is likely to get a lot boos, Jonah Hill and Mintz-Plasse manage to create two extremely likable characters, especially Plasse. There's also guest actors Seth Rogan (Knocked Up) and Bill Hader (Hot Rod) playing two totally hilarious and crude cops added for good measure who also turn out to bring about a fair bit of laughs.In regards to characters, it's hard to really beat Superbad, because each one feels complete, even if a few could be dismissed as 'panzies'. Like Harold and Kumar and American Pie before it, Superbad makes the main characters and even some of the smaller ones all feel complete and believable. This is also something many comedies tend to miss the mark with, and it's nice to see that this movie made the characters so great.All told, Superbad is definitely the best comedy released so far this year. It puts movies like Hot Rod to shame and manages to surpass the stellar and almost as likable Knocked Up. This is a movie that just about any comedy fan can love, even watching just the first five minutes can make you a fan. Thanks to great characters and constant laughs, Superbad manages to step up and earn itself a spot among the best comedies you'll ever see.",9,1,6,27 August 2007
Terminator Salvation," Terminator: Throwback Edition
","When watching Terminator Salvation, one can't help but get a strange sense of deja vu throughout the course of the film. This isn't so much due to the characters or the story and how it's presented, but more thanks to select scenes that at times feel thrown in for the sake of nostalgia. With that in-mind, it's easy to view this film as more of a tribute to the other Terminator films (namely the first two) more than a truly significant entry in the series.Probably the film's only truly main issue is the plot itself: it just isn't that significant. Save for showing John Connor and Kyle Reese in the constantly foreshadowed future to give an idea of their characters in the setting. Really the film feels as if it's just trotting along to entertain rather than tell anything. There are a number of action scenes that come up every so often and these are the highlight of the film. From impressive special effects to very good camera shots and enough adrenaline to keep the viewer's eyes glued to the screen, Salvation manages to succeed very well in the action and entertainment aspect.With regards to the film's characters, they're mostly competent but not effectively used. Sam Worthington and Anton Yelchin are the only two here who are any exceptions to this, with Worthington being the film's most likable character and the only one really close to fleshed out well enough. Anton definitely looks like he's giving his all to try and do justice to Kyle Reese after Michael Beihn superbly played him and he manages to do a surprisingly good job. However, everyone else just comes off as unremarkable and not in the least bit interesting. This isn't helpful, since Christian Bale, as with his predecessors, just can't manage to utilize the potential his character has. Granted, he's probably done the best job out of him, Edward Furlong and Nick Stahl, but even with that said he barely does anything to stand out from the crowd.As mentioned before, the plot could very easily be argued as completely insignificant. Really all it does is tell part of a potentially endless series of chapters in the long war against the machines. There are also a couple questionings that one might have with the decisions made in the film in regards to the series' continuity (eg. Reese's feelings towards the Terminators in the first film a la 'it can't be bargained with...it doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear...' speech don't seem to match up with him knowing Marcus in the film and, in the end, that he was a Terminator). These parts might not be glaringly obvious, but they do lead to some skepticisms with the film and its choice in progression.While it might sound like I'm beating up on the film and consider it a lousy overall production this isn't the case. In fact, my expectations were quite low and the film did manage to surprise me. There's enough fun to be had with the action scenes and the film is generally entertaining despite it's flaws. The film could certainly have been a lot better and, if anything, we could've certainly done without it. So if you simply want a film that entertains and serves a bit of a tribute to its predecessors, then get in line. But if you're hoping to get a significant installment to the films plot-wise with stakes along the lines of Terminator 2, don't be surprised if you're, well, disappointed.",7,4,8,22 May 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," At Series' End, At Finest End
","It's a bit funny that the third Pirates of the Caribbean film is titled 'At World's End' when this is what we see and go through within the first thirty or so minutes in. And given the film's near three hour runtime, it leaves far more to the film than the title might imply. Yet this is rightfully so, given the introduced circumstances and cliffhanger ending to Dead Man's Chest. Going in the Matrix sequel route, At World's End saw itself released very shortly after its predecessor, especially for a sequel. Not surprisingly, both sequels to both franchises were met with very mixed reception, almost having nothing but lovers or haters of each of the films (unless I'm hearing talk of another Pirates of the Caribbean film series). That said, what's one more guy's opinion? The two things At World's End seems to demand of its viewers are patience and multiple viewings. For a first viewing, it's quite easy to get lost with the plot in how it seems to twist and turn all over the place and makes the lengthy runtime seem inadequate in regards to fleshing the story out. Due to this, the film can be argued to have some pacing issues, though after seeing the film enough times the story comes off as far more cohesive and doesn't seem nearly as uneven in its pacing as before. While watching the same two hour and forty-nine minute film multiple times might seem demanding, it's ultimately worth it in the long run.Other areas the film has drawn plenty of flak is in regards to the characters, the acting and dialogue. Yet this is another area I must respectfully disagree. While Depp and Rush might not be nearly as good or charming in this film as they were in Curse of the Black Pearl, they, as with the rest of the cast, do a more than sufficient job fitting back into their roles. Knightley definitely does her most charismatic acting in this film of the current Pirates trilogy (as of the writing of this review) which, admittedly can sometimes come off as over the top, though most of the time she fares well enough, and certainly a lot better than just about any other actress around her age would have. Orlando Bloom also at least deserves some credit for this film since he tackles a more down, serious and emotionally torn character. He's far from the best young actor out there, but as far as I'm concerned, he does a solid job in this film and, like Knightley, pulls off arguably his best acting job in the series. The rest of the supporting cast are just as well, with Bill Nighy standing out once again doing a great job as Davy Jones.Easily the film's greatest strength though is its entire presentation. The film is excellently shot, with little to no lack of great cinematography. As with its predecessors, the special effects are top notch, and we get plenty of this demonstration in the last action scene towards the end. Speaking of the action scenes, while there's not too many of them, what are present are definitely amazing, with the aforementioned final action scene being quite impressive. Yet it's the film's amazing score that really sells the picture. While it hasn't garnered much attention make no mistake the score pieces throughout the picture are wonderfully placed and used to great effect. Many scenes in the film work so well thanks to the superb score. Not many films seem to utilize the potential of fitting score placement well enough, but this film pulls it off with ease and can easily win you over just for that.Judging by what I've said, I think it's easy to determine my regards towards the film. One key reason for this is because this is a film that becomes more rewarding with each repeated viewing; another viewing lets me take notice of several things that really make this film so much more than the majority I've seen recently. Call it blasphemy, but I hold this film as superior to Curse of the Black Pearl and definitely higher than the sub-par Dead Man's Chest. This film feels more complete, doesn't suffer dragging on as much from multiple viewings (the one major weak point of the first film), has far less of the silly, unnecessary jokes which plagued the second film and wraps the trilogy's story arc up satisfyingly while leaving us curious as to what will happen next. Give the film the time and it will grow on you. Watch it once or little more than once and you'll likely hold in 'mid-series' regard at best. Patience is a virtue.",9,0,1,13 April 2009
X-Men," A Thoughtful and Interesting Watch
","What Bryan Singer has done to bring X-Men to the big-screen is both smart and fun to watch. Instead of making X-Men about nothing but big mutant action, he's managed to make a good action movie with a good plot and puts everything in the movie together nicely and with some style in a few areas.Considering the mutants included in this movie, Singer has done, if I may say so, an excellent job in selecting the actors and actresses for each role. As far as bring their character to life, Jackman does the best job as Logan or Wolverine as he's better called by fans. Paquin does a good job at capturing the confused and seemingly stressed feeling of Rogue. But Patrick Stewart is the smartest choice in particular, even though Jackman does the best at being Wolverine. Not only does Stewart have the perfect look for Professor Xavier, but he also has the right personality and attitude, a kind of know-it-all but helpful and not-so geeky kind of personality makes him one of the more believable characters. Ian McKellen is a great choice for Magneto. Not only is he the smartest choice for Magneto, but McKellen creates a charming and calm kind of feeling towards his character, which even as a baddie he manages to make the audience like him. All the other performers of X-Men do their part to bring their mutant role to life, and they all do it successfully and almost perfectly.X-Men's plot is actually one of its better elements. Yes, you could go on saying how cool each of the mutants were, how great the special effects are and how cool the vs. battles were, but to talk about this movie and not mention it having a good plot is almost an insult. The thing I like about this movie is that it takes its time to let the audience understand everything that's going on and the movie takes what some might call a risk in not being so involved in the action sequences and using up a majority of the viewing time to let the story of the movie flow and lets the action and performers go and unfold the events that happen throughout the film. But since I don't want to spoil the simple but more than above-average plot for you, I'll keep it on the down-low from now. Just know that if you're looking for a good plot in X-Men you won't be disappointed.The action in X-Men isn't that much of a focus of the movie as the plot is, but not to worry, the action is more than satisfying and most of the time pretty cool. The special effects in this movie aren't used in a way that it'd make X-Men the king of CGI like King Kong and Titanic are, but they're nothing short of impressive and make the action sequences much more stylish. Most of the action is thrown out near the end and it all leaves a good feeling with the audience to make them feel satisfied and to have gotten a good share of action.But even with all that I've said in X-Men, it just doesn't seem to rise to that mark to make it an Oscar-worthy film. It's not that the movie lacked anything, not at all, everything in the movie was pieced together right, but it's just one of those movies that doesn't give the viewer that 'wow' or 'now that's a stunning masterpiece' impression once the movie ends, but instead comes out being a great movie that only lacks the beyond belief factor that the biggest movies deliver. But by no means is X-Men a bad film, there's absolutely nothing that I could say was particularly wrong with the film, it's only when you stack it against the best movies that it comes short, and X-Men almost seems to want to challenge those films in some way.",8,0,0,22 January 2006
Yes Man," A 'Has Its Moments' Film In the Purest Sense
","Jim Carrey has had a rather rough run with his recent films. After raising the bar with the obscenely lovable Liar Liar and creating a perfect casual guy goes party mode in The Mask, it seems he's had a tough time living up to his 90's classics. While 2003's Bruce Almighty was a decent watch it just felt a little forced near the end. Then there was The Number 23, which was an all-time low for him as far as I'm concerned. Now he offers us Yes Man, with my thoughts from the trailer being that I though it would be mildly entertaining but not a return to glory. And this is pretty much exactly what the film was for me.Carrey basically plays a man of reluctance and slight resentment in the film until he's finally persuaded to give a program a shot encouraging people to say 'yes' to mostly everything. Carrey's first thoughts are that it's as bad as he thought, but then things finally start to go his way in-spite of a few suspicions. The rest of the film essentially plays out like a casual romantic comedy with him and his love interest doing what they want and hitting the usual speed bump near the end with words and a couple events smoothing things out at the end.For me, this film had a bit of the 'Bruce Almight syndrome' in that the first half to 3/4 of the film are where the highlights are at, but the rest of the film felt like it was becoming a little too forced and serious. There were a few good, humorous moments during the film but nothing that'll make you choke on your popcorn and soda. My main problem with this film and other comedies is that sometimes they take things too seriously or feel forced for certain sections. This was the case with Bruce Almighty during the second half and Harold and Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay felt like it was trying to push the 'food for thought' aspect(s) a little too much. Yes Man is more or less in the same boat.If you're a Jim Carrey fan like me, then this film might be worth a viewing, though I'd suggest waiting for it come out on DVD and renting it since I was only entertained so much. I did get a fair amount of chuckles and laughs and it did manage to keep a smile on my face for most of the runtime. However, during the last roughly thirty minutes it felt like it was trying to change its style, which just didn't work for me.",6,0,2,5 January 2009
The Terminator," 'I'll Be Back', For This Masterpiece Several Times
","Terminator is one of those unforgettable masterpieces that will always be admired for how it stunned us. How Cameron managed to create such a tense and passionate movie is, needless to say, amazing.I'm pretty sure most of you are aware of the plot of the Terminator movies so I'll spare you those details, despite their importance. But the plot of the Terminator movies introduced here is both intriguing and interesting. The whole story is given to the audience by Micheal Beihn, who does an excellent job of fulfilling his role. Beihn also gives some excellent and memorable lines while delivering the story and gives each and every detail great seriousness. It's this effect that Beihn manages to pull off that helps the viewer get drawn in by this movie's story.Actors Lance Heinriksen, Bill Paxton and actress Linda Hamilton also make appearances in this movie, which may very well be the movie that got their careers started. But of course I'd be a fool to talk about Terminator's performers without mentioning the T-Man himself, Arnold. I don't think anyone could play our favorite cyborg like Arnie himself did. It's Arnold's unique, robot-like voice that gives him such an authentic acting flair in this movie, especially the good shape he was in. As the Terminator himself, Arnie got the pleasure of taking the load of action scenes, but with those scenes comes guns, which we know he loves.Hamilton has the next largest role in the movie next to Arnold and Beihn, and she's does a great job herself. Hamilton does excellent at acting as a hard-working girl early in the film and does even better as someone who has to deal with an undeniable truth. The rest of the cast let the movie flow its way but do their importance when it comes, which is something most movies avoid nowadays.The presentation of the Terminator isn't flashy, but what else would you expect from a film from the mid 80's. The action in the Terminator is both tense and very satisfying. Add that to the near-perfect style of the rest of the movie up till the end and the Terminator is a movie that you will not be disappointed by.",9,1,2,3 February 2006
Knocked Up," It's Taken Five Months For 2007 To Get An Indefinitely 'Good' Movie
","2007 has been a year full of surprises for most people so far. So many big movies came out: Ghost Rider, Spider-man 3 and Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End. It almost seemed like 2007 would be THE best year for movies and that those three would be the perfect evidence. Instead, most people walked away from those movies sour and found more entertainment in Disturbia, a less-than 2 hour somewhat corny thriller.Now enter Knocked Up, the next movie by the guys that brought you The 40-Year Old Virgin. The story behind the movie isn't anything new, a stoner gets a hard-working hottie pregnant and they need to work things out. But don't let that (or the disappointments this year for that matter) fool you, because Knocked Up is unquestionably the first indefinitely 'good' movie so far this year.Why does Knocked Up actually work? Well, part of it has to do with how easily accessible it is. If you're a guy that loves the outrageous comedies and has a girl that's all over the 'chick flicks' or vice versa, there's no reason why you shouldn't enjoy this movie. The style of the movie is like a mix between Liar Liar's lesson of responsibility and The 40-Year Old Virgin's outrageous and totally irresistible comedy. In other words, it's an insane comedy with a great heart.Knocked Up is a movie that you don't need to speak much about to really emphasize how great it is. All that one really needs to know is that it's a comedy mixed with some romance that works quite well. About the only thing the movie doesn't do well is the length, it's running time is noticeably longer than other comedies. But you know what? What's wrong with a few more laughs, honestly? If the first batch of movies have been 2007's disappointments, then Knocked Up is 2007's redemption.",7,3,9,7 June 2007
Alien," A Good Horror Movie Through and Through, But Not That Scary
","Alien is one of those movies that takes the horror genre and demands it to really be recognized. Now it's hard for people to talk about horror classics without mentioning how they were freaked by Alien. But is the movie really that scary? In my experience in watching it, I'd say no to that.Right from the credits rolling through space the movie reveals its dark and dramatic approach to horror movies. The effect works surprisingly well in the fact that the viewer gets the feeling that they are a passenger on the ship (forgot the name). Seven people, lucky number right? Well, how about we land on an unknown planet and bring along an alien as an eight passenger? Ridley Scott takes all the precautions necessary to make Alien a believable film in and of its plot. Not once does the movie fail to impress the viewer with a thought of 'Could this really be space travel in the future?' Another thing I liked about Alien was that the character development was impressive. Almost right from the start the viewer knows who's who and they get to know and love each person before, well, we'll let the movie speak for itself here. Not one actor/actress seemed inappropriately cast, and it's this that makes almost each passenger aboard the ship seem like family to the viewer. At least, this effect lasts for the time being until almost all of them are pretty much slaughtered or stealth-killed as if the alien were Sam Fisher.That's another thing to give Alien a lot of credit for, the Alien itself. Yes, Ripley might be the most recognizable character in the Alien movies, but Alien makes the alien of the movie a character of its own. Whether the alien is CGI or not it seems like he's one of the passengers, just the very angry and not-so welcome one. Another thing I found astonishing with Alien is the special effects in general. Right when you see the ship in space you'll be amazed with how real it looks for a film of the late 70's. This is one effect that makes Alien a movie to really pay attention to in its own age.Now, let me be honest with you on this part. Everyone says that this is possibly the scariest movie ever, that every time they watch it they are scared by it. So, I rent it, put it in my DVD player late at night alone and start watching it. And you know what, even though it caught my attention with a few suspense-filled moments, it just didn't scare me. Although the movie does hit you in the gut with each person that's attacked you'll already know that something has to happen, with an Alien on-board and all. So most of the deaths in Alien come as no surprise to the viewer, with the exception of one or two passengers. I might not have been scared, I'm going to be completely honest with you, I just wasn't, and the movie might've dragged on for me, but it had me interested. It's just that for a movie with so much credit as being scary I expected a lot more.Alien is, in and of itself a good movie, no doubt. You get a great plot, memorable characters, nice special effects and the movie captures the true essence of horror movies. But as a scary movie in the horror movie regard it just didn't deliver for me. This is the biggest letdown I can tell of the movie but I still enjoyed watching it.",8,0,1,10 February 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Has a Bit of an 'Episode I Syndrome', But It's a Mostly Fair Improvement
","Back in 2002, it was tough to go into theaters for Episode II: Attack of the Clones and be full-heartedly excited. After the overall less-than lukewarm reception The Phantom Menace garnered, Star Wars fans were left unsure if the next prequel could manage to even come close to being an improvement. In some ways, Attack of the Clones doesn't feel all that different from its predecessor; in-spite of a number of changes made.The story has a very similar format to that of The Phantom Menace, with two main story lines existing simultaneously (while occasionally intertwining with each other). First is the more politically-involved plot which begins with an assassination attempt on Amidala and an attempt to find the assassin along with the introduction of a later character's precursor (Fett) leading to the clones introduction to the mix. The other main plot present is Anakin and Amidala's love for each other, which I'll get to later on (since it's determined by the characters more than the storyline itself). In regards to the plot involving the clones (leading to the Storm Troopers), it's sufficient enough and is carried well throughout the film. Other small story tidbits are tossed in, but they tend to feel like they were tossed in simply to link the two trilogies together (such as the Death Star's conception).As with Episode I, Attack of the Clones' characters either feel weak or well fleshed out. Obi Wan Kenobi is given more much-needed exposure and his character is a lot easier to like this time around (with a mostly solid performance from McGregor). The supporting characters feel sufficient enough as well, with Christopher Lee as Count Dooku being a clear standout.However, the characters in Amidala and Anakin (especially in regards to their acting and dialogue) is where the film begins to fall apart. The main reason for this is that Hayden Christensen's acting is simply awful. Essentially, watching and hearing him talk on-screen here is like watching a soap opera. His voice and line deliveries will either make you cringe or say 'wow' in explanation. If there's anything that can be praised in Christensen it's that he's good at emoting when silent via facial expressions (so the scene where his mother dies works well enough).Unfortunately, Christensen's awful acting as Anakin makes the love connection between him and Padme feel misplaced. For most of the scenes in the beginning where he's talking to her she seems to react with a 'wow, what a (insert demeaning/derogatory term here)' kind of look on her face. And while Portman had a good screen presence with a solid performance in The Phantom Menace her acting her feels rather off, especially for her character. Another key complaint that can be attributed to both performers in the film is how they're left delivering these absurd, cheesy lines that feel like knock-offs of Shakespearean writing (giving the film an awkward, cheesy feel, respectively). For almost every scene of dialogue interaction between the two there's at least a couple lines that feel so melodramatic that it becomes so easy to be taken out of the picture.On the other hand, when the film isn't (lousily) trying to express and tell the love story it actually manages to be fairly decent. This can mostly be attributed to the action and build-up to the last thirty to forty-five minutes. By the time Obi Wan lands on Geonosis the film becomes a little more engaging since the focus moves towards the conflicts that are about to unfold and away from the unconvincing romance story.If it isn't implied enough by now, then it should simply be said: Attack of the Clones has excellent action and has impressive effects even by today's standards to support it. The ensuing battle between the clones and the droid army is one of the most intense and entertaining scenes in all of Star Wars and has a great, light feeling of nostalgia. Even by today's standards, the special effects are very impressive and top of the line, which only help to make the action all the more enjoyable (along with how they're capture on-screen excellently).One light compliment that can be given is that the film ends on a good enough note. When the score kicks in at the end with the clones marching into their ships upon the words 'begun the Clone War has,' chills are almost inevitable. While this does give the film a bit of a cliffhanger ending in regards to the Clone War, it manages to end on a fairly smooth transition to where it doesn't feel rushed (like some key parts of the pacing through the film).Attack of the Clones is, if anything, a slight though debatable improvement over its predecessor. While the plot, action and effects have improved, the characters and pacing are still glaring stains on the once majestic material. There's a decent enough film to be found here, though you'll have to look past the horrible love scenes to find the true film here.",6,1,2,4 March 2009
Predator," Welcome To The Jungle
","One of the most popular sci-fi/military movies ever, Predator has stood as a crowd favorite for many years. By combining a great cast, awesome action and effects along with an interesting feeling of suspense, Predator has earned itself a place among classic sci-fi movies that has, with a bit of help from the Alien movies one way or another, inspired many movie directors and producers but has been tough to top.Predator is set in the place that the military are best suited for: the big, vast and deep jungle of Central America. Major 'Dutch', played by Arnold Schwarzenegger leads a squad of commandos into the jungle to investigate mysterious disturbances, and being set up for another mission along the way. But they quickly realize that they are being hunted by what they cannot see, what they fear is the death of them, the Predator.While the plot of Predator may not seem much more than what you'd get out of your typical action flick it actually keeps you interested. This is all done thanks to the real star of the film, the Predator itself. The viewers, along with the commandos slowly learn what exactly the Predator is, how it acts and what they plan to do to stop it. Deaths are lost along the way however, until only Dutch and a young female hostage are left alive.Before the viewer gets the awful pleasure of watching each commando die one at a time they get acquainted with that very commando. It's how the viewer gets some form of connection with each of these beefy and dirty commandos that gives the movie a unique kind of feeling to it. Part of the connection that the viewer will get with certain actors varies from how they love the way they create humor or how they are impacted from the loss of a friend in the jungle. I might make the movie sound cheesy and sleezy but you have to watch it to understand what I mean.But it's not just passion for commandos that Predator tosses at the audience, no, it's more than that. There is a good share of action sequences in Predator to kick up some excitement for the audience. Most of the action in Predator involves our friend the Predator himself, and mostly as the commandos hopelessly attempt to mow him down with their guns. By the time the Predator does show his true form the viewer might be a little freaked by how ugly his face is, but glancing into his face can be frightening at first too.Not everything in Predator is perfect though. For one, some parts in the movie do drag on a bit and do diminish some of suspense gained in the movie. There are also a couple of moments the movie could've gone without, like the girl in movie could've been cut for some more assassination kills among the commandos. But Predator does its job in making these flaws seem less serious to its real score and they don't do much to flaw the movie.The love that this movie has received is well-deserved. By the end of a long struggle through the jungle against the Predator one has to wonder what it could've been like had they been Dutch fighting the Predator and fighting for his life. Fortunately that's what movies are for and Predator comes as good as they should be.",8,1,2,30 January 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Giant Epic That Really Delivers
","I must admit my faith in this movie wasn't exactly great at the time, it just didn't seem like one that would appeal to me. But upon watching it I was pleasantly pleased with the presentation of this first Lord of the Rings movie.Do know I have never read any Lord of the Rings books, although I have tried to read the first but it was just too complex for me. I will say that The Fellowship of the Ring is a great translation in the first pages I read of the book. Under the direction of Peter Jackson people will say that alone makes the Lord of the Rings movies great, that more or less applies mostly to this particular installment.What I mean is that this is the best Lord of the Rings movie. Part of the reason is because when watching this movie the viewer gets a better acquaintance with the characters. The love that the audience gets with the characters in Fellowship of the Ring is better placed than the last and is much stronger than the next two. As for the performers in this movie they do an excellent job of doing their job, especially Gimli and Gandalf.Another reason this is the best Lord of the Rings movie is that it's the more interesting installment. In the next installments it's mostly just epic battles with incredible CGI, that's not completely the case here. The battles here aren't as huge as the next installments but the way Jackson introduces the audience to the plot and characters is almost flawless.But the biggest reason this is the best Lord of the Rings movie is because this one has the best presentation. Unlike the next movies in this trilogy, The Fellowship of the Ring catches your attention more and draws you in more. All things considered, the overall feeling this movie delivers is excellent and shows the top of Jacksons directing talent.Now, after comparing this to the other Lord of the Rings movies you're probably thinking that I don't see much in this movie for what it is on its own. That's not true, I'll easily say that on its own merits, this is a great movie. Again, the character development in Fellowship of the Ring is great and the audience gets a great connection with each person in the movie. The action isn't the best you'll see in a movie but it's more than good enough to satisfy your excitement thirst.Just the whole way this movie is done is remarkable. Jackson was at the top of his game when directing this movie, and it shows with a great watch for any night. For those that want a movie that will keep you interested and immersed for just under three hours and not drag on, this movie has your name written on it.",9,0,0,5 February 2006
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Awkward But Fun Twist To The Terminator Movies
","By the time a movie series reaches its third installment the series is considered a disgrace because of the most recent addition. While some fans of the Terminator movies would like to ignore what Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines has to say it's still an exciting watch.Unlike the previous Terminator films, T3 puts the focus on big-bang action scenes rather than storytelling. In the regard of its action, T3 is a real thrill ride. From the opening sequence revealing a short but impressive look at the nuclear war to the inevitability set for Judgment Day, T3 serves up a good pace of tension-filled and occasionally humorous action. Not only do these scenes make T3 worth watching multiple times but it also gives the movie the extra points it needs to be above-average, and even a great movie.However, T3 makes compromises a strong story for these impressive action scenes. This will immediately turn Terminator fans off as the previous Terminator films were smart and took the time to develop a strong storyline. While the plot in T3 isn't necessarily bad, it makes a big mistake right from the beginning: Being made in the first place. Since T3 was made it was inevitable that the producers intended for Judgment Day to still happen, it makes the costly choice of taking T2's excellent ending, laughing in its face and tossing it away.With that, T3 is, on paper-a typical action flick with a mixed up plot tossed in. While the idea of making the ending of T2 pointless by its own rules is a big mistake, T3 still comes out strongly for what it is. This is one of the sci-fi movies that comes out as an exception to the standard that action-focused movies suck. Part of this is because that it still holds on to the formula of Judgment Day set by the first Terminator. But this rattles the viewers as T3 teases us with the idea of another Terminator movie that, if made, would be the real Judgment Day movie.So all things considered, T3 isn't a bad movie. In fact, it's actually a great movie as it has some cool and awesome action and does stay true to the original Terminator formula. Just that T3 makes the risk of even being released by toying with T2's ending about stopping Judgment Day that it loses points. Otherwise, T3 is a movie that regular Terminator fans will more than likely enjoy for what it's worth and under the flow movie sequels usually follow.",8,2,3,12 February 2006
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Blazing Sequel That Terminates Almost Every Other Sci-Fi Movie
","'The future has not been set, there is no fate but what we make for ourselves'. These are the words that set the way The Terminator moves forward. The same applies to Terminator 2: Judgement Day, which is one of the greatest sequels ever made in filming history.Like The Terminator, T2 has a Terminator and a protector sent back in time to change the future. But a couple of rules have changed in T2 that make it a different movie. For one, Sarah Conner is no longer the target of the Terminator, it's her now born son John Conner. The other changes is that instead of a Terminator and human soldier sent back, two Terminators are sent to find John Conner. The model sent to protect John is the same as the Terminator from the first movie, so Arnold is back but he's turned a new leaf. The model searching to kill John Conner is the more advanced Terminator, the T-1000, or Alloyman as I like to call him.T2 takes place about ten years after the first Terminator, and a bit has happened since then. One being that John Conner is born and living the life of a typical bad kid. The other and the more surprising being that Sarah Conner is now locked up in a mental institute, where unlike the first, she is now a tough and strict woman that does at times seem close to crazy. Since John of course can't live with his mother he's raised by adopted parents which he obviously loathes, being the computer hacking, bank-stealing kid he's become. The story of how Sarah and John got to where they are is told through the plot segments of the movie so the viewer doesn't feel completely lost.Like it's predecessor, T2 focuses on tense and suspenseful action sequences with plot segments in-between as its means to entertain. And like the first, this technique pays off thanks to some more exciting and memorable scenes. Such scenes that T2 is famous for include the first and last chase scenes in the movie and one of the best endings ever. The plot segments that go before and after the action scenes are more or less story-telling scenes that fill the viewer in on what they have missed between the first Terminator and this Terminator movies.Again, Arnie is back but he's changed. Instead of being a ferocious killing machine he's now a softer and less menacing character. The newer Terminator is played by Robert Patrick, who brings a charming yet obviously deadly personality to his Terminator role. Linda Hamilton returns to play Sarah Conner but she like Arnie has changed, but she's more like Arnold was in the last Terminator movie instead of the innocent hostage-like chick from the first. As for John, he's unprofessionally played by Edward Furlong, but at least he gets the job done as John, but just barely passing.Fans of the first Terminator movie might feel a bit betrayed by the changes in the characters but Cameron actually took a logical direction with the characters and it pays off surprisingly well. Most of the movie seems dedicated to allowing the viewer to establish an accurate with the new and old characters to the movie. This combined with some unforgettable action scenes help to make T2 one of the better movies to find a certain love for, one way or another. This works especially well in the perfect ending that many fans will say was the real ending to the Terminator movies despite the release of T3.Terminator 2 stands as a monumental accomplishment that shows the peak of James Cameron's directing talent. As Arnold said in the first Terminator 'I'll be back' and he did come back and brought back a fresh supply of excellence. The great action is back, the excellent story-telling is back and the great acting, despite some obvious complaints in Furlong and perhaps Hamilton and Arnie's roles is also back nonetheless.",9,8,11,8 February 2006
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," A Darker, More Mature Potter
","While Chris Columbus did do his job making worthy adaptations of the first two Potter films and had the loyalty of fans of the book (myself included) they lacked much, entertainment being one of the biggest, as they felt more like a vision with people talking from the book rather than an actual movie. But the Harry Potter series has now met Alfonso Cauron, who proves to not only manage to give the Harry Potter series some much needed spunk and maturity, but also proves to make it a good movie on its own merits.Part what makes Prisoner of Azkaban such an improvement over its predecessors is that the young actors seem to have gotten the space they needed. It's hard to get young actors/actresses to get a particular role right and still make them feel comfortable with their career, but Cauron seems to have taken pressure off of Radcliffe, Grint and Watson's shoulders. The older performers in the movie are also given time to let the audience get acquainted with who they are.Prisoner of Azkaban is also much darker and mature but also more humorous than the previous installments. The mood of the story and movie not only looks dark but also feels dark and it helps to reflect on the younger roles of the movie by making them seem all the more mature. But even with this, the movie manages to crack a few jokes to make the viewer get a chuckle or two here and there and it helps to provide a brief relief from the seriousness from the film, and a little humor never hurt anyone right? But most of all, this third installment proves to be far more entertaining above all. Unlike Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets, which felt much like a bunch of actors and actresses efficiently speaking word-for-word from the book , Prisoner of Azkaban liberates itself from the book but manages to keep much of the sufficient details from it in the movie and in the end it pays off as a much more fun to watch movie.Serious Harry Potter fans might feel somewhat betrayed by Prisoner of Azkaban and how it shares only the main plot details from the book, but casual movie goers will find a tasty and ultimately satisfying treat in it.",8,0,1,5 May 2006
Aliens," One Of The Biggest And Best Sequels Ever
","It's certainly hard to talk about sci-fi movies and not bring up Aliens. James Cameron's sequel to the 1979 horror classic Alien is not only superior to its predecessor but it's among the greatest sci-fi movies to have ever been released.Aliens picks up where Alien left off, only it's been over forty years, and Ripley's been in cryo-sleep the whole time. After a not-so-friendly meeting about what happened in Alien, Ripley is revoked of her license. Then she finds out that the inhabitants of a colony that landed on LV-426; the alien planet have gone missing. Ripley, by her own will, chooses to go with a group of marines to hunt down the disturbance. As you might expect, things get pretty sticky and tight in Aliens as there's more than one, a lot more.James Cameron puts an action emphasis on Aliens unlike Ridley Scott's horror direction for Alien. And it's this that Aliens does so well, being a great action movie along with some thrilling moments. Not only does this change in direction make Aliens a more exciting film but also a better film. It's not just that the action in Aliens itself is great, but also that Cameron went for an original approach for the action attitude rather than make another horror-focused movie.There's also some great actors to find in Aliens. Sigourney Weaver of course returns as Ripley and she's much more serious than her character in Alien, so yeah, she's pretty bad-a** now. You've also got Micheal Beihn-who played Kyle from the Terminator as Corperal Hicks, and Beihn once again does a great acting job. Then there's everyone's favorite marine from Aliens, Bill Paxton as Hudson. You of course have to love Paxton for giving Hudson some of the best one-liners like 'Oh that's great, that's just f**,king great, now what the f**k are we supposed to do? We're in some real tight s**t now man!' Once again, I have to talk about the action itself in Aliens, as it's so impressive and fun to talk about. I could mention so many awesome scenes from Aliens but the one that I love the most are the sequences with the Alien Queen. I must also give kudos to Cameron for the scenes of the Alien Queen against Ripley in the loader, which just flat-out rocks! The magnitude of Aliens was and still is excellent and huge.If you ever find yourself in need of a perfect Saturday-night sci-fi movie, Aliens will work ever time. It's just one of those movies that you don't get tired of watching, ever. Thank you James Cameron, for making some of the greatest movies of the 80's and 90's, Aliens was a true accomplishment!",8,3,5,16 February 2006
The Butterfly Effect," A Side Of Movies We Don't Get Often
","The Butterfly Effect is somewhat of a sleeper hit that, as far as critics go, didn't get the credit it deserves. This isn't a movie that the family should see, it'll definitely disturb some on a few levels, my mother was. With that in mind, this movie is not for the faint of heart, but it does have a take on life that people often overlook; that you can't change someone without changed who they were before. There are references to chaos theory in this movie that show that the human mind is still a puzzle waiting to be solved. At first the movie can be a bit hard to follow so you might want to watch it more than once, but every time you watch this movie you begin to further understand and comprehend this movie's point. Also, Butterfly Effect shows us a side of Kutcher that I don't think we'll ever see again. But for the kind of person he is, Kutcher does an excellent job portraying his character. Another thing I liked about this movie is that although it's got a bit of a love story in it the movie doesn't end like pretty much every movie involving love. If you're looking for a movie that delivers at a level that could rival that of the Sixth Sense then Butterfly Effect will satisfy you, it's a real punch in the gut.",8,0,1,5 February 2006
Alien vs. Predator," Fun Action Just Barely Overshadows Unnecessary Mix To Alien Storyline
","As perhaps the most loathed of all Alien and Predator movies combined, AVP has often been the easy target for screwing up both the Alien and Predator movies.Like Alien Resurrection before it, AVP puts its focus on fun and mindless action scenes and off of logic and a real storyline. In that regard, AVP isn't much more than a silly but fun spin off mostly to the Alien movies. The action in AVP is about what you'd expect out of a movie with aliens and predators in it; action scenes with both that end with results that will have someone complaining.AVP tries to capture a plot that is supposed to seem good to the audience. But after the last Alien movies I think that we can all agree that the so-called story in AVP almost purposely tries to confuse fans of both movies. If AVP really sets any real winner to the two foreign-to-Earth creatures watch the Predator movies, then watch this followed by the Alien movies. The first few scenes of LV-426 in Alien should tell you who won the 'war' AVP creates.AVP sets the audience up with the impression that there will be sequel with the inclusion of the 'Predalien', the new addition to the Alien/Predator species. After the style of action that AVP contains and the plot it sets forth, you can expect AVP2 to probably be focused on the Predalien giving the predators a run for their money. The prediction: another mindless action movie without much purpose for storytelling.As for AVP itself, the movie is worth watching, but the storyline it has just begs for a shredding in the Alien movies. Along with that, the Predator fans will face the fact that the serpent-like aliens over-powered the predators. Only a select few will find AVP to be at least enjoyable, and I'm one of them.",7,0,1,19 February 2006
Ghost Rider," A Bittersweet Piece of Hell
","Given the early drought of 2007's first wave of movies, it's easy to pick out Ghost Rider as a film you'll indefinitely want to see. And why not? If you've got the main character being a flaming skeleton with a blazing motorcycle, it's hard to resist the eagerness of seeing what action scene they'll take place in. Mark Steven Johnson's latest movie is a lot like his recent Daredevil adaptation in how you might leave the theater. You may walk into the theater expecting something good and fun without much brains, but walk out getting the impression the story was taken serious and that little was utilized in the film.Stunt motorcyclist Johnny Blaze takes on the main role of the film when he signs a contract to save his father in exchange for his soul. But poor Johnny becomes the victim of his own choice when the devil decides to turn the results of the contract around. Fast-forward a few years and Blackheart-the son of the devil-wants to obtain the ultimate form of power; is there ever a villain that isn't greedy? Thus, Johnny is turned into the Ghost Rider at night as the devil's bounty hunter to do his work; in this case, finding Blackheart and stop him from gaining his desired power.The plot isn't terribly deep and it's easy enough to follow even with the fair number of plot twists tossed in the film. Like Daredevil before it, Ghost Rider likes to utilize the light-hearted humor and plot with a serious tone. And just like Daredevil, this really becomes one of the film's major weaknesses in how it leads to some very unnecessary scenes and details. Some of the comedy in the film does work, but most of the time you feel like you missed the point or that there was too little or too much effort put into that joke. As for the more serious parts, Ghost Rider tries to make these parts stand out, but they wind up feeling rushed so that the film can get to the next bit of details.Then there's the characters, who go back and forth between being likable and totally unconvincing. This is especially noticeable in the chemistry between Johnny and the attractive love of his life: Roxanne. While they're both likable characters, the believability between the two goes back and forth between strong and nonexistent. And it's tough to establish just how a character feels when they shift from a comical tone to a serious tone and back to comical faster than I can snap my fingers.Not to say that Ghost Rider is automatically a bad film due to these flaws, there's still some redeeming qualities. Nicolas Cage, while probably not the best choice for Blaze, usually makes for a character that you'll admire for his tragic flaws as individual. Supporting actress Eva Mendes also makes for some solid scenes with her character, and actually tends to be more believable than Cage himself. Blackheart and Mephistopheles (the devil) typically do well to be charming villains, but they do get rather annoying with their almost sadistic tone after a while.There are also a few nice action scenes to experience in the film, particularly in the last hour or so. When the Ghost Rider is doing what he does best it makes for an entertaining and usually exciting experience. Also, the Ghost Rider himself has a few moments that, while containing corny dialog, manages to make them sound cool enough to help make his character all the more likable. And you've got to give it up for a guy with a flaming skull, chain and wicked motorcycle for those more memorable sequences.These aspects are nice and do help Ghost Rider to avoid being a complete failure, but most of these moments take place within the second half of the film only. For the first half you feel like your being treated to a bunch of scenes that add little to nothing other than setting up the premise and helping you get used to the characters. Thus you get a bit of that Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest in which the start of the film does little but after the half of the film is gone, the potential is finally being realized.Ghost Rider is by no means a bad film, there's plenty to like in the film, if most of it is because of the film and characters' style. But once the end finally comes, you get the impression that it was a missed opportunity. It may not have as much charm as Fantastic Four or even Spiderman for that matter, but at least you're treated to something of better quality than The Hulk. Proceed with caution, for this is one of those films that you may love for its action and style, but might be disappointed by due to the almost completely obvious flaws.",6,1,3,16 February 2007
Hellboy," It's Fun and Unique, But Just Doesn't Cut It
","Let's face it, the 21st century is the year of movies based on famous comics, like Spiderman, The Hulk, X-Men, The Punisher and then there's Hellboy, which takes a different approach from what you may expect out of it. Hellboy's mood is darker than movies like Spiderman and The Hulk and attempts to be a bit more than just a typical action movie with a plot that's supposed to be interesting. While I appreciate and admire how the movie tried to be an interesting and different kind of movie there's one problem, the attempt backfires. The plot in the movie is good, but the movie presents it in a sloppy way, sometimes as if it were a sequel and most of the time the moments that try to let the audience develop a connection are screwed up by an awkward mood in those moments that make the movie seem as if it can't decide between certain ways to present itself. This is Hellboy's major downfall and makes it a less recommendable movie. But with that aside Hellboy is a pretty enjoyable movie and at times fun to watch. Ron Perlman makes a great Hellboy, he makes the big red demon-like creature that Hellboy is the most lovable character in the movie. The other performers in the movie don't do that great, with the exception of Hellboy's 'father' and the main villain who looks similar to Rob Halford with a facelift. The action in this movie isn't used too much until the end but all of it is satisfying for the most part. As for the plot, while it is at least interesting, it just isn't as good as I'd have liked to be. All-in-all this is a good movie, but it's nothing special compared to what we've seen from other movies the past few years.",7,0,0,23 January 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," A Darker Side of the Rings
","Part of what made the last Lord of the Rings movie so great was its presentation. The light-hearted scenes were heart-warming and the darker moments were more suspenseful. The Two Towers takes a dark turn in the Lord of the Rings and uses it to be its primary mood. For the most part, this darker atmosphere pays off and helps the battles seem more impressive.The Fellowship is broken in this movie, but the journey must continue as The Two Towers continues right where the Fellowship of the Ring left off, like a true sequel. Almost instantly, Jackson introduces us to a crowd favorite character, Smeagol and Gollum. But why do we love this two part combo character? Maybe it has to do with the world-famous line 'my precious....' Yes, that line alone makes this ugly imp-like creature one the audience can't help but love.Frodo and Sam don't have much a role in this movie, instead, The Two Towers puts the major focus around Aragorn, Legolus and Gimli, which I'm pretty thankful for. It's nice to see that after getting used to the silly hobbits that we get a movie that puts as much dedication towards the more serious part of the group. Gandalf also makes a return appearance and his changed attitude makes him more or less a more credible character this time around.The battle sequences in this movie are big and great. The first few battles that take place out in open fields are impressive themselves, but you won't know true battle scenes until the battle for Helms Deep. This sequence, combined with the Ents taking on Isengard is one of the most impressive epic battle combos ever seen in a movie. The CGI in The Two Towers is also incredible, no shot looks bad or ugly, with the exception of the brutal and nasty orcs and Uruk-Hai.Other new characters are brought into trilogy with The Two Towers and while it's nice to see some more good guys fight against the orcs, the movie lacks a spark to make them more lovable. The connection that Jackson establishes with these new characters exists, but it isn't used to the effect that he did with Smeagol and Gollum, which is a true shame.Regardless of this flaw that affects the movie more than it probably should've, The Two Towers is an great sequel. Some will say that this is the best of the Lord of the Rings movies, which in some ways is true. But compared to how great the first movie in this epic trilogy was, The Two Towers just doesn't create the same impressive feeling that Fellowship of the Ring left.",9,0,0,5 February 2006
I Am Legend," Solid, But Really Awkward At Times
","Oh joy, another last man on earth movie with zombies, that's the next thing this world needs! Putting sarcasm about the film's plot aside, I Am Legend is really an interesting movie to sum up. Will Smith plays a lone doctor in the middle of a barren New York City during the year 2012, the year that gas prices-according to the film-will be $68 a gallon. Apparently, three years earlier a medication was discovered that could supposedly cure disease, but it slowly turned into zombie-like infesting epidemic. As you might expect, Smith's character is immune to this infestation and he's off fending for himself trying to find a cure with only his canine friend.The set up for the film isn't the most original in the world, but there's enough in the film to at least carry it all the way through. But what's really neat about the set design is how New York looks as a deserted wasteland; it's downright mesmerizing. Now, based on the trailers for this film it's easy to look at it as an almost completely action-filled flick with Smith tearing the infected humans apart. Do be warned: this really isn't the case with the film and it's easy to be mislead by a few reports and trailers. For instance, with a name like I Am Legend it would only make sense for one to think it's another way for Will Smith to say 'I am a bad man' (or something along those lines). But again, this isn't the case; he's a doctor merely trying to find a cure in the city. Speaking of Will Smith's character, he does an excellent job carrying out his role, even if he doesn't have that much to really work with he manages to make the best of it.With that in-mind, don't be surprised when you find the bulk of the film's faster parts to be merely incidental. While the movie does go for multiple genre styles, ranging from horror to drama, a good bit of the film's relatively short screen time is dedicated to dialogue and monologue parts. As a result, I Am Legend winds up being a rather slow film with the action scenes breaking up the monotony very sparingly. And do note that the film has a PG-13 rating, so the amount of action a movie like this could go without hitting the R rating is so far. If this were a straight-up balls-to-the-wall action extravaganza it's likely the film would've walked away with an R-rating.A good majority of the film has Will Smith carrying his role all by himself, with the occasional flashback also trying to break up the repetition. And really, the film needs as many of these parts as it can get, because it's only so long before a movie following one lone character begins to lose its touch. These parts do tend to work pretty well since it offers some background to Smith's character and the state New York City is in during the film. There are also a fair number of moments used to provide comic relief in the film, which do usually work. But there are a few that are clearly unintentional and at times extremely awkward. I won't spoil every one, but do be prepared for Smith to start impersonating a scene from Shrek and yell at a mannequin.The ending does at least wrap things up well enough to where it doesn't feel like a sequel is so obvious. However, it isn't exactly the most satisfying of endings and it really pushed the meaning of 'morality' too far. Not to mention it's not even the most believable ending that could've been picked out of a good load of options. And by this I mean believable in resolving everything, not in whether it's actually possible or not. So again, be prepared for some awkward and on a couple occasions nonsensical moments. Will Smith fans will do well to give this film a shot, but keep an open mind when heading into the theater.",7,1,2,18 December 2007
School of Rock," Jack Black's The Sub? Screw Skipping Class!
","With the so-called 'music' that fuels people to buying CDs and downloading songs, the genre that seems to be slowly dying is rock. After the emergence of the rap, pop and emo genres the rock genre sees a slow but steady decline in popularity. But before the genre does die away there's one movie that will shine as rock's last stand, a movie that isn't afraid to speak the truth about economy and provide a good laugh. Ladies and gentlemen, I give the School of Rock! In School of Rock, Jack Black plays Dewy Finn; a die-hard and overzealous rocker stuck in the 70's and 80's music era. After being knocked out of his band by the other members he seeks out people to be a part of his new band. However, word of his 'excellence' has spread already, and people aren't exactly hot about him trying to form another band. Along with no success to his new band attempt he's also stuck with having to pay a rent for the apartment he shares with his long-time friend Ned, who is practically bossed by his girlfriend. The problem here, Dewy has no money and no job. After failing to sell one of his guitars to get the rent money he gets a call saying that a private elementary school needs a substitute for a class, and Dewy takes it upon himself to take the job.As the name of the movie might imply, Dewy eventually finds out the fifth grade students he's teaching actually have some musical talent, enough for his band. And behold, the fifth graders become Dewy's new 'band', and the movie builds up from there. The one thing that School of Rock of course stands with is classic rock music, which the movie's soundtrack is composed of, all-time classic songs. Not only does the movie play songs from bands such as Led Zeppelin, AC/DC and Jimi Hendrix but it also mentions them as bands that you have to know if you have any clue of what music is.However, School of Rock stands against more than what it stands for. Jack Black works his magic amazingly to emphasize this with one of my all-time favorite quotes: 'Stick it to da man!' The movie also talks about how rock n' roll was the way to give 'The Man' hell and how it reached a downfall with one of my favorite jokes (but it's an honest one), the creation of MTV. School of Rock also mentions a few terms used during the era of rock n' roll such as groupies, but it doesn't emphasize these terms that much. This also seems odd in the favor of School of Rock's PG-13 rating, which seems more than misplaced after watching the movie.As if a movie that stands for true rock music and against the crap that makes up the majority of today's music there's also plenty of laughs to be found. Pretty much every moment of laughter that School of Rock creates is brought up by Jack Black's outrageous personality. With so many classic quotes and jokes brought that show Black's true potential as a comedian, it's almost impossible not to at least chuckle at School of Rock. The fifth grade performers in School of Rock are also very likable characters that get the attention they deserve. The movie does seem to focus on mostly the same young actors/actresses but by the end of the movie the viewer has gotten acquainted with each 'band member' of the movie.If you like rock n' roll or just comedies in general I'd highly recommend School of Rock. In fact, I'd recommend this to most any movie viewer, unless you actually enjoy watching the music that this movie is easily against (rap, pop, emo) obviously. Yet, I'd have to say that anyone should enjoy this movie, even my grandmother liked this movie and went as far as to say that it 'rocked', and she was able to tell almost everything that would happen. Now that, is what I call a true family film!",8,2,3,22 February 2006
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," A Beautiful Tale Courtesy of Mr. Fincher
","WARNING: THIS REVIEW DOES CONTAIN SPOILERS.At this point David Fincher has established himself as one of the most talented directors out there, with films such as Fight Club, Se7en and Zodiac earning him a great deal of respect from film critics and fans alike. An admirable part of Fincher's films is that they put more of a focus on the story and characters along with the narrative and cinematography revolving around them. This, along with various aspects to his other films has helped solidify him as an ideal inspiration for aspiring film makers. I recently got the opportunity to see his latest offering, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, which I was very interested in seeing since I saw the first trailer. After sitting through this near three hour film I can safely say that this is my new favorite Fincher film.Obviously what drew me to this film was the catch to the story: how the main character ages backwards. My interest in this wasn't so much to see Button's character go through a reverse aging, but more to see how things unfolded around him as he physically became younger. Thankfully for me, a lot happened during the film, whether it centered on Button or simply involved him. Given that the film has a fairly lengthy runtime, I was glad to see that there were a fair number of changes in the setting of the film.This brings me to perhaps the most surprising aspect of the film for me. A film can very easily win me over with beautiful sceneries, and I also have a soft spot for movies that take place during the 50's or any period preceding that point. Since a good portion of the film takes place around the 40's to the 70's I was automatically engrossed. There were also points in the film when the scenery (the winter night outside when Button's having an affair with Elizabeth, the sunrise at the dock with his father and the ship passing his captain's tugboat to name a few), these were the parts that I felt I had left the theater and entered the film.The story, which mostly centers around Button, is one of several stories that works well thanks to the narrative. Parts of the film are narrated by Button's daughter as they transition to Button's voice narrating. The film is told in flashback which doesn't necessarily hurt the film, but I would've preferred a little less emphasis on the present scenario. Brad Pitt, an actor who I've never been particularly fond of, manages to do well with what he's given. Cate Blanchett, an actress who I've held similar regards to managed to do about as solid as Pitt. This is to say I liked their characters in the film, but it didn't change my perspective on them, which is about as much of a compliment as I could likely give either of them.I'd actually have to say the side characters seemed to have a stronger screen presence than Pitt and Blanchett. While this isn't a common aspect to most films, I do like it when the 'next-in-line' characters get their fair share; it helps make the film feel better-rounded. The film is very character and narrative-driven, similar to movies like Forrest Gump and American Beauty. And like those films, Benjamin Button does an excellent job in both aspects, helping it unfold into a great story not so much for the events themselves, but what the characters themselves go through due to these occurrences.One part I was very curious was to see how things would wrap up around Button and what would happen during his last moments. The last few minutes and thus, the actual ending to the film was the most powerful part of the movie for me. Just the thought of how Button forgot about his life and died as if just born was a very shattering scene for me to watch and as a result, this became one of the few films to actually bring tears to my eyes. Not remembering your life, not even a single part of your memory, is something that really got to me in this film.Other than a slightly shaky narrative in brief parts and a couple moments that drag on, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button proves to be a very valiant and worthwhile viewing. If you're like me and you love films that have memorable settings and places the characters on center stage then you should have no trouble falling in love with this film. With the exception of The Dark Knight and possibly WALL-E, there aren't any other films released this year that I could put in the same league as this latest effort by Mr. Fincher.",9,0,1,3 January 2009
The Dark Knight," The Knight, The Fallen Hero, The Joker
","The Dark Knight isn't just the Batman movie we've all been waiting for; it's the superhero movie we've been waiting for all these years. While there have been some great comic book films like the first two Spider-Mans and Iron Man, The Dark Knight is what really takes these films to a new level. This is a film that does everything right, nails what so many others struggle to and this is one that's done so well, that it's easy to forget this is even a superhero/comic book film. Even with the names 'Joker' and 'Batman' being used very frequently in the film it's tough to even begin to look at it this way.There are plenty of surprises all over the place in The Dark Knight, with many of them coming from the story and how much focus has been put into it. It's really quite surprising how much of a focus is put on the story between Gotham itself, Bruce Wayne/Batman, Harvey Dent, the gangs and the Joker. This is just one of the many ways in which the film really surprises you and helps it unfold into something truly special. From every exchange of dialogue, statement made, lie told and all that progresses the story to the very last line you're constantly engrossed in this film from start to finish, it never loses grip of its engaging story.The actors and performances from them are just as impressive, with the casting being about as good as it can get. When you have a cast that includes Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman and Heath Ledger, you know that the performances shouldn't be a concern. Even with that in-mind, every performer does an excellent job and brings their respective character to life exceptionally. Bale as Bruce Wayne and Batman is once again excellent, managing to be the likable, sympathetic guy as Bruce and then the focused, swift crime-fighting vigilante as Batman. Freeman as Mr. Fox is once again brilliant and a very likable character; just about any movie he's in he makes his character stand out and this is no exception. Oldman is far and away one of the most overlooked actors out there and his performance here is no less than worthy of anyone else in the film.That is, with the exception of Heath Ledger as the Joker. Unlike the Joker in Batman from 1989 who had more of a comedic aspect to him in some cases, the Joker here portrayed by Ledger is dark, sinister and at time downright disturbing. His entrance into the film is just one of his many stand-out parts; and after you see his acting while talking (especially those about his scars) you can't help but be completely mesmerized. Some of these scenes are so amazing and haunting that you'll have your jaw dropped for minutes with shivers coming down all over your body (not just your spine). Complete and utter tensions are what dominate you when seeing Heath on-screen. Whenever Heath is on-screen he IS the movie.As far as action goes, there's plenty to be had, but by no means does it dominate the film or try to be the biggest or best aspect. What's remarkable about the action sequences here is that they aren't the most memorable parts of the film; a superhero/comic book film. Rather than feeling like pointless scenes meant only for entertainment these scenes happen for a reason and help give way to unfolding what happens next in the story. The film even makes fun of youngsters going ballistic over just the action scenes in the middle of one of the chases, which was pretty nice.Something that this film also manages to do amazingly well that almost no other film (or any that I can think of) is that in-spite of its long running time (nearly 3 hours) it doesn't drag out once. Normally I check my cell phone several times during a movie to see how many minutes have passed, but not once did I do so here. Watching The Dark Knight you'll be saying to yourself that you don't want it to end, because you know that one of the best films you've ever had the pleasure to watch will eventually end and you don't want that moment to come. But the least you can look forward to and hope for is that the film has a worthwhile ending and The Dark Knight doesn't disappoint here. The ending is very powerful, shocking and far from a typical Hollywood film ending. This is the kind of ending that a superhero movie just never has, and it will remain as one of the most memorable endings of all time for me.The Dark Knight isn't a movie, it's an experience; an experience worth re-living over and over again.R.I.P.

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," The Magic Comes To Life, In A Bit Of A Dull Way
","Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone had a lot to live up to as a book-to-film adaptation. For-the-most-part, the movie delivers as being entertaining, but any fans wanting more than a passing movie might be disappointed.The story of this movie of course revolves around Harry Potter, his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardy. In this movie Harry just turns eleven and suddenly discovers he's a wizard, and probably the most famous one at that. More details are revealed in the movie about Harry's past but I won't spoil them for those who have yet to experience the books or movies of Potter.As far as being a loyal translation, Columbus does an excellent job. Yes, plenty from the book is left out of the movie but all the vital moments are in the movie. The moments that did make it to the movie are very loyal to the book, almost too loyal. While I give Columbus credit to making the movie loyal it's just too confined, not just for the young actors in the movie but the impact on the audience as well. It's this that makes Sorcerer's Stone no more than a worthy and passing effort by Columbus.The young actors that play as Harry, Ron and Hermione are all perfect picks by Columbus, which is definitely a plus. Radcliffe as Potter is a great selection as is Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley. But Emma Watson proves as the most creditable selection and as the most mature of the young trio. Surprisingly, the actors and actresses that play the professors do a better job than our three young heroes. Not only are the selections for the professors perfect, but they add a great flair to their roles that make them seem even better for their role.The presentation of Sorcerer's Stone is magical, no doubt, a great movie for the holidays, but it just isn't enough. The movie is fairly long, at over two hours and for some it will seem as if the film drags on too much. While the translation of the teachers, students and plot of the book is done very nicely it's how everything else is executed where the movie falls apart too. Yes, the final tasks near the end of the movie and the Quidditch match are fun to watch but far from stunning.The result in Sorcerer's Stone is that it's a good movie through and through, but people, especially fans of the books like myself will feel let down by the movie. Now, this isn't a bad movie, there's lots to love in the film's magical flair from the introduction of the students, teachers and other cast members that make appearances in later films. But, if you're expecting a movie that will dazzle you then you're asking for too much of the movie.",7,1,2,4 February 2006
Thor," A Very Pleasant Surprise; Applause-Worthy
","This summer is shaping to be a big one for action blockbusters and sequels (with more expected this year than any preceding). We got Fast Five recently (with the sixth installment already underway), Pirates of the Caribbean's fourth outing is a couple weeks away, while July will be giving us more than just Deathly Hallows Part 2 and Transformers 3. Thankfully, we're getting some films that are at least trying to give us a tale not told in a while on-screen as well. And one of them just happens to be what is, in this writer's humble opinion, the biggest theatrical surprise since Iron Man in 2008. Seeing the trailers for Thor, I expected it to be a mediocre at-best film not far from what G.I. Joe apparently turned out to be. But then the reviews came in and, combined with urging from personal acquaintances, I succumbed to what had long-since caught others. Being almost completely unfamiliar with the tale(s) of Thor, I wasn't sure if the film would be able to truly catch and maintain my interest. Thankfully, we're given a pleasing introduction within the first act that sets the stage well without creating overexposure. Essentially, after years of battles and quests, Oden nearly bestows one of his two sons, Thor, as his proper successor. But after a thought-past threat ultimately shows what Thor is truly like, Oden banishes him to our world without his true strength (since Earth is the ideal place for the outcast).Thor (as a film) doesn't have any problem deciding what kind of film it wants to be: this is an action blockbuster with traits of an epic. The first act has some impressive visuals and an excellent action sequence that the final act actually has trouble matching. Despite the genre being clear-cut and not requiring much (if any) of an attention span, Thor thankfully manages to avoid falling into the rut that too many action releases have. By this I'm of course referring to a lack of compelling characters and, more so, an even lesser tale to tell. Most of the characters we're introduced to are nicely developed and are quite likable, with one in particular being more dimensional than audiences might anticipate. The cast here is notable, with Portman, Hopkins and Skarsgård all being among my personal favorite performers. Yet it's the relatively unfamiliar lead title character who steals the show (and thankfully so). With the exception of a small role in 2009's Star Trek, Chris Hemsworth was unknown to me until now. But he fits into the role of Thor perfectly, going through his personality with almost as much strength as his build. He's sure to become one to find in future action films. Thor is a very enjoyable film with just enough action and laughs to make it one that most anyone can enjoy with an open mind. While the script might show cracks here and there, namely with regards to a few lines, most of what we have here is quality material. Here's hoping that Thor proves to be a precursor to other fun summer films to take us away from our daily hardships (which is what most films should do).",7,4,8,10 May 2011
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Worthy, But Still Suffers From Loyalty
","Chris Columbus managed to bring the world of Harry Potter to the big screen with success in The Sorcerer's Stone. Now, Columbus returns to direct the second Harry Potter movie, Chamber of Secrets. After watching the movie it's safe to say that it has improved upon the first Potter movie but still falls in areas.The deal in Chamber of Secrets is that Harry tries to go back to Hogwarts for another year at school but encounters a house elf who is unwilling to let him go. This leads to Harry's rescue from the Weasley brothers and a real intro to the Weasley family. By the time Harry does get back to Hogwarts he has a lot to deal with, as if the troubles to get there weren't enough. Mysterious things happen to students at Hogwarts that is connected to the Chamber of Secrets being opened. From there on, the movie keeps a good feeling of interest for the audience to keep everything go nicely.Chamber of Secrets is more serious than that of Sorcerer's Stone and is a darker film. But there isn't anything in this movie that should haunt the youngsters until they're teenagers. While the darker mood isn't used to great effect it does help keep the movie going, and very smoothly at that. There's also a bit of real action in this movie, just a bit though. The Quidditch match is more in-your-face than the last and the scene in the Chamber of Secrets has a bit of an edge-of-your-seat way to it that actually works well.The acting in Chamber of Secrets is improved from Sorcerer's Stone, but marginally only. Yes, the trio has matured since Sorcerer's Stone and it does show, part thanks to Radcliffe's deeper voice. Even with the acting being just slightly better than that of the first it's not a bad thing. In fact, under the circumstances of most Hollywood sequels, this a good thing, as each person in the movie leaves the same good effect as before. A bit of maturity doesn't go a long way here, but at least it shows.From start to finish, Chamber of Secrets is a worthy sequel that manages to be better than the first in every way. However, the movie is plagued by the extreme loyalty to the book. This also creates problems for the young performers in the movie and it does show. But anyone that has a good taste for movies should be able to find at least one way to enjoy Chamber of Secrets.",7,0,1,6 February 2006
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Has Enough Going For It Despite Being a Big Mess
","The first live action Transformers film, just like any other film by director Michael Bay, yielded mixed opinions though most were at least entertained by it. With the sequel, Revenge of the Fallen, we see the film playing to its predecessors' strengths and weaknesses very largely, but the general scenario (in regards to judging the film) has changed a bit. In some ways this helps the film, while in others it's hindered by this.Revenge of the Fallen's plot is simply all over the place, mostly due to the constant shift in settings. The starting point of the story is that the Autobots are now helping humans track down other Decepticons with Sam going to college and having to deal with Bumblebee, his girlfriend and one of this parents being more...unconventional than usual. But things only wind up getting more messy for Sam as the situation with the Autobots starts going in a not-so hot direction. By the time the film has ended, the viewer has gone and visited Sam's house, a college, a military base, airplane museum and Egypt.While the film's plot does have more substance than its predecessor (which, granted, isn't exactly a challenge), it doesn't flow out nearly as smoothly, with practically every essential plot point being delivered very briefly and over-stressed without elaboration. In some ways, it almost feels as if the film doesn't care about losing the audience in its plot details, though anyone who pays attention, has seen the first film and is even faintly familiar with the original back-story shouldn't have too much trouble keeping up.Stories are not where Bay has ever succeeded at, but rather the action is what he's noted for. And here, just like Transformers from 2007, the action is big, loud and overzealous. In fact, this film is to its predecessor what Gears of War 2 was to its predecessor action-wise: bigger, better and more bad-ass. The action has been captured much better than before, though it isn't without a few random explosions and 'chaos cuts' that ultimately show nothing. That said, everything in these sequences are quite impressive to look at and are guaranteed to make the viewer's eyes pop. What most will likely remember is the rumble in the forest during the middle of the film, it's definitely the best scene in the film.A few other select areas have seen a bit of improvement, but only slightly. The acting is a small step above that of the first one (with some obvious exceptions), the Transformers are properly given more screen time than the first film and there are a couple nice throwbacks to the original TV show (Starscream + Megatron=Not so pretty scenario).However, there are also areas the film still falters on and, even in parts that are improved from the first, still hold it back. What most will likely hold against this film the most (and already have) is how the runtime really drags on a lot more this time around (despite only being six minutes longer). Even during action scenes the film's length will definitely show its cracks, which has made many already dislike the film. And while the acting is a step above the first film, this isn't to say it's good, and once again, the machines have more/better personalities than the humans (well, generally, the twins aren't exactly what I'd call 'necessary inclusions').This also brings up the amount of Transformers we see in the film, which has hit a pretty large number. However, many of these inclusions don't feel in the least bit necessary and others who could've (and should've) been emphasized/fleshed out more were barely included (I can only recall Ratchet having one brief, quiet line). If anything, the film details the Decepticons side almost as much, if not a bit more than the Autobots (though fans of the show probably won't mind this). Some of the machines we see in the film impress us (with one near the end being, well, big), though for every likable one there seems to be another than we could've easily done without.While there's a lot that can be complained about in Revenge of the Fallen, it's still very possible to like and enjoy it. There's a greater sense of urgency with the higher stakes presented in the film, we see more of the Transformers themselves this time around (finally getting a bit of real screen time), the attempts at comedic scenes, while still falling flat, aren't nearly as lousy as those in the first film and again, the action is quite entertaining and is usually impressive (with some interesting twists here and there).Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a film that will likely cater to only select viewers who are tolerable of long run-times and lacking (to say the least) plot lines. For my money, I'd say it's better than its predecessor despite still having some key issues, but it's a tough recommendation since there are a lot of easy turn-offs present throughout. If you go into this film expecting mindless action, you'll get enough of that, but your endurance may very well be tested and it's pretty much given you'll get more than you bargained for (whether this turns out to be good or bad is entirely subjective). I myself enjoyed the film very much despite its flaws and will likely watch it again down the line.",7,0,2,24 June 2009
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," An Excellent, Entertaining Mid-Installment with Few Shortcomings
","Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith was literally the last hope any and all Star Wars fans had for George Lucas to even come close to matching the original trilogy. Despite the uneasy and lukewarm-at-best reception The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones garnered, anticipations were set high after the promising trailers along with multiple light saber duals being touted. This was the last major, on-screen film Lucas had left to release, and how did it manage and hold up? About as good as realistically possible.It's tough to try and even match the original trilogy. And while Revenge of the Sith isn't like a new revolution to Star Wars, it is one heck of a great film. It manages to be so engaging and entertaining that there are plenty of times it can be easy to forget about the film's shortcomings (especially during the last hour). Everything that could possibly be squeezed into a film such as this (and more) is present and handled and executed surprisingly well. From the story, to the drama, to the emotions, conflict, intensity, action, effects and even more, Revenge of the Sith can at times feel like a multi-layered film stylistically and genre-wise.So let's take a closer look, starting with the story. Things open with a bang as Anakin and Obi Wan get caught in the middle of a huge battle as they attempt to rescue Chancellor Palpatine. The unfolding plot from the beginning at first feels rather casual but eventually leads to a far more involved and engaging story. While the overview of the story itself has been known for what feels like an eternity now, the film manages to make the plot as interesting as possible thanks to a more personal insight into this particular branch of the story.In regards to the characters carrying the story as well as the rest of the film on their shoulders, there are some good performances to be found. Obi Wan, Anakin, Padme and Palpatine are given the center stage treatment and for the most part they do a sufficient job. McGregor as Obi Wan is still a solid, likable character and he manages to (once again) create a fairly convincing younger version of Ben Kenobi from A New Hope. Portman also delivers a mostly solid performance as Padme (especially after her on again, off again performance in Attack of the Clones), with only a few melodramatic lines being delivered. McDiarmid as Palpatine is finally given some true exposure after seldom appearing in the last two films, and while he has one or two lame lines he does well to create the dual personality character Palpatine/Sidious has.As for Christensen, the film's main point of focus, he actually turns out to have the most surprising performance of the entire cast. Unlike his horrendous performance in Attack of the Clones, Christensen managed to make a far more convincing and more than tolerable character this time around. While his role isn't without some cheesy lines and overzealous dialogue, he mostly pulled off a good performance this time around; which is good since this was really the last chance we had at seeing him before becoming Darth Vader with the suit on.If it isn't clear by now, Revenge of the Sith's greatest weakness is that there's some melodrama and issues with the dialogue. While the points in the film that these show aren't too frequent (about three or so times total), they still stick out. But since the film has a relatively lengthy runtime and the last hour is almost devoid of any of these moments (hence the word 'almost'), it's easy to look past them or even forget most of them.As with all other Star Wars films, the action and effects here are excellent. The five major light saber duals are all very fun to watch, even if on the short side (with one or two exceptions). Revenge of the Sith also hones the expected space battles, with the opening being a large-scale space ship battle that's pure pleasure to the eyes. And, as always, each of these scenes are captured and directed brilliantly, showing everything at a great angle so that you can appreciate as much as possible.To help compliment the action sequences (as well as non-action scenes) is the always impressive musical score. It's tough to find films with an overall greater and more memorable score than Star Wars, and other than films like The Lord of the Rings, there are few that can rival it. This is no less the case with Revenge of the Sith, as several various, tantalizing and epic scores are played throughout the film. It's all pure bliss.There are also some particular scenes that stand out very well and help make the film all the more intense, emotional and simply entertaining. There are three main standouts for me during the film. The first being when Anakin and Padme are looking out across the windows of the separate buildings they're in, imagining the other in the opposite area when they in-fact are. Another would be towards the end when Padme is giving birth and Anakin/Vader is being operated on to be outfitted in the Vader outfit; with both suffering simultaneously as the film alternates the viewpoints. But probably the single strongest scene in the film for me would be when the Jedi are being terminated/betrayed, from Obi Wan being shot off at to Anakin getting ready to kill the young padawans. Needless to say, there's no short supply of emotion and intensity here.All told, Revenge of the Sith is one heck of a movie and about as good as a film in its scenario could possibly be. While this isn't an earth-shattering, remarkable film that some might have foolishly hoped for, it's a great watch worth several viewings and a commendable effort from Mr. Lucas.",9,2,6,7 March 2009
X2: X-Men United," X2 Does Fall A Bit Short, But It's Still Really Fun To Watch
","Seems that X2 has been a movie that has gotten the love or hate treatment, just not the the extreme with movies like Alien 3. To get one thing straight, X2 is not as good as the first X-Men, but it's still a fun and stylish watch that actually comes out better than what typical movie sequels deliver.X2 starts out acting like the audience knows who everyone is, so if you haven't watched the first X-Men then you'd better watch it before this one, but why wouldn't you? Anyway, the character development isn't that deep since thanks to the first X-Men we all know who most of the mutants in X2 are, with the exception of Jason, Deathstrike and the infamous Nightcrawler, whom is awkwardly portrayed but still has a cool part in the beginning. Some of the main characters from the first movie don't have as big of a role in X2, instead, X2 allows the audience to get acquainted with some of the more or less underdeveloped mutants from the first like Iceman and Pyro.The plot in X2 isn't anything special, but it's worthy to say the least. All you really need to know is Logan finds out why he became Wolveriene, who gave him his powers and that the school gets overtaken. X2 does however set the stage for X3, so expect to see that coming at us soon.The special effects in X2 are certainly impressive, which help nicely to compliment the stylish action sequences that made the action in X-Men so fun to watch. It's these action scenes that make X2 so fun to watch and worth viewing multiple times. That and some humorous dialogue in a few areas will give fans of the first X-Men plenty of reason to like this movie.Does X2 prove to be as good as the first, no. Does it do anything to change the way we look at movies, no. But X2 does give us plenty of reason to have faith in X3 and proves to itself that stylish action is enough to make a movie watchable, but relying on it isn't good enough.",8,0,0,26 January 2006
The Matrix," The Greatest Sci-Fi Masterpiece Since Star Wars
","The Matrix stands among the greatest sci-fi movies to have ever surfaced in years. Like Star Wars before it, The Matrix has awed movie audiences with its great special effects, different view on the world and its deeply intriguing plot. Not once does The Matrix cease to amaze its viewer with what it has to tell, and it has quite a story to tell us indeed.The story of The Matrix is that in the near future, Neo, a computer hacker, is found by a group of people to discover the roots of the Matrix. What Neo quickly learns from this group of people led by Morpheus is that the world he lives in is not what it appears to be. This world he feels so safe in is merely an illusion created by the Matrix where the way we live is used to fuel the Matrix and the cyber beings that created it. Neo is brought into the picture because Morpheus believes Neo to be the One, a single person who's destined to save humanity from the prison of the Matrix. The plot is deep and isn't very easy to understand at first but this is what makes The Matrix such an interesting watch.What makes The Matrix different from other sci-fi movies is that it doesn't focus so much on special effects and mind-blowing special effects. Instead, most of the running time of the movie is used to tell the plot to the audience and let them understand how the Matrix works as if they were Neo. Yes, Neo might be a computer hacker at first but once he learns of the Matrix it's like all his knowledge of computers barely even matters. With that, the viewer almost never feels like they aren't getting anything in the movie that Neo isn't.The cast of actors/actresses in The Matrix is a pretty strong selection. Keanu Reeves plays the role of Neo, Laurence Fishburne plays Morpheus and Carrie-Ann Moss plays Trinity, a feisty woman who later becomes Neo's lover. Keanu Reeves does a good job of portraying Neo as a computer hacker and as the One. Fishburne also delivers a more than worthy performance as the persistent Morpheus. Carrie-Ann Moss gives the audience nothing less than the impression that she has feelings for Neo from the beginning and she keeps that feeling along with her more get-to-the-point attitude together very nicely. Then there's Hugo Weaving, who plays the bad guy of the show, Agent Smith. Weaving does a great job of giving Agent Smith a smirky but somewhat charming personality that makes the viewer not help but love him for it.The action scenes that The Matrix does give the audience are fun to watch and definitely worth seeing. But don't expect much action in The Matrix, as it only makes up about thirty to forty minutes of the movie. Hey, at least you get to see some sick CGI at the end of the movie, not to mention the world-famous signature lean by Keanu Reeves that got The Matrix for its nickname. Not only is the action scenes in The Matrix awesome, but they also present some funny humor to help them be more enjoyable. The battles in The Matrix may not be Star Wars huge, but with such a great presentation in the movie otherwise it doesn't matter.The Matrix ends very smoothly and by the time it does the viewer feels much more than just satisfied with their buy or rent of the movie. Without a doubt, if you're a sci-fi goer you just have to have this movie in your movie collection. If you are and you don't have this movie along with the other Matrix movies then why are you even reading my review to start with, go out and buy it now!",9,0,1,31 January 2006
Fast Five," Fun Film For Fans of Fast & Furious Franchise
","Film series as of recent have been holding a better streak of adequate consistency than we might be accustomed to. Saw didn't start becoming rotten until the fourth installment and while the upcoming Pirates of the Caribbean film might not leave much of a strong impression, early reviews are indicating it'll likely be about as good as Dead Man's Chest (decent). Now we have the Fast and Furious franchise coming back with a fifth installment (and a sixth already in-development). Though the shameful 2 Fast 2 Furious might have been a poor addition, the remaining films have maintained an adequate level of execution and entertainment (peaking with the under-appreciated Tokyo Drift). And with Fast Five being the first of many guaranteed action blockbuster films for the summer, eyes have still been on it to deliver.What has to be made clear is that anyone who honestly wants to enjoy the film should leave their logic and standards at the concession stand. Because from the opening minute alone we're given a scene that defies all plausibility, and the things only continue down a similar road throughout. Now that this has been made clear, the skeptical shouldn't worry too much, for there's still a solid film to find here. Part of what helps Fast Five work as well as it does is thanks to the fact it embraces such an over-the-top nature that audiences are likely more willing to accept given the hardships of today's economy. If you've come to enjoy the crazy action characteristic of series such as Rambo and Die Hard, then you'll feel right at home here.Those who've followed the Fast and Furious films up to this point will probably get a fair amount of nostalgia throughout the film with various characters coming back, including a couple surprises not shown in trailers (one of whom audiences will want to stick around after the short credits, along with another curious surprise). As a result, long-time fans will get the most out of Fast Five. But this isn't to say that newcomers won't feel some sort of attachment (if not entirely to the characters). Since the return of various characters isn't relied on too heavily with regards to exposure, less-familiar viewers needn't worry about feeling lost or not getting an idea of what they're like throughout the runtime. Fast Five might not significantly raise the standards that we've come to expect from such a franchise, but it doesn't have to. With so many areas visited by previous installments, resorting to a more action/thriller-centered approach than even the previous film only seems like an inevitable and fitting road to travel. And you know what? The results are quite welcome and pleasing.P.S. Don't mind my alliteration-heavy summary.",7,3,6,14 May 2011
Slumdog Millionaire," A Decent Though Unremarkable Film Worthy of Recommendation
","After hearing so many positive remarks about how this was one of the best, if not THE best film of the year my curiosity for it raised. Going into the film, I wasn't quite sure what to expect but I half-heartedly felt that I'd be either horribly disappointed or completely blown away (since I tend to be in the love it/hate it crowd for critically praised films such as this one). After leaving my theater (which was filled with people at least three times my age) I was saying to myself 'eh, it was a good film, but not Oscar-worthy'.While this might sound like I have an overall negative opinion of the film this is far from the case. Slumdog is a perfectly good film that's worth a watch by anyone really interested in seeing it. That said, I can't call it anything more than 'good' or 'solid' since it was certainly likable but far from awe-spiring.The story revolves around Jamal Malik who, upon coming one question from winning an Indian version of Who Wants To Be a Millionaire? is confronted and accused of cheating. Up until the last ten minutes the film is told in flashbacks as Jamal explains how he knew the answers to certain questions, with a considerable chunk revolving around him and his brother Salim and the troubled connection he has with Lakita, a girl they meet as kids early in the film. I liked the approach they went with giving the answers to certain questions a backstory from Jamal; I was actually hoping they did a flashback for each question but given the film's overall approach, it's easily understandable why they didn't go with this approach.One of the film's strengths is that it manages to feel authentic with the story revolving around the characters and the struggles they face. While I will say the dialogue felt rather clunky and slightly ridiculous at times the film manages to feel mostly believable thanks to its mostly down-to-earth approach with Jamal and Salim. As for the acting, everyone did a mostly solid job. Dev Patel manages to create a likable character (despite some on again, off again acting), Madhur Mittal creates a very believable adult Salim though Freida Pinto would have to be my favorite performer in the movie as the adult Lakita; she manages to make a great character who's very easy to like and sympathize with.There are a few strong moments in the film that will catch the audiences' attention (almost all of them unpleasant), most of which occur in the first half of the film. Comedic bits are few and far between, which does work in the film's favor since it maintains a core mood throughout the runtime. All told, it's a well-rounded package, with a sufficient ending that feels like it flows well and naturally as with the rest of the film.But why isn't this film anything truly amazing (for me at least)? Mostly because there really isn't anything in the film that's truly impressive or spectacular save for a few select scenes. The acting as I mentioned is solid though some performances are better than others (particularly with the supporting cast), dialogue is hit-or-miss and the film does drag out a bit leading up to the end. These aren't major issues and don't keep the film from being enjoyable, but as the film stands it only holds up as being a good, mildly entertaining watch (and I use 'entertaining' lightly here).This is a good, solid film that I would suggest watching if you're curious to see what it's like and know enough about the film going in. That said, I can't say this film is Oscar-worthy in my books and is far from being the best film I've seen this year. You may and possibly will like the film a lot more than me for all I know, which is perfectly fine by me; I'd rather at least half enjoy a film everyone else loves than not like it at all.",7,1,3,9 February 2009
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," It's a Mess
","I'm a light fan of the first two films (average/above-average sci-fi/action), so it should be easy to understand that I was anticipating this film. While I'll definitely admit the problems with both Transformers and Revenge of the Fallen, those issues didn't interfere with the entertainment and fun I got out of them. All I really wanted out of Dark of the Moon was good action and possibly some humorous scenes that would make it an enjoyable time in theaters. What I received, however, was an overbearing, convoluted mess that left me perplexed (not in a good way). It's tough to provide a decent plot synopsis since so much occurs back-and-forth throughout the film; especially during the first two acts. We're essentially introduced with a montage-esque twist on the first Moon landing, before switching to the film's present day with Sam and his (new) girlfriend trying to get him a job. Meanwhile, the Autobots appear to be continuing their jobs originally seen in Revenge of the Fallen (finding Decepticons and taking care of other world issues--illegal nuclear plants--along the way). This leads to the first of Dark of the Moon's problems: the plot (and script) is all over the place. This is especially so in the second act where shifts and twists come by as fast as the explosions and crunches emphasized later in the film (we'll get to those). Some of the more criticized scenes from the previous two films were those used for laughter. While it's true most of these fell flat in the second, they usually worked in the first. And while I'll say we get a couple more successful attempts at this in Dark of the Moon, too many are hackneyed and, at one too many points, misused. A key example of this comes from a character who acts extremely over-the-top (makes the brownie scene in Revenge look depressingly-toned) and doesn't get an ideal exit. Right when this happens, other characters make ignorant jokes that would have been funny and appropriate had he simply been knocked out, rather than meeting a serious end. 90% of the other frequent jabs of humor don't fare much better.This leads to one of the biggest issues with the film: haphazard tone shifts. Once again, the second act is where this prevails. We get a lot of scenes that are intended as funny, but are scattered amidst more serious moments. The problem is that these are juggled around so quickly that it becomes tough to stay in a certain emotion, which only took me more and more out of the film. Comic relief shouldn't be used like a crutch and tossed about more serious points. Unfortunately, Dark of the Moon makes this mistake so many times until the final 40-60 minutes, that words like conflicted and bipolar become understatements.Of course, what everyone truly wants out of a film like this is good action and effects, something Bay has always been known for and often delivers. And it's true, Dark of the Moon has some incredible visual spectacle. The action scenes are nicely shot, for the most part, and the final act is almost nonstop in the display we're given. When the real action sequence(s) kick in, they definitely leave you glued to your seat and the best part: they're not too short-lived like its predecessors (especially Revenge). However, even for the excellent technology put up, I couldn't even feel (happily) enthusiastic about it. As I said, the last act has A LOT of effects and stunt work at, well, work. But there's not much action otherwise in the rest of the film; save for a little chase-to-battle scene about halfway through and a couple brief points sprinkled elsewhere. The reason I couldn't fully enjoy the action found in the last act, however, is that it all comes too late and is overbearing. It takes about an hour and a half to get to this point, which is about how long most action films can retain the enjoyment of their stay. And though the previous two films were long as well, they flowed well enough to where the ongoings didn't feel like too much for the film to handle. Here, the film feels like it was two in one. As I said above, the plot goes all over the place which, combined with a literal (and to quote one of the characters) 'cluster****' of comedic/serious scenes, makes the incredible action in the final act feel more strenuous than entertaining. Even though I'm a fan of longer films (Pirates of the Caribbean 3 being a personal favorite), Dark of the Moon really takes its toll when the second act begins to give way to the third. And since the ending is way too anticlimactic to feel like a proper resolution has been provided (we're given, at best, a minute of talking after the action stops, before the credits begin), it becomes that much easier to feel like your eyes, ears and mind have been fried. But this wasn't from the epic nature the film strives for near the end, so much as it was from how misused everything felt.Dark of the Moon is a film I truly wanted to enjoy; it was what I wanted to be the ultimate summer action film of the year. The first two kept me entertained and interested, the trailers for this looked promising too, so I was expecting to have fun. Yet what I experienced was a huge, incoherent mess with next to nothing that helps it feel legitimately distinguished. My brain tried to shut down, but there are simply too many problems present; and they tragically outweigh what little redeeming qualities exist here. I'm glad others enjoyed it (my friend and the theater we were in gave it a huge applause), but for me, this will likely go down as the disappointment of the year.",4,5,13,29 June 2011
Jurassic Park," Hold On To Your Butts
","Jurassic Park is one of the films I just couldn't stop watching when I was younger. Although I used to watch it just for the roar of the T-Rex, the movie was still a perfect way for me to kill two hours on those boring Sundays I still deal with. While the idea of a movie that has the plot of 'resurrecting' dinosaurs, the movie does an excellent job in making the plot believable and actually made me think: 'If we had the right preparations, could we create dinosaurs?' It sounds crazy, but the movie really gets you thinking that after the easy-to-follow description of how they brought back the extinct lizards. As a movie directed by Steven Speilburg, the least one could've expected when watching a movie like this for the first time would be excellent CGI, and let me tell you, this looks better than many movies of today, and it's over twelve years older than them. Not only do the dinosaurs look astounding and believable, but the action they're put in (along with the actors) is equally satisfying and thanks to all-around great acting performances, there's plenty of well-done suspense throughout the film as well. But one of the many parts of this movie that immediately made me dig it was the music. The theme music in this film isn't only instantly recognizable, but it's also unforgettable and always a joy to listen to when watching a movie as fun and thrilling as this. While Speilburg has made (and still does make) some disappointing flicks he's still one of the top directors in my eyes and this one in particular stands out as a big hallmark. If you're looking for real entertainment that's larger than life, look no further than this thrill ride through the jungle.",9,4,5,1 June 2006
Valkyrie," Well-Crafted and Engaging
","When I first saw the trailer for Valkyrie, I said to myself, 'plenty of potential, but it looks like it will be wasted.' I was offered a the chance to see the film a couple times but turned away since it didn't look too promising to me. But I finally succumbed and decided to give the film a shot and see how it would hold up. After quietly leaving the theater with my friend, I can say this was a very nice surprise; and I'd encourage anyone curious to see the film to do so.One thing I said to myself before the film started was that I just couldn't see Tom Cruise pulling off an eye-patched Nazi attire. This was one of the first areas the film surprised me; Cruise managed to fit into his role as Colonel Stauffenberg very well. He also managed to make Stauffenberg one of his more likable characters for what I've seen. The supporting cast also do a good job and were arguably better at their roles than Cruise.The film does get off to a rather slow start but it ultimately sets the scenario up for what becomes an interesting and very engaging watch. While the end result(s) aren't surprising it's still neat to see how everything plays out and this is ultimately the film's greatest strength. Once the climax and plot began to play out I could not look away from the screen.Definitely check this film out if you get the chance, I can almost guarantee you'll leave the theater satisfied.",8,6,7,19 January 2009
The Soloist," Solid Performances In a Weak Film
","As I walked in and sat in a seat at my nearby movie theater waiting to watch The Soloist, I was hoping to get what the trailers seemed promise: a strong, character-driven story led by two talented actors ultimately amounting to a solid film. What I got was half of this. The Soloist does well with some of the material it has, but there are too many missteps throughout the film (especially in the first act) to make it anything above decent.The film's plot is fairly basic. Robert Downey Jr. plays a writer for the Los Angeles Times (Steve Lopez) who comes across a homeless violin/ex-cello player (Nathaniel Ayers) with Jamie Foxx filling in the character's shoes. Lopez sees potential for Ayers to make a 'comeback' so to speak and begins writing a column for him in the newspaper. Of course not everything works out so well and several debacles take place throughout the course of the film. All of this unfolds with some fairly haphazard approaches and mixed results.What really hurts the film is many of the choices made to progress the plot and emphasize the characters. The scenes which show the viewer what happened to Nathaniel before he became homeless come of as either perfectly adequate or inconsistent. Many of the film's scenes involve multiple voices saying/repeating lines/words over and over which, quite frankly, do get annoying before long. It also feels rather odd having a good few dialogue exchanges occur with both or all of the characters talking at once. Whether this was intentional or not doesn't detract from it feeling unnecessary and taking the viewer out of the unfolding plot.What does work in the film is the performances by the two lead actors. Downey Jr. does a great job playing a conflicted newspaper writer and he also takes part in a couple...nasty scenes that make for good, brief comedic moments. As for Foxx, he manages to do an equally, if not superior job fitting into his role and, unlike the film itself, barely has any hiccups during his performance. While both put on great performances, don't expect them to be in the running for the Oscars since they come just a slight nudge below excellence in their screen time. Part of this (mostly in Foxx's case) can be attributed to the questionable style of development as mentioned above. For the first half of the film it's tough to really care much about what happens but the second half does help even things out with stronger scenes. In regards to the supporting cast, most of them are negligible and, other than those who have more frequently occurrences (which granted aren't that many), barely stand out.The Soloist is a film that had plenty of potential to be a precursor to the film releases over the summer. Unfortunately, the film lacks a proper sense of pacing and direction to make it realize this potential. Foxx and Downey Jr. put on two great performances and during some of their key scenes, it's far easier to get immersed in the film. However, the film itself doesn't fare nearly as well and misses the mark just too much to be worthy of a full recommendation.",6,6,14,24 April 2009
