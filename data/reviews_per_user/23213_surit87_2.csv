Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," A tribute to Arthur Conan Doyle's work
","This was a very enjoyable movie with breath-taking action sequences. The 'chase through the woods' scene was spectacularly done through slow-motion but it isn't until 'Little Hansel' is unleashed when the viewer is left truly awestruck.The scenes between Holmes (Downey Jr.) and Moriarty (Jared Harris), greatly done, are the focal points of much of the movie's plot. The chemistry between Downey Jr. and Jude Law are also further developed from the first movie. My only complaint about this sequel is that Mycroft Holmes' character was dismissed as utter garbage.Hans Zimmer's score deserves a worthy mention. All in all a thrilling movie that conveys Arthur Conan Doyle's Holmes to our more 'adrenaline hungry' generation.",8,2,2,7 July 2012
The Dark Knight," The 'Darkest' of all Knights
","This is a very dark movie and Heath Ledger's Joker is the darkest it gets. The entire movie is like an eerie roller coaster ride. There's not much CGI here, only a truly haunting score and dashes of the Joker's mesmerizing lines. The action is kept from being overblown and that's really encouraging in this era of mindless CGI-driven summer blockbusters. More importantly, the story of Bruce Wayne is taken to new high (or low). This is unlike any comic book movie you have ever seen, one that you'll keep coming back to. All of the actors deserve their kudos, but Ledger overshadows them all.",10,2,4,7 July 2012
