Skyfall," review
","Director is not updated to current trend, outdated movie, I think They didn't see action films nowadays. We see eagerly for BOND movie.. who will give.. for the last 3 movies of Daniel are waste movies... Might be story is good, but Its not James Bond movie....We are expecting a lot from Bond movies, Last three films are having no action only talking. Its like serial, Background music is bored. There are no action scenes , which are best, All scenes we can expect before . Its completely somewhat grilled. Director didn't utilize chance. Craig also should see current movies.from Bond movies, Last three films are having no action only talking. Its like serial, Background music is bored.
