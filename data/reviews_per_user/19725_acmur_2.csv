The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," A lovely visualisation of the book.
","Breaking Dawn is my favorite of the four books. This is a good film of the book, delightfully capturing the essence of the first half with little detour from the source. I was pleased enough to see it in two consecutive sessions today. There's a generous sprinkling of humor amid the drama and the story sprinted to make the two hours seems very short. I could have happily sat longer for a more detailed exploration of the characters and their relationships, especially amongst the wolves. I can't imagine what people will experience without knowing the saga fairly well beforehand. I've read some negative reviews and find it amusing that anyone not caring for the previous films would see this... more fool them. My thanks to the cast and crew for bringing the book to life on the screen. I wish part 2 wasn't so far away.",8,4,16,18 November 2011
Pride & Prejudice," Run to the ticket window!
","Couple of problems with this show; it was too short, and it wasn't long enough. This film has fast pace, high octane dance, razor sharp delivery, vivid sketches of secondary characters and breathtaking settings. Darcy comes out of his fog like a god (please include nude scenes in the extended DVD version). Lizzie is smitten early and deliciously bunged up with prejudice, watching her reach truth is a revelation. Lady Catherine de Bourg, Mr. Collins and Mr & Mrs Bennett are fresh and surprising.I love the BBC production. I was blown away by this new film. How often do you get to love two versions of a story? Saw it on a big screen today. Forget about work, I'm going back tomorrow.",10,16,26,26 October 2005
