The Rock," Great action with great actors AND great music
","Viewed as an action movie I would have to put this among the top 10 of all times. The story is kind of... not unusual, but the actors make this movie really great. There is NO better man to play an officer with a conscience than Ed Harris. Period. Contrary to the awful Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna at his... well, usual level, I suppose) Harris acting is flawless. Then there is Nicholas Cage who is always good in this sort of role, the guy who is stronger than he thinks, and shows courage when it really counts. Sean Connery is of course great as he always is, but sad to say, the scriptwriters gave him some really cheesy comments, such as 'winners go home and f**k the prom queen'. I mean, that's not the line you'd like an actor like Connery to deliver. Really. Just as we would not like to hear Jean-Claude Van Damme read lines from some play of Shakespeare. Anyway, I have to correct myself. A little. Along side with Ed Harris, Michael Biehn is the perfect guy to play an officer. I mean, do people think of him as ANYTHING else? No, don't think so. Aliens, The Abyss, Terminator, Navy SEALs, the guy is a soldier! He plays the role really good, as always. And the supporting roles of William Forsythe, among others, is also good. Well, enough about the actors. The music gave me goose bumps. Perfect action movie music. In my mind only met by Alan Silvestri's music for 'Predator'. I am from Sweden, and like most of my countrymen, we aren't to keen on flag-waving movies , of which The Rock is a great example, along side with Armageddon and Independence Day. The Americans save the world! Sometimes we get the notion that you guys forget that there are other countries that are just as technologically advanced as you. Well, I had to put in a little criticism in here! Other than that, I give The Rock an 8/10.",8,5,6,16 June 2005
