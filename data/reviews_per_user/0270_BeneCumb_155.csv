Moneyball," Only for team sport fans, probably...
","I am not into sports, baseball is totally unknown to me and random short clips about this game have not increased my interest. I decided to watch Moneyball due to several Academy Awards nominations and some great actors - but the result is mixed and so-so feeling.Brad Pitt is good as usual, but he has had more interesting and complex parts (e.g. in Burn After Reading or 12 Monkeys or Inglorious Basterds). Philip Seymour Hoffman and Robin Wright are too briefly on screen. Jonah Hill does good acting, but his part is often numb. The other performances and just average and some characters add nothing to the logic of the plot (Pitt / Beane's family, for example).As for the script, it is slow at times, and the ending is too protracted and odd. Additional points from me because of real events and characters.Thus, it seems that Moneyball can be enjoyed by basketball fans, in the USA, above all. In my country, the movie got rather poor audience.",6,0,0,28 August 2012
Vertigo," The plot is good, the rest is great
","But it is still neither Psycho nor The Birds... Vertigo is a love drama with a crime in the background, it is mind-twisting, but not so thrilling and exciting as the above mentioned. The long scenes without texts do no include or add horror. The audience becomes aware of the mystery before the main character does - but the end is still unexpected, that is so Hitchcock! And the role and place of music is so fitting and boosting the whole atmosphere.Luckily the film is not black-and-white, making it easier to watch and enjoy landscapes and fashion.Vertigo is highly admired by most critics, including Estonian ones, who have ranked it the best or second best film in the history of cinema. I am not so generous, but I find the film a good classic and worth watching by younger generations as well.",8,1,6,6 September 2012
Come and See," Well constructed, yet one-sided Soviet film using TarkovskyÂ´s methods
","The film is 'old' and I am pretty sure I had not seen it in my youth, but for a change - and based on good ratings here - I decided to find necessary 2+ hours... And obtained mixed feelings.True, it is rather atypical Soviet film about war, reflective and running its course, without constant shootings and explosions, with religious elements. The leading character/performance is great, often 'too much' - in a sense that all other characters are too minor and supporting, less than e.g. Belarusian nature which wildness and emptiness provide additional value (btw, periphery villages in Belarus look almost the same as in the film, with minor technical accessories visible). On the other hand, one should bear in mind that this film was made before perestroika. thus all atrocities in the WW II were committed by Nazis only - so the Soviet people were told and that we see in the film. There is nothing about Soviet partisans stealing and plundering, confiscating properties, killing countrymen for living further in occupied territories, etc. Thus, in reality, Idi i smotri provides rather lopsided picture what was going on in those turbulent times and can be regarded a great work in terms of visual only.",6,2,8,13 April 2018
The Monuments Men," Good performances, brittle script
","A couple of years ago, 2 Academy Award winners George Clooney and Grant Heslov became interested in a true story about an allied group, the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program, tasked with finding and saving cultural works and items before their destruction by Nazis during World War II, and set to write and produce a movie. Due to their fame and connections, they manage to include almost a dozen of internationally known middle-aged actors and the budget of around 70 million USD... Sounds like a guaranteed way to a blockbuster? Well, the profit has been twice of the budget amount, but most of viewers and reviewers have been critical; and I can understand why. Even great actors like Clooney himself, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, etc. were unable to improve the hectic script, consisting of different places in Europe at the same time - as they spent too little time on screen and their characters were not elaborated. Funny dialogs were pertinent only at times, they were mostly meant to make dull search for creations more 'interesting' and smooth... Human connections/relations remained incomplete, and the movie is, in fact, a chronological and arid presentation of events not commonly known from WW II. Luckily, this 2-hour-movie does not become dull or annoying, but it is still a good example that important awards' winners and nominees do not automatically ensure a catchy and influential story. With ordinary/unknown actors, the movie might have become a flop.",7,0,1,29 June 2014
Captain Phillips," A bit too much focused on one man and lopsided place of action
","Tom Hanks apparently likes to star in movies where he saves the world/other/himself - apart or en suite - and he does it always well, irrespective of the script's quality. The movie in question has a solid basis in the form of biographical book, but the narrow venue and 2 hours 10 minutes combined make several scenes slow and dull to follow. And if you know the story behind, including how the hostage situation ended, there are now twists and you have to follow the events mostly taking place in small and half-dark premises - not so interesting if the scenes are long or recurring. However, dramatics in still in place, events seem realistic, and the conglomerate Maersk obtained free publicity (or was in the list of funders?).As for performances, Barkhad Abdi as Abduwali Muse, pirate leader is also worth mentioning (well, in the beginning, I had difficulties to discern the Somali actors, but soon Abdi stack out). But the other characters-performances were uninviting to me, partially due to brief appearance on screen.The movie is definitely worth watching if you like action taking places in a limited space of vehicle. Otherwise, you may experience decline in attention or would like to use fast forward function.",7,0,1,24 January 2014
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," A pleasantly different college movie
","There was a time when virtually all college shows or movies were based on himbos/bimbos vs. nerds, how to get laid / lose virginity, how to deal with boredom when/if you come from a rich family etc. The teen performers were cute and ugly, respectively, at it was stressed by 'blond' or 'wise' dialogs. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is totally different: warmhearted and realistic plot, switch of sad and glad, coping with introversion within company, influence of childhood to teen and adult years. The cast is also nice and even, no ordinary cute and empty faces, characters are finished in a gifted manner. Logan Lerman as the leading character Charlie is brilliant; he will likely follow River Phoenix' and Anton Yeltchin's footsteps. Emma Watson as Sam and Ezra Miller as Patrick are great as well.Thus, this movie is highly recommended to all giving odds to inner depth and feelings rather than exterior popularity. It should be further promoted and screened also in Europe.",8,0,1,13 January 2013
The Equalizer," A good action movie, thanks to leading actors, above all
","The second cooperation between Antoine Fuqua and Denzel Washington has resulted in another pleasant work - although not so powerful as Training Day, due to weaker script, but still... Washington is an actor who fills nicely out long individual scenes and parts not directly providing additional value, rather than adding tonality (and total length... :)) After a tardy start and unequal 'duetto' (Chloë Grace Moretz as Alina/Teri is sweet, but not on a par with Washington), the events start to roll, and Washington/McCall gets a due enemy in the form of Teddy (well performed by Marton Czokas). Other characters are rather vague, often played by inexpressive actors, or - for some reason or another - by the actors capable of filling bigger roles (Melissa Leo, Bill Pullman). At times, the logic of events and venues are odd (e.g. pre-final action in Wal-Mart - in the form of Home Alone for adults), but Fuqua-Washington round it nicely up without becoming annoying. All in all, a more-than-okay thriller, I believe that admirers of Washington will not be disappointed.",8,0,2,5 January 2015
The Expendables 2," Better that 1st part as well as than many action movies with young actors
","The screenplay is gifted, clichés and wittiness have put together inventively - and action heroes have good laughs at themselves, at their previous movies and style they are famous for. Moreover, it is amazing how fit the even 60+ years old men are chasing-shooting-fighting much better than their counterparts in their 30ies. And vulgar cursing has been brought to a minimum letting the movie to be enjoyed by a 'decent' audience as well. Of course, there is lot of violence, but it is not exaggerated, but realistic - people lose their lives for much less than kidnapping or trading nuclear materials. Recommended to all fond of action movies and fans of the big stars separately. The team is easy-going and everyone has his/her role to play. And the final big scene in the airport involving all the stars is undoubtedly a milestone soon to be copied or parodied.",8,0,0,10 November 2012
Skyfall," Not bad at all... And less emphasis on state-of-the-art widgets
","Despite different times, incl. changes in audience and getting used to digital opportunities, the Bond-series has maintained its traditions, repetitions and composition. Adele's song was nice - and the pre-story was also thrilling to follow (the fastest part of the film). Daniel Craig has improved a lot (he was very unaccustomed to me in his first Bond performance), but I still have to admit that several supporting actors outperformed him: Judi Dench as M, Javier Bardem as Raoul Silva and Ben Whishaw as Q, above all; Ralph Fiennes could have been spent more time on screen, but he will certainly do in next Bond films... Young female characters, however, were too brief and not convincing, the Bond-girl Sévérine (by Bérénice Marlohe) was rather inexpressive. Perhaps the film could have been shorter and with less unrealistic scenes, but still - it is worth watching and definitely in the better half of the Bond-films. 007 can continue, no time to discard him yet. I am looking forward to the next film already.",8,1,5,6 January 2013
John Wick," Stylish (over-)sophistication
","I have always regarded Keanu Reeves a great actor, but some of his choices/opportunities have been bizarre - mildly speaking. Fortunately, John Wick puts Reeves back on track again - he is the real 'filler' in this movie, there are a few short scenes without his presence, and quite often he is the only personality visible on screen. True, one can find similarities with his character in e.g. Matrix and A Scanner Darkly, and the plot has several flaws and airy-fairy moments, but all this is presented in a stylish and witty manner, with both multiple angles and endings. Reeves/Wick is a gloomy and firm man, his deeds are certain and final, yet dog- and wife-related scenes are nice and touching. And the locality of Hotel Continental is unconventional.Apart from Reeves, there are many other distinctive performances as well, practically all who have verbal roles. Michael Nyqvist (as Viggo Tarasov) is a due antagonist to Reeves; rather frequently, there is no proper confrontation because the 'bad guy' is more versatile/fascinating than the 'good guy' (or vice versa).All in all, the movie in question is no Tarantino, but yet a good entertaining action with pleasant performances.",8,9,22,22 January 2015
Gravity," More effects and technology than acting opportunities
","I am not an eager follower of sci-fi movies / space dramas without real enemies to fight, and the reasons I decided to watch Gravity were good actors and short duration (the latter is uncommon for such movies); true, I had read about high praise, but I did not get it under my skin :) Therefore, I observed a pleasant and talented actress Sandra Bullock and her similar counterpart George Clooney in the course of their actions... They did well as usual - although Bullock had much bigger role and I recalled similar Clooney from Solaris - and everything was decent/good, but no wow! feeling... As for the plot/script, even for me as non-physicist, there were too many odd phenomena, and floating Post-It notes and pens in the spaceship seemed more like a practical joke. Of course, cinematography and directing are well done, but all in all - with no new angles in the script and the ending's predictable nature, I am unable to consider it conceptional in the movie industry, just a well-polished creation.",7,2,5,11 January 2014
Lone Survivor," Documentary - rather than feature film
","Military movies based on biographical books and focusing on a single operation have both advantages and disadvantages. The first includes accuracy, naturalness, real names and places, but if you know the course of action and the ending (including hinting title), then you have to find some other angles and elements to catch...Well, the cast is evenly good, a real ensemble, although several actors performing members of the team were unknown to me.Shootings and dramatics were also in place, but the movie was roughly and unevenly divided into 3 parts: preparation for the mission (a bit protracted), failed operation (a row of fast and changing scenes), and escape of a single man (with ups and downs, and where I was confused why the US sends their soldiers out without any knowledge of local language, even with the help of a phrase-book).Occasional aridity in the plot is outbalanced by great cinematography and realistic atmosphere, probably better appreciated by those having direct contacts with troops or military service.Thus, I like Lone Survivor, but there are dozens related movies I like even more, e.g. Platoon or Saving Private Ryan.",7,0,4,28 January 2014
Star Trek," Great technology, good acting, plot full of clichés
","The more the technology advances, the less attention is paid on human acting / relations etc, being replaced by explosions, bangs, flashes and other mishmash hindering contemplation. The Star Trek is another example of similar movies so popular within last decades. And all this mentioned above is 'robed' into political correct and wider audience attracting elements and cast where all genders, races, ages, types etc are constantly visible - with their 'nice' and comprehensive-to-all understanding of human issues.As for acting, at least two supporting actors - Simon Pegg and Anton Yelchin - performed better and in more interesting way than most of stars, with the exception of Zachary Quinto as Spock. Chris Pine as Captain Kirk is not convincing... But as I am not a follower of Star Trek series over the years, I just watched the movie as another adventure one, guessing the end already. Thus, not impressive, but a quality killing time.",7,1,2,1 November 2012
Fury," Pathos and elation at the expense of logic and realism
","Panoramic war movies with the participation of famous actors have always caught great success and ticket income. No exception is Fury, where Brad Pitt for 'older' generation and Logan Lerman and Shia LaBeouf for 'younger' generation are definitely the names to attract audience. And yes, they do great in this movie, pity that LaBeouf's character was not so elaborated and spent limited time on screen. All three have successfully diverged from plain 'nice-guys-with-cute-faces' roles and have (Pitt, LaBeouf) or attempting to (Lerman) participate in something more versatile and dramatic.Fury has firm expectations for this, but unfortunately the script has focused on action and battling rather than smooth logic of events. Clichéd characters and unrealistic events and solutions prevail too much, and feeling of time and space is impaired on several occasions (the time-frame between Lerman's character detecting German soldiers and first shots from their tank is especially odd). Moreover, the ending is trivial as well.Thus, 8 points for acting and 4 for the plot from me, but if this movie has made the younger people pondering on and over the essence of war, then it has gained its end. Anyhow, there are too many movies focusing on visual effects and reasoning out there.",6,81,170,15 December 2014
The Maze Runner," A bit of this, a slice of that - and no new level
","Well, I realize that I am not among the movie's target audience, but I have seen Lord of the Flies, Divergent, Predator and similar, but it has not crossed my mind that I take more of less interesting parts of them, employ more or less famous actors with different racial background, with the hope that something conceptual will arise... In fact, the outcome is a rather plain story for teens with laying stress on 'nice' values, such as need for teamwork, trust, friendship, courage, etc., where the leading character/actor is less interesting than his co-stars, and the ending is confusing and scattered due to the sequel already planned. But as this movie and Hunger Games series have enjoyed enormous popularity and box office, then such creations probably fill some kind of gap in the line of new movies. There are a few thrilling and unexpected moments, but all in all - just another shallow entertainment, but hopefully a stepping stone for young actors who could be more selective in picking roles (at least for Thomas Brodie-Sangster and Will Poultier).",6,1,3,30 November 2014
This Is the End," Quite a good rubbish :)
","As I am no admirer of the actors having leading roles in this odd creation, I did not expect much, but decided to see this movie due to high acclaim. Well, the result was better than I had feared, as most of the participants performed boldly and with a lot of self-irony. As for the script, it is rather hectic and loose, but it's craziness does not live up to which is used in most British similar movies. I personally find the scenes prior to 'sci-fi stuff' best and most amusing, the very ending is funny as well. Somewhere in-between, the pace slows down, and there are jokes resembling Jackass, or just attempts how far is possible to go vis-a-vis rudeness and dope...As for acting, the best parts are performed by Craig Robinson and Michael Cera, the least interesting - by Danny McBride and Jay Baruchel whom I did not remember from any of the movies. Seth Rogen is much better producer and screenwriter than actor.If you like Canadian comedies, messy fun and blunt jokes, then you will probably enjoy This Is the End as well. For me, it was an average 1 hour 40 minutes in front of screen.",6,2,6,29 June 2014
World War Z," Zombie movie with a difference... But still a zombie movie
","In general, I am not much into science fiction where villains are not aware of their cruelty, but the names related to the movie (Forster, Brooks, Carnahan, Pitt) let me believe that I would see not a trivial zombie movie focusing on blood, shootings and related smutty shouts... To a large extent, I was right: zombies are not prevailing and often not even visible, there are versatile places of action, and the protagonist's activities are supported by high-minded goals (sometimes the latter is stressed too much, however).Brad Pitt (as Garry Lane) is pleasant as usual, but the whole movie is too focused around his character, and there are only a few memorable supporting actors - e.g. David Morse and Peter Capaldi. Proceeding from the logic of events, the presence of Lane's family is superfluous; so are some story lines.Nevertheless, skillful directing and big budget (different locations, mass scenes, digital effects) have helped to create a smoothly running script, with some unexpected twists and expected ending. If you like epic-apocalyptic movies, you will enjoy World War Z and have sympathy with brave people and non-sympathy with the undead...",7,0,1,10 September 2013
Mississippi Burning," Versatile depiction of reality - with evenly strong cast
","This drama-thriller is loosely based on the FBI investigation into the real-life murders of three civil rights workers in Mississippi in 1964, providing an additional value to anyway skillful plot (by Chris Gerolmo) and direction (by Alan Pakula). In comparison to other states, Mississippi was (and largely is) behind the times in many ways, and many crimes were launched or not disclosed due to overall mentality and indifference -- thus, community solidarity can have both good and bad elements. The movie shows how difficult is to investigate if people are at bay, and when certain activities are not perceived as felonies. The events are logical and catchy to follow, largely thanks to character actors like Gene Hackman, Willem Dafoe, Frances McDormand, and Brad Dourif who make a difference even while being briefly on screen -- no cute faces or politically correct solutions, but harsh and effective methods for solving a severe crime.It is neither family movie not entertainment, but depiction of black spot in the US history after WWII. But laid out and performed well, without digital effects or long reasoning on human values.",8,2,2,27 May 2013
The Impossible," Excellent performances, but protracted and predictable plot
","The screenplay is based on a true story of the Spanish family Belón before and after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, and that is why it is a Spanish movie - apart from actors who are mostly from the USA. As its pace and running are very Spanish, hence the different running and longer focusing on reiterations and longer scenes. I am not very much into statics and several times I found myself in using (fast) forward function. Due to my imperfection, I guess... :) The cast is, however, brilliant, especially Naomi Watts as Maria Bennett and Tom Holland as Lucas Bennett; Ewan McGregor as Henry Bennett is great as well, but he spends less time on screen. On the other hand, because of the use of known actors, the viewers can shortly guess the outcome even if without prior knowledge of the story. It should be noted that all children's performances are very good and realistic, even the smaller Bennett boys have rather long bearing scenes.The movie is definitely for you if you like survival stories with 'ordinary' people becoming real heroes.",7,1,2,22 January 2013
Shaun of the Dead," Witty black comedy
","As I am no fan of sci-fi stuff, I am very selective in watching related films (I try to avoid films with lots of sophisticated technology achievements and vocabulary). But I have enjoyed films with Simon Pegg's participation - and I did not have to be disappointed this time as well. He is not only a talented actor, but he has a certain twisted mind for partaking in peculiar works where real fun and amusement lie in background actions and/or witty comparisons. Pegg's character is Shaun, an ordinary and childlike man attempting to get some kind of focus in his life as he deals with his best friend, neighbour, girlfriend, mother and stepfather - all of them having their own problems and odd concepts (skillfully played by British character actors). At the same time, Shaun has to combat an uprising of zombies, begin to take decisions both for himself and the others; but he will still remain (almost) an ordinary citizen, not fabulous superman for couple of hours as we see in most similar U.S. movies.The plot is strong and smooth, many scenes and lines make you giggle, and politically incorrect ending scenes are really enjoyable. Recommended to all those who would not take destroying humanoid zombies very seriously and can withstand the idea that the good can die too...",8,1,3,6 May 2013
Argo," A good political thriller - there are not too many of them
","The fact that it is based on a true story gives additional value to the plot - regardless of authenticity claims or wishes. As the embassies are usually the places where even the fiercest enemies dare not to attack because their grounds are considered territories of respective countries and unauthorized entry is equal to declaration of war. But this hostile takeover really took place in Tehran in 1979 and only more severe events in Afghanistan prevented this conflict from emerging into a real war.Ben Affleck has done a great job in creating true background and atmosphere, giftedly combining documentary and feature film frames. Tensions and race with time are maintained throughout the movie, characters are realistic and human, not self-destructing persons full of pathos as we see in many similar US movies. All the cast is good, but the finest roles are performed by John Goodman and Alan Arkin who - not being state officials - are more relaxed and witty.Recommendable to those fond of historical thrillers. Moreover, the movie helps to comprehend many issues related to current Iran.",8,4,8,12 November 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," Good movie... Although with some underused characters
","I am very picky in watching sci-fi movies, they tend to be too 'inward' (= slow, few lines) or too technological to me. Star Trek series holds a nice balance between them and, therefore, I have seen all on them; without a wow! feeling, but still having a good time. The movie in question had the latter influence on me, I was eager to know how all the space mess created would end. Well, sometimes there were lots of explosions and flashes, but great (Benedict Cumberbatch, Simon Pegg - Brits outperforming Americans again :)) or good (the rest) actors prevented the movie to become a purely technical course of events. Some actors, however, could spend more time on screen (Zachary Quinto, Anton Yelchin) and the character of Dr. Carol Marcus provided no additional value to the movie. As for the main star Chris Pine, I am not a fan of him, he is not a top-A-whatever grade actor to me. On the other hand, he was not annoying, although I would have expected to see his presence less and others' more on screen :) Star Trek Into Darkness is definitely for you if you like space action with versatile characters. Sci-fi fans following the book should probably avoid it as the script is a mix.",7,2,4,8 September 2013
Ted," If toys could/would 'mature' with you...
","I watched the movie without prior knowledge and the very beginning did not look promising... But then, with Mark Wahlberg's (as grown up John Bennett) entrance, the things changed and lots of fun and irony filled the screen. The plot has its roots in romantic comedies and there are several related clichés, but used vocabulary and awkward supporting characters provide additional - and captivating - value. In spite of 'overlay' fun and hectic events there are serious topics in place, including (but not limited to) growing up, letting go, commitment, love and/versus friendship, greed, jealousy, childhood influences.It took some time for me to recognize Mark Wahlberg as a gifted actor - but I have admitted it for a while and the movie in question is no disappointment in that respect. In a convincing way, he can be both a tough action man and a pleasant childish ordinary guy. The director Seth McFarlane as Ted is also sweet and funny. Mila Kunis' role has the most clichés, but thanks to appearance and talent she does her part nicely and smoothly. Giovanni Ribisi is an atypical actor who could be used more frequently. Soundtrack of the movie is well-picked and good as well, especially Queen and Nora Jones. Queen is one of my most favorite bands and all respective references make my day :) Owing to the topics, Ted could easily be a family movie, but due to strong language it has been rated unsuitable for children/teens in many countries. So far, it the highest-grossing original R-rated comedy of all time. Well done, Mr McFarlane and your team!",8,0,3,30 November 2012
Black Book," Another Verhoeven's masterpiece in Holland
","Conquerors have often had the tendency to beautify, glorify their contribution and the events towards victories. This has brought along hundreds of films where dramatic events have been dealt with black-and- white manner. Zwartboek is a pleasant exception which shows life in harsh and uncertain circumstances in a realistic manner, with 'good' and 'bad' people and actions in both sides. The plot is solid and intense, has several twists and turns, catchy action scenes and dramatic moments. The value is enhanced by filming in real locations (joy of recognition; however, it increased the budget a lot) and the use of both Dutch and German actors, thus the original languages were spoken during the film. The cast is very strong and with character actors mainly, beginning with Carice van Houten as Rachel Stein / Ellis de Vries and Sebastian Koch as Ludwig Müntze - both internationally famous European actors. Highly recommended to those fond of versatile war films with strong feelings and dynamic events. It is no wonder that, in 2008, the Dutch public voted it the best Dutch film ever.",8,0,1,17 March 2013
Pirate Radio," It rocked... in different ways
","Richard Curtis is a name connected to many successful British comedies with great choice of actors: Four Weddings and a Funeral, Bridget Jones's Diary, Notting Hill are the most known and appreciated. The Boat That Rocked is a slight step behind, but there are lots of funny moments and credible depiction of daily life and attitudes of DJ's and music managers in the 1960ies.The cast is full of stars (Philip Seymour Hoffman, Bill Nighy, Rhys Ifans, Nick Frost, Kenneth Branagh) and most of supporting roles are also played by famous men and women often doing bigger roles. Nighy, Ifans and Branagh bring along the funniest moments, Hoffman's character has most versatile aspects.Although the film is a bit too long (over 2 hours), it could be both advertised and shown more at least on TV. People aged 60+ can have comparisons and reminiscences, for the others it is definitely a humorous view on life of bohemian mavericks... And the soundtrack includes the main hits of that era, later and even at present covered by various artists.",8,2,2,1 December 2012
Orphan," Great thriller - without divine mystics or similar
","I was a bit hesitant to watch this movie as I am not very fond of evil governed by supernatural characteristics or if something bad happens just in someone's minds and senses. But as I have admired Vera Farmiga's appearance and performance, I thought that the result could not be awful or numb either. To my surprise, the movie was great: thrilling, logically motivated, smoothly running with many unexpected scenes.Apart from Farmiga as the mother Kate Coleman, the other great role is performed Isabelle Fuhrman as Esther - an awkward and gifted girl adopted by the Colemans - who triggers the sequence of varied events in and around the family. I was also astonished that the plot has connections with my motherland Estonia, and the Estonian language is spoken and read - quite a rare thing in Hollywood movies.After seeing the movie, I was wondering how many viewers keen on adoption changed their mind afterward or at least had second thoughts...",8,1,2,21 November 2012
About Time," Recognisable Curtis, but still pleasant to follow
","Richard Curtis is a sign of certain quality in the British cinema, even in the event of recurrent approaches, scenes and topics, e.g. laugh between tears, ups and downs in romance, giggling moments amidst 'serious' scenes, colourful supporting characters, and last but not least - a wedding scene... Anyhow, there is always a new angle, and in spite of some disharmony and flaws in the plot, About Time is definitely another 'well-done' creation, with fine performances even in supporting roles (particularly Domhnall Gleeson as Tim, Rachel McAdams as Mary, Bill Nighy as Dad, Tom Hollander as Harry).The role of sci-fi was not too big (good for me :)), so the film is apparently not for genuine fantasy and fiction lovers, and the amount of big laugh opportunities is lower than e.g. Four Wedding and a Funeral, and Love Actually... Bearing that in mind, I am sure that if you have liked Curtis' concepts, you will have a pleasant and warm-hearted 2 hours in front of TV screen.",8,4,6,17 April 2015
Insomnia," A bit slow, but with strong cast
","It is a pretty for-certain success when/if you combine sense issues with a middle-of-nowhere landscape which provides additional vacuity and thrill; Iceland, Canada, Scotland are the best known locations. In spite of the events going on in Alaska, the movie was shot in British Columbia, i.e. Canada.Christophen Nolan is fond of mystery movies running their course - and Insomnia is no exception. At times the scenes are too long and only thanks to Al Pacino's excellent performance you won't yawn or longing for the imminent end... Robbie Williams and Hilary Swank are also worth watching but they spend much less time on the screen than Pacino. And a nice 'supporting actor' is the landscape and background...I have not seen the original Norwegian movie, but the one in question can still be recommended. Especially for those who like Pacino and Williams - you won't be disappointed.",7,0,0,19 November 2012
500 Days of Summer," I know what you did with Summer... and vice versa
","This movie is a nice romantic - yet realistic - comedy drama, with the ending different from similar movies. It non-linear narrative structure, with comparisons and flashbacks, provides the movie additional value, and yet it runs smoothly. = Good writing and directing! Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Tom Hansen and Zooey Deschanel as Summer Finn - the main stars - are brilliant and their characters are realistic and convincing; such attitudes towards love, relationship, commitment etc. are common among many younger people. And the choice of music is masterful.Together with Paul Dano and Anton Yelchin, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is among the best young contemporary male actors. All movies with their participation - due to the performers' versatility - are pleasant and catchy to watch, remember this! :)",8,1,1,14 December 2012
Juno," Wittily funny... A teen movie with a difference
","No wonder that the screenplay received Academy Award - it is skilfully written and is realistic. Well, probably there are not too many cases where all parties reach consensus, but still... Of course, the topics of abortion and teen motherhood are sensitive and conservative viewers might condemn the way they were approached. Anyhow, the characters are deliberated and wonderfully performed; Ellen Page has the leading role, there are a few scenes without her; all supporting actors are catchy as well (Michael Cera is a nice character actor). The scenes develop in a logical manner and the ending is pleasantly versatile as well - and not fully predictable. With warm and romantic undertones, though.The music/soundtrack has also a role in the movie's huge success, the calm and and slow songs complement the moods in a very suitable way. They are mostly related to Juno's thoughts or deeds.This movie is highly recommended - and not to young people only. Moreover, it is so pleasantly different from the bulk of teen/college movies with bold cuties vs. poor nerds, sportsmen and cheerleaders, home parties with sex/drugs/booze and other overexploited themes and topics.",8,0,1,30 January 2013
Don Jon," Distinct idea, pleasant performances, realistic ending
","Movies dealing with lust, masturbation, casual sex, etc. are not for everyone, and they must be candid or with twisted approach, otherwise they are just rude and embarrassing. In my opinion, Joseph Gordon-Levitt (director + screenwriter + leading male) has found this angle, and the result is a realistic movie depicting modern comprehension of sex and love among the younger generation, boosted by Internet and club atmosphere. Even family ties or church are often unable to hinder this...All the three leading performances are sophisticated: apart from Gordon-Levitt as Jon 'Don Jon' Martello, Jr., Scarlett Johansson as Barbara Sugarman and especially Julianne Moore as Esther provide brave but still nice performances. The other are also okay, however, most uninviting Don Jon's pals, apparently brought along for diversification of ethnicities.'Only' 7 points from me as I find some other recent movies with the presence of Gordon-Levitt more interesting (e.g. 50/50, Hesher, 500 Days of Summer). But anyways a strong feature directorial debut.",7,1,1,22 January 2014
Cloverfield," Accomplished with particular nature, but several flaws at the expense of thrill
","I am not a typical viewer of related works, but, from time to and 'on request' from friends or relatives, I am in for them - especially when they are not long.As my prior information did not include any famous actors and I was briefed about the basics, I decided to focus on scenes and their structuring. The 'introduction', however, was too long, and when 'the hell broke loose', then odd things occurred not possible in such situations, e.g. maintenance of lighting or GSM coverage, and if/when explosions widen and buildings crash closer and closer, people do not remain on the streets and follow them, but run away or find shelter asap. Thus, many of subsequent scenes were airy-fairy, and the found- footage style just added tension (true, I have to admit, quite capably), but again: no way the cam and the film inside could last until the so-called end.So, all in all, Cloverfield is just another mind- and technology- twisting creation meant for them completely in following the events, moods and twists. For me, it was a slightly-more-interesting The Blair Witch Project, and its huge popularity remains mystery to me.",6,0,0,20 March 2016
The Hateful Eight," A rather static 'sitdram' elevated by strong performances and peculiar solutions
","A new Tarantino's movie is always an event to be waited for or feared by millions, as his approaches, choice of actors and selected topic set a certain example. Many regard Tarantino as a lover of exaggerated violence and rough communication, but it is often forgotten that he can be 'mild' rather than 'wild' - in Jackie Brown. Here, in The Hateful Eight, the volume with shootings or blood is quite limited as well, the main focus is on characters, dialogs and some beautiful winter landscapes - particularly familiar now when there is snow in many countries in the Northern hemisphere... True, the first half or so could have been abridged (as well as the total length) and not all characters are evenly elaborated (Samuel L. Jackson, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Walton Goggins spend most time on screen and have more versatile characters to play), but still - the result is distinct, with references to more distant U.S. history and mishmash of time-frame typical to Tarantino.This movie has definitely its style, although it might attract less audience than many other Tarantino's creations - for Tarantino fans, it is tardy and pensive with dialogs causing no giggling, for non-fans it is too violent and twisted anyway. But SLJ and JJL provide distinctive performances, the latter was nominated for Golden Globe for her role.",8,1,6,26 January 2016
Dear John," A film about youth, but not another youth movie
","Lasse Halström is a skilled director who knows how to make teen idols perform in serious dramas. I used to like What's Eating Gilbert Grape (with Johnny Depp and Leonardo DiCaprio) more but still I find Dear John a nice romantic film where Channing Tatum (former model and commercial performer) has made his best performance so far. His character fills all the scenes and he looks very convincing - often more than his female partner Amanda Seyfried (ex-model as well).The plot is realistic, not with big surprises and twists, but I guess lots of viewers can identify themselves with the same or similar situations. Long-range love, single parents' issues, hard illnesses are familiar to most of us.Recommended to those fond of intense relations and profound issues.",7,0,0,27 September 2012
Crash," Rambling entanglement, but not protracted - and with brilliant cast
","Big cities do not apparently conform to human nature - people are tired, nervous, and all this is reflected on rude behavior, including on people's gender, race and/or profession. Paul Haggis has created a realistic atmosphere in one of them - Los Angeles where people of different background and races must intertwine and cope with each other; unfortunately, race-related positive discrimination has created some injustice and abuse of 'advantage', resulting with things easily getting out of hand.The cast is very strong, although there is no leading character, all have kind of supporting roles. But names like Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Brendan Fraser, Terrence Howard, William Fichter are a sign of quality, and they are pleasant to follow. But the most interesting role was played by Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges whose statements on racial tensions make you giggle - in spite of seriousness beyond... Most of characters act in couples, but not all pairs are equally interesting or contributing to the run of events, they seem to act in a parallel universe.Nevertheless, Crash is a conspicuous movie - no wonder it was awarded 3 Oscars (plus 3 nominations) - as it combines felonies and profundity in a distinctive manner.",8,1,3,30 October 2013
The Way Back," A survival story - based on real events
","Director Weir has accomplished a magnificent - and undoubtedly not a cheap task, due to the need for variety of landscapes. Although only Indian scenes were filmed in India, the geography and other background are very trustworthy. The route is harsh, its cause is dangerous, but the beauty is still there - even in an empty desert.The real stars of the movie are Farrell, Harris and Ronan (my ranking). It is really amazing how an Irishman (Farrell) looks like and speaks as a real Russian crook! The others, incl. Sturgess, have perhaps less interesting characters, at least they were not convincing to me.The only thing a bit distracting is the language issue - similar to other movies where events or characters are non-English. Combination of Russian actors and English-speaking actors speaking Russian is not always a success - though here some common rude Russian words are audible, which is seldom the case even in Russian movies :)PS It is a pity that, Stalinism-communism is still considered more decent than Nazism (portaits of Stalin and Lenin or hammer-and-sickle symbol not banned etc) although there have been far more victims and lost generations under communist eras.",7,2,4,30 September 2012
Shutter Island," Too mind-twisting, Scorsese has made better stuff
","Actors are excellent (DiCaprio has pleasantly surprised me again), but the plot has its shortcomings -- there are so many issues unsolved or unexplained, e.g. whom did the main character meet in reality or why he suffered his illnesses. The movie itself is a bit lengthy (suspense is sometimes lost), and the ending is too sophisticated as well.Director and cameramen, however, have done nice work, making Shutter Island definitely an A-movie. But, in my opinion, The Others and The Sixth Sense (among others) are better. But if you just like to experience in common or like to be captivated by gloominess and mystery, then this movie is meant for you :)",7,0,1,27 July 2012
Life of Pi," Playful and showy, but too much 'wreathed' worldwide
","Although the movie has a nice balanced approach of visual and spiritual, the plot is still hectic and with too long scenes and repetitions - its duration of about 2 hours could have been avoided. Directing and camera work are, of course, excellent, and powerful nature (the sea, above all) and animals are catchy to follow, but this shipwreck story becomes a bit annoying soon (thanks to the tiger, not totally boring though). Moreover, the flashbacks and recollections could easily be shorter. And the ending, well... Just the joy of storytelling.As for actors, they are not so memorable, typical Bollywood, and Gerard Depardieu has too small part. Speaking of India-related movies, I would definitely prefer Slumdog Millionaire or The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.",7,1,3,26 February 2013
Doctor Strange," When do people get tired of Marvel stuff and their 'treatments'?
","I can't say that I belong to the target audience of superhero films, but I do not exclude them; well, several of them have given me good moments and memories. Also, I do not declare that special effects would necessarily kill the idea or watching pleasure, particularly when looking back on movies decades ago when the technology level did not permit to include out-of-this-world or sci-fi elements in a way in conformity with the rest of the movie... But still, at present, I tend to come across that flashes and effects constitute the main frame/value of a work.Most of the above applies also to Doktor Strange, where even good character actors have limited opportunities to show their talent, when dialogues - even when witty - are artificially constructed, and the pre- ending scenes are predictable and consisting with action in the main. Yes, all is visually great and without 'bastings', but the movie itself lacks novel approach and visions, resembling a known fairy-tale in a different sauce. Costumes and masks are great, but versatile actors tend to use their facial expressions and body movements while producing a wonderful role...Acting 9 points, script 5 or so, in total - 7. To me, the weakest movie with Cumberbatch involved - whom I admire a lot. On the other hand, I comprehend that fame and acclaim is often based on the number of viewers, and so more versatile roles are about to come.",7,2,2,13 August 2017
Full Metal Jacket," Probably great then, but slightly timeworn now
","I am sure I had seen this movie before, probably after its release, but I had no reminiscences - probably due to being too young. As for Stanley Kubrick, I have ambivalent feelings towards him: I consider him talented and distinctive, but there are two movies being uninteresting to me - Dr. Strangelove and 2001: A Space Odyssey... True, all his later films I have found to be at least good, if not more, and the one in question is definitely a good movie.Full Metal Jacket consists of two rather different parts, with only two connecting characters - 'Joker' and 'Cowboy'. The first part is more intensive and versatile, and many elements have been later used both in other 'serious' movies and in parodies. R. Lee Ermey (as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman) fills in the screen in total, the roles by Matthew Modine and Vincent D'Onofrio could have been more psychological, too much focus on field training and barrack environment. Part 2 - already in Vietnam - is more arid, with many shootings and wrecked buildings resemble battles in Stalingrad, with the exception of climate... The actors are not catchy and scenes depicting one idea or event are too long. The ending could have been more sophisticated as well.Not a bad war movie, but I still like some later ones more, e.g. Platoon, Saving Private Ryan, Stalingrad.",7,0,1,15 October 2013
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," A realistic, intense film with distinct characters and strong performances
","I had planned to watch the film in question months ago, but then I delved into longer series and so I found time yesterday only... And I am fully satisfied.Above all, due to characters and performances. They are peculiar, yet, realistic, there is some evolvement, but basics remain, and the events not expected make them disclose their 'hidden' values. It is one of the few films where even actors with smaller roles are catchy, starting with Harrelson and Dinklage; McDormand and Rockwell could show their versality again in full and their Academy Awards are well to the point.The story is leading-edge as well. There is limited 'action', but so must be life in a small place, and, as the events progressed, you expected generally a different solution as you saw on the screen later. Tragic and comic moments are in good symbiosis and the ending is nicely 'open' - probably not their cup of tea who are fond of usual crime stories - but not creating wtf! or hollow feelings. Simple things have sometimes complicated solutions, yet their depiction is far from simplicity and moralisation. All in all, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a real gem amidst over-sophisticated and over-flashed films often based on comics (that is why I have moved on from films to series).",9,1,4,18 June 2018
Pacific Rim," Perfunctory over-sophistication with clichés
","As we know, Guillermo del Toro is fond of fantasy and visual effects, and state-of-the-art technology enables him to provide more flashing scenes and fights - regretfully at the expense of pithiness and novelty. Similar monsters, equipment, fights, reasonings, types of characters (politically correct approach of different races and ages) etc. have been visible in dozens of movies - so is the ending, typical to Hollywood blockbusters. Bearing in mind the development of technology in recent decades, it is still odd why there are still so many Godzilla and transformer figures in movies! And you can easily guess which characters survive and who lose their lives... As for the cast, only Idris Elba and Ron Perlman give decent performances, the rest is gray zone, no catchy moments, just trivial solutions of trivial types...A kind of entertainment appraised likely by video gamers, but without offering new elements to the history of cinema.",6,0,2,21 October 2013
Empire of the Sun," Great panorama movie, with some brilliant performances
","Steven Spielberg, a gifted director and producer, has always liked difficult and controversial periods in human history. WW II is one of his favorite topics but the angle of depiction is sophisticated; the good are not always right and the bad are not always wrong - the same applies to wars and taking sides. The real gems of the movie are Christian Bale and John Malkovich. Bale as the main character, Jamie Graham, a boy, is virtually in every scene of the movie and fills them with talent and brilliance (it is worth noting that Bale is still a good and well-known actor). As for Malkovich, he has always been a firm choice, I can not remember a movie where I have not liked him. The other performers like Miranda Richardson or Nigel Havers are good as well, but their appearance on the screen is quite brief. The only 'minus' is the length (almost 2,5 hours), some scenes could have been minimized. However, even then the movie does not become boring.",8,3,7,7 November 2012
American Sniper," A solid story based on true events and characters
","Due to the U.S. participation in Iraq and Afghanistan and related topics and issues, the two last decades have seen dozens of movies dealing with them - similarly to the decades after the war in Vietnam. Not many of them are good, focusing mostly on shootings and explosions, but American Sniper can be regarded as one of the best in its field. This is thanks to the director Clint Eastwood, and the star Bradley Cooper, above all. Acts of war and human approach are nicely in balance, everything seems realistic, the main character is no dumb killing machine without any feelings, war is not 'fun', etc., often lacking in movies alike. True, the movie is practically focused on Cooper's character Chris Kyle, there are no comparable performances, but I could hardly find glorification/justification of the U.S. military involvement in the movie in question - wars are initiated by political and/or economic interests, the military is supposed to obey the orders coming from government departments. And there is no place for reasoning during battles - either you kill, or you / your fellows get killed.All in all, a serious and solid movie. I liked it more than e.g. The Hurt Locker or Zero Dark Thirty.",8,191,366,15 January 2015
Gone Baby Gone," Great/good acting, but untrustworthy and sluggish plot
","Missing persons, incl. children is a serious issue in almost every country and movies related to the topic provide a good basis for distinguishable performances both on and behind the screen. Director Ben Affleck (his first respective attempt, by the way) has done a pleasant job inviting doers like Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris to participate (his own brother Casey is OK as well), but the screenplay is numb at times and even meetings with mobsters are incredibly calm and colorless. The role of policemen in the disappearance is also strange and it is hard to believe that experienced cops would find only such a solution we realize in the end. I cannot say that I am fond of constant chases and bursts, but Gone Baby Gone is too slow for a crime drama where the main focus is not on a single detective like Agatha Christie's characters. Thus, the movie is above average, but nothing special.",7,0,1,2 November 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," Just another hero movie... With unimpressive lead actors
","You have already Batman, Superman, Iron Man... Not enough? Need another supernatural patriotic male? Well... Why? And then you combine-connect him with Nazis, world conquering technology, jumps into the future and end the whole story with cliché used in tens of movies. Before that, lots of bursts, explosions, chases, fights - sounds familiar? If you don't like them, skip the movie, but if you do like, then watch it if you don't have much to do. As it gives no additional nice moments or new angles - unlike movies by e.g. Quentin Tarantino or Christopher Nolan, who are capable of twisting and turning trivial plots into sophisticated art.As for the cast, the main stars are rather ordinary... Luckily, there is a participation by Stanley Tucci, Toby Jones and Tommy Lee Jones, who were pleasant to watch. They could all spend much more time on screen, but alas...I am quite perplexed why this movie got so many viewers and a lot of praise. But perhaps I - as a non-American - am not a target audience member.",5,0,2,21 December 2012
American Hustle," Great performances, good characters, mediocre plot
","The main cast consisting of Academy Awars / Golden Globe nominees and winners, characters and events based on real cases, thrill via FBI and crossing / double-crossing - all this should be the basis for a gripping movie where time flies and you won't notice the length. Unfortunately, as for American Hustle, it does not fully apply. True, performances are catchy - particularly Christian Bale as Irving Rosenfeld, Bradley Cooper as FBI Agent Richard 'Richie' DiMaso, Amy Adams as Sydney Prosser / Lady Edith Greensly, Jennifer Lawrence as Rosalyn Rosenfeld, Robert De Niro (uncredited) as Victor Tellegio - characters have comical behaviors and lines, but the plot is uneven at times, the thrill fades away, and several activity lines do not provide additional value to the whole story, contributing the length only. The solution is plain, the main twist is dissolved in real outcomes of exposing corruption.Well, if we take some other movies nominated for 10 Academy Awards: Cabaret, The Godfather, Network, Tootsie, Star Wars, Braveheart, Slumdog Millonaire... Can American Hustle be compared with them? I am afraid not. It is an okay movie, but not conceptional.",7,0,1,2 February 2014
Nightcrawler," Witty script, distinguishing performance
","In fact, I had no idea about its synopsis even, I just heard that it was a good movie, plus I have always considered Jake Gyllenhaal as a talented actor (although I do not value many movies he has participated). But Nightcrawler fascinated me from the very beginning: noirish style, sophisticated leading character, lots of irony and grinning at gutter press - to name a few - and all this presented in a distinct and versatile manner. And Gyllenhaal's performance (as Louis Bloom) is not worse than in Brokeback Mountain, perhaps even more consistent, as he is really the leading character in this move, there are hardly any scenes without his presence, and multiple scenes with only him on screen. The main supporting characters - performed by Rene Russo, Riz Ahmed, Bill Paxton - are rather brief and schematic, although they provide a solid complement to Bloom's actions and ideas. For me, there were several pleasant twists as well, and the 'large ending' (=pre-ending) appeared to be a witty and unexpected solution, thus tensions and questions were open throughout the movie.So, a good movie, recommended to all who are eager to follow twisted things carried out by 'decent' people in their modern struggle for fame and recognition.",8,1,2,5 February 2015
Oblivion," Game of drones... And often confusing
","Usually, I am not much into sci-fi movies, especially when there is fight against technology or vicious creatures not in the know they are doing. On the other hand, I can't remember Tom Cruise performing in a total rubbish... His performance was good again, but the over-sophisticated plot was unclear to me at times (later, I had to read the plot overview to get all things straight). And sophistry on soul, love, memory, power, eternal life, misuse of technology etc. have been exploited in similar movies too many times. True, the sci-fi stuff (incl. battled scenes) was visually catchy and all supporting actors gave good performances, but the movie was too much focused on Jack Harper's character and the approach of topics mentioned above was sometimes too plain and obvious. And I found many similarities with movies like Solaris or Moon.Oblivion was okay, but currently I do not think I will watch this movie again in the future.",6,0,3,26 May 2013
Man of Steel," Protracted and hollow story elevated by masterful visual effects and some good performances
","Comics have brought so many supernatural action heroes into the world that one may lose track sometimes... And even if you memorize them, you can easily mix up their deeds and environments. Superman is, of course, the best known, but in spite of this, I expected a kind of new approach, a new level. True, its special effects are smooth and state-of-the-art, but they fill out too large part of the movie, creating the feeling of perfunctory script and trivial solutions. Even for a comic, there are too many goofs and unreal scenes, and Henry Cavill as Superman / Clark Kent is not a due opponent to Michael Shannon as General Dru-Zod whose performance is probably the strongest in this movie. Smaller, yet good accomplishments are provided by Kevin Costner and Diane Lane as Jonathan and Martha Kent and Russell Crowe as Jor-El; even Amy Adams, who is generally a good and distinguishing actress, is depicting Lois Lane too ordinarily.Thus, Man of Steel did not impress me much, although I am aware of not belonging to the main target audience... I find e.g. Iron Man movies much more interesting, obviously due to more versatile protagonist performances.",6,0,3,30 June 2015
The Revenant," Protracted plot and violent floundering exalted by direction, camera-work and 2 fine performances
","I tend to appreciate Alejandro G. Iñárritu and I have begun to notice Leonardo DiCaprio's strengths, but I am pretty sure that without vast advertising and multiple wins and nominations I would have postponed The Revenant for much later. But now I have seen it and I cannot say it was boring or disappointing... but no wow! either.Apparently there are still more elements I liked: direction, cinematography, magnificently created scenes (e.g. fighting with bear, riding into the ravine), two eminent performances (DiCaprio and Mother Nature - yes, nature here was no supporting actor, but a leading one), wide use of non-US actors (seemed that US ones were in minority), but its sparse plot stretched into almost 2.5 hours and long staying on violent scenes diminished the total value for me, I felt sometimes that I was watching Discovery channel... Plus the thing that some actors were so 'defaced' that they were difficult to recognize, Thomas Hardy included; well, the latter is a good actor, but I am a bit hesitant regarding his Oscar nomination for his John Fitzgerald.All in all, Mr. Iñárritu and others knew how and managed to do well, but it is hardly a movie you would multiple times, unless you masochistically try to feel 'abandoned but wild' while sitting in the warmth on the sofa and ponder on and over how one could survive in the 1st half of 19th century when eating raw fish was not eating sushi and raw meat was no Boeuf a la tartar...",7,1,1,9 February 2016
Trouble with the Curve," A pleasant movie with great actors
","I am not into sports, really, and I am very picky in seeing sports- related movies; as for baseball, I neither comprehend the rules nor find the game attractive. But I have had my exceptions due to actors I like - recently Moneyball (because of Brad Pitt) and now Trouble with the Curve - because of Clint Eastwood.And again, I was not disappointed - the over 80-years-old man shows no signs of weariness, although he has been on top since 1960ies. All his co-actors are great as well: Amy Adams, John Goodman, even Justin Timberlake, whose songs are uninviting to me... And the plot is pleasant to watch, sports terms and nuances are explained, and the storyline has its twists in spite of several guesses and predictions. And there is no moralizing reasoning on important, at times painful issues - viewers are smoothly 'filled' with the points and ideas the makers find important. Well, the director and producer Robert Lorentz is no novice, being first and famous for his collaboration with Eastwood. And the result is another nice movie worth watching - even for no-sportsmen like me.",8,2,2,15 December 2012
Bridge of Spies," Far beyond a simple legal drama
","When Spielberg and the Coen Brothers create something together, the result should/could be at least solid and versatile, even if the topic is controversial and/or not bespeaking wide audiences. This was my benchmark when I decided to spend almost 2.5 hours in front of screen; I had some vacillations as the Americans tend to approach European events and characters in a different manner we are used to. Luckily, it was not the case here - European venues seemed authentic, German characters spoke/were German, there was no black-and-white approach regarding 'us vs. them', etc. And as the plot is based on true characters and events, then realism prevails, and artistic exaggerations just ensure more spirited and dynamic course of events, diminishing aridity usually so characteristic to Cold War spy movies. Thus, the main ideas of justice vs. fairness and legality vs. humanity were skilfully moved to the surface. As for performances, they are good as well, particularly Tom Hanks as James B. Donovan and Mark Rylance as Rudolf Abel; unlike many other movies with Hanks' starring, he does not dominate here, he is not evidently 'better' (= so more famous) than his co-stars. And just today, Mark Rylance obtained his first Academy Award. Congratulations!PS Only last fall, my country experienced a similar event: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksei_Dressen",8,0,0,29 February 2016
Hugo," Ode to genuineness and mechanics in the era of digital mixing and editing - and using them
","The movie is visually effective, shiny and has several great performances (Ben Kingsley as Georges Méliès / Papa Georges, Chloë Grace Moretz as Isabelle, Christopher Lee as Monsieur Labisse, above all), but the plot is uneven, with frequent lengthy camera stills, and too much focus on gear wheels. The main star - Asa Butterfield as Hugo Cabret - is not so impressive as his coeval Thomas Horn in the role of Thomas Schell in the movie from the same year Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close (moreover, the two movies have many common topics and values). And Inspector Gustave (played by Sacha Baron Cohen) resembles officer Crabtee from the cult series 'Allo 'Allo! - perhaps too much.With regards to Scorsese, he has made better movies, and it not very credible to long for history and 'real' cinematography with the help of digital tricks and state-of-the-art technology. Additional points from me for depicting historical events.Can be recommended as a family movie during holidays (for example, Christmas) as a tutorial entertainment.",6,1,1,26 December 2012
Doctor Zhivago," Still enjoyable -- almost 50 years later...
","I am often of the opinion that the movies depicting specific historical events should be made in the country they occurred. In most cases, foreign filmmakers and actors have difficulties in comprehending nuances, their physical appearance is different and landscape is not genuine. 'Doctor Zhivago' is a pleasant exception -- as the signs were in Russian, I used to forget the language the actors spoke and found myself deeply in the fascination of Russian types and nature (btw, I speak Russian and have traveled there a lot). It is totally realistic - thanks to the original author coming from and living in Russia, but making such a film in the Soviet Union was out of the question - or the 'Reds' would have been positive figures only and many scenes left out totally.All actors (mostly non-U.S.) are great and the main cast has won several awards and fame later on. And last but not least - Lara's Theme by Maurice Jarre, one of the finest film music pieces, known today as well.",8,1,1,31 July 2012
Salt," Better than expected, but, well...
","Well, it is a decent action flick, with lots of twists and turns and unpredictable moments - perhaps too much; several scenes have just sophisticated and entertaining value, it is difficult to imagine them happening even theoretically or in the event of a huge turmoil. But the fights are there, as well as chases, explosions and double/triple crossings... However, the movie is too focused on one protagonist and the choice for the role - Angelina Jolie - was not the best, in my opinion, as her build and looks make many fulfillments hard to picture. The other questionable issue was to bring the Cold War into 21st century; moreover, almost all the deeds and plans of Russian characters resembled rather those of Islamic/Arab terrorists. Luckily, the ending is not slushy, and leaves room for a sequel.If you like political thrillers with strong players, the 1 hour 35 minutes pass with the blah! feeling. But it is no masterpiece, particularly script-wise.",7,0,2,7 April 2013
We're the Millers," Far better than expected, multiple giggling opportunities
","I have been gradually starting to select movies for watching on the basis of directors and/or actors; therefore, I was long hesitant to see We're the Millers as respective names (director + 2 'older' stars) have not impressed me much. Luckily, the first 10 minutes or so already showed that I was wrong: the plot was well constructed and smooth, sex-related scenes were funny, not banal, characters were elaborated, acting was true to nature and distinct; above all, I was surprised to see Jennifer Aniston (as Sarah 'Rose' O'Reilly) in a new and pleasant angle (well, Friends was not a favorite series of mine, mildly speaking). Jason Sudeikis was also 'higher into the air', and both teen actors were not trivial cute-face types. Many ambiguous scenes were really funny, boosted by pleasant chemistry between all the so-called family members.Moreover, in spite of being a 'raw' comedy, many topics approached were quite serious and actual, giving reasons to ponder on and over. Recommendable to watch if you like comedies with thrilling elements and sophisticated ending.",8,2,5,26 January 2014
Silver Linings Playbook," Pleasant, decent - but not impressive; apart from the cast, of course
","The screenplay has several good moments, incl. strong characters, but, all in all, it is hectic and neurotic, like a movie of Woody Allen without Allen. True, the background allows this, motives are logical, but neuroses and shouting are not very catchy to follow and some laughs I had were connected with psychiatry and related topics. When Pat Jr and Tiffany meet, the following outcomes are fathomable already. The ending is too predictable, even plain.The cast is great - it is seldom so that 4 actors receive an Academy Award nomination! However, I must admit that male performers seemed more interesting to me - Bradley Cooper, Robert de Niro, Chris Tucker, Anupham Kher... Jennifer Lawrence, Jacki Weaver, Julia Stiles etc are less memorable.I expected more of a comedy, but it was not, really. No hard/bad feelings, but I don't think I will see this movie again in the future.",7,3,5,29 January 2013
Divergent," Just another Hunger Games - with less good actors
","The background/theme of the plot is intriguing, but not the moral arising from it; first, there are many who would prefer 'organized' life, and second, there are enough professional and lifestyle dynasties. Abstract freedom is not for everyone, and due to family or disability, many people would choose not to make rustles here and there... Anyway, this benchmark could launch an interesting movie, but what we see is getting entangled in clichés and mostly trivial performances, actors-actresses based on looks (apart from Shailene Woodley and 'older' generation actors). There are some twists, but having seen about half- an-hour, you will be pretty sure who will have crush on whom, who will not survive, etc., but many of them whose acting could be pleasurable spend too little time on screen (particularly Ashley Judd and Kate Winslet). And a closed society with hostile outside world - not a very novel one, and there is no contact between them (perhaps in sequels?). Thus, in general, Divergent is an expensive hype made for young audiences who would like to identify themselves with the characters depicted mostly in good vs. bad, brave vs. craven manner.",5,0,1,27 August 2014
Ender's Game," Moralizing Star Trek for schoolchildren
","I have not read the book, I knew nothing about the plot, thus I sat to watch it with an open mind (usually I do either-or as I like to follow unknown twists). But the outcome was the following: many good and distinct performances (Butterfield, Ford, Davis, Kingsley, Steinfeld - in particular), lots of political correctness (different races-genders-religions included), hypocritical approaches-attitudes (child warriors are good everywhere, aren't they?) and visual over-sophistication (all this technology and weaponry). All wrapped in an elaborate package and apparently meant to encourage not-so-popular youngsters with strong characters and high ambitions... Yes, digital technology is fine, but this alternately with educational ideas in the form of blunt lines may work on the young people, but adults just shrug their shoulders.",6,0,1,10 February 2014
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Well directed and performed, but still unnecessary remake
","I postponed watching this movie as I had seen the Swedish version a couple of years ago which I enjoyed a lot. So I knew the basic story- line and did not want to watch a movie due to artistic comparison purposes. Yesterday, when I realized that I did not remember too many scenes, I decided to see what the US version could provide.First I recognized that many scenes were the same or very similar - the director and screenwriter were obviously eager to maintain the Swedish atmosphere, and they succeeded in that (well, most filming in Sweden and Norway was of big help). And introduction of European, incl. Swedish actors was a wise move as well; all the leading ladies and men are at least good, if not great (beginning with Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara). Thanks to strong book behind, the characters are elaborated, scenes and twists are logical; David Fincher's talent and skills let capture the mood and tensions through mystery aura. Nevertheless, the US remake was ready about 2 years after the original Swedish version... For those millions not eager to read subtitles, it could have been easily postponed for later.",8,2,7,9 July 2013
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Probably the most stylish and versatile impossible mission so far
","I have always liked the Mission-movies: characters are elaborated, performances are at least good, the script is frisky, the venues are diverse and action scenes do not create blah! feelings... Of course, there are lots of references to many other and more famous movies, including James Bond ones, but I like that the attitude/mood is non- serious, not 'bulked out', even in respectable places like Vienna Opera... And inclusion of new and international actors, e.g. Jens Hultén, and places, e.g. Morocco, Austria, provides the movie with broader background, bringing the viewers away from narrow despondency. And - last but not least - all the cast is great again, even smaller parts are played with non-random performers. True, in my opinion, Tom Cruise was overshadowed by Simon Pegg - but 'nerdy' characters are often funnier than real 'actionists'...",8,1,4,5 November 2015
The Intouchables," Great sad comedy, with giftedly combined contrasts
","Although the plot is based on real events, it must be very difficult to balance sorrow and joy, wealth and poverty, constrained disability and (hyper)activity in such a way that the result is not rude and/or embarrassing. In spite of several teases and jokes related to disability, they are included in a logical and realistic way into Driss 's character (splendidly played by Omar Sy). No wonder that the film has received so much warm welcome and has become one of the biggest French successes all over the world. Opposites, even antipodes have several things in common, but there are a few occasions triggering the events to understand them. The film could be recommended even to those who have disabled persons closely around. Perhaps it is then possible to find new angles to deal with them and bring more joy and variety into their lives.And last but not least: I hope no Hollywood remake is made, although Eddie Murphy and Dustin Hoffman (just my guess due to their looks and similarity) could be tempted to go for it...",8,2,3,18 September 2012
Dallas Buyers Club," Monopolies and bureaucracy can expedite your death...
","Health is the most important thing to everyone, that is way people do everything to preserve it, and - in the event of mortal danger - find ways to postpone it as much as possible. Based largely on real events and characters, Dallas Buyers Club rises painful but important issues regarding discretion/sovereignty, health care, medical tests, marketing of pharmaceuticals - among others. I personally can understand respective arguments given by the authorities, except for the mortally ill; I find that those people should use each and every opportunity for getting better as worsening of health is no subject here anymore.All the above is dealt in a gripping manner, and even if you guess the outcomes, it is still interesting to follow the events and ponder on and over different attitudes, ways of life and activities. And the two most colorful types: Matthew McConaughey as Ron Woodroof and Jared Leto as Rayon/Raymond - with both big physical and spiritual sacrifices in preparing for the roles, the outcome is superb, and I really hope they will get their Academy Awards they fully deserve. They outperform all the others, and following them on screen enables to feel both passion and compassion in this gloomy and rather hopeless surroundings.All in all, Dallas Buyers Club is a good movie, but the topics and approaches make it difficult to watch it repeatedly or recommend it to everyone (including those with contacts with fatal diseases) - similar to e.g. Philadelphia or Leaving Las Vegas.",8,1,1,20 February 2014
Now You See Me," Questionable plot saved by pleasant performances
","Magic topics in the era of digital cinema are not as they were in the past, as at present you can create virtually everything. All this made the plot complex to follow at times - the line of possible and impossible was gone and, until the end, it was difficult to realize whether it had fairy-tale elements or not. At least to me, the solution (= who was behind all this) was factitious, bearing in mind most of preceding actions, especially the fight in an apartment... Nevertheless, the events were catchy to follow, and actors like Jesse Eisenberg (as J. Daniel Atlas), Mark Ruffalo (as Dylan Rhodes), Woody Harrelson (as Merritt McKinney), Morgan Freeman (as Thaddeus Bradley, Michael Caine (as Arthur Tressler) are always up to their scratch... The others were nothing special, but nobody was annoying, i.e. settled their characters in a decent manner.Another pleasant thriller movie directed by famous French director Louis Leterrier - not an eternal masterpiece, but far above average.",7,0,1,4 September 2013
Mamma Mia!," Surprisingly good frivolous entertainment
","Quite often, I tend to skip musical/romantic comedies as they are too slushy and predictable, and frequently aimed for a wide audience (= avoiding sensitive topics). Mamma Mia! is a nice exception, dealing with e.g. promiscuity and gay issues. As ABBA songs are timeless, then using them in a creation provides additional value - not distracting as some viewers have said. Of course, as all actors sing themselves, the quality of presentations is floating, but it is still better solution than characters having two performers - one for acting and the other for singing (particularly if an opera singer is used). The script has some nice twists and so does the ending, and overall joy, fun and talented dancing/moving scenes are pleasant to follow; to those seeking profundity: you cannot expect Wenders, Jarmusch or Malick to get involved in such a direction, and musicals are not meant to be gloomy and protracted.The cast is brilliant as well, particularly Meryl Streep - as Donna - who has again shown her talent and versatility; her voice is far above average as well. On the whole, female characters outperform male ones: Julie Walters as Rosie and Christine Baranski as Tanya are pleasantly funny, Amanda Seyfried as Sophie brings along both sad and grave undertones. Male characters spend limited time on screen, are shallow and Pierce Brosnan's singing is quite terrible...Thus, if you like musicals with fine music and great performances, Mamma Mia! is definitely for you. Also for fans of Streep.",8,1,1,28 October 2013
The Fault in Our Stars," Better than expected, but not conceptional
","I had heard about this movie but I postponed the watching for months. Evidently, I was afraid to live through another teen tear-jerker without a difference...Well, my fears did not come true full, particularly during the 1st half and very end, where balanced approach, pleasant performances (incl. a 'harsh' one by William Dafoe) and some distinct shifts made the watch rather seamless; plus, for me, a nice joy of recognition regarding Amsterdam. But then, some typical Americanisms appeared (e.g. related to eggs and funeral rehearsal) and when one started to guess the ending, then it was not that catchy anymore, at times even protracted (in the Anne Frank House, for example).True, I realize that I do not belong to the target audience, as well as I have never experienced respective issues in my environment, but I often felt that the movie in question was made for attracting audience and making big money, vis-à-vis e.g. 50/50, dealing with related topic. But as The Fault in Our Stars did not bring along insipid moments, then strong 7 points from me.",7,0,1,10 September 2015
To Rome With Love," To Rome with Looseness... Would be more precise
","I am very selective in watching movies by and with Woody Allen, I am no loyal admirer of him. His plots are uneven and dragging, and the characters performed by him are almost lookalikes - irrespective with topic, age, era etc. But this time I was eager to see how the event fit into The Eternal City - Rome, which I have visited several times.And I had my joy of recognition from the very beginning, and soon several witty and versatile events began to develop, making me giggle from time to time as there are many funny lines and scenes. Typical to Allen, there are lots of confusions, multi-levels and reasonings, but as the movie lasts a bit over 1,5h, they did not become boring. The cast is also interesting, but uneven: great performances were carried out by Penelope Cruz, Alec Baldwin, Jesse Eisenberg, Roberto Benigni... The rest - and especially other actors from Italy - were not catchy. As the city of Rome is the major supporting actor, I cannot imagine how this movie would be comprehended without prior visiting - probably not so much.To Rome with Love is a quality entertainment, but definitely not among the best works by Allen. On the other hand, I can't see why his fans could get disappointed; so, you have been warned! :)",7,0,1,17 January 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Spirit of the book well captured
","Films like this have usually enthusiastic fans and gloomy skeptics - but they are not uninviting. The first do - after enjoying the book - appreciate state-of-the-art realisation, the latter are of the opinion that technology effects and tricks would decrease the importance of acting and spirit. Well, it is true that heavy make-up + digital distortions make much more difficult to evaluate real skills of an actor (most of dwarfs, trolls, orcs) and in fight/battle scenes, huge creatures would steal the show. However, those elements would enlarge the audience...The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is good and quite book-like, with several great main (Ian McKellan, Martin Freeman) and supporting (Andy Serkis, Kate Blanchett, Christopher Lee - almost 90 years old during filming!) performances. Technical solutions are also well elaborated, with the exception of perhaps the orcs chasing Radagast.The most visible minus is the length - over 2,5 hours - as this film is the 1st of the trilogy only and, therefore, without a proper ending. Thus, a certain challenge for younger and older viewers, above all, but definitely better than e.g. Thor or similar comic-based films.",8,3,10,4 January 2013
Non-Stop," Trivial story enhanced by both good directing and performances
","Recent years have seen dozens of popular movies where events take place in a limited space and time. Non-Stop is another is this row, and definitely above average. Well, the script is not fresh, with several moments seen in other so-called plane action/disaster movies, and unreal scenes, but thanks to various awards nominees Liam Neeson and Julianne Moore and director Jaume Collet-Serra, the intensity is maintained and the course of events is not annoying or yawning to follow. Pity only that talented character actors Lupita Nyong'o and Corey Stoll had unimportant roles to play. The ending could have been more interesting (= less predictable), but as I did not guess the person of the offender and his motives, I can't complain :)Do not seek profundity, sit and enjoy the pace and performances!",7,0,1,1 July 2014
The Pianist," Strong survival story, without black-and-white approaches
","As stories about vast sufferings such as genocide, holocaust, ethnic cleansing etc. are mostly revealed by sufferers-survivors, then they tend to be subjective and individualistic, full of hatred and grief, without so-called big picture, 'we' are always good/right and 'they' are always bad/wrong. Both the author of the autobiographical book (Władysław Szpilman) and its screenwriter (Ronald Harwood) have avoided the above and created a warmhearted, yet realistic and reasoned story about a Jewish family's fate around the events related to Warsaw Ghetto. The narration runs smoothly, we see people with different attitudes and characters among the Jews also, and not all Nazis were humiliators or ruthless killers... True, intellectuals such as musicians perceive the world in a different manner, they have more compassion and eagerness to understand rather than condemn, but still... The atmosphere is realistic, provides additional historical knowledge, and great choice of music plus talented aggregate direction makes The Pianist enjoyable to watch even if you the Szpilman's story (as I did not, the twists were additional value to me).The cast consists mostly of European actors (apart from Adrien Brody, but his father is of Polish Jewish descent), and Nazis were played by Germans. Of course, Brody is the greatest of them, besides, he spends most time on screen. I think he fully deserved his multiple awards, including Academy Award for Best Actor. But also the rest of the cast fitted into the atmosphere well - both by looks-wise and performance-wise.Altogether, The Pianist is a masterful panoramic narration and I liked it even more than Schindler's List.",8,0,0,5 February 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Recognizable Wes Anderson - nevertheless catchy
","Anderson likes to play both with characters and actors, and the result is a peculiar yet distinctive movie without 'normal' persons. However, by no means, they are comedies, but rather dramas with comic elements; the same applies to The Grand Budapest Hotel where you can't have big laughs, but there are various opportunities for giggling and snorts. After all, background events and fates of characters are mainly dramatic. But joyful colors, symmetry admiration, the English language in the German surroundings, and lots of poker-faced characters provide the movie a surreal visual. The cast is splendid as well, with lots of winners/nominees of important awards spending less than 5 minutes on screen, and introducing a fresh young face such as Tony Revolori as Young Zero Moustafa. The star of the movie is definitely Ralph Fiennes as Monsieur Gustave H (both elaborated character and performance), but the most peculiar roles were performed by Harvey Keitel as Ludwig, Edward Norton as Inspector Henckels and Tilda Swinton as Madame D (the latter was barely recognizable).A must-see for Anderson's fans, and for all others without petrified approaches on cinema and depiction of 'serious' events.",8,1,3,8 July 2014
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Stylish and definitely better than other similar movies
","I have determined to watch all the Mission-movies: characters are elaborated, performances are at least good, the script is frisky, the venues are diverse and action scenes do not create blah! feelings... Of course, there are lots of references to many more famous movies, including the James Bond ones, but I like that the attitude/mood is non-serious, not 'bulked out', even in respectable or posh places. And inclusion of formerly locally known character actors, e.g. Michael Nyqvist, Anil Kapoor and Vladimir Mashkov, and places, e.g. Budapest (as I visited this beautiful city recently, I was eager to see how many places I visited were available in this movie), Mumbai, Moscow, Dubai, provides the movie with broader background, bringing the viewers away from narrow despondency; true, were did not see much of surroundings or panoramas as operations took places in the buildings and chases were too fast. And - last but not least - all the cast is great again, even smaller parts are played by non-random performers. Here, unlike in the most recent Mission, Tom Cruise was not yet overshadowed by Simon Pegg, as his funny side and 'nerdiness' was included not so often.",8,1,2,19 November 2015
28 Days Later...," Trivial storyline, but well directed and performed
","Desolated cities or towns after a cataclysm or mayhem and evil creatures ready to harass - something not new, but Danny Boyle has managed to create a decent thriller arising from them. Also, thanks to skillful selection of music (particularly in the second part) and pleasant character actors like Cillian Murphy, Naomie Harris and Brendan Gleeson (always catchy to follow). However, the intensity is uneven, the 20 minutes or so after Jim's awakening at the hospital are slow, and fights with infected people resemble ordinary zombie movies too much. Nevertheless, there are interesting twists and turns, and change or uncovering of human nature during extreme situations makes you ponder and share the feelings. The characters and realistic, elaborated and 'good' characters can die too. The ending could have been more sophisticated.If you like movies with the said elements, 28 Days Later is definitely for you. Not recommended to stressed or moody people.",7,2,3,24 February 2013
Lawrence of Arabia," In the 1960ies, I would have probably given 9 points...
","... but currently 8 'only' - mainly for the three following reasons: -- This film did not have similar effect on me as One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Pulp Fiction, Godfather - to name a few from later decades -- Some too long nature/battle scenes and overall length of over 3,5 hours -- Totally male cast, no female charactersOf course, the film is great, and even supporting actors are those capable of starring (and they have done so, e.g. Guinness, Sharif, Quinn). O'Toole is amazing and it is a pity he received an Academy Award nomination only. Directing, volume of mass scenes and music score (Jarre) are also elements remarkable today as well. Many contemporary well-known directors have mentioned Lawrence of Arabia as their guiding light.If you have time to absorb and are keen on history, then the film is definitely for you.",8,0,2,27 October 2012
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Hectic turmoil with apparent inner jokes - with Tarantino´s talent still visible
","QT is a filmmaker who can select fine actors, incl. various solid award winners and nominees of different generations, delve into different eras and character types, combine real events with exaggerated scenes... All this is rounded up here as well, much in Tarantino´s manner, but many promising segments (particularly in relation to Cliff Booth / Brad Pitt) remained ambiguous and 'open' for me. There is some suspense and thrill, but the solutions are trivial, and the violence section was 'thin' and partly incomprehensible.I watched this film as I have decided to see all Tarantino´s (also e.g. Coen Brothers´) movies, but I have to admit the one in question ranges in the rearmost places of my list of his works. 'Luckily', I have some interest in and knowledge of the 1970ies cinematography; I can fully understand that those who do not would be disappointed.",7,0,1,23 February 2020
Behind The Candelabra," Passions in the world of kitsch and shallowness
","Many wealthy and/or famous people are factually incredulous and lonely as they are often unsure who their real friends and like-minders are (many will never find out as wealth or fame is maintained until the end). But when entertainment field and hidden sexuality come into question, then all inside and outside is boosted, resulting with 'drama queendom', various ups and downs, occasional tragic events. Such were the last decades in the life of Liberace, an innovative entertainer who was almost unknown to me. Thanks to Behind the Candelabra, I can judge and assess the reasons of his enormous popularity and look into the glamorous life in L.A. during the years when AIDS hit most.The cast is brilliant, particularly the stars Michael Douglas as Liberace and Matt Damon as Scott Thorson - I believe they both deserve an Oscar, as it is not easy for straight actors to perform gay characters in such an 'open' manner, with some nudity and sex scenes included... Moreover, Dan Aykroyd as Seymour Heller and Rob Lowe as Dr. Jack Startz are interesting roles, rather different from their usual ones.All in all, the movie is definitely for you if you like strong realistic dramas and have no ugh! views on gay lifestyle.",8,0,2,5 November 2013
Gone Girl," Just OK, not more - considering the names within and behind
","David Fincher in cooperation with Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike... The result should be pleasing and taut, but when the credits appeared, I just shrugged my shoulders. I can't say it was boring, but the overall length, trivial ending and conventional characters did not bring along any wow-effect. Well, directing and performances were good, but all of those people have been involved in much better movies, and the plot was not so angled and winding that they could all show their skills in full. Hate, revenge, adultery etc strong feelings have been better covered in other movies, e.g. A Perfect Murder.That is why, it is difficult to agree with some viewers and critics as for the script and book behind it, that they are somewhat conceptional, interesting and tense. At least I did not find those elements there and, mildly speaking, I do not fully comprehend its huge box office around the world.",7,1,7,17 December 2014
Mr. Nobody," More interesting than The Tree of Life by Malick, but still... and too long
","I agree that movies should not be primitive, with simple characters and predictable solutions, but over-sophisticated ones are difficult to follow -- especially if you watch them in a cinema without an opportunity to pause and resume. A person's mind can be deceptive and selective, but the director could take into account that all viewers are following the fate of a stranger. However, by the end of the movie, it would be nice to find out what really happened in the hero's life. And less moralization and reasoning, thank you! :) Especially on the issues like mortality, love, devotion, destiny...Jared Leto is really good, the others are just above average. Perhaps their characters have not been distinguished enough. But cameramen, of course, have performed in an excellent way.A must-to-see for those fond of 'independent' philosophical movies, for the others - lengthy and boring.",6,1,9,13 July 2012
Django Unchained," Very stylish,,, And Tarantino is still recognizable
","It is longer than 2,5 hours, it is a western, it is focused on black slavery / U.S. 19th century history - and it is still catchy to watch! Well, I am usually not much into the elements mentioned above. But I like Tarantino's works and I did not have to get disappointed, everything was in place: directing, dialogs, tensions, realistic cruelty... It strikes me that many consider this movie too violent; compared to other Tarantino's movies, proportion of violence/blood is rather small. And how the black music (e.g. rap) fits into riding scenes, wow! The ending scenes have also several levels, are versatile and sophisticated (apart from the very final scene, perhaps). As regards the cast, it is astonishing again, with several Academy Award winners and nominees. And again no dull characters, even the very supporting ones. In my opinion, the cream-of-the-cream performances are by Christoph Waltz as Dr. King Schultz and by Samuel L. Jackson as Stephen, although all the others are great as well. Waltz is the only actor provided an actor Oscar for Tarantino and he has the opportunity to duplicate this year. Let's see, he has strong competitors.Django Unchained is great, however, I do still consider Pulp Fiction better / more conceptional. That is why 'only' 9 points this time. But I hope that Django Unchained will receive more Oscars than Pulp Fiction when the timing was apparently not right.",9,1,4,12 January 2013
Insidious," Scary, thrilling in the 21st century?! Come on...
","Distant voices/noises/whizzes, flashing lights, music from the past, ghost busting and exorcism?! Those who think the above mentioned are hair-raising should have their mind/nerves checked and cured. It would be another story in case of a wrongdoer, a criminal, or an alien, a vampire - at least. In the era of digital effects, ghosts and devils may be catchy to watch, but, in fact, they are unable to terminate someone's life. That is why I prefer physical evil as - in the event of well written and directed movies - it is hard to predict the course of events and ending (e.g., Se7en, Silence of the Lambs). The cast is also just above average, nothing special. The ending has a twist, but, nevertheless, I cannot comprehend the movie's popularity and I can hardly recommend this movie to anyone I know. If you must see a similar movie, then pick The Others or Rosemary's Baby.",5,7,13,25 January 2013
The Theory of Everything," The love of everything...
","Prior to the film, I feared that evaluating this would be very difficult , because: a) I have always liked Eddie Redmayne, since his first film Like Minds, and he has later had various brave and complex roles, not suitable for many othersb) One of my favourite actors, Benedict Cumberbatch, starred in TV film Hawking in 2004 already - and he was wonderful there alreadyc) In 2015, they are both nominated for Academy Award within the same category - Best Actor. Yeah... Luckily, the films are different, the one in question is more focused on relation(ship)s, feelings, different kind of love (for people, science, history, etc.) - all events and scenes are subject to them. The plot is smooth, the tune warmhearted, but - unlike in Hawking - there is less attention on Hawking's intellectual inheritance, and some moments related to other people I had to review later from Wikipedia. Cinematography and music score are splendid as well, but the real gem is Redmayne: so distinct, I have to admit, and 'better' than Cumberbatch due to far bigger likeness with real Hawking, above all. I was not so enraptured by Felicity Jones, well, she was really good, but so were all others in supporting roles. Anyway, I am sure that The Theory of Everything will be rewarded with multiple Academy Awards. And I promise I will be happy for Redmayne if he wins as well - even at the expense of Cumberbatch for The Imitation Game. Pity that they have to compete in the same year...",8,0,0,17 February 2015
The Number 23," Thanks to strong directing and casting, more than average
","Names like Joel Schumacher and Jim Carrey are usually signs of quality, and this movie is no exception either. Carrey's cogency (it is mostly solo movie around his character) is pleasantly complemented by Virginia Madsen and Logan Lerman who give also pleasant and convincing performances. However, the plot leaves a lot to be desired: the idea is nice, but more than a half is too slow and focused on meaning of numbers, without any events that would be helpful to comprehend what is going on. The last half an hour is more thrilling, but ending scenes are trivial, amount of twists and turns is limited. Well, I have lived for decades in the house No 23, but the movie did not give me any creeps :)Additional points from me due to no aliens-ghosts etc involved, and for the fact that I did not figure out neither the truthfulness of the events nor the killer.",7,0,0,14 January 2013
Across the Universe," Decent musical drama, with too much sophistication and predictable solutions
","The Beatles was not music of my youth and I was no hippie (due to much younger age), thus I had no nostalgic feelings about the period - late 1960ies. But I like musicals - in spite of trivial plots - and I welcome when 'ordinary' actors perform singing as well. The latter was in place here, but as 'real' and good actors like Joe Cocker and Bono were used as well, there was a big voice-related contrast (unlike in Mamma Mia!, for example). The plot was just okay, without sudden twists, and some scenes were aridly constructed based on a song-text, there others had too many hints to psychedelic experiences arising from new drugs. The ending was also anticipated.As the plot involves both Americans and Brits, the inclusion of British actors is logical - and usually their performances tend to excel the American ones. Not here, though: American females (particularly Evan Rachel Wood as Lucy) were much stronger than British males (Jim Sturgess as Jude and Joe Anderson as Max). Luckily, there were several smaller but great performances (Dana Fuchs as Sadie, Eddie Izzard as Mr. Kite - to name a few).Therefore, Across the Universe is not bad, but I find Les Miserables or even Mamma Mia! more interesting and smooth.",7,0,0,6 July 2014
The Mist," Not an ordinary monster movie... And with even cast
","Usually, I am not a big fan of Stephen King's works as they are too much focused on changes in people's minds - I tend to prefer fight with expressed evil. The Mist combines the two elements in a gifted manner: there are both evil creatures, and ordinary people whose minds are affected by tensions, uncertainty and ignorance. Moreover, Mrs. Carmody's character (splendidly performed by Marcia Gay Harden) demonstrates the consequences of any religious fanaticism combined with strong persuasion skills. Generally, the real horror here lies in the unpredictability of human mind and behavior.As for the cast, it is evenly strong, the absence of A-category actors makes all the supporting roles evenly watchable and important (Marcia Gay Harden, Laurie Holden, Toby Jones, David Jensen, Nathan Gamble, above all). The leading character David Drayton (performed by Thomas Jane) seems less credible to me - painters / poster artists have usually no arrangement or commanding skills and do not become heroes in a short time.Nevertheless, it is a good horror movie. And the ending is also with a twist, letting you torment long after the credits appear.",7,1,4,25 February 2013
The Bourne Legacy," The real 'Bournes' were definitely better
","With Matt Damon, I mean... Jeremy Brenner is not bad, but Damon is more versatile. The plot here is weaker is well: too much emphasis on medicine and conspiracy at the expense of thrilling chases or exciting events (and e.g. chasing on the streets of Manila is visually impressive, but too many clichés). The first 30 minutes or so, for example, were very tardy and dull. Flashbacks/dreams are often confusing, difficult to distinguish from the beginning. The ending is too sudden and 'open'.Edvard Norton, Albert Finney and Rachel Weisz provided an additional value to the movie as well - thanks to actors I gave my 7 points. The Bourne Legacy is OK for killing time, but do not expect a catchy experience or maintaining the level of the preceding Bourne saga.",7,0,1,7 December 2012
22 Jump Street," Uneven, but with several giggling moments
","I am not much into dumb-dumber or nerd-cutie type of movies, but from time to time I let myself into this world as well - for comparison, to keep up with the times etc. In this context, the movie in question is an annoying example, rather OK, with several references to famous related movies and sneering at clichés. Thus, the story is 'over the spindle' and one might get tired - unless your attitude is easy-going. The events pass smoothly, there are some nice character actors included (Peter Stormare and Ice Cube, above all), and the post-ending (in parallel with credits) is distinct, probably the best and funniest part of the movie. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have a good chemistry between them, female characters are less elaborated and the actresses less to my taste.All in all, not bad, quite an okay entertainment; no brilliancy, but no flop either. However, people seeking profundity should give it a miss.",7,1,3,21 December 2014
Unknown," An elegant thriller, with several unpredictable twists
","This century has seen Liam Neeson in real leading roles, when his character 'permeates' the whole movie and is strong and quick-witted. Taken 1 and 2 are best known, Unknown has - for some reason or another - remained in their shadow. In my opinion, the script of the latter is much stronger, has more twists-turns and unpredictable moments - me being a fan and active viewer of crime thrillers could not guess what kind of background could Neeson's character Dr. Martin Harris really have. Sequence of the events is logical and chases are visually enjoyable. The ending in general is predictable, apart from the very last scene.Well, all the cast is excellent, not only Liam Neeson; Diane Kruger and Bruno Ganz are the supporting actors more time on screen and they are really good. In short, Unknown is really worth watching - especially if you have not read spoilers :)",8,11,14,16 December 2012
Call Me by Your Name," An ode to idleness and latent feelings
","This film has lots of strengths and pleasant moments (particularly leading performance, beautiful landscape, capture of mood of the period), but it is too focused on the main character and some scenes just add duration being not inevitably necessary. And again, like in many films with 'controversial' topic, a minor is depicted by and adult (catchily, but still), and the creators´desire to give the audience various food-for-thought and enchance romantic moments has significantly blurred the motives of the main characters to act as they did. Sorry, but in general nothing really special to me, I can name dozens of more interesting films or series on related topic.",7,1,4,28 June 2018
Gran Torino," Real masterpiece, with unknown actors - excl. Eastwood
","In his latest movie (so far, hopefully) Clint Eastwood has shown again both his talented directing and acting. Another profound movie, where black-and-white attitudes obtain vivid nuances even in case of an old man (Eastwood was 78 when the movie was finalized). In spite of miserable and dangerous background, one has several bursts of laughter due to Eastwood character's appearance and his vocabulary and expression of stereotypes. One point less is given by me due to several clichés; pre-end of the movie, however, was different from my expectations.Moreover, it was educational to get to know culture and customs of the Hmong people - a relatively small group split into several countries in Asia and having difficult times even in the end of last century.Highly recommendable!",9,2,3,22 July 2012
1917," Smooth and dynamic depiction for an account of realistic events
","As to war dramas, the war itself can be in the foreground (battles, campaigns) or in the background, where small units or individuals are meaningful and their minds and evolvement are dominated by war/military. 1917 is mainly about the latter, with war spinning around personal destinies. The events start running promptly and the journey of 2/1 soldiers is versatile, full of hope and misery, with distress all the time still.All this is captured via talented directing, camerawork, and defined performances, both leading and supporting ones. There are several character actors performing small yet important roles, plus I am sure George MacKay (Lance Corporal William Schofield) will get more significant roles in the future. But, in my vexation, several 'individual' scenes with Germans involved appeared not to be realistic, they were apparently meant for the twist paving the way for the next steps in the journey (in particular, I have in mind a certain stabbing, a certain shooting and a certain pursuit which 'normally' could not have taken place). Thus, when rating this film, I should assert that the script includes almost only weaknesses here.",8,0,3,26 January 2020
Lincoln," A strong movie - in every aspect
","Steven Spielberg has done it again... Created a powerful movie with solid plot (with real events and characters) and employed talented character actors, incl. several Academy Award winners. Of course, the screenplay is compact (created by world-famous Tony Kushner) and not catchy for those not fond of history and/or something happening in a limited time and space. And, above all, the movie is made for Americans - by Americans - and could be a good aid in teaching/learning 19th century American history; Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was really a major step in the U.S. politics back then.All the cast is evenly strong, with the most brilliant (and most frequently visible) performances carried out by 3 Academy Award winners (Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field, Tommy Lee Jones) and 1 nominee (David Strathairn). All them, starting with Day-Lewis, could be strong candidates for another Academy Awards. But those in smaller roles are also very good: Joseph Gordon-Levitt, James Spader, Tim Blake Nelson... All versatile actors, no just 'cute faces'. On the other hand, a dignitary person like Spielberg can afford this.Lincoln by Spielberg is a tough and serious movie without any usual entertainment nuances. And even in the United States history there have been not too many presidents with so broad views and comprehension as Lincoln, politicians have dominated over statesmen.",8,0,2,3 January 2013
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Profound war film - with a difference
","The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas is one of those II WW dramas where war events are in the background, beyond, i.e. no proximate battles around, but idyllic life is soon spoiled by horrible things difficult to cover as the war advances. And typically to all totalitarian regimes, one must always take sides, choose and prove his/her loyalty, hesitating or opposing in any way is not tolerated. This is all especially confusing and tragic for children, as they have misshapen and vague picture due to two main reasons: their limited comprehension as well the fact that adults try to gloss them over nasty things.The storyline of the film advances smoothly and is rather credible, the only thing that seemed strange to me was how those boys could meet so openly for so long time? What about guards and/or electrical fences? Using this corner, many could have escaped... The ending is unanticipated and forms a sharp contrast with the pace before.The cast is great, especially Vera Farmiga as Elsa, Asa Butterfield as Bruno (far better performance than in blockbuster Hugo) and David Thewlis as Ralf. As for the director Mark Herman, it is his best (and for some reason or another) last film so far.",8,0,0,27 December 2012
The Imitation Game," A solid narration, both direction- and performance-wise
","Stories about famous scientists tend often towards aridity due to non- versatility of persons and complexity of the field, sometimes accompanied by sophisticated terms and equipment, but skillful directors and screenwriters find always an angle to emanate from, and competent choice of actors draws up an interesting creation to be enjoyed by people of different ages and social strata. It was the case with e.g. A Beautiful Mind, and now with the film in question, where the 'conglomeration' Tuldym/Moore/Cumberbatch has generated a real masterpiece. In spite of complex time and references to atypical sexuality, the scenes pass smoothly, delicately, without moralising or providing stringent assessments. And Benedict Cumberbatch has excelled again; well, I have watched most of the films with his presence and I can't say he is 'better' here - he is always great, sometimes the material is weaker perhaps, but his Hawking or van Gogh or Assange or Holmes have been splendid as well. As regards other actors, I liked the performances of Mark Strong and Charles Dance more than that of Keira Knightley; yet, she performed well, but her looks differed a lot from the real Joan Clarke's. But The Imitation Game is still a film largely based on real personalities and events.All in all, a good film, hopefully paving the way for Oscar nominations at least. Cumberbatch is definitely ready for this Award! :)",8,1,5,9 January 2015
The Big Blue," What if/when habits and hobbies govern your life...
","Is it possible to change, for example, through love, different profession, new circle? When a healthy competition and rivalry becomes a pig-headed and dangerous race with time? Will some people never 'grow up'? Those issues/questions are strongly at present in this splendid film by Luc Besson, different from most of his other films. I really enjoyed it in spite of the context uninteresting to me (free-diving). But thanks to subtle dialogs, beautiful landscape, suitable music score and talented cast it is no wonder, that we do here with one of the most successful French films ever.All the actors are premium, but Jean Reno still outperforms all others, including Jean-Marc Barr and Rosanna Arquette. As for the latter, I would have chosen an actress with a more oval face, let's say :). Jean Bouis does a grand small performance as Uncle Louis.Usually I am biased to watch films over 2,5 hours, but this one did not become dull or boring, even the long water-related scenes were appropriate.",8,0,2,28 October 2012
Clash of the Titans," Travesty of ancient mythology clothed in entertaining action
","Recent decades have seen growing interest in movies depicting ancient and medieval (fantasy) stories - apparently due to digital revolution enabling to depict fantasy world in non-ridiculous ways. Also, Clash of the Titans has seen great popularity (= box office), in spite of plain story with 'real' characters from Greek myths; well, the visual side is great, chases-battles realistic, imaginary characters merge into real background, but the messages-ideas are too blunt and moralistic, and main characters most often on screen - younger ones - are performed by not-very-special actors. Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, Mads Mikkelsen, Liam Cunningham, on the other hand, could have been more visible, they are pleasant to follow even in second-grade movies.Thus, the movie in question is just an above-average, perfunctory movie, but 1 hour 35 minutes is okay to watch it without a blah! feeling.",7,0,0,16 December 2013
World Trade Center," With reference to Oliver Stone - rather mediocre
","Of course, the topic is difficult, painful and most of viewers remember this or can revive the live events via Youtube or similar channels... But female characters (performed by Maggie Gyllenhaal and Maria Bello) are over-dramatized; families and friends of those who work within rescue, military, and police should be - and usually are - always prepared for the worst as those jobs are dangerous everywhere. And the women having children with them must be strong and realistic, not panicking around and letting off steam on relatives.Nicholas Cage could have obtained more screen time, so the real stars for me are 2 Michaels: Pena and Shannon (though the part of the latter is relatively small).Pre-rescue scenes under ground are too long, dull and hard to watch due to darkness. Tensions are not highly maintained throughout the over 2 hours... As a whole, the movie is too lengthy - not surprisingly, Mr Stone is known for long and epic works - but still I think that World Trade Center is one of the weakest movies Stone has directed.",6,0,1,12 October 2012
Prisoners," Trivial plot improved by fine directing and acting
","Are the days of promoting team playing over? Leading characters in Prisoners are strong individualists who are committed to pursue their case and obtain results at any cost; feelings of people close to them are less important.True, observing vigorous personalities is always catchier and attracts wider audiences - and the movie in question has enjoyed big popularity and positive attitudes already. Director Denis Villeneuve has skilfully utilized Hugh Jackman's and Jake Gyllenhaal's skills, and supporting actors like Paul Dano or Viola Davis are always a firm choice. Tensions are high, viewers can ponder about guilt and remorse, gray and rainy background boosts anxiety... The length, however, is too much (pace tends to fade at times) and motives of the chief offender could have been different. The ending is versatile, a kind of summing up all preceding events... Unexpected, but still not wow!.Thus, a decent thriller, recommended to those fond of gloomy surroundings dinned by weather. But take/save your time as ca 2,5 hours are ahead...",7,1,1,17 October 2013
Big Fish," A warmhearted ode to versatility and individuality
","Another Tim Burton's masterpiece - and less fiction and imagination as usual, but skilled and nuanced emphases on important general topics like cross-generation attitudes, family ties, true love/friendship/commitment - included, but not limited to. The story runs smoothly and obvious extravagance provides additional value to the movie, not cutting and not impairing it. Although the background is father's lethal illness, there are lot of nice and funny moments, and the mood of the ending becomes different than the circumstances otherwise expect. And the cast, quite a dream-team: Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Jessica Lange, Marion Cotillard, Helena Bonham Carter, Danny DeVito, Steve Buscemi... Only Billy Crudup as William Bloom seemed too ordinary among the others. Anyway, the movie is recommended to admirers of Burton and/or those fond of warm tutorial movies.",8,0,1,23 December 2012
2001: A Space Odyssey," Ahead of time then, timeworn now
","Due to my age and native country, I was unable to see the film soon after its completion and even prior to the use of modern digital technology. On the other hand, I am not a fan of 'arid' sci-fi films, such as Solaris or Stalker - I find them protracted, stolid, and too commonplace. Long scenes without text lines, lengthy stills of space technology, kitschy interiors are the thing I usually tend to avoid. But as I regard Stanley Kubrick as a talented filmmaker, I have decided to watch (again) all his main films - but 2001: A Space Odyssey turned out to be a real challenge... Of course, I admit its particularity and skillful use of state-of-the-art technology at that time, but watching it in 2013 was not impressive to me. Moreover, there were no catchy characters and performers to remember (unlike in Star Wars trilogy, for example). For fans of Kubrick and/or elderly sci-fi admirers, probably. I would be surprised if middle-aged or young viewers get a memorable experience from the film in question.",6,1,4,2 May 2013
Elysium," Entertaining sci-fi thriller, with non-polarized good and evil
","I liked Neill Blomkamp's District 9 and I was sure I would not be disappointed with Elysium as well - as for thrillers, I prefer movies when evil is cognizant (even if aliens or mutant warriors, not abstract such as animals, natural phenomena or even zombies. Well, the script contains some unreal scenes for the sake of excitement and action, but they are not long and do not become annoying, fights/chases and human contacts are balanced, and many actual serious topics are approached (e.g. immigration limits, overpopulation and poverty, health care and wealth). Actors like Matt Damon, Judie Foster or William Fichtner are always high-level (Damon has become a really versatile actor, his role in Behind the Candelabra is totally different). However, the movie has no even good-bad contradiction, as Sharito Copley is not equal in value with Damon. The ending is only partially expected, and the general mood differs from most Hollywood movies. All in all, if you like action sci-fi thrillers without numb actors and pointless violence, then you will enjoy Elysium.",7,7,12,14 November 2013
The Artist," Unconventional and beautiful, but rather uninteresting
","Of course, the director Mr Hazanavicius and most of actors (especially Ms Bejo, Mr Goodman, and the dog) have done excellent job, but the storyline is rather simple and predictable. Similar to most of European (incl. French) films, there is a lot of romance, feelings, moods etc, as well as profound variances such as routine vs innovation, pride vs humbleness, past vs future. But due to few text lines and long scenes, I was quite eager to use forward function and got the whole picture in about an hour. The film is not bad, but 5 Academy Awards is slightly exaggerated, in my opinion (as most other nominees were state-of-the-art films as well). Critics have praised it a lot, but audience figures have been modest everywhere.",7,1,3,13 September 2012
Invictus," Sports can create and/or strengthen unity
","Usually I am not much into sports and related movies, but certain directors and actors make an exception. Clint Eastwood is definitely one of them; I happened to see his Trouble With the Curve first and I was sure that focusing on genuine sports battle would not be the main theme here either. And it was so: the main topic is how rugby had its part in creating inter-racial confidence in South Africa right after abolishment of apartheid, and what was the role of South African President Nelson Mandela and the captain of the South Africa rugby union team (Springboks) François Pienaar -- played by Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon, respectively (and giftedly). The scenes - based on real events and a strong book - run smoothly, the choice of background music is just to the point, and viewers get a versatile picture of one of the 20th century greatest statesman whose desire and aim was to create a 'all-inclusive' society, without punishing those who just were ordinary employees and workers during the previous segregated system (different from the case with socialist leaders who mostly deprived, deported or killed most 'carriers' of previous social order). Of course, Mandela was highly educated and lettered, not like e.g. Stalin or Mao Zedong...Invictus is a nice movie, providing additional and realistic knowledge of life in South Africa in the 1990ies, and encourages to use popular activities/games/sports etc. in leveling confrontations.",8,0,2,3 July 2013
Sinister," Slow and dull most of the time, and too much Hawke's solo
","The start is quite promising as viewers obtain the information about real murders from the past - through snuff films found; rather intriguing matters, but then everything slows down and strange supernatural backgrounds and side-lines appear, including trivial marks of horror movies. I am still perplexed that wind, noises in old houses, psychological stress etc can still be perceived as horror attracting attention and praise. Well, you can use some of those elements from time to time, but not to fill the whole movie with them - and repeatedly. The are constant signs that something would happen - but alas... Luckily I watched it on DVD, thus I could use forward function. And I did... lots of times. It is not a total flop thanks to Hawke's performance only. And last but not least: virtually, its poster reveals the killer :)",4,2,4,8 January 2013
Stalingrad," An anti-war war movie, a bit protracted though
","For losers of a war or a battle, it is not customary to create something depicting their defeat, especially if this happened not so long time ago. E.g., Russians have had several defeats in the post WW II period - could you imagine them picturing this? With Stalingrad 1993, Germans have crudely shown the horrors and sufferings in one of the most severe battles in the WW II, without glorifying themselves and without scoffing at their enemy. On the other hand, Soviet Russia was no innocent victim, its treatment of own and neighboring people in the 1930ies was nasty and lethal as well, and Soviet (non-)activities were largely a reason why Hitler had courage to start this horrible war.As for the movie, the events and background seem realistic (probably shot in Finland), most of actors performing Russians speak decent Russian, and leading men are catchy to follow (primarily Dominique Horwitz as Obergefreiter Fritz Reiser, Thomas Kretschmann as Leutnant Hans Von Witzland, Jochen Nickel as Unteroffizier Manfred 'Rollo' Rohleder). However, some of the scenes could have been shortened, and direct battle scenes comprise only a small part of the movie. The ending is predictable, although the scenes leading to it are well directed. It seems that the creators wanted to combine profound human aspect with concrete battle, but for this task, the movie was too short - a miniseries could have been more appropriate. Nevertheless, if you like war movies based on real events, Stalingrad is worth watching.",7,3,4,14 June 2013
Where Eagles Dare," A great war film - with really great performances
","I have not seen many movies with Richard Burton as he comes from previous generation. On the other hand, I have seen most of movies with Clint Eastwood and I appreciate him a lot - notwithstanding the part he plays. In Where Eagles Dare, those men starred together - and did it splendidly, performing strict and committed, but officers of war, without unnecessary grimaces. The other actors were also not bad, but no memorable performance for me.The plot is thrilling, has lots of unexpected turns and the end is surprising as well. Luckily, the movie is in color, enabling to see the nuances of beautiful Austrian landscape and a stunning castle. Explosions, bursts and chases are also present, in addition to psychological confrontations. In other words, it is evident the script has strong literal background - Alistair MacLean is a world-famous novelist.Highly recommended to fans of war movies.",8,1,3,16 October 2012
Groundhog Day," Great actors, some funny lines, but too sophisticated plot
","I had seen this movie when it came out in the beginning of 1990ies, but I did not remember much of it. Only the fact that Murray and MacDowell are great actors. I am still of the opinion, although Murray's role in this movie is more significant - more than in his other movie where he stars excellently - 'Lost in Translation'. However, at times, windings of the plot are difficult to monitor and there are not too many scenes you can really laugh - and they are all related to Murray's lines. The best scene is where Murray is driving mad the car with two local rednecks and gives his views on life and future. The romantic angle with MacDowell is similar to most of movies with Meg Ryan. In short, recommendable within an intelligent community, not to be watched as a comedy in a loud and drinking group :)",7,0,3,4 July 2012
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," Revolutions often devour their own children...
","All wars and violent revolutions were 'created' to solve some serious issues - often they did, but - in turn - brought forth new ones, with all means employed. Families were split and friendships were deprived, enemy figures changed faster that the years and solutions were interpreted according to own judgments and skills. Plus the fact that some people get used to fighting and long-term confrontation are unable to re-enter into 'normal' civil life.The Wind That Shakes the Barley is a fine example of all this taking place during the Irish War of Independence (1919–1922) and the Irish Civil War (1922–1923) - through the eyes and fate of two brothers, Damien and Teddy O'Donovan, splendidly performed by Cillian Murphy and Pádraic Delaney, respectively. Tensions are maintained up high to the end, accentuated by fierce shooting events, brutal behaviour of the British soldiers and - last but not least - desolate Irish landscape and weather. All this seems realistic even to me who is unaware of those events, and the result is a strong and catchy war drama (according to Ken Loach style) - to be watched alone or in a company of like-minded, and although some women have significant role in the film, it does probably not bespeak contemporary women.",8,0,2,16 February 2014
The Great Raid," Decent, but many imitating references to prior related movies
","The main strength of this movie is being based on real events and names. The plot, however, is uneven, with a few intertwined story-lines with unequal weight and smoothness: preparation for liberation, life in POW camp, resistance activities, liberation itself. Following all this, we see many similarities with approaches from e.g. The Bridge on the River Kwai, The Thin Red Line, Pearl Harbor - and without upgrade or distinctive twists... There are some protracted and arid scenes, tensions tend to decrease at times. The cast is even, both no prevailing performances; Marton Csokas as Capt. Redding and Connie Nielsen as Margaret Utinsky seemed most interesting to me.All in all, an okay war movie, but no great experience. I would recommend the ones named above instead.",6,4,5,15 December 2013
Limitless," A realistic warning movie; and largely an one-man show
","Usually I am not very much into sci-fi movies, especially if full of technical, medical etc sophisticated terms, reasonings and inventions. Luckily to me, Limitless is, in fact, a crime thriller where the specific drug is mainly triggering 'down-to-earth' events and relationship changes. However, it is no drug movie either - the main emphasis is on other issues than drug trafficking or miserable life of addicts.Director Neil Burger has splendidly exploited the values of the book (The Dark Fields by Alan Glynn) as well as contemporary technical opportunities, but the real star/gem is Bradley Cooper whose character changes are performed in a great and trustworthy manner. The always talented Robert De Niro plus two pleasant actresses Abbie Cornish and Anna Friel provide additional value to the movie. In other words, Limitless is a movie recommended to all keen on respective topics and actors; you will not be disappointed, although the script is sometimes unbalanced.",8,1,1,3 December 2012
Sicario," Realistic movie with a static leading character
","As a rule, I am not into films or series dealing with drug abuse and/or drug trafficking, but at times, in the event of distinct plot and good performances/direction, I find time. Sicario had good prerequisites, but it did not provide wow! experience as a whole; apparently due to realism maintenance, most of the plot was arid, and the main character FBI agent Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) was strangely 'colorless' and non-dynamic, falling down on, in particular, Benicio del Toro as Alejandro Gillick and Josh Brolin as Matt Graver whose versatility bears the weight in the movie, following them maintain the thrill and cohesion of the plot. Besides, some twists were revealed too soon, thereafter one could guess how the things would go on and resolve. The very ending was too plain as well.All in all, Sicario is not a bad movie, but does not measure up to e.g. Blow or Traffic. Thus, 'only' 7 points from me.",7,1,2,24 March 2016
Pulp Fiction," Great in every way... And different in many ways
","Chronologically, it is the last of the wow-movies for me so far; the other two are Cabaret (1972) and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975). I can still remember my thoughts and ravishment during and after seeing Pulp Fiction - directing and plot compilation was so different, and the director was totally unknown to me (I had not heard of Reservoir Dogs before). And the cast: plenty of that-time and/or current stars, even in smaller roles, with the budget less than 10 million USD! Many effects, manners, ideas are still conceptional, and lots of later parodies and imitations have just fastened its place in the movie history. Luckily, Pulp Fiction was praised and prized already directly after screening, sometimes big innovations and improvements are understood years after.I have seen all Tarantino's movies and Pulp Fiction is still the one I like most, although I cannot say the others are bad, weak or something, but Pulp has undoubtedly the most sophisticated storyline and the wittiest dialogs/remarks.",10,0,2,16 December 2012
Jack Reacher," Witty and some fine acting - but no wow! feeling
","The biggest shortcoming to me was the too early revealing of real affairs behind the shooting - this surprise moment could have been postponed for later or even for the ending scenes. I would have been interested to ponder why Jack Reacher's person and actions caused so big interest from the 'bad guys'. True, there are still several twists and turns left, the ending is pleasantly 'loose' and chasing/actions scenes are catchy to follow. The cast is strong an even as well, I was most impressed by Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher, Rosamund Pike as Helen Rodin, and Robert Duvall as Cash, whose performance enhanced the value of the movie. Thus, a decent conspiracy action movie, and admirers of Cruise will not be disappointed again.",8,4,10,17 March 2013
In Time," Great idea, uneven plot, some good performances
","I consider the concept of time settlement sophisticated and fresh, and most of the events and dialogs originated from this in a witty manner, providing food for thought and reflections. The plot was not smooth, however, the excitement declined from time to time, and some scenes were unnecessary, giving the movie additional 10-15 minutes that could have been avoided. As for the cast, I liked Cillian Murphy and Alex Pettyfer most; usually interesting Amanda Seyfried was too ordinary here. Justin Timberlake was pretty much uninviting, instead of him Joseph Gordon-Levitt or Shia LaBeouf could have been used, for example. Nevetheless, In Time is an above-the-average entertainment, and is recommended primarily to those fond of sci-fi with strong human involvement.",7,1,2,15 March 2013
Thor," Skilfully directed entertainment, but nothing special
","The first 20 minutes or so were even boring, then some events began to develop... Names like Branagh, Portman, Hopkins, Skarsgård, Russo are usually trademarks of sophistication and high quality, but their performance - at least to me - remained just above average, probably due to mediocre screenplay. All the main issues touched have been scrutinized in so many movies, that Thor became just another 'sparrow on the line'...Of course, as the budget was high, the donors and lenders seemed to want to act for certain: different races, genders and ages were carefully picked. However, technology used is state-of-the-art, fight scenes are carried out in a brilliant way. But the ending is nothing special.Worth watching, if you are a teen, or you have teenage children and are in need of a family event :)",6,1,2,22 July 2012
Zero Dark Thirty," Seems realistic, but too protracted and too focused on a single character
","Although the plot covers the events over a decade, the ones picked for showing could have been much shorter - 2,5 hours is too long for a movie where interrogations, surveillances and mappings prevail. Thus, the movie is often arid, although there are sudden twists; well, the first is really sudden, then you start to expect a frames before shocking events are rather similarly depicted. The ending is trivial as well.The casting is decent: Jessica Chastain is brilliant and deserves her Golden Globe and Academy Award nomination, but she is too much on screen, at times one might think that this was her operation, being the chief coordinator or so. All others are supporting actors and not really catchy, with the exception of James Gandolfini and Mark Strong - but they were too briefly on screen. So it is all like a solo story, there is no even cast to follow and enjoy.Zero Dark Thirty is above average, but 5 Academy Award nominations?! Too much, I think. Mrs Bigelow has directed far better movies; by the way, Hurt Locker did not impress me either, too static and the events too 'far' from me and not attractive. Both these movies are OK to watch once, but hardly more.",7,2,5,24 January 2013
12 Years a Slave," Great performances and directing, moralizing plot
","Virtually every country has black spots in its history - some countries have them currently, too, including slavery (now hidden or under some other name/form). Depicting this together with understandings prevailing in the 19th century provides a good basis for dramatic events and intense human relations, where different races/genders/backgrounds approach or collide.Undoubtedly gifted Steve McQueen has fully exploited those opportunities plus has managed to attract famous and talented cast even into short supporting roles (Benedict Cumberbatch as William Ford, Brad Pitt as Samuel Bass, Paul Dano as John Tibeats, Paul Giamatti as Theophilus Freeman). But the strongest and longer visible roles (with close-ups of faces) are performed by Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon Northup, Michael Fassbender as Edwin Epps, Lupita Nyong'o as Patsey; I would not be surprised if any of those achievements is honored with Golden Globe and Academy Award.As for the script, the beginning is protracted and confusing, and I felt an attempt to burden the white with additional guilt and shame for the past, for their forefathers, especially in case of those living in the Southern states. At the same time, all great nations have based their wealth on penal servitude, slaves, overseas natives etc.I have to admit that Django Unchained by Quentin Tarantino impressed me more. And last but not least - I wonder why a panoramic movie about US history had to be accomplished by Brits mostly...",7,1,3,10 January 2014
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Definitely great then, but slightly timeworn now
","This large-scale and realistic film was just a decade after the World War II had ended, without much technology assisting in creating credible atmosphere and effects. Even colour films were not so common... As the Brits had maintained more or less normal relations with their former colony Ceylon, they were able to film there, using lots of mass scenes and manual labour.The idea behind is intriguing, and after a certain escape, the film consists of two parallel set of events intertwined in the end. However, many scenes are depicted too lengthily, bringing along temporary uneven pace and and diminishing excitement (or current viewers have just become too impatient...) As for the cast, only Alec Guinness as Lieutenant Colonel Nicholson and Sessue Hayakawa as Colonel Saito were catchy to me, I can't remember the others from other films, for example. Well, Guinness was awarded his only Oscar for the role (great, but lengthwise not a real leading one)... All in all, the film received 7 Academy Awards, showing that the opportunities of that period were used in a maximum way. I could particularly point out the directing and the music, with many songs becoming hits afterwards. A real pleasant supporting actor is the nature, forming a contrast to construction activities and prison camps (however, life of Japanese POWs was not as harsh as of German or Soviet ones).Thus, The Bridge on the River Kwai is undoubtedly a great war film, but I am not sure it 'accosts' modern viewers with Oliver Stone, Brian de Palma and Clint Eastwood in mind...",7,2,5,26 October 2013
Edge of Tomorrow," Military action flick with a difference
","This century, evidently thanks to advanced digital technology, has seen dozens of futuristic movies where the world is to be saved from alien invasion. Most of them have both the plain plot and ending, and all action in focused on visual effects. The latter plays also an important role in Edge of Tomorrow, but, fortunately, a new angle - in the form on recurrent time loop - and twisted humor make this movie an entertainment distinct from other of the kind, perhaps as the screenplay is adapted from a Japanese light novel. The very ending has a pleasant 'dodge' as well.Anyway, you have to concentrate and ponder, as things get intertwined, repeated scenes are combined with new elements, and the chemistry between Tom Cruise as Major William Cage and Emily Blunt as Sergeant Rita Vrataski is good as well; besides, Bill Paxton as Master Sergeant Farell and Brendan Gleeson as General Brigham provide small, yet memorable performances. As for the effects, the enemy's look is different, and the likeness of the equipment/technology used by the 'good guys' with the ones used in related movies is not annoying as they are not means for torpid destruction. The creators have taken all with ease, sometimes it seems that they laugh even at themselves.",8,2,5,19 January 2015
Whiplash," Too ill-natured and rough for a movie about jazz
","Yelling and foul-mouthed superiors/teachers are still seen here and there, but I can hardly imagine them 'flourish' in the field of 'mild' arts; I myself have collaborated in several choirs and bands, my close relative worked for decades in a theater, so I know that artistic people are very thin-skinned and soft-hearted, certainly not ready to tolerate crudity for years, even by someone with contacts and talents. This sort of person we saw in Terence Fletcher is more fitting to sports or war-zone.True, the dramatics was skillfully created, there were several twists paving the way for witty, yet odd ending. The performances of two protagonists - Miles Teller as Andrew Neiman and J. K. Simmons as Terence Fletcher - were thrilling to watch particularly thanks to pace and dynamism, but sidelines and background were relatively empty, especially regarding Fletcher. After all, the viewers obtained some information about Neiman's background and life outside music.All in all, a vigorous drama with multiple strong and opposite feelings present, but it is difficult to me to envisage how (jazz) musicians would experience this movie plot-wise. And how the people far away from music or hating jazz are willing to watch this to the end at all...",7,1,2,18 January 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," Greed and insolence will destroy everyone... Eventually
","Anyways, this is the main idea of this long movie... A certain panoramic epic, more drama than comedy (well, tragedy for thousands but they are not visible). Evidently, the tandem Scorsese-DiCaprio is fond of strong characters within vicious glamor and alternating activities - the movie in question is another example. Although I am not sure if most of viewers would regard it as an warning movie - hedonism and life-fast- die-young principle are too popular among the younger and middle-aged audiences.The plot is covers almost two decades and is rambling at times, but as based on memoirs with real events and characters, it adds credibility and diminishes suddenness - as we know in advance what happened to this company and its leaders. Directing is skillful, male cast is rather strong, but focused on totally on Leonardo DiCaprio as Jordan Belfort; Jonah Hill as Donnie Azoff is interesting, pity that Matthew McConaughey had so little part. Female characters could have been of several levels, mostly visible are bimbos, beautiful, but identical.The biggest shortcoming is the length - over 3 hours (with commercials) in the cinema is physically hard; in my opinion, some under-plots and drug scenes could have been skipped. I did not get bored yet, however.All in all, the movie is worth watching, and Academy Award nominations will certainly follow (winning is not sure as competition is high this year)....Well, if you do something illegal, do it alone and unobtrusively... Or not.",8,1,5,14 January 2014
August Rush," Poetic urban fairytale intertwined with flowing music
","For centuries, tales about people having nothing and obtaining a lot due to their skills and/or good nature have been popular, particularly if children are involved - Oliver Twist is probably the best known. Evan Taylor aka August Rush (heartily and distinctively played by Freddie Highmore) is a boy living in an orphanage possessing a savant-like ability to hear music everywhere. Through ups and downs, meeting different people while living on the streets, he succeeds in both his goals at the same time. His nature and environment is melancholic but beautiful, sometimes within protracted scenes, however. Ugly, bad scenes in connection with him have been avoided.The other dimension, between past and present, are Lyla Novacek and Louis Connelly (performed by Keri Russell and Jonathan Rhys Meyers - amiably, but trivially), musicians of different kind - whose link to Taylor/Rush is not disclosed until the second half of the movie - and sometimes it is difficult to follow which part of their life is depicted. The ending of the movie with their imminent presence is breathtaking and sweet, rounding up all previous actions.As for the other major cast, Robin Williams as Maxwell 'Wizard' Wallace is convincing, Terrence Howard as Counselor Richard Jeffries is too plain (due to his character apparently). Music dominates everywhere, focusing mostly on classical pieces, diminishing audience rather than widening. Still, August Rush can be considered as a pleasant family entertainment, particularly if music has a distinct role there.",7,0,0,7 February 2014
"Hail, Caesar!"," An over-sophisticated movie about making movies
","From time to time, movies like this are made, by talented directors- producers and including talented actors. They are dealing with their love and daily grind - cinema - with lots of inside jokes and scenes fully understood by thousands, yet uninviting to millions. Hail, Ceasar! is a fine example of similar movie, and all the people I know who have seen it said that they managed to 'pass through it' by focusing on characters only, being surprised how the Coens can convince many Oscar winners and nominees to perform so small and weird parts. Yes, there are some witty-funny dialogues and characters, but the Communist line is too much and excessive even for the Coens...To me, it is the most uninteresting Coen-movie I have seen; well, I can't say it's bad - 7 points for strong cast and characters with 'touch', but the era and the environment did not come up to me as expected. Luckily, unlike most Coen-movies, it lasted 1.5 hours only, so I was committed to watch it until credentials appeared.",7,0,3,27 November 2016
Dark Shadows," Another playful works by Tim Burton... And so?
","It is true that Dark Shadows is less profound, less marvelous, with less glitter, and more both clichés and repetitions, but evenly strong cast - no matter if leading or supporting roles - makes it still pleasant and catchy to follow. Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Helena Bonham Carter, Jackie Earle Haily - those names are all known to those fond of 'different' movies; moreover, they are also recurring actors in Burton's movies. Well yes, the plot is uneven, but there are several funny moments (particularly when Depp reacts to 1970ies lifestyle, a kind of cultural shock), and depiction of a vampire is also different from trivial approaches on this matter.Despite some shortcomings, still recommended - unless you dislike Burton's out-of-this-world creations. Strong 7 points from me.",7,1,3,15 February 2013
Sherlock Holmes," Conan Doyle for 'actionists'... Well directed and played though
","The script is rather loosely based on Conan Doyle's characters and events, enabling to create a story beyond - luckily without much of incredibility. The events roll and they are inter-twisted and at multiple levels; thanks to explanations and flashbacks they are easier to follow. The characters are deliberated well and even smaller appearances have a significance and are played by decent performers. The cast is, of course, great, combining excellent male actors from both sides of Atlantic - Robert Downey, Jr. as Sherlock Holmes, Jude Law as Dr. John Watson, Mark Strong as Lord Blackwood, Eddie Marsan as Inspector Lestrade... Holmes-Watson dialogs are catchy, there are 'sizzles' and chemistry between them is spite of their mood. Female characters are rather sketchy, Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler was uninviting to me; Kelly Reilly (as Mary) is more talented actress, but she spent too little time on screen.A pleasant action movie to spend around 2 hours with - perhaps not then if you are serious admirer of Conan Doyle's works. Jumping and kicking-butt were not the characteristics Holmes and Watson were famous for :)",8,0,2,9 February 2013
Arrival," A been-there-seen-that movie with substantial flaws
","This decade has made happen dozens of sci-fi movies with activities in a limited space and time, with slow pace and lengthy speculations about mankind's present and future. On the usual line, I am not into similar productions, but the reputation of the movie and it awards 'urged' us in a group to pick the one in question. We all watched the movie in full, but all of us had several misunderstandings and indistinct places solved only afterwards, when reading about its plot... Vague flashbacks, strange behavior of characters in clear situations, and settlements based on Western approaches made this a topsy-turvy watch, with trivial ending and naive conclusions. And as a linguist, I know that one is unable to figure out a totally different language/pictograph in a way we see in this movie. Bringing the Western wishful thinking into the minds of non-human aliens may flatter some part of respective audience, but it is neither scientific nor logical approach... And if the basics is totally odd, then the following events do not make any good sense, particularly when bearing in mind a sci-fi movie.Therefore, for me, Arrival is above mediocrity due to the direction and leading performances only (Amy Adams as Louise Banks and Forest Whitaker as Colonel Weber, above all). The overall concept is unreasoned and necessitates to refer to its plot description later on for some of its angles and ideas.",6,1,4,15 June 2017
The Blind Side," Interesting movie on a non-interesting main topic...
","...at least for me as I am not into sports, and the phenomenon and rules of US football have remained mystery to me. However, from time to time, I watch some sports movies, usually if the persons I admire are involved.As for The Blind Side, the plot based on real persons and events provides a strong additional value, otherwise it could have become a moralizing story about racial tensions, wealth vs. poverty, naive attitudes on helping and alike, quite often present in Western movies aimed at as wide audience as possible. Here, it all makes sense, and we can follow a story of a young Afro-American lad from his scanty upbringing, through his years at Christian school and his adoption, to his position as one of the most appreciated prospects in college football, then finally becoming a first-round pick in the NFL. All the performances are at least good, but my favorites are Sandra Bullock as Leigh Anne Tuohy and Jae Head as Sean 'SJ' Tuohy, Jr., whose roles distinguish from all the others, including Quinton Aaron as Michael 'Big Mike' Oher who apparently was rather dull in real life. In addition, it was pleasant to notice 'Cinematography by Alar Kivilo', probably the most known Estonian in Hollywood.All in all, a good movie, although the start was protracted (plus without Bullock), and sports scenes covered quite a big share of the total length. But those 'minuses' did not call away this generally smooth creation.",8,1,2,5 August 2014
Parasite," Orderly artisanship, but no wow! for me...
","Yes, the script is equal to the task, there are several twists (but also predictable moments), performances are pleasant (Song Kang-ho as Kim and Cho Yeo-jeong as Choi), but apparently my expectations were too high after lots of awards and accolades. The title is ambiguous, and the course of events is as the Coen brothers would join forces with Tarantino...The film in question won 4 Academy Awards and it is nice, but if I look back on The King´s Speech, Rain Man, or No Country for Old Men - also with 4 Oscars, then I have to admit I liked those more. My bad... :)",8,0,3,14 February 2020
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Great performances, but 'restricted' and over-sophisticated plot
","As I have seen all feature films by Alejandro González Iñárritu, I did not expect neither trivial nor smooth watch, but I remember large diversity of people and topics from previous ones. Birdman, however, is focusing on persons involved dramatic art, their goals and issues, robed into Iñárritu's round-the-bend approach. Although I had some giggles and the performances of all more-or-less leading actors were pleasing to watch (particularly Michael Keaton as Riggan Thomson / Birdman, Edward Norton as Mike Shiner, Zach Galifianakis as Jake), I often felt that not all scenes and lines reached my mind, that I apparently missed inside jokes and stuff familiar to people daily involved in acting and play production (therefore, it is logical that The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has awarded 9 Academy Award nominations to Birdman this year). Thanks to skillful directing and camera-work, I did not get blah feelings, and quite a witty ending arrived earlier than expected, but still...My two close relatives have worked in different theaters, I know some actors personally, been to back stages, etc., and yet, Birdman remained out-of-the-way to me. I can't image how people with no or casual contacts with theater world could watch and enjoy Birdman's storyline at all. And even if I admire Keaton (well, always have), I think that 'Performance by an actor in a leading role' should be awarded to either Benedict Cumberbatch or Eddie Redmayne this year.",6,4,12,19 January 2015
The Conjuring," Apparently skilfully made, but...
","For me as agnostic, weird things result from lack of knowledge and/or twisted mind. Well, there are clairvoyants, but they are persons with sharp senses and enhanced psychology skills. When I am too lazy to ponder, I confine myself to Murphy's laws... Besides, I do not find old house or weather related creaking doors or outside rustles - or similar - supernatural or scary and I do not believe in bad aura.Nevertheless, from time to time, I watch movies dealing with the above topics, particularly if fine directors and actors are involved. In the movie in question, Vera Farmiga was the biggest traction to me: her pleasant physiognomy does not hinder her being versatile... Regretfully, she was the only part I really enjoyed, all other things were okay at best. There were lot of scenes when you expected that something would happen, but either nothing did or the incident was ridiculous, i.e. non-real or deriving from the past. Fuss with finding evidence was not fresh as well, similar depictions have been used in dozens of movies before... Well, I can admit that some twists are thrilling - especially to those having weaker nerves - but all this related exorcism and religious connections provide all this mess odd undertones. I would have preferred a real, personified evil attempting to make his or her misdoings look supernatural or so (i.e., someone trying to chase neighbors away for various reasons, personal revenge, etc.). The ending was nothing special and expected as well.All in all, the movie is not bad, but lacks new approaches and elements for 'impassive' and non-religious people like me.",7,0,2,27 October 2013
Never Back Down," Teen gladiators in the Internet era
","At least since Gary Grant, the movies where a rebellious teen attempts to prove something for himself and people close to him, have been flourished. The method has slightly varied, but fights, car chases, parties, beautiful girls and muscular men have all been included. Novelties have long gone, but movies with similar elements tend still to attract wide audiences. All this concerns Never Back Down as well. Is it really not cool for the young to watch a similar movie made some years before? I can't see any new angle or approach here (technology development is a parallel phenomenon), and the only good actors and 'adult' ones, e.g. Djimon Hounsou and Leslie Hope (some additional rating from me thanks to their performances). Those depicting students are - apart from their looks - not inviting at all. Well, my teen years were decades ago, but I can still assess a book, not its covers only. If you like to see time-proof movie with and about teens and youngsters, the keywords are - included but not limited to - Paul Dano, Ezra Miller, Anton Yelchin, Joseph Gordon-Levitt.",5,0,1,8 July 2013
Taken 2," Not a masterpiece, but definitely not a flop
","Luc Besson as a writer/producer, with Liam Neeson and Famke Janssen starring - and the outcome is an intense thriller with lots of chases, bursts and explosions. The pace is always present (apart from the very beginning), and not much time is wasted on reasoning or moralizing. Neeson looks still great and fit - he was almost 60 years old during the filming! - and Janssen has her pleasant charm allowing to depict both sweet and sinister characters. Maggie Grace as their daughter impressed me less than in Taken in 2008. Rade erbedija has always been a great villain depicter. Another exotic supporting actor is the city of Istanbul... Despite most of the scenes shown in discolored suburbs or markets, I obtained the desire to visit it again.If you like almost constant action, the movie is for you, and about 1,5 hours pass quickly.",7,1,2,1 December 2012
The Woman in Black," For a British film, not excellent... Apart from 2 supporting actors
","If the plot involves historical period in a distant British place with abandoned castles, old graveyards and tide waters, then you have a large part of a horror film already in place. And if all main characters have lost someone close, then their mind is willing to accept and see different gloomy matters. Such is the background of awkward and supernatural things happening to and around a poor lawyer and the widowed father Arthur Kipps - normally, but not splendidly played by the former Potter guy Daniel Radcliffe. The real gems of the film are Ciarán Hinds as Sam Daily, a local landowner and Janet McTeer as Elisabeth Daily, Daily's wife, who are really catchy to watch. Well, the whole film is more or less thrilling to watch, but I would have preferred some real evil involved, rather than spiritual phenomenon. Though the ending is unexpected and stylish, I felt somehow empty when the credits appeared, that I saw just a hollow story.I have heard that there would be a sequel titled The Woman in Black: Angel of Death. In all probability, I will skip it.",7,0,1,22 December 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Witty and powerful, with wonderful actors
","Another achievement by Nolan Bros. and Warner Bros... Thanks to its huge budget available (ca 230 million USD) one could use state-of-the-art technology and employ a dream-team of actors of different generations: Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Anne Hathaway, Joseph Gordon-Levitt... And they got the opportunity to have elaborated roles to play, not just appearing in the background; Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth is probably the finest of the great ones. Moreover, it is no comic strip movie, but an epic story of universal values, attitudes and issues, with superhero and sci-fi moments complementing the script, not governing it.Minuses from me due to length (ca 2,5 hours) and too obvious references/comparisons with characters from other hit movies (e.g. Hannibal, Catwoman, James Bond). But still, the movie is worth watching and recommendable!",8,6,10,16 December 2012
Blade Runner," Ahead of its time then, but slightly timeworn now
","Before digital revolution, it was tricky to get involved in depicting science fiction - particularly if you desired to show long scenes with futuristic technology; some directors as George Lucas even postponed some works as they found the technology was not ripe enough. Luckily, in Blade Runner, the main focus is on human(ist) values, with 'modern' surroundings in the background. Still, let me remind that the events take place in 2019, but seeing television tubes, mildly advanced phone booths and sizable apparatuses is a bit awkward at present... Not mentioning openly visible product placement. The biggest gem of the movie is the cast, with 2 excellent (Rutger Hauer, Harrison Ford) and the rest giving good performances. Visually, the director Rider Scott has evidently influenced by Lucas and Stanley Kubrick.Perhaps I am spoiled by mobile and digital technology, but as of the year of 2013, I can't consider Blade Runner as timeless creation.",8,0,4,11 November 2013
Jojo Rabbit," Talented combination of over-the-top and heartiness
","Although its pace is versatile, depending on dialogues and scenes, I find it wise that the beginning is so 'crazy' - it makes you eagerly follow what is going on and what would happen, enjoy the twists and changes in moods and wisenings even more... A real dramedy, with sad and tragic moments included.The performances are excelling, particularly the 2 'leading boys' Jojo and Yorki, as well the supporting cast... Direction, production, music - everything in harmony, just where they need to be.Well, evidently, such a film could not have been made in Germany, but still - good that we have it. Forget your prejudices, discomfort and one-sided stories about WWII and see comic elements in tragedy and vice versa!",9,4,8,11 February 2020
Lucy," Over-sophistication of action film
","In general, I like Luc Besson's creations I have tried to follow them as much as possible. His distinct approaches and good choices of actors are notable - and Lucy is no exception here. However, there is too much neuroscience, sometimes sci-fi and plain shootings do not match / disturb each other, there are some unrealistic scenes (e.g. person with a visible gun freely moving around in a public institution), and the talent of some actors (particularly Morgan Freeman and Amr Waked) was 'wasted' in minor and non-elaborated characters. Scarlett Johansson is, of course, great and thanks to her abilities and charm the film's overall value is enhanced for me. Long shootings are car chases characteristic to Besson are present as well.Anyway, the film in question is still far above average and the 1 hour 20 minutes pass smoothly, with a few protracted scenes though. But it has not reached the level of e.g. Subway or The Fifth Element.",7,3,9,13 October 2014
Moonrise Kingdom," An awkward sophistication, with small(er) parts played by great(er) actors
","I have seen most of Wes Anderson's movies and I find them good at least, if not more. The plots themselves are usually not so holistic, but the characters and developments are pleasantly strange and make you giggle. Regarding this, the Coen brothers, Tarantino and Anderson seem to share similar values, but the latter is least violent.The characters and their performers are just great, including all known versatile Hollywood names beginning with Harvey Keitel and finishing with Jason Schwartzman... And female characters are stronger than male ones. The children are also well selected, including the main stars Kara Hayward and Jared Gilman, whose appearance and depiction of adult issues is natural, without moralizing or political correctness too often visible in Western movies involving minors. Through splendid roles and performances, Anderson laughs at lawyer language, foster care, local police, camp routines etc, but the stereotypes and clichés are funny and edifying, not annoying. Recommended to those fond of head-over-heels world and different approaches, but is a movie for like-minded, rather than a family movie.",8,1,2,30 September 2012
Flight," I do have ambivalent feelings towards this movie
","Excellent features: - performances by Denzel Washington (!), Keilly Reilly, John GoodmanGood features: - performances by the rest of actorsNot so good features: - the plot. It is too slow at times, and becomes gradually predictable. There are also unrealistic moments, especially the hearing scene - persons tend to 'sober up' after dramatic events, but not in this manner. Washington's and Reilly's characters are too plain anti-addiction patterns, but thanks to the actors' talent, they are still pleasant to follow.Nevertheless, the movie is worth watching, and Washington will probably get a Academy Award nomination. Good luck!",7,1,1,29 December 2012
Unbroken," Not bad, but there are more powerful related movies out there
","True or mostly true stories about strong people who survived tough circumstances are often catchy to follow, particularly if a person did not get into trouble 'voluntarily', but due to a certain force majeure. World War II was such a mayhem when staying alive no matter what was the virtually the main thing, other things like broken families/opportunities/careers seemed secondary, if not lower. Thanks to the Coen Brothers and Angelina Jolie, above all, we are able to follow the childhood and youth of Louie Zamporini, until his return from a Japanese prison camp in 1945. Rough environment and sports made him tough and let him survive so many such events that even 1 one of those could be easily fatal to most of us. But Zamporini landed on his feet and lived 97 years, all in all... The pace is not always dynamic and some scenes are protracted, but the movie in question is generally a smooth narration about the war perceived by single, 'ordinary' people.The cast is even in a sense that there are no famous persons stealing the slow. True, Jack O'Connell as Zamperini and Takamasa Ishihara as Mutsuhiro 'The Bird' Watanabe spend more time on screen than others, with the characters more elaborated, but still, there are no pointless supporting characters among them who say something, they have good complementary significance. Thus, Unbroken is a good watch, but it is still no The Bridge on the River Kwai, The Great Raid, Empire of the Sun, or similar - no such profundity.",7,0,2,6 March 2015
The Purge," Obsolescent plot decently performed
","21st century has given different low-budget thrillers where the events develop in a limited space and limited time, often with a rich family involved, e.g. Panic Room or Trespass or Funny Games. All tense in a way or another, focusing on tough choices and pondering on human value and dignity. The Purge is another movie in that row and, as the topic is exploited too often, it brings along too many clichés, improbable solutions and odd ending. However, good actors like Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey squeeze the most out of it; at the same time, those depicting children or gang members are not inviting. And what was the purpose of including an African American - an attempt to widen the audience? Not to mention the fact that the idea behind/beyond the purge is rather dumb; I could picture a day when criminals could be punished and disputes settled out-of-court, but the meaning visible in this movie is just a mind-twister without any logic. But as all this lasts less than 1,5 hours, it is a kind of thrilling entertainment without wasting too much time.",5,1,3,28 June 2013
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Decent? Yes. Conceptional? No.
","I have not read the books, I was somehow invited to see the 1st installment, which I did not like so much, but there is always hope for the better... Especially when both movies have received so much praise and accolades. But alas, again, similar ambivalent feelings, as the plot is uneven, at times protracted, games themselves start in the 2nd half of the movie, unnecessary explanations alternate with indistinct scenes... The reasons for such an ending is understandable, but I would still prefer a kind of solution, round-up for each and every part.The best thing in the movie are 'older' actors, starting from Woody Harrelson and ending with Amanda Plummer. The younger ones had not much impression on me, I know dozens of more versatile and distinct actors aged 30 and below, e.g. Paul Dano, Anton Yelchin, Joseph Gordon-Lewitt, Emma Watson, Zoe Kazan; the phenomenon of Jennifer Lawrence is still mystery to me, well, I will try to peruse this by watching Winter's Bone as soon as possible :) Well, I do still not comprehend what is the real target audience and how/why the movie has obtained so many viewers and box office. There are much more intriguing movies out there.",6,2,12,31 January 2014
Looper," A decent sci-fi thriller, but not so special
","Well, at least I am puzzled why this movie has earned so much worldwide and why even critics have praised it to the skies... Of course, the actors are known and good (starting with Bruce Willis, Joseph Gordon- Levitt, Emily Blunt; although the most brilliant performances were Pierce Gagnon as Cid and Paul Dano as Seth), but the topics of time traveling, telekinesis and loyalty and greed among hit men have been exploited widely before. The pace is also uneven, at times too fast, then too slow (especially in the country house) and full of reasoning on human and past issues. Thus, Looper is okay for killing 1h 45 minutes, but do not expect a state-of-the-art or conceptional experience.",7,0,2,4 November 2012
50_50," A moving comedy with tragic background - without being a tragicomedy
","The topic is serious and although cancer at present is not almost 100% lethal as it used to be, it is still unpredictable and often is the mental situation the decisive thing in determining the outcome. I liked the film for the following reasons: -- the screenplay is based on real events; a difficult topic is touched with piety, but realistically -- excellent performances by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Anjelica Houston and Anna Kendrick (Seth Rogen is too plain comedian for me)I can't imagine how this film is watched by cancer patients or by those whose close ones have/had it... Thus, I would be careful to recommend the film largely and widely. However, memorable moments and laughs will be guaranteed. Plus some hints and knowledge, how to handle yourself and others in the event of difficult situation.",8,0,0,19 August 2012
Cloud Atlas," Distinguishable, with fine performances, but uneven episodes and long run
","The movie in question is a long and hectic narration (at times seems unceasing), with some elements of interlock, continuity and era-wise approaches. There are 6 different places/years, but not all of them are equally intriguing; my favorites are UK 2012 (with the funniest moments) and San Fransisco 1973 (most crime thriller), distant past and particularly distant future episodes used known turns and depiction too much. Joining elements are not always clear, same actors play different roles (with occasionally crude make-up), thus one has to stare the screen all the time, which becomes physically difficult as the movie lasts ca 2 hours 45 minutes. As for the cast, the finest performances are carried out by Oscar-winners Tom Hanks, Halle Berry and Jim Broadbent, the others were just average or spent too little time on screen (e.g. Susan Sarandon).All in all, a kind of challenging watching: rather unusual script, but too sophisticated episodes and weak connection did not make tracking events easy. I would have preferred less time periods and more inter-generational links when deeds or ideas of older generations have direct impact on their descendants.",7,1,4,6 November 2013
300," Good (computerized) battle scenes, but still an overrated film
","The first third of the film is rather boring... Then events start to develop but that you see on screen is battle for battle's sake. Life in Sparta is running slightly on the background only. As for actors, there are no real 'gems', Fassbender, for example, has too small part. Butler as Leonidas and Heady as Gorgo are rather mediocre... And should Xerxes look like gay emo? And why are monster persons and monster animals brought along?I have seen much better historical Greek-Roman era films, e.g. Spartacus, Gladiator, Alexander, Attila. You may enjoy it if you like fantasy comic books and do not care about historical accuracy.",2,2,4,5 September 2012
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Stylish and impetuous entertainment
","Brits are famous for their spy(ing) films, and the even the financial and/or human participation of Americans has not generally spoiled them :) Kingsman: The Secret Service is another fine example of quality entertainment where introduction of new faces for younger generation (Taron Egerton, Sophie Cookson) has been giftedly combined of the participation of known and rewarded character actors: Colin Firth, Samuel L. Jackson (the funniest and most distinctive), Mark Strong, Michael Caine, with Firth and Caine being Academy Award winners! As for the plot, it is rather witty, true, one has to know many previous similar films to make the most of certain lines, events and references, as the film in question is a real 'child' of multiple films beginning with James Bond at least... But still, no more maze runners and divergents, please, but more quality cinema where humour and action are combined without factitious course of events and leaning on cute young faces only.",8,2,7,9 June 2015
The Hangover Part III," Less witty than I and II, but not a flop
","Well, the plot is without any hangover, not so smooth and has less twists, but the run is logical and includes several funny and warm moments. Animal-related scenes are not to everyone's taste, but the share of dirty sex jokes has significantly diminished (in order to widen the audience?).As for the cast, the 3rd movie is focused mainly on Zach Galifianakis' character Alan Garner (ZG outperforms all his co-stars); Ken Jeong as Leslie Chow and John Goodman as Marshall provide catchy performances as well. The other characters are less elaborated and even a splendid actor like Bradley Cooper has to strain to the utmost. Female characters are sketchy and nothing special, they appear seldom on the screen.If you at least tolerated Hangover I and Hangover II, then you could watch the final series as well as it rounds up the trilogy in a nice manner.",7,1,2,14 June 2013
Inside Llewyn Davis," A pleasant watch - unless (folk) music is uninviting for you
","As I have managed to see all movies directed by Joel and/or Ethan Coen (many of them even multiple times), it is natural that Inside Llewyn Davis was on my list as well. I like the Coens' approach, choice of character actors, and that all characters are 'odd' in different ways. The same applies to the movie in question, where the viewers are invited into the New York folk music scene in the 1960ies; thus, there are many songs fully performed on different occasions (probably annoying for them disliking Bob Dylan, The Byrds and like), but they are masterfully carried out and fully fit into the general context, at times, there are funny scenes during or after them. The mood of the movie is rather gloomy, stressed by the gray weather, and the protagonist's condition/situation and lifestyle enables to logically introduce the bunch of colorful characters and witty lines - with Roland Turner (splendidly performed by John Goodman) as the most 'Coen-specific' one.As for the cast, as typical to the Coens, there are both known and less known persons involved. Goodman is a kind of Coens' trademark already, Carey Mulligan and Justin Timberlake have suitable roles as well, Oscar Isaac as Llewyn Davis was not so vivid to me - perhaps due the fact I cannot remember him from other movies. But still, the chemistry is there, and the development/fate of characters remains unclear, unsettled - so pleasantly characteristic to the Coen brothers as well.All in all, another nice contact with the Coens, although not at the level of e.g. Fargo or No Country for Old Men.",7,0,0,6 February 2014
The Cabin in the Woods," Decent acting, mediocre plot
","I am quite selective in watching zombie movies, I like a few of them, but all from 1960-70ies or their later remakes. But The Cabin in the Woods... Hm, combining manhunt for money, zombies from the recent past and medieval dragons does not necessarily mean that all categories of viewers fond of them separately would be fond of them together in one. The outcome is at times funny, then stupid and the total summary is a 'porridge' of this and that... Not impressive.Actors-actresses were also nothing special, even Sigourney Weaver's character was too briefly on screen. Well, it can still be that I do not belong into a target audience, that the movie is meant for teens and twinks - as all the main actors are in their 20ies. Nevertheless I know that there are better horror movies out there. Just search IMDb.com!",5,0,1,8 December 2012
Mad Max: Fury Road," Visual over-sophistication, waste of good actors
","The initial Mad Max movies were crazy and odd enough, but they had a solid plot with character dynamism and a lot of lines, but the one in question is a constant and rough chasing, with vague characters performed by celebrities (Hardy, Theron, Hoult - all distinct actors otherwise), model-type ladies (performing doubtful roles as heavily pregnant women handling heavy machinery and 'kicking butt'), and 'unseen' actors (faces with warpaint/masks). True, there are some silent and pensive scenes in the middle, but they seem out of context, as a pause for audience to catch breath before uproar starts again. Just back and forth on the same deserted landscape, with even explosions and shots not influencing some characters' exterior.The only personage I liked somehow was Nux (skilfully performed by Nicholas Hoult), but his change of sides remained mystery to me... All in all, the movie is like a protracted Manowar video or a road movie inside out, but the conceptual element regards visuality only. The rest is rather mediocre, at times annoying, meaning that visual effects might be a supporting component of plot only (e.g. Tarantino's movies), not the substitution of activities / logic of events.",7,2,3,3 February 2016
The Great Gatsby," Needless modernized remake of a classic
","The one in question was preceded by 4 adaptations of the novel - I have not seen them, but I remember vaguely the book I read 20+ years ago. Regretfully, the movie was apparently 'refurbished' to widen the audience, but stylish 1920ies do not go with electronic music, club dancing movements, and Disney-like colors... Dramas and tragedies accentuated by kitsch - not for me, if the topics and appearance are meant to be serious and not like Tarantino's creations. The cast is uneven as well, Leonardo DiCaprio as Jay Gatsby is great, but the others such as Tobey Maguire, Carey Mulligan, Joel Edgerton have had far more stronger performances. Less supporting actors are quite uninviting and forgotten before long.Thus, just an above-average creation, improved by the presence of good/known actors. I have the feeling that the one with Robert Redford and Mia Farrow from 1974 would stay more true to the novel and include more even cast.",6,1,1,24 December 2013
The Proposal," Decent, warm-hearted comedy
","Although the script included several clichés, their outcome was not always predictable, there were several twists and the whole main theme was reversed - female older boss and her younger assistant. The only thing I was curious about that amazed me: is the US so strict with its neighbor and NATO ally Canada? There are frequent illegal immigrant legalization campaigns, after all...The cast is strong and pleasant as well, especially female ones: Sandra Bullock as Margaret Tate and Betty White as Grandma Annie (White was over 85 during the filming!). Ryan Reynolds is a good actor, but not among my favorites, he seems sometimes rustic... However, there was chemistry visible between him and Bullock, and the duo was nicely complemented by others plus fine Alaskan nature, being a kind of supporting actor as well. All in all, no masterpiece, but worth watching if you like romantic comedies without syrupy course of events.",7,0,1,18 January 2014
Warm Bodies," Odd progress of caring and love
","I have heard about dozens of zombie movies, but I am not eager to watch them as I prefer evil being purposeful, not doing harm involuntarily or for plain survival. But I heard lots of good words concerning Warm Bodies and I watched it today... Well, better than expected. Although the plot is not smooth and has some logical caps, the presence of diverse zombies, inclusion of boneys, use of varied music, and some fine acting (particularly Nicholas Hoult as R - Hoult should obtain more praise for this role - and John Malkovich as Colonel Grigio - well, Malkovich is always pleasant to follow). The idea beyond is nice as well, the ending is expected, but warmhearted; a twist could have been included, however.All in all, the 1,5 hours pass without blah! feelings, and Hoult's facial appearance and expressions are something not to be missed.",7,0,0,19 December 2013
Law Abiding Citizen," A different prison(er) thriller
","There are dozens of prison dramas where convicts try to persuade their innocence and most of the plot is based on letting viewers to guess are they right and whom to blame - some of them have even got Academy Awards or nominations at least. Law Abiding Citizen is 'plain' in that sense: viewers are let to know about the guiltiness and the person in question does not deny it. Nevertheless, interesting twists and turns begin, a real cat-and-mouse play between legal personalities and a criminal mastermind. And here, at first, weaknesses of democracy are clearly visible - as solid proof is very hard to obtain. Anyway, the thrill is maintained throughout the movie (well, sometimes at the expense of rather improbable scenes, i.e. escapes and passing through high-level security), although the final 20 minutes are a bit protracted.The cast is evenly strong, first and foremost the leading performers Jamie Foxx, Gerald Butler and Viola Davis in a memorable supporting role. Thus, it is recommendable to watch - despite some minor faults. The movie is intense, without chases and bursts, and no digital effects were necessary.",8,0,1,20 January 2013
