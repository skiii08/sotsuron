The Blair Witch Project," Too scary?
","The film was a bit slow in places. But the overall effect was pure terror. It seemed that there were endless stretches of adrenaline being pumped into my body. Some comments:My father does not appreciate any supernatural movies because such things do not exist. Of course not: but you are supposed to cede their possibility for the movie! In the same sense, all comments about their 'filming' the movie up to the end make no sense - how would we see the footage any other way? I suppose that films that feature unkillable humans, or high schools populated with models makes sense? SHEESH!!!Secondly: This move is more of a test of the viewer's intelligence / creativity. If you need a movie to tell you to be scared thru: music, explicit gore, etc. then this is not the movie for you (i.e.: You just got off work and are dozing thru it, waiting for a character to explain the story). Pathetic (if you are over 12 years old)",10,1,2,25 July 1999
