Skyfall," Back to ejector seats
","Yay, the Bond for our eraWell that didn't last very long did it? Two films taking a fresh, interesting approach but then that's it, back to the ejector seats. From beginning to end, everything in that film was an ancient Bond cliché.All I can do it refer to the review of kumar_amit-517-866321Talk about hitting the nail on the head for this amazingly disappointing and overrated movie. It's the Emperor's new clothes. I'm looking around and rubbing my eyes in disbelief and the review of these critics. The World is Not Enough and Die Another Day were terrible films but at least it was to be expected.",1,13,29,3 November 2012
