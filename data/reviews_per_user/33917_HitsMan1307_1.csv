Sucker Punch," More Than Meets The Eye
","Seeing the trailer, I immediately (and wrongfully) assumed this movie was going to be targeted at young male guys, who are probably single, and want to witness hot girls in heavy action sequences. How far off could my first impression be?It was a fantastic movie in my opinion and I cannot understand the hate for this movie. Its so much more deeper than I imagined and the cgi is visually stunning. The storyline is brilliant and 'Blue's' acting is definitely one of the reasons this movie held together so well. Sucker Punch shows there is more than meets the eye.Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. OH YEAH!",8,10,20,29 June 2011
