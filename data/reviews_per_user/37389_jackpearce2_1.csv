It," Rather be ejected into space.
","I rarely write reviews..But this film just triggered it. I am so sick to death of Hollywood corrupting these films with unnecessary and completely horrific CGI. It totally an utterly ruins the effect any of the scares have on the audience.The opening scene with the kid and the clown in the drain was brilliant. It was eerie, ominous and creepy. The detail of Pennywise's voice and his pronunciation of every syllable was perfect. The fact you couldn't see too much but knew exactly what was in there was terrifying and mysterious.Everything after that scene was a disgusting embarrassing mess. As soon as that clown opened its mouth to a plethora of about four thousand teeth in an array of special effects I knew this film would be overdone. This film has so much potential to be creepy and genuinely scary but it wasn't. The town should of had a general darker atmosphere.The clown should of made less abrupt and obvious appearancesThe ridiculous scene where the clown tarts dancing for 2 minutes is just a joke to the filming industry. I mean COME ON.When the spirit or whatever inside decides to take the form of the demonic sister of Mona Lisa and start eating the faces of little Jewish kids. actually suck the Jewish kids face then run off back to the sewers. Thats when I knew I would rather be ejected into space then watch this.don't get me started when we discover an underground layer with hundreds of flying dead kidsThe only way its getting a 4 is because it showed great promise early onThis film has been totally saturated in CGI and is a complete waste of time. Target audience:4-15 year old's Genre: Comedy, drama. Pride and Prejudice featuring kids and a clown.",6,1,8,17 September 2017
