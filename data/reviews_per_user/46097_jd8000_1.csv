Raiders of the Lost Ark," Among the greatest movies of all time
","When I was eight, I watched an Indiana Jones movie for the first time. It was the Temple of Doom, and, being young, I loved it. I went to the library and took out Raiders of the Lost Ark. This one was a good ten times better. Since then, I have watched the movie countless times. I would say it is one of the greatest movies of all time.A great thing about Raiders is the fact that it does not start out slow. From the minute you see Indy walking through the jungle in the opening scene, you know, oh yeah, this is it. No matter how unrealistically round that boulder is, you still watch in anticipation as Indiana Jones runs for dear life. It gets even better in the bar fight scene, where we get our first real glimpse at the bad guys. The movie continues with these great action-packed scenes, moving at exactly the right pace. There's even some comic relief thrown in. I remember laughing when the assassin pulled out a sword, did some fancy tricks with it and lunged at Indy...who shot him with his gun. The special effects don't matter at all, besides, with the current remastered versions, there's nothing at all to worry about.Indiana Jones is a very believable character. He feels pain just like any other human, and is not invincible. You also care about Indiana Jones and Marion Ravenwood. You want the good guys to win. Raiders of the Lost Ark shows us all that sometimes the mere scientists can beat a whole Nazi army to save the Ark of the Covenant. People who despise the Nazis can enjoy seeing them get their asses kicked by an archaeologist with a bullwhip. I advise all of you to see this movie. It is a classic.",10,0,1,3 February 2008
