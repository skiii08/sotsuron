Walk the Line," I've seen better
","There are many people who thought this was a fabulous piece of work, but I'm not one of them. I respect other people's opinions, but I just saw it as a flat, old-fashioned biographical film. It really did not offer any real gripping stories, that I have not seen in biographical films before, there was little room I felt, to really like or dislike the lead characters. It was pretty much a standard love story with really good music, and strong acting performances. The music is enough for some recognition for this film. I can not argue with the authenticity of the music which made this film appealing throughout. Granted of course though, just get a Johnny Cash album for that. I don't drive to Vegas to see Elvis impersonators only. Recordings of the real Elvis or Johnny Cahs are hardly that heavily in demand. If you want to capture the different loks on the music being made, that is another story. Granted though, I thought that was extremely watered down. For the most part, this film is a total ripoff on the film that inspired it, 'Ray.' 'Walk the Line' deals with the same primary issues of the lead that 'Ray' deals with (i.e. the scandal, negligent family man, origin of artist finding unique sound, etc.). One scene I thought was done very poorly in this film which was inspired by a similar scene in Ray is when Cash and his two performers audition at the sound recording place and the producers finds their sound boring because it is the same old thing. And the scene gradually turns into him doing something really spectacular with his music. It was absolutely watered down with minimal energy. This level of energy remained constant throughout the film. The best part of the film was the acting. I can not deny that the acting n this film was absolutely fabulous and kept the film. Both Joachin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon absolutely became their characters. It was not an impersonation. They really were the characters. Witherspoon's Oscar was completely deserved. Since I have not Capote, I can not completely against Phoenix not receiving the Oscar, but he sure could have won and wold have deserved it. Overall, this film was at best, a little more than decent. Cash fans, enjoy. Phoenix fans, watch Gladiator. Witherspoons fans, Watch Legally Blonde or Vanity Fair.",5,1,2,11 March 2006
Raiders of the Lost Ark," A classic, and most deservingly so
","This film deserves every form of recognition it has received. A perfect mixture of breath-taking action, memorable heroes, delightfully evil villains, well-timed humor, and historical accuracy. Not that all the events in this film are true or that much of it is based on truth, but it is at least based both on real expeditions which Hitler sent Nazis on, and real biblical references to the ark of the covenant. The highlight of the film is action sequences choreographed so beautifully by Spielberg. There is nothing action films have seen to top some of the sequences in this film. The action is not insanely gory or painful like in Braveheart or Saving Private Ryan. There is blood, but it is not that painful to watch. But the sequence from when Indy is stealing the ark from the plane to when he finally steals it from the truck; that sequence is an all time classic. It starts with a plane the Nazis intend to use to ship the ark to Cairo. Indy fights a plane mechanic first before an intense fist fight with a really bulky Nazi. In the middle, his girlfriend, Marion snags another plane and is shooting off attacking Nazis, and Indy is gradually beating the Nazi, before colliding him into the propeller of the plane right by them. Indy brakes out of the plane which is about to explode. You then see a huge explosion before the Nazi load the ark then onto a truck. You are given a few moments to catch your breath before Indy chase the truck down. The battle when he jumps onto that trunk as intense as anything film can offer you. He fights off Nazi after Nazi. He dangles from the side of the truck, and keeps knocking Nazis out left and right. He finally escapes with the truck and that is that. I know it needs to be seen to be appreciated, but it is the most excitement you could ask for if action is what you seek. This film however, is more than just a strong action flick. It deals with extremely strong parallels of good versus evil. It really portrays the Nazis as these negligent villains, who seek the ark for nothing but access to a weapon. Indy meanwhile, truly seeks it to see it opened and look at what has been buried for thousands of years. And you see this massive army of trained soldiers with armed artillery who can not fend off one man and his whip and gun. This is a must-see for all action lovers. And do not think that the film is outdated after 20 years. On technical level, it is. But first of all, the Oscar winning visuals are not outdated by that much; and secondly, what it lacks it lacks in that department it makes up for with timeless ingenious film-making.",10,0,0,21 November 2004
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," A masterful adaption
","I do not have the attachment to the books which so many of their fans do. I have read LW&W and I have read Magician's Nephew. This film adaption of LW&W was virtually my picture perfect interpretation of it though, which made it so much more fulfilling to sit through. As a piece of film-making, it is a product of its era. Where as this film has been inspired to day from the Lord of the Rings films and the Harry Potter films, LW&W captures the perfect medium between those two film series'; in that, it has a mildly dark, riveting use of directing (ala Lord of The Rings) but still maintains that wonderful childlike escapism the Harry Potter films have not quite so successfully fulfilled. MR. Timnus for instance, is really just a lovable, scared, little boy. He is a loyal and cheery fellow with brilliant chemistry toward Lucy. You truly feel sorry for him while the White Witch torments him. Meanwhile, the White Witch is truly awful. Tilda Swinton really makes you hate her the entire time, and she masters that evil so well. Even when she is winning over Peter, you can tell she is evil. It is creepy, but it works. Then when she shows her evil to Peter, you see her in the most rotten of form. The visuals in this film are done perfectly. They are beautiful and not distracting. The animals sure look real, but this film will not make you think of Babe. The wolves terrify the audience when they move across the screen. Mr. Fox meanwhile, never looks phony. The interpretation of Narnia is as magical as any visual C.S. Lewis could have created. It is snowy and would seem like a marvelous paradise to someone who has never been there, but an evil and cold place to those who live there. In all ways, this film is a must see for any lover of fantasy. It is both exciting, and heart-warming. The characters all play off each other perfectly, and then extra scenes not included in the book make this film flow perfectly. 9/10",9,0,0,21 January 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The Circle is now complete
","This is not Lucas' finest, but after seeing what he had to offer for the first of the prequels, that is still an improvement. George Lucas insisted and insisted that he put nine hours a day into writing this film, and wanted a really great product for Star Wars fans to bid farewell to the saga with. Does it match up to original trilogy? No. Is is still worth seeing? Yes. Is it worth seeing several times? I would say so. It answers the most important questions to lead into episode IV. It definitely has some excellent action sequences, combined with eye-popping visuals. And unlike past Star Wars films, Lucas does not make the visual extraneous. They are all over the place, but still solid. The major downfall of this film is the characters. The truth is that you just need Luke, Han and Leia to truly make Star Wars Star Wars. The characters in all the prequels including this one just go through the motions. Compare Padme to Leia. Leia is strong, and fights for the common good with devotion and love for humanity. An occasional smart-Alec line decorates her still loyal determination to the rebellion. Padme is basically in love with Anakin in this film still, and just naively lets Anakin decay into Darth Vader. She is constantly asking him to be more honest with her about everything, and just sits back and worries. Leai would join thfight. Padme just waits around and worries. I was worried she was gonna get suckered into suffering Anakin's fate. At least she has some sense. Yes, you do feel sad when Anakin becomes Darth Vader. It is is especially sad from the perspective of Obi-Wan, and even more so from the perspective of Padme. But I never really felt a great attachment to their romance entering the film, so there was not enough to feel. Still, Natalie Portman does her most with Padme. Not bad for a girl who admittedly grew up, hating Star Wars. Ewan McGregor is definitely Obi-Wan. Everythng about Obi-Wan you envision is in Ewan McGregor. There is a look of loyalty and devotion. And you know he is a character who is determined to preserving the good for all the galaxy. Hayden Crhistansen has shown he knows how to act. He is better off playing a dark, angry, and nearly insane character than he is at playing a winy teenager. And the ways in which you see Chancellor Palpatine seduce Anakin without him even knowing it is eerily appealing. The weakest character was General Grievous. And then, you have Yoda. He becomes interesting at then when he leaves, realizing that he has failed the Jedi council with Anakin, but he is mainly just a pawn in the film. He was exciting to watch fight, but was bland theatrically. There's no other way of putting it. In short though, all the characters just interact with each other to the minimal use. There is no real rapport you feel with with any of them. The action and visual effects were the best in this film. All the shots on Coruscant, Kashyyk, and in space were fabulous. Just give me some more lightsaber duals. The oh so anticipated dual between Obi-Wan and Anakin may not meet up to everyone's expectations, but how could it with that much hype? I mean the dual was quite intense though. The lava sequence, which ends in Anakin almost melting is truly awesome. And it does not get so ghoury, that they are trying to make this a PG-13 movie. The most disappointing fight was between Cont Dooku and Anakin/ Ob-Wan at the beginning. I won't spoil the film with details, but it lacked energy. That is the most I will say. All the battles in the fighters are solid. Do not expect ti be like those in the original trilogy. The republic has some new surprises to use. All in all, the film works. It is not to be classified alongside the original trilogy. Whatever happens, those were three remarkable pieces of film-making that will never be replicated. The force was stronger than ever with George from 1977-1983. But don't let that say that he can not still make a good movie. And now Lucas, I say bring on Indiana Jones IV.",7,2,4,19 May 2005
