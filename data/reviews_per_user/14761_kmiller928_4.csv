The Hangover," Maybe I just don't get it.....
","After hearing all of the hype about this movie, I couldn't wait to see it. To hear a movie being touted as the 'best reviewed comedy of the year', I was expecting a whole lot more than what I got. I have actually watched this movie more than once to see if maybe I had just missed something. I will admit, there were a few funny moments, but when I hear people say they 'laughed through the whole movie', it truly confuses me. I like to think of myself as someone who definitely has a great sense of humor and I truly appreciate many forms of comedy. I loved Old School, (also by Todd Phillips) but I don't see that this movie can even hold a candle to that flick. I found Ed Helms' acting to be horrible and I actually found his character annoying. Many of the jokes just fell flat. I really wanted to LOVE this movie, but that is not the case. It's not ALL bad... just not what I was hoping for.",1,16,31,17 January 2010
Twilight," Terrible adaptation of a mediocre book.
","I have a 12 year old stepdaughter who basically forced me to read the book. I was not all that impressed by the book and was hoping for a better movie. What a disappointment! I could barely sit through the movie, and the only thing that made it slightly tolerable was the 'decent' acting of Stewart and Pattinson.I would say wait to rent this pile of garbage, or maybe, just wait for cable. I'm not sure I would even waste the money renting the thing. I expected so much more with all the hype. Maybe New Moon will be better. I would think that a change of director would be in order. Get someone with a bit more experience.",1,9,34,7 January 2009
The Dark Knight," A Superb Flick
",My thanks to Christopher Nolan for not blowing it. The Dark Knight was by far the BEST movie I saw this year. I haven't yet been so pleased with a 'Superhero' movie. I walked away from this one with a big smile and chills. The acting was incredible and Heath Ledger's performance was a memorable one. He is by far the best movie villain to date. I came into this movie with low expectations (we all know how sequels go) but I left very impressed overall. I'm glad they got rid of the lifeless Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. I have been a fan of Maggie Gylenhaal since 'Secretary' and 'Donnie Darko'. Christian Bale definitely personifies all that Bruce Wayne/Batman is. What an AMAZING movie. It's too bad it probably won't see many nods at the Golden Globes or Oscars.,10,4,9,12 December 2008
Avatar," First time I've ever walked out of a movie....
","After all the hype surrounding Avatar, I was ready to be impressed. Boy, was I disappointed. The fact that this movie beat Inglourious Basterds at the Golden Globes is a travesty. Where is the substance in movies these days? Screenwriters are now allowed to pass off the same recycled garbage as a script and it is getting old. And apparently having a big flashy movie is all you need. Predictable, lame stories are the norm.I wanted to love this movie, but through the 1.5 hours i could actually stomach, I was bored to tears. This movie used any excuse to have some big stupid chase scene just because it looks cool. Avatar felt like it was chasing its own tail the whole time. If you want to see a visually stunning movie that does nothing to stimulate the mind... see Avatar. I personally wish I could have my 14 dollars back. Should have waited for DVD",1,9,18,30 January 2010
