It," Nick Bowers ruined it
","I give 5 stars for all the other actors and director. Pretty good film, I do have a few criticisms but after seeing the way nicholas bowers publicly humiliated someone on youtube for simply having HIS own opinion and criticisms, I'll refrain from giving mine for I do not wish to be posted on his twitter. Lost a lot of respect for the film as a whole after seeing this Nicholas kid have an arrogant temper tantrum over 1 criticism. I'm guessing this is first (and now i'm sure only) film he will be in after his diva behavior shadowing negative and snobby light on a film that is supposed to be anything but that. Stephen King himself has taken so much criticism and takes it like a man. This is partially (along with him being a writing GOD) why he's held onto such an amazing career for all these years. Sadly I will not be watching this movie again, and will not suggest it. The 5 stars are for the hard, incredible work of everyone else in the movie (and mostly for stephen!!!!) But i'll be sticking with my 90's original film <3",5,1,3,2 October 2017
