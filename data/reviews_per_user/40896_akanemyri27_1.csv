Requiem for a Dream," I'm mad I've watched this.
",Was I supposed to care about these characters? It's a movie about drug addicts and what they are capable of doing to get drugs and what drugs eventually do to people. I wasn't surprised their lives were destroyed. Why were they? This movie didn't change my opinion on anything. Drug addicts (and anyone involved in this business) are pathetic.,2,0,5,21 May 2020
