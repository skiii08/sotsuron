The Lobster," 'The Lobster' will leave you gasping for air!
","Ordinarily, I enjoy the unusual movie, not tailored to the general public, and have viewed many, many such films over the years. So, when I read about 'The Lobster' and thought it was worth viewing, inviting some friends to come along. They couldn't make it, and I'm so glad they didn't come; I would never be able to recommend another movie. 'The Lobster' begins with an interesting premise but runs out of gas, and the viewer's interest, about half way through. It begins in a strange world which is fine but ceases to be entertaining, interesting, or worthwhile fairly quickly. The director seems to lose his way once the scene shifts to the wood locale. The film goes from mildly offbeat to what? finally ending with 'are you kidding me?' When the movie ended the entire audience just sat there silent without moving. This is a movie I hope to forget as soon as possible I only hope that no one asks me about it so I won't have to admit I saw it. I'm sure the director, script writer, etc., have a message hidden in there but the overall effect is that of eating a bad meal; you hope to get it out of your system as quickly as possible.",1,31,49,26 June 2016
Mulholland Drive," That David Lynch is so funny!
","He has got to be kidding us with this movie. He is not Luis Bunuel. This is a movie that lures us in, pretends the character are human, at first slowly, then quickly, turns into a freak show. I do not recommend this except to serve as punishment. In order to accomplish this aim (whatever it may be called) David would need to have been much more skillful. Oh wait, there are people walking under my front door, I have to go and greet them!",2,1,5,27 August 2018
