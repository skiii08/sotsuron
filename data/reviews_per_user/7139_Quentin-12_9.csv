The Blair Witch Project," Movies at there best!
","I walked out of this movie not knowing what to think, a few of my friends were quessy from the stedicam work and my mind played for a question of wiether or not I had enjoyed this film.  It wasn't until this afternoon that I had an answer, I didn't like this film.  I LOVED IT.  There was so much to it - we saw it as a bad-camp video [you know what they are like] and we saw the characters as just that - real people as opposed to actors following a carefully monitered script.  We saw real emotions and all of the people involved in the production need to be commended greatly.  Not only is this the best horror/suspence film of our time it measures up as one of THEE best films in general.  All of the horror that this movie had to offer was the build-up and your after-thoughts.  The conclusion is perfect - see this movie as soon as you can.  It is amazing.  We should be seeing the name Blair Witch at the Oscars this year.",Null,1,2,2 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Another New Hope
","I went to this film not knowing what to expect - I didn't want to be overwhelmed as to expect too much, so instead I decided to just expect a Star Wars movie - and that is exactly what I got.  It very much lived up to the previous films and set a new standard for them - it is a different generation and different things are happening.  I will not talk of the end in case people are reading this before seeing it - but I felt it somewhat predictable.  Natalie Portman was excellent, and young Jake Llyod did very well for taking on such a valiant role as the ill-fated Anakin Skywalker. All in all this was an excellent film and those who are fans I implore you to watch it [there are many inside jokes to be accounted for], and for those who are not - you will learn to fall in love with the magic that is Star Wars.",Null,0,0,19 May 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Not what I expected - IT WAS GOOD!!!
","I was kinda forced into seeing this movie, and I've watched the odd episode of South Park so I knew that there would be the regular d**k and fart jokes that went along with that kind of humour.  But the whole time before the movie I couldn't stop thinking - how the hell are they gonna fill an hour and a half without getting boring and stupid - well, to my surprise they did it.  I was very impressed the way they handled a plot and their characters. Although the language was very profane [but then again what do you expect from a South Park movie], they knew that to impress the audience they had to cover some new offensive ground and boy did they ever do it - I believe that Mr. Garrison walked away with the best line referring to women and his fear of them due to PMS.  The movie clearly made fun of it's self with their cleaverly made 'Terrance and Phillip' those crazy canucks.  I am Canadian and so was the audience I was in and they loved it - there was some huge Canadain mocking but we're strong enough not to worry ABOOT it.  [inside joke].  The whole movie was a comedic attack on the parents that boycott the television series from their children, anyone who doesn't see this is definitly blind.  All in all it was definitly a worth seeing movie.  It was rude, tasteless, racist and offensive - everything an episode of South Park should be.",Null,0,0,4 July 1999
American Pie," A joyride of emotions and hormones.
","This was not the amazing comedy that it boasted to be.  It was very funny and had the lewd humor to it that was expected from it's previews but it had more depth to it.  An actual crafted plot.  What really saved the movie for me was that at the end the boys realized that sex wasn't all as important as they were making it out to be and called the pact off - then all went and had sex anyway.  I really liked the mini lesson on how you can never really prepare - it should just happen.  The montage at the end was beautifully crafted.  This is a funny date-movie.  There are some pretty gross sections in the movies - but you'll see them coming, it's just waiting for them to happen is what it is all about.  Eugene Levy was excellent in this as the Dad who wants to tell his son and seem cool at the same time.  Although highly unrealistic at times the film showed some the morals that all movies about students should - I'm not going to say what they are - you'll have to find them for yourself.",Null,0,0,10 July 1999
Titanic," How much crap will we put up with?
","How can we live in a world where a piece of *%^@ film like Titanic can even be considered for an Academy Award?  Now I understand that I must give some credit to Mr. Cameron for spending WAY too much on minor details (such as the ships's engine) which could have easily been avoided.  This is the obvious case of a man who needs to spend as much money as possible for publicity? Anyone remember the last time that stunt was pulled?  It was called 'Waterworld' - and was equally as bad and chessy.  The only difference was that 'Waterworld' did not take place around a real event - and that is the ONLY reason Titanic won Best Picture, oh and how I can forget the ludicrous special effects!!!  In my humble opionion no film that isn't at least nominated for Best Screenplay should be able to take home the Best Picture award.  Mr. Cameron must have written his script after an inspiration of something he saw floating in a toilet.  I'm sorry to say this Mr. Oscar, but you've lost my respect.",Null,5,9,19 February 1999
The Green Mile," The Gospel According to Steven King and Frank Darabont...
","First off I must say that this was, hands down, an amazing film - there can be no argument about that.  Beautifully acted, directed and written, now all of that aside can this movie be seen as anything other than a re-telling of the New Testament set in a prison???  John Coffey, first off let's look at the man's initial's for starters, excluding the fact that Paul (Tom Hanks) tells us that he's God's mircale worker, it looks pretty obvious as to the real identity of who Michael Duncan was playing :).  Next we have the apostle, aka prison gaurds, with Paul playing the role of Peter, who denies John Coffey the chance at freedom three times - and his punishment is to watch everyone die. (which I found to be the high point of the film).  Our beloved mouse-killer Percy is Judas, and Wild Bill and the french guy that owned Mr. Jingles were the two criminals that died with Jesus on the mountain - one of who asks for forgiveness, the other who doubts him.  Now as for Mr. Jingle - is he perhaps God himself?  Who knows....  This movie is hands down the #1 film of the year so far, still waiting for 'Man on the Moon' to open - Hanks was stellar but not Oscar worthy - defintly up to par with 'Shawshank' it not only meets Darabont's previous attempt, but destroys it.",Null,0,0,19 December 1999
The Matrix," The first step of a brilliant saga.
","The first thing I had to say after this movie was completed was Wow.  For a film that took five years to make it seems almost worth it when you view the finished product.  A very intelligent sci-fi / action flick.  Morpheus reminded me of an old high-school teacher I once had, the way he spoke in metaphors.  From rumours I've heard it's to be the first part of an electrifying trilogy.  I hope to see more from these two brothers in the future.  It gave us hints of Star Wars and also the Bible - which is a strange conjunction.  A good movie.",Null,0,0,10 April 1999
The Breakfast Club," 'There's nothing to do when you're locked in a vacancy'
","The Breakfast Club opens with a simple quote from David Bowie that talks about the way that the youth are treated.  This is what the generality of the movie is about.  I love this movie, as should everyone that ever went to highschool.  John Hughs clearly lays out five stereotypes that are given in every educational institute.  The way the movie progresses is brilliant, the characters don't sell out to each other and their are no false emotions. These people spend a whole day together and speak of their greatest humiliations and talk about stuff they normally wouldn't, and then when a simple question is asked.  'Will we still be friends on Monday, if we're friends now that is?'.  This gives the perfect set-up for a cheesy hollywood ending, but the characters are true to themselves and their stereotypes.The scene with the janitor and Vernon is outstanding as he learns that if he keeps up his attitude towards students that there will be no one to look after him in his old age, we learn so much from these students: humanity, humilty, trust... it's a film for the ages. This movie will stand the test of time, and I'm glad that it is one that proves that you don't need big expensive sets and outragious special effects, all you need is a good story with good people to tell it - that is the fundamental of film and John Hughes has caught it in his 1:45 min of running time, I just wish he would make more movies like this and leave the Home Alone series to hacks like it should be.  This is THE HIGHSCHOOL movie. Never pass up the chance to see it.",Null,0,1,18 June 1999
Born on the Fourth of July," What was anyone thinking? Is garbage the new excellence peak?
","What is everyone thinking that praises this movie as an outstanding masterpiece?  This was not some great movie about the GREAT Americans, weither Stone meant it to be or not I'll tell you what this movie was about. This movie was about some trigger-happy war loving kid who wanted nothing more than to defend his country, without even looking into it he goes to 'see some action' and then, after he gets paralized and realizes that his life doesn't mean anything he starts to get mad.  But who does he get mad at?  Not himself.  He gets mad because people 'lied' to him... the answers were there if he would have looked for them.  Instead he's wheeling around for the whole movie feeling sorry for himself and expecting someone to give him a helping hand when it's his own fault.  No one MADE him go to war.  No one MADE him take that second bullet.  And instead of getting on with his life and accepting that HE made a mistake he expects people to feel sorry for himself.  His friend offers him a legit job and he pretty much spits it in his face.  And where does this climax [that takes WAY too long] end up? With him going out to make a speech that we never hear.  This movie is a far cry from being anything close to outstanding, and unless Stone was going for what I've said in this review than he failed miserably much like some of his other pictures.",Null,3,5,10 October 1999
