The Blair Witch Project," try to ignore the hype and just keep an open mind.
","First, I feel like I have to address the buzz surrounding the movie. I am at the same time disgusted and sort of impressed with the hype. It is pretty clever when you think about it. No trailers (well, they are showing one now, but still, it took them long enough) no cast members doing the rounds on talk shows, no big budget, etc. Just the website, the documentary on the SciFi channel, and bigtime word of mouth. It sure worked. I feel for those actors, since they got paid about what I make in 2 weeks for 3 weeks of hell.  I hope to God the filmmakers were generous and gave them points in the film. I am also hearing that at most theaters, they pay the manager, etc to get up before the showing and get the crowd all hyped up, which is kind of lame. When we saw it Saturday, the owner (before she threatened people who had laser pointers) got up and yelled, 'Hey, welcome to Crossroads theater, and ARE YA READY FOR THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT?? Whooooo-hoooo! Everyone READY TO BE SCARED?' I was like, oh please. I also heard these girls in front of me asking someone next to them if **this was a real documentary**. We got up and moved because I did not want to spend the movie sitting behind someone so incredibly stupid and naive. But I guess that's what a good job they did marketing it, because I heard there are plenty of stupid people out there who think the thing is real.  I also grudgingly admire whoever decided to market it initially as a 'hard ticket', meaning they wanted to have it only at one theater or so per city for a few weeks. I'm sure that helped the buzz.  Hyping it as the scariest movie of all time (though maybe this is more word of mouth than the filmmakers doing it) is kind of dumb, though, because people are just going to be disapointed, unless all they've seen are 'Scream' and 'I Know What You Did Last Summer'. I heard kids talking after the movie who were let down because they was very little gore, no monster, and no real pay-off. I had a good time because I told myself not to expect anything. I guess if you go, just keep an open mind, and don't think, 'This better be the scariest movie of all time after all the hype, or I'll be p**sed'. I do think it's kind of funny how the big studios spend millions of dollars marketing their lame summer 'event' pics, but this is the one most people are talking about wanting to see.
So, that's my 2 cents as far as the hype goes.  Went and saw BWP for myself this weekend.  Inside the theater manager had to come make an announcement about laser pointers, she said if anyone used them during the movie she'd take them away and kick them out. She was this huge, burly, tough woman who looked like a prison warden so people calmed down after that and shut up.  Anyway, I loved it. Not the scariest movie I've ever seen, but if you asked me what the scariest movie I've ever seen was, I wouldn't be able to name it. I would saw BWP, the Exorcist, Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer, Last House on the Left (and a couple more I can't think of right now) are like the top scariest.  I was really impressed though. Very realistic, the way it was shot and put together, and the character's reactions to stuff. My spouse said it really scared him, which he hardly ever says, because he's been camping and that's like your worst nightmare. The whole movie was very creepy and spooky but the last 5 minutes REALLY scared the crap out of me.It's funny, the audience started out very rowdy, and I thought I'd have to 'shhh' people the whole movie. But after the first 5 minutes, people were engrossed. As the film got more and more tense and scary, there were no screams. Instead, the whole audience just sat there cowering quietly in fear. Not a lot of talking back to the screen, etc like there is in most horror movies, and the audience was full of teenagers. That speaks for itself, I think.I read a review in which they said that the movie was all about panic, and I agree. One of the most upsetting things is the way the charcters go from calm, controlled, and joking, to nervously joking and then arguing, to trying desperately to hold it together, to understandable total freaked out panic by the last reel. As the film draws to a close they just give up all pretenses of composure and control and just panic and run around like maniacs screaming incoherently at the top of their lungs. Usually when characters in a movie do that you feel like slapping them, but the film draws you in so much that you do not blame them, one bit. You know you would probably act the same way if you were in their shoes, and the way the movie is filmed, you are pretty much in their shoes.Bottom line regarding how scary it is: If I'd been watching it by myself at home at night I probably would have started crying.",Null,1,1,2 August 1999
Requiem for a Dream," Good Lord!
","I was tempted to title this 'Drugs are bad, mm'kay?' because 'Requiem' was so sad I was desperate to inject some humor. Man, what a sad, scary, excellent, grim, disturbing, well-made movie. The more I read about RFAD and learned, the more fascinating it seemed. I'm one of those people who, upon hearing a movie is extremely shocking, has a burning urge to see it as fast as possible to see if it shocks me (especially unrated or NC-17), since I'm pretty jaded. So, I eagerly anticipated seeing it.Unfortunately, I read so much about the making of the movie that I knew a little too much about the plot going in, so there were few plot surprises. 'Requiem' concerns four addicts. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly play a young loving couple, Harry and Marion, who dabble in heroin and plan to make a big sale with their friend Tyrone (Shawn Wayans) so they can be set for life and Marion can start her own business. Their recreational drug use turns into day-to-day addiction, and things start to get ugly. VERY ugly. Ellen Burstyn plays Harry's mother Sarah, a lonely widow who wants to lose weight to fit into a red dress to appear on her favorite TV show. She starts out addicted to TV and candy, but has the bad luck to visit a doctor who-in what I thought was the only unrealistic aspect-gives her an RX for 'diet pills', that turn out to be speed. I say unrealistic because, as anyone who's ever worked in the medical profession knows, few doctors will write a new patient a huge prescription for extremely powerful, addictive controlled substances without even an exam.I found her story thread the most memorable and heartbreaking. Sarah takes her pills and starts losing weight, plus suddenly becoming energetic and chatty. Like any addictive drug, her happy blue pills stop working after prolonged use, so she ups her dose more...and more...and things slowly start getting very weird and scary. In one of the best scenes midway through, Harry visits her --the only visit where he doesn't openly steal her TV to pawn for dope. He's briefly riding high (in more ways than one) and announces he bought her a big-screen TV; he wanted to do something nice for her and figured out that 'TV is her fix'. He looks uneasy when she's babbling happily about how she has a reason to get up in the morning, then he hears her grinding her teeth, and figures it out ...the first time in the movie you see real fear in his eyes. Sarah soon starts having very scary strung-out hallucinations-starting out with subtle things like time woozily slowing down and speeding back up, and when her refrigerator suddenly starts moving on its own, the real nightmare begins. An aggressive fridge may sound Monty Python-esque now, but trust me, you won't be smiling by the end of the movie.One review I read said that the movie not only pulls the rug out from under you, it drags you and the rug down a long flight of stairs into a very dark basement. Another reviewer compared the experience of watching the film to a drug, and that's not too far off the mark either. Whenever a character gets high, there's a slam-bang fast-cut montage of the same images over and over; a sigh, a pupil dilating, cells changing color. The description I probably agree with most came from Aronofsky himself; he compared the film to a jump from a plane without a parachute, and the movie ends three minutes after you hit the ground. The last few minutes that show the gruesome, depressing, worst-case-scenario fates of all four characters are just as intense, hard to watch, and nightmarish as I heard they were. I don't think I will ever forget Harry's mother's transformation from a harmless, plump, friendly older woman to someone so frightening looking that people cringe away in fear and revulsion at the sight of her.My only complaints would be that I wished there was more time for character development. The film is divided into 3 segments, Summer (things going fine, having fun getting high) Fall (the beginning of the downhill slide) and Winter (end of the line). I would've liked more scenes of what these people and their lives were like before addiction, as well as their relationships with each other. The cast is stellar- Wayans shows that he has the most range and talent of the Wayans bros- I laughed so hard at him in Don't Be A Menace that I ended up buying it, but here ...wow. I would've liked to see more of his character. I never liked Leto much before, but he's excellent and also almost unrecognizable (he dropped 1/5 of his weight for the role and oh, it shows). Connelly I actively disliked before, but I was very impressed and now know she can act. Burstyn gives the performance of a lifetime- not only convincing, but dedicated enough to let the filmmakers make her look like absolute and total hell; few actresses over 55 would probably be as fearless.Not recommended if you're easily shocked, squeamish, or upset. If you only like movies that take you to a happy place, stay away. Everyone who left the movie theater looked like they had just been hit over the head with a very large board, and we all who knew what we were getting into. Recommended for those who want to see a movie that will completely overtake you and involve you emotionally. In addition, this film should be required viewing for everyone in the fashion industry that supported/glorified that whole 'heroin chic' crap. Also a good movie if you are having some problems in your life and want to put them in perspective VERY fast. 9 out of 10 stars. I'll probably never look at my fridge quite the same again...",Null,220,264,17 November 2000
Erin Brockovich," Not bad for a Julia Roberts movie
","As you can tell, I am not the world's biggest Julia Roberts fan. I don't hate her guts, or anything, but I generally don't see movies she's in unless they got very good reviews.When I first saw trailers for this movie, I was like, oh please. Not only was it a Julia Roberts Vehicle, but there was the extra insult of having it be a big novelty that she played a sorta white-trashy, tough-talking, skanky dressing character. Oh, what a departure! Then I read lots of great reviews from reviewers I trusted, and thought again.I don't think she gives an Oscar-worthy performance, but she did just fine in the role. Erin Brokovich is a single mother who may not have the best social skills, or fashion sense, but her heart is in the right place and she refuses to tolerate injustice when she sees it. Plus, I know how it feels to be in such a b*tchy mood that you can't help wanting to use the f-word in every sentence. She has mouths to feed at home, so she gets a job at a small law firm, and stumbles upon a situation where a large corporation has made a huge mistake, and is being weaselly trying to get out of it.The fact that this movie is based on a true story and the main character based on a real life person really helps. Part of what turned me off in the first place was the fact that I thought the filmmakers made Julia Robert's character dress really trampy just to get attention. Now, I do think they over-do it in parts-no intelligent woman walks around in public with 90% of their bra exposed. Dressing sexy is one thing, but in real life, women know better than to wear a top that is so hideously mismatched with a bra that you like like you were dressed by a blind person. Also, the main character is not perfect- though her cursing is entertaining, she goes too far in some cases. We all have felt like using 4 -letter words to some of the people we word with to their face, but adults don't do this on a regular basis-or if they do, they are looking for a new job very quickly. Aaron Eckhardt is great in the role of the supportive, yet put-upon biker boyfirend. So nice to see him play a character that is likeable!A great movie, very entertaining, and actually makes you think that sometimes in life, hard work is rewarded and people get what they deserve-very satisfying.",Null,1,2,3 November 2000
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," I laughed so hard my stomach hurt the next day
","This is the hardest I've laughed at a movie I saw in the theater in literally years. I expected it to be pretty good, but it was even better. Though I don't get Comedy Central, I've seen about half the episodes on video and read the scripts for them all, and have always laughed my butt off at the incredible bad taste and Cartman's voice. (it's the WAY he says stuff). And yes, I am a grown woman. It's too bad the idiots at the MPAA wouldn't let them go with the original title, 'All Hell Breaks Loose' as it would have been more appropriate to the plot and tone. As I'm sure you've read, Parker and Stone told the MPAA, pretty much as a joke because they never expected them to go for it, to change the title to the present one, and the MPAA didn't get the joke and said it was OK. The songs were great, and didn't slow the movie down as I thought they would. I especially liked, 'It's Easy Mmmmkay' and 'Uncle F*cka' but my all time favorite number was 'Kyle's Mom is a B*tch' as performed by Cartman, this time with a couple of extra languages thrown in. I laughed so hard and loud at this that I had to put my hand over my mouth, because I was actually worried that someone would complain to the usher. And Cartman's one-word reaction (which I can't print here, partially because of the profanity and partly because it will be funnier if you don't know it's coming)at the end of the song when he turns around and sees that Kyle's Mom is actually standing behind him and has heard the last verse had the whole audience cheering and clapping. Speaking of audience reaction, the only time the audience cheered more strongly was when Bill Gates is shot. I saw the movie in Seattle and you should have heard the crowd go nuts! So besides the movie being hilarious, it's actually well thought-out (I thought) and had care put into it. Man, would I love to see the parts they cut out, considering the stuff they got away with! My only complaint was that it was too short, and that the insane school bus driver was not in it-I missed her. I also was grateful my least favorite South Park character, Mr. Hankey, did not make an appearance. I plan to see it again in the theater at least once, and then buy it on video. Oh, and don't feel guilty if you were the only one laughing at 'Operation Human Shield'. Though you could practically hear the jaws dropping, every single person in the theater laughed their guts out at that (and cheered for Chef's revenge). I can't say enough good things about this movie, or describe how funny it is--you have to see it to beleive it. Unless you're Mr or Ms P.C. in which case stay away--though who knows, even people who need to lighten up might find themselves hating themselves for laughing at this movie. I give it 10 out of 10 stars.",Null,0,0,9 July 1999
American Beauty," Could be the best movie of the year.
","And there were a lot of great ones this year. I will also say something even (possibly) bolder--that Kevin Spacey gives the performance of his career. And all us movie geeks know that is saying a LOT, given this man's past roles, and his talent. I used to think he was overrated as an actor. Then I figured OK, I see what all the fuss is about. Now, he's up there with my favorite actors of all time, with James Woods, Steve Buscemi, Robert Deniro...probably in the top 5. I was lucky enough to see a free screening this afternoon and boy, am I glad I had the privilege. In fact, this review might not even be that coherent- it's one of those movies that blows you away so much that you have trouble even putting your feelings into words. The plotline sounds trite when you first describe it (it did to me when I first heard about it), Spacey plays a man who describes himself as a loser, with Annette Bening as his horrible, shrewish, self-absorbed, pathetic b*tch of a wife. His daughter is not all that likeable either, despite the fact that you can understand why she turned out this way, with her as a mother. Just when you think you've met the most dysfunctional family in the world outside of 'Happiness', you find out about the family who just moved in next door. At first, the strange son seems like the most messed-up member of their brood, but after you get to meet his ex-military, abusive, homophobic, terrifying father and his withdrawn, sad, headcase mother, you realize he is the most normal member of the household by far. Then, the filmwriters toss in Kevin Spacey's lustful obsession with his daughter's sexkitten cheerleader friend, which trust me, is a lot more fun, entertaining, and amusing than it sounds when you read about it. Soon, he is having the most entertaining, amusing midlife crisis ever seen in the history of cinema. He just doesn't give a ***k about what he does or says anymore, and you only wish you could get away with doing the things he does.I found myself laughing out loud in this movie so many times, most of it horrified, amazed laughter at what is happening and the things that are coming out of the character's mouths, especially Spacey's. He had at least a dozen lines that had every member of the audience in hysterics and actual applause and cheers. I can't say enough good things about this movie. You think, after the first five minutes, that you know how the movie will end. Well, Spacey's opening narrative does give it away, but trust me, the events unfold in a way that you will NEVER see coming. You will swear you can see what a character is going to do next, what violent or self-destructice act they will commit, but you turn out to be wrong.Without getting too pretentious here, the movie lives up to it's theme/tagline of '...look closer'. THe characters are not what they seem, up until the end, and even then they surprise you. At least two characters that you are POSITIVE you have figured out, do or say something that turns all your preconceptions of them upside down, while making your jaw drop, and your heart ache. You will leave the movie with a smile, though, and that is maybe what I expected least of all.Words just cannot do this movie justice. See it for yourself.",Null,163,217,16 September 1999
Edward Scissorhands," I will never forget this movie
","I am a huge Tim Burton fan, and love all of his movies and own them, have watched them at least 10 times each, and each one is really special to me (I know how dorky that sounds) but this is the one I am the most emotional about. I can't think of any other movie that has made me cry as often during the course of the movie, or as hard.  When I saw it in the theater, I wasn't just tearing up, I was sobbing by the end. During the scene where Vincent Price (God I miss him) perfectly cast as 'The Inventor' tells Edward he has a special present for him and hold up a pair of perfect hands, only to slip away at the last moment, I looked around the 3rd time I saw in the theater, and literally everyone in the theater was choked up if not outright crying, including grown men. If I ever want to cry on demand, all I have to do is simply *remember* the last scene of the movie, and the last few lines uttered by the storyteller, and I tear up. Just pulling up the image of Ryder, spinning around in the 'snow' dreamily, can still bring tears to my eyes 9 years later. I think this is the only movie I've seen where I actually had to sit there all through the credits trying to pull it together because I couldn't stop crying. My friend and I were still sniffling walking out of the theater. Other women out there: this is not a movie to watch when you have PMS, not unless you want to totally break down in a sobbing, emotional heap. I was reading the transcript on the internet during my dinner break at work last month and started tearing up right at my desk, and I wasn't even in an emotional mood when I started reading it. There's so many great things about this movie-- Tim Burton is a genius, plain and simple, and the art direction is brilliant. His vision of suburbia is great, with rows and rows of identical, colorful 50's style tract houses and flawless green lawns. The imagery will stick with you long after the movie is over; for instance, the shot of the little girl, getting told a bedtime story (the film's framing device) in a huge, oversized bed, almost buried in all the quilts and pillows, or the inventor's workshop, with an assembly line pumping out gingerbread men. Elfman does do his best work (other than Beetlejuice).  Winona Ryder and Johnny Depp were a couple at the time the movie was made, deeply in love, and it shows. It actually hurts to look at them, and Ryder, even with a horrible blonde wig, is stunningly beautiful and radiant. Just the way they look at each other, the longing in both their eyes, the tenderness when she says, 'Hold me' and Edward replies sadly, 'I can't', so Kim (Ryder) lovingly wraps her arms around him instead-- it gets me every time. All the casting is great (Vincent Price, especially -- obviously, Tim Burton got his dream cast for this one). Anyone who has ever felt like an outsider, or lonely, or longed for someone they know they will probably never end up with, will be touched deeply. (Starcrossed lovers always get to me). Yeah, I know. This all sounds very corny, but this movie is really in a class by itself.",Null,0,0,12 November 1999
The Exorcist," What 'possessed' me to watch this movie after dark by myself?
","I'm not kidding. I am a grown woman, have seen hundreds of horror movies, and even watching this in the middle of the day when it was sunny outside it gave me chills. In fact, a couple of scenes (like the head spinning) scared me so bad I almost started to CRY. I saw this movie on TV when I was in high school and for some reason it scared me WAY more now. The documentary was excellent, and I finally got to see the notorious 'spiderwalk' scene that was cut out. I wanted to see this part for a long time, ever since I heard about it, but I didn't think I'd get to because I don't have a DVD player. I was thrilled that it was included, but YEEEESH it gave me the creeps. I think it was a great idea to remaster the sound, as the sound is one of the most frightening aspects of the movie. It rightly deserved the 1973 Academy Award for best sound. Her voice is creepy enough, but these horrible animal-like sounds come out of this little girl that make every hair on your body stand on end. I also didn't think upon a second viewing that I would find any scenes shocking as it takes a lot to shock me, and I am not exaggerating. Well, the scene with the crucifix made my jaw drop and I had to cover up my eyes, I couldn't watch! ( if you are easily shocked I would seriously recommend either fast-forwarding or NOT looking during this scene). What's also interesting in the documentary is hearing about how rough a shoot it was. Evidently Friedkin is not very well-liked by most of the actors who have worked with him, and you will find out they have good cause for this. But I have to admit, he got results, and this is one hell of a movie.",Null,0,0,20 July 1999
Resident Evil," Whoa
","I can't compare the game to the movie that well, since I've only played the game once or twice in the arcade and didn't last very long before I got eaten. (Check the trivia section on the IMDB if you want more info on that, though beware of many spoilers) I don't know if the game has any more of a backstory than the DVD box did: a virus is accidentally unleashed at an underground biological research facility that turns all the employees, lab animals, and experiments into flesh-eating undead. A rescue team discovers too late they are stuck in there with them; they have 3 hours to get out without getting eaten or, worse, infected  before the Red Queen' master computer permanently shuts down all the exits.On the negative side, it was a little longer than an action movie needs to be-- 10 minutes could have been trimmed, I caught myself wanting to hit forward and skip scenes in the first half hour of people wandering warily around deserted areas. I've never wanted to do that with a Romero movie. It does take a little too long to get going, but when the action kicks in, trust me, it doesn't let up, to the point where I felt kind of battered after the movie-- really unrelenting. I couldn't stand the industrial/techno soundtrack, but then I don't usually listen to bands with song titles like Fistf*ck' and `My Plague (New Abuse Mix)'. I guess it was appropriate for the movie, I didn't exactly expect, say, Oingo Boingo (though that would have been kind of cool, now that I think of it) but it was grating after a while. Several shots were extremely derivative of Romero, but since I haven't watched the featurettes or commentaries, I'm not sure if the filmmakers intended them as a tribute/in-joke (like the newspaper headline blowing around a deserted street proclaiming THE DEAD WALK, always great to see in any movie) or just ripped them off with the plan to say they were inspired by' the other movie if anyone pointed out the similarities.
The end seemed to be setting up for a sequel (according to the IMDB, one is planned but not even in pre-production), though at least not in an extremely cliched way, and it mainly irritated me because it was a cliffhanger. There's also several CGI shots where the monster looks about as realistic as the one in the actual game; I did not for a moment forget I was watching CGI, and it was VERY easy to tell where the animatronics ended and the CGI began in several key scenes.OK, enough of what didn't work. On the plus side, Milla Jovovich has proven herself to be one of the few genuinely talented model-turned-actresses, and gives a great performance. I was kind of disappointed in Michelle Rodriguez's acting, mainly because she was so good in Girlfight, but she was acceptable and at least can really look like a badass. There's quite a few fun--and sick--shots. There were plot twists that I actually didn't see coming--sorry to say, I could see most of the jumps walking up 5th Avenue-- and the plot was a lot more brutal and downbeat than I expected (for a movie based on a video game, and for a modern zombie movie, anyway)--good for them. They did definitely outright steal some ideas from Dawn of the Dead (and, as everybody has already probably pointed out, Cube) but at least had some originality by putting a slightly new twist on them. There was a much higher body count than I thought (not counting all the zombie employees, of course, I mean among the heroes), most of which was pretty ballsy. Characters did not die in the order I expected them to. Things got pretty cold-blooded (so to speak).I'd recommend it for a rental, if you want a mindless, scary action movie with some real suspense. You could do a lot worse (like rent the director's Mortal Kombat, for instance) Not bad for a mainstream studio movie based on a game.",Null,1,1,15 August 2002
Man on the Moon," Good for what it was
","I went to see this not because I am a big Kaufman or Carrey fan (though Carrey can be hilarious, and I did think Kaufman did a killer Elvis and a couple amusing routines)but because I liked The People VS Larry Flynt, and I love biopics, and it was well reveiwed, and the trailers looked good...plus I wanted to see the cast of Taxi playing themselves!When I say 'good for what it was', I mean as good as a biopic can be of Kaufman, who most people only know as Latka Gravas (sp?) died very young (sadly)and seemed to have a limited, cult following. Jim Carrey obviously threw himself into the role and gave it everything he had, and did a dead-on impression of him. But I guess I am one of the few people who couldn't forget that I was watching Carrey do a dead-on Kaufman, and also thought from time to time, 'Edward Norton resembled him much more'. Carrey is just too good-looking (he is a really handsome guy, when he's not making some horrible face) though he obviously gained weight, looked as unattractive as possible, etc. There was just the usual problem that biopics have, where you can't help but notice that the person playing them is much better looking ( though there are some exceptions to this rule). That being said, I still had a great time, and am not sorry I went to see it- I was quite entertained. (though I wish they'd included his sobbing-playing-the-bongos routine). A good movie to see on Christmas Eve like we did, with the Carnegie Hall scene and all, and it did actually make me teary. DeVito was great as his frustrated manager. Courtney Love was in it less than I thought, fortunately. SO, to sum up, though I'm not a big fan of Kaufman, (don't dislike him, just can take him or leave him) I recommend it for the performances and filmmaking. Also, it was fun seeing the cast of Taxi back in their old roles-Marilu Henner was the only one who couldn't pull off being 20 years younger (not trying to be catty- I really did think she'd look about the same, but it was obvious she'd lost weight and had some 'work' done on her face). There were some very funny scenes, and some touching ones - not a bad way to spend a few hours. But I don't think it was Oscar-worthy. For a nomination, maybe, but I'd still like to see Spacey get it. Yeah, I know, real bold choice on my part, but that's just my opinion.",Null,0,0,28 December 1999
Detroit Rock City," I liked this movie better the first time I saw it...
","...when it was called 'Rock N Roll High School'.I still am not sure whether the moviemakers meant this as a 'tribute' or just a ripoff. Before I even saw the movie, I saw the poster and trailers, and figured it out. I could go on and on about the similarities, but if you've seen RRHS you know exactly what I mean, if you haven't, you probably are already mad at me and stopped reading. I'm not a big KISS fan, so I didn't get into that part. It was worth a matinee though. The kids who played Trip and Lex were especially good, the kid who played Jam got on my nerves for some reason, just the guy's face.
On the negative side, the movie had some pretty predicible moments. There was some gross-out humor that was unnessacary, just nasty and seemed tossed in to jump on the recent trendy grossout bandwagon. The movie ended too suddenly. The 70's retro stuff was a little too contrived. (I hate when they go out of their way to mention and show 8 track tapes and happy face logos, etc) Most of the ideas were stolen from Rock-N-Roll High School. Edward Furlong just sorta gives me the creeps for some reason, maybe I read too much about his personal life and it affected how I see him even when he's acting. The dialogue needed work. Stupid Blair Witch Project take-off print ads.On the plus side, there were lots of twists to the plot that I didn't expect. There were a few Ramones songs used to great effect on the soundtrack (the more I think of it, the more I think the filmmakers, or someone involved anyway, were Ramones fans). Lex is a dead ringer for Dee Dee Ramone in the late 70's. The kid who played Trip was pretty talented and funny. Good period detail and costumes. Cameo by Ron Jeremy (another trend lately, but so far it hasn't been run into the ground yet). Some good laughs, and some satisfying moments. You do feel for these kids and want them to get in to the show...we all can identify how bad we wanted to see our favorite band live in high school. And hey, it's not supposed to be Citizen Kane, so why not go and enjoy yourselves? You could do worse.I could see how this would be, like, the ultimate movie to a KISS fan, just like Rock and Roll High School is to a Ramones fan. But let's face it, if RRHS had never been made, the filmmakers defintely wouldn't have come up with this movie on their own.",Null,2,5,23 August 1999
The Sixth Sense," Surpassed my expectations- (SPOILER, though slightly subtle)
","My expectations weren't too high- I saw a matinee, just wanted it to be mildly entertaining. I had seen BWP a few weeks before and thought it was creepy, but overhyped, and not the scariest movie of all time like everyone said. I had friends who said they almost cried BWP scared them so bad. Well, there's one of many moments in this (there's so many that just made every hair on my body stand on end, my skin crawl, and made me actually gasp- and I can say that movies that only have 1 or 2 moments like that, I can probably only name 10 or so) I won't give the end away, but the moment that starts out with the  kid appearing to Cole and whispering excitedly, 'Come on, I'll show you where my Dad keeps his gun'- that one moment, to me, was 10 times scarier than all of BWP put together. There were many times where I jumped, and it wasn't just a 'fake' jump, it was something clever that I genuinely didn't see coming. As far as The Twist, first of all, I've decided when it's hyped that a movie HAS a twist ending, that's a drag right there, because you-well, I do anyway--spend at least half the time trying to guess the twist. Having seen a hell of a lot of movies, and a hell of a lot of twists, I usually get it 9 times out of 10. (BEGIN MINOR SPOILER) I guessed the twist in Jacob's Ladder, so...and it was already spoiled because I read a review that DIDN'T give a warning, but said, 'If you've seen Jacob's Ladder and Angelheart, you'll see this one coming a mile away'(END) I'm pretty much the spoiler queen, it's like heroin or something, maybe 1% of the time I can resist reading them, I don't know what it is. If I had to pick any movie where I could go back and not know the spoiler ahead of time, this would be it. My husband didn't see it coming, and he's pretty clever about guessing them too. Something else I did not see coming was how emotional this movie made me. I had a friend die on me without getting to say goodbye but was over my grieving, and if you've recently experienced the death of someone close to you (especially if you are not finished grieving) then in all seriousness, please think twice before you watch it. During the second to last scene in the car, I surprised myself by starting to cry, hard, and I didn't stop until the credits were partway over (and Bruce Willis is not one of my favorite actors). GOD that scene in the car got to me. Re-reading the screenplay, I realized even more how great it was, and how heartbreaking. There are so many elements that just make your heart wrench. I read the last scenes of the screenplay at home, alone, and had a really good cry, which hasn't happened since I read the screenplay to The Green Mile. Aside from that, again, this movie scared the crap out of me. The premise is very scary but they could have handled it in a way that bungled it up, but they did it just right. Even if you *really* don't like Bruce Willis' acting, and were turned off by the trailer, give it a chance. But don't be surprised if you need to sleep with the light on.",Null,0,0,3 December 1999
