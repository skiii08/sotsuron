E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," An alien gets lost in earth and meets a boy who befriends him and they have adventures together.
","I think this is Spielberg's best movie. I have been watching this film for almost 24 years. I never tire of it, when E.T's family come down to earth and forget to wait for E.T who wondered off a little too far. He walks around and Eliot Aka Henry Thomas finds him in the shed while he's playing baseball. He tries to see him so people don't think he's crazy, he finds the creature loves sweets, he led the alien to his room. He gets to know the creature and shows him all his things and feeds him, they become the best of friends. He tells his big brother Aka Robert MacNaughton and little sister Aka Drew Barrymore they kept him in secret. E.T misses his family, and they find he wants to phone home, E.T couldn't use a normal phone. He had to make a connection toy to call home, he collected everything he will need and they went to the forest and set everything up. They waited and waited. E.T became very sick and so did Eliot, they were both dying and rushed to hospital. Luckily Eliot and E.T survived. The boys decide to take E.T back to his spaceship where he called his family. Everyone says goodbye as E.T goes home. There are some great scenes which Henry Thomas and E.T are saying goodbye and it expresses how much E.T means to the boy aka Henry Thomas and how much E.T loves Eliot. IT was a unique story of friendship a special unique one between two people and of course of loneliness and never to take anything fo granted because you never know when you may lose them.",10,2,4,30 January 2006
