Vertigo," The best ever? The best Hitch ever?
","A lot of people seem to think so. I see people, here, calling this the best movie ever; or, if not that, at the very least, the best movie Hitchcock ever made. To call 'Vertigo' the best movie ever is, of course, quite laughable. And as far as it being Hitchcock's best, I judge it to be only about his 4th or 5th best (my personal favorite is 'North by Northwest,' truly one of the best movies ever). Based on these comments, one might assume that I don't much like it. Right? Au contraire! I think it is a very good movie, one not far removed from excellent. But it does have flaws, minor though they be.First and foremost, 'Vertigo' is a FABULOUS travelogue for late-1950s San Francisco and environs (including Muir Woods in Marin County and Mission San Juan Bautista, 100 miles south of San Francisco). At the time of the filming, I was a high school sophomore in San Francisco. I well remember the film company coming to town to shoot the movie, though I never saw any scenes actually being shot. What I do know is that the movie is most evocative of the San Francisco of that era.The plot? It's good, I've seen better. Its weakest link is when Scottie (James Stewart) 'loses' Madeleine (Kim Novak), or so he thinks, then accidentally 'finds' Judy (Madeleine's alter ego -- also Kim) on the streets of downtown San Francisco. I realize that movies often have to have coincidences in order to make their plots work. That said, 'Vertigo' has to take a grading markdown for this ridiculously coincidental Madeleine-cum-Judy plot device in order to make this story work. Having lived so many years in San Francisco, I know how difficult it would be -- make that impossible! -- to find one specific person on a downtown street, ESPECIALLY when you're not even looking for that person in the first place. That's how difficult and coincidental it would have been for Scottie to actually 'find' Judy. I also didn't care for the way the character Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes) was handled. Was she or was she not Scottie's 'love interest' before Madeleine entered the picture? She starts out as a major character, then gradually fades away and by the end of the picture, she has disappeared completely, as if she were never even in the movie. True, Scottie becomes more and more obsessed with Madeleine/Judy, but let's at least let Midge hang in to the bitter end as the crushed girlfriend -- or something!    Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak. The former is my favorite actor -- EVER!!! -- so you know I have nothing bad to say about his performance in this movie. It was just your typically fine performance by 'The Man.' As for Kim Novak, I see many people, once again here, commending her great performance in this film. Sheesh! Gag me with a spoon, Charlie Brown! Her performance in this movie is barely adequate, at best. Barely. It's no wonder Sir Alfred of the Hitch actually wanted Vera Miles for the role and when he couldn't get her (she was pregnant at the time), had to 'settle for' Kim. Talk about a one-note samba performance! Kim is a classic example of a gorgeous woman with no true acting talent who came to Hollywood and was able to break into movies strictly on the basis of her beauty. Unlike some actresses in her category (Julia Roberts is one who comes to mind), Kim never developed one iota as an actress and that is why she had such a nothing career in the movies. Her one talent was to stand there and look pretty -- hopefully with her mouth shut! And she is the major dead weight that prevented 'Vertigo' from being all that Hitch hoped and wanted it to be.Last, I cannot ignore Bernard Herrmann's score for this movie. When it comes to scoring a movie, this is as good as it gets. I don't know all of his scores without looking them up but I seriously doubt that he ever did a better score -- for any movie! -- than the one he did for 'Vertigo.'The best ever? The best Hitch ever? For those people who think this movie is -- one or the other -- I commend those people for knowing what they like. I, of course, cannot agree -- to either one. But ..... if only Vera Miles had been available.",8,1,3,6 November 2001
Forrest Gump," Forrest has 'gumption'!
","Gumption: noun; common sense, horse sense, initiative, enterprise (Merriam-Webster). Chop off the back half of that word and you have Forrest Gump, a towering fountain of stand-alone common sense in a nonsensical world gone crazy.In a recent letter, a friend told me that she had just watched 'Forrest Gump' and that she 'loved that movie.' Although it had been some seven years since I had seen it, her comment to me reminded me that I, too, had once 'loved that movie.' When it suddenly showed up on TV last night, I felt the urge, the need, for a refresher course on what it is like to be a Forrest Gump in a world of schlumps, myself included. Moreover, I needed the sanity and serenity of Forrest Gump the man to assuage the insanity and unserenity that has been the month of September of 2001. I have been assuaged.By now, almost anyone who watches movies has seen 'Forrest Gump.' At least once. Thus, we all know that it cannot be classified as a comedy. Nor as a drama. Nor an adventure. Nor a charmer. Nor a tearjerker. And yet, it is all of those things, all in one movie. 'Forrest Gump,' when and as you are watching it, reminds you constantly that there IS good in the world. Even as you are watching bad events transpire in the movie, you seem to know that somehow, good will eventually result. That is because Forrest Gump is nearby -- around -- somewhere -- and wherever Forrest goes, goodness follows.My favorite movie actor is, was and always will be Jimmy Stewart. With Jimmy gone and no longer with us, Tom Hanks has taken his place. In my heart. Just as Jimmy was in so very many of his famous and fabulous roles, Tom has become the American Everyman. He's the guy for whom you always root. You want him to triumph. You want him to get the girl. He HAS to get the girl! Even if the worth of the girl to be gotten is open to question, you STILL want him to get her, if only because he has always loved her and will always love her so unfailingly and so unconditionally. And when, at last, his unrequited love for his beloved Jenny (Robin Wright) is finally so deservedly rewarded, you feel as if you want to jump up and shout ... 'HALLELUJAH!!!' Then, when Jenny tenderly tells Forrest that he is the father of her sweet little Forrest Jr., you think to yourself and you say to yourself, 'Yes, Self! That is right! That is as it should be!'And that is right and that is as it should be about this entire movie. Even Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise), Forrest's self-loathing and loathable army buddy, is unable to avoid Forrest's goodness wearing off on him. Forrest 'touches' everyone. And he doesn't even know it! He's just a guy living his life. He just ... is ... Forrest Gump, a guy with gumption in a gumptionless world.I am so very glad and happy that my friend told me she saw 'Forrest Gump' and that she 'loved that movie.' She spurred me to watch it once again. Having now done so, I feel that Forrest has restored both peace and love to my troubled mind and heart over the awful events of September of 2001. He is a reminder to us all that no matter how many Hitlers, Stalins and bin Ladens may rise and fall, we will always have a Forrest Gump to help pull us thru the evils that these evil men do. Peace and love to you, Forrest.",10,1,2,29 September 2001
Caddyshack," The best ever? Duh .....
","I FINALLY got around to watching this movie in its entirety. I'd seen bits and pieces of it over the years but never the whole thing all at once. Proud of being the snob that I am, I always considered 'Caddyshack' to be about 20 floors beneath my cultured dignity.Having seen it, I now have come to IMDb to vote on it and to comment on it. I've noticed, first, that a few commenters think this is the best movie ever made. Or, at the very least, the best COMEDY ever made. Conversely, 6,262 voters (to date, counting me) rate this movie at only 6.9 out of 10. Which means that the 'silent majority' think 'Caddyshack' is just an OK movie. And I'm with the latter group. 'Caddyshack' does have its moments, a few of them quite funny, but overall, it's just OK.Let's face it. There are only four people in this movie: Chevy Chase, Rodney Dangerfield, Ted Knight and Bill Murray. All the other actors and actresses who are in it, young and old alike, are thrown in just to fill in empty holes in the screen. Or to say something when all of The Big Four are debating among themselves as to who has the next one-liner. And usually it's Dangerfield, who tosses out one-liners as if he's throwing rice at a wedding. Most people would probably say his character (Al Czervik) is the funniest in this movie. Not say me. My vote goes to Bill Murray (Carl Spackler -- what a name!), who plays an absolutely insane assistant keeper of the greensward at the uppity Bushwood Country Club. This guy couldn't get a clue if Vanna White herself were handing them out for free, which makes his character all the more lovable in this movie.There is one classic scene where Chevy Chase (Ty Webb), in preparation for an important match upcoming with the snooty Judge Smails (Ted Knight), is working on his golf game -- in the middle of the night! He accidentally knocks his ball into Spackler's -- uh -- 'living quarters.' In the course of attempting to get Spackler's permission to 'play thru,' the two of them have the most inane conversation you could possibly imagine.I can imagine that Brian Doyle-Murray (Bill's brother), Harold Ramis and Douglas Kenney, the three co-writers, must have had great fun writing the script (such as it is) for this movie. I can picture the three of them, in many late-night writing sessions, trying to top each other's one-liners -- and the more lowbrow the one-liners, the better.Though the movie does have, as I've said, some funny lines and scenes, it is mostly just a 'cut-and-run' from one scene to the next -- unrelated -- gag or scene. If one appreciates a COMPLETE movie of this type -- and from this era (1980ish, give or take a few) -- one would do much better with the likes of 'Animal House,' 'Airplane' or 'Ghostbusters.'Don't forget! 'Caddyshack' is the type of movie that attracts those people who are attracted to the lowbrow in almost anything. The 'Best Ever' movie? No. The 'Best Comedy Ever'? I don't think so. Remember, those members of the cultured intelligentsia, such as myself, rarely stoop to the level of a 'Caddyshack.' It really is beneath us. But if one does so stoop, one will actually find a few laughs therein. What a surprise!",7,0,2,2 November 2001
Life Is Beautiful," Humor, deception and pathos in one neat package.
","Add Roberto Benigni's name to the list of cinema triple threats: those who can write, direct and act -- all in one movie! And do it well, too!In 'La Vita è bella' (USA: 'Life Is Beautiful'), he has made a classic. Initially, Guido (Benigni), an Italian Jew, is a happy-go-lucky fellow whose silly antics are constantly rubbing those who know him the wrong way. Then he meets Dora (Nicoletta Braschi, Benigni's real-life wife) and while Guido's happy demeanor never lets down, he's now becoming more of a man of responsibility. Eventually, Guido and Dora have a son, Giosué (Giorgio Cantarini), and it is now that Guido's blue-sky philosophy of life is severely tested by the World War II clouds that have enveloped all of Europe.The crux of this movie is how possibly can Guido, the happiest Italian Jew, help his family survive the Nazis and The Holocaust? It's a daunting proposition, at best, and we don't know 'til the end of the movie how -- or even if -- he's going to manage to pull it off.Benigni, here, has taken a most original story idea, mixed in equal parts of humor and tragedy, added a strong dose of deception (perhaps the movie's most important plot element), thus producing a work of art that is seldom equalled on the screen. And in this case, when we talk of humor and the Nazis in the same context, we're not talking 'Hogan's Heroes,' folks!
Without telling you how Benigni did it, there is one scene in this movie when Giosué, the son, puts in his first appearance as a five-year-old. The scene is done in a matter of seconds and it is done flawlessly, seamlessly and with a type of artistry that is rarely seen in motion pictures.And that's what 'La Vita è bella' is, too: the artistry of motion picture-making at its very best. A heart-wrencher and a cheerer-upper, all rolled into one.",9,1,2,4 July 2001
