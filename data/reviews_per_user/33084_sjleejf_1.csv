The King's Speech," Why are you stuttering?!
","In the King's Speech, we see a perfectly able, decent man incapacitated by a disorder. What holds him back is stuttering, something that is caused by his unhappy past. Alas, he is no ordinary man and may just be forced to step up to a place of a king at a time of worldly crisis. Oh, the fear that must grip him! Not only of the nightmarish public embarrassment but even worse, the fear of failing to lead a nation (and perhaps a good part of the world) because of a seemingly small impediment that he fails to overcome.And that's the point of the speech disorder, I think. From my perspective, the entire person of King George VI seems so stupid because of his stuttering. I say to him, 'Hey, what's the matter? Why are you stuttering? There's no reason for you to stutter! Just speak normally, like me. Now watch how I do it.' As I watched him battling his demon with the help of a mentor, I came to appreciate a little more the problems that people have, whatever they may be. Something that to me seems so easy to overcome may not be so simple to the person concerned.So, please, friends... Be kind to me and my many shortcomings. I am trying, really.",8,1,2,22 May 2012
