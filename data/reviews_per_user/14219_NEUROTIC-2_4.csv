The Blair Witch Project," Horror film...? More like a comedy to me!
","Let me begin by stating that no one could have been more intrigued by this concept of 'mock documentary' in horror than myself. I've seen that special on the Sci-Fi channel that brilliantly sets the stage for screening the film. It truly gave you a sense of foreboding history and got you acquainted with a mysterious lore lurking in the Black Hills Forest in Maryland. Unfortunately, that Sci-Fi special (part of the whole PR campaign) was far scarier than the actual film.I saw Blair Witch in a packed house that was filled up nearly 40 minutes before the show started, which is how anxious everyone around here was about wanting to see this and be terrified beyond belief. We all apparently bought the hype and our expectations were just too high perhaps. Whatever the reason, Blair Witch seemed nothing more to me than a corny episode of the Real World - Lost in the Woods. The film had so many funny moments and the audience laughed out loud so many times, you would have thought you were at a Jim Carey flick. Not a single scream was heard in our theater for the entire film. Personally, I grew tired of listening to the three of them complain and yell at each other about whether anyone knew where the hell they were going and what would happen once they got there. I suppose it showed realism there as I'm sure friends lost in the woods, growing more tired and hungry and agitated by the minute, would be behaving in exactly the same way. It just seemed that I was waiting for the scary moments to occur and they just didn't. I'm sorry, but constructed stick figures and rock piles along the journey, did not scare me in the least. I knew you had to tap into the emotions of the characters as they appeared to be followed and hunted by some unknown forces, but it just didn't translate well from those 8MM cameras, poor sound quality, and sub-par filming by the actual actors. There were some stretches where the audience was staring at a black screen with only the sounds of breathing and cursing going on. It just didn't cut it with me.I must say that the last 5 minutes were truly intense to experience and the ending is a shocker that really sends you reeling out of the theater. Trouble is, you have to sit through the first 83 minutes to get there. To put it simply, the beginning got you off to a good start, the rising action was okay, the entire middle SUCKED until the last 5 minutes. I would not recommend seeing Blair Witch, especially if you prefer some horror in your horror movies. Just watch the Sci-Fi channel special and you'll be more frightened in the comfort of your own living room.",Null,0,1,24 July 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Has the looks, the sounds, & the music, ...but...
","Sat. May 22nd 12:31 AMHaving just returned from this first weekend's screening, I feel compelled to write this while it's fresh in my mind. Episode I had you believing you were watching a Star Wars film, yet that was the whole problem that I found with TPM....I was just watching and not doing what I had done with the original trilogy, experiencing! There is a huge difference. Of course the visuals were flawless, again....a problem. I missed the feel of actual constructed sets and tangible characters instead of all the computer animation. Everything seemed ILM originated, it was as though I was watching a cartoon. I couldn't fully appreciate any of the battles because I couldn't bring myself to care about computer generated Gungens, because they never appeared to be in danger of anything. I always thought that if Jar Jar was close to getting hurt, an ILM tech would be there to save him by painting a quick laser bolt to destroy an oncoming attack droid in the nick of time. It lacked any real drama or tension.Now about the characters and plot line. Sadly, nothing was developed very well in this movie from Anakin, to the origin of the Sith, to the reason for all of this greedy Trade Federation and political turmoil mumbo jumbo. I thought this episode would take on a grander scale than it did. I knew to properly develop Anakin's and Obi Wan's fledging relationship, the film would have to be slow. I didn't know the first hour was going to crawl like a garden slug in the sun. Man, was it boring. Jake Lloyd actually gave a decent performance, as did most every other human character, it was the writing that was seriously flawed. Lucas just didn't have the magic rekindled for this one. Let's face it, when the first words from Obi Wan's mouth is, 'I've got a bad feeling about this,' you know you're digging yourself an early hole. Jar Jar was given way to much screen time, while more essential characters, like Darth Maul and Amedala, were barely in this picture. The chemistry between the main group just never seemed to gel.This first installment was not completely awful, it did have some riveting action sequences like the Pod race & the best lightsaber duel yet (blows the previous three duels away combined). That saved the second half of the film. I kept waiting for a third act....but it never came! You can't help leaving the theater feeling like Lucas could have done better. The greatest saga of all time deserved a better beginning than this.",Null,0,1,22 May 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Kubrick's swan song is NOT his best work
","Let me begin by saying that I am not the greatest fan of Kubrick's work so this may add weight to my review if anyone cares to read. The man is a genius at cinematography, atmospheric setting, and camera work. I'll concede that, however he is NOT the best storyteller in the world. I suppose that's not his intention. He would rather have his audience leave his films with a total sense of astonishment and force it upon them to fill in the gaps with their own interpretations, like an artist of oil paintings or exquisite sculptures.I loved Strangelove, 2001, The Shining, Full Metal Jacket, however Eyes Wide Shut left too much of an emptiness within me. The visual film elements are mesmerising, but the dialogue will drive you NUTS. Especially Nicole Kidman, who takes 5 minutes to complete every damn sentence for dramatic effect (partially due to being drunk in the opening party sequence and stoned in another key scene in their bedroom). This film explores a theme of jealousy and it's consequences. Although no actual extra-marital affairs exist in this film, Cruise's character is driven into an all-night journey into the sexual underworld because his wife wanted to be unfaithful to him when the couple was on vacation a year before these present events.Cruise is emotionally devastated and wanders the night alone and then runs into all sorts of weirdos along the way and ends up in a very sinister mansion on Long Island where a cult-like masquerade ball orgy-fest occurs. I will divulge no further except to say that this half-hour sequence is the best part of the film and makes you sit up in your seat with enormous interest of what exactly is happening here and what is going to happen to Cruise. The plot could have really taken off from there, and in my opinion, could have turned the film into a seedy conspiracy-mystery crime thriller. Alas, no. All the potential that was drawn from the chain of events at this mysterious house was terribly wasted in the third act and the resolution to the whole thing was a serious let down. The ending turned what had become interesting and open to interpretation into a lame explanation that is too trite and tidy. The whole thing remained an almost three hour examination or thesis, if you will, on human reaction to jealousy and what one's imagination can do to a relationship.To conclude, I really wanted Stanley's final gift to the movie-goer to be the masterpiece that the hype would have you believe. Sadly, it wasn't. Not the worst film he's made, but certainly nowhere near his best. Rest in peace, Mr. Kubrick...",Null,0,0,17 July 1999
The Matrix," A complete waste of $6.75 and 2 hours of your life...
","I hate being a victim, but alas, a victim I became the moment I decided to drag my girlfriend with me to see this film. I saw the enticing trailer, the HBO behind the scenes special, and the rave reviews of many respected critics, and said, 'I have to see this movie.' Big mistake... This film is absolutely dreadful, quite possibly the worst sci-fi motion picture ever made, (even makes the first Star Trek look like a winner). Here is what's wrong with 'The Matrix'...1) All special effects window dressing and loud noise, not a single trace of a story is present.2) Keanu Reeves (only action actor worse is Jean-Claude Van Damme).3) Long, drawn-out monologues trying to explain what the hell is going on when no one in the theater has a clue. This plot is so convoluted it makes Kubrick's 2001 read like a kindergarten pop-up book.4) Too much John Wooesque artsy-fartsy stuff when this film doesn't merit anything award winning.5) Keanu Reeves6) Impossible to even imagine any of this plausible to fill a plotline (I know we must suspend disbelief, but come on now).7) Too many characters and not enough with character.8) The violence is way too gratuitous, especially in the wake of  Columbine.9) Extremely poor acting (with the exception of Moss).10) AND FINALLY.....Keanu Reeves.To summarize, don't fall for the hype, this movie is so bad, it makes staying home to watch 90210 reruns a more appealing alternative on a Friday night. In fact, I feel that WB owes me and my girlfriend $6.75 each.",Null,0,1,28 April 1999
