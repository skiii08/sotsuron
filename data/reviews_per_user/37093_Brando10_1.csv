","I saw the movie last night. I have no idea about all the conspiracy theories, and they are probably untrue. I went to a 9:30 pm showing on Friday and the theater was packed. There was virtually no speaking or sound from the audience throughout the film. When it ended everyone just filed out in silence, even the high school kids. But, the movie places no blame, (on Americans), just presents the facts and you can draw your own conclusions as to what the powers that be should have done. And by the time Bush & Co. took action, it was too late. Everything was over by then. So there is a dig at the administration and rightly so.",8,1,6,29 April 2006
