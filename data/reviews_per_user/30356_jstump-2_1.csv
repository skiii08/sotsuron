Mission: Impossible III," C'mon. Show me something...I'm begging you.
","This movie wasn't bad, but it was completely unremarkable. For a more thorough review, check out my blog where I review this and other movies -- www.stumpedblog.blogspot.com Otherwise, here are a few thoughts: 1. Why have Hoffman in this movie if he's only going to be in a few short scenes and one of them is a fight scene? 2. With all that budget, you're telling me you couldn't come up with one single distinctive visual in this whole movie? 3. Tom Cruise becoming a wack-job in real life has hurt his movie appeal. I just kept thinking about Oprah's couch.4. The guy who dreamt up Lost could have given us a couple interesting twists or layers to spice up this very ordinary flick, and the fact that he didn't left me pretty disappointed.",6,3,5,27 May 2006
