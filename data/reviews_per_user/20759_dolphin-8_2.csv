Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Lightning strikes 4 times
","It's amazing.  I am relieved and in wonderment as to how four related films can all be so wonderful.  Why did I give TPM a 10-rating? The reason is that what made the previous SW films so good action,story,characters,special effects return in full force with this edition.  We get to see how the Saga started...finally.  What we witness is an amazing story(or at least the beginning) that is a more than worthy start point to the greatest movie saga of all time.  Because the previous 3 films were so good TPM had to maintain that level of excellence.  It did.  New characters as Jar Jar and Darth Maul brought an added dimension and substance to the saga.  Older characters such as Obi-Wan and Anakin allow us to see them in their younger years and begin to piece together the mysteries of how they reached their states in the older films.  When the credits to TPM roll we are left with the film that has all the wonderful attributes of the previous SW films.  Can we ask for more?",10,0,1,3 August 2000
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Super phenomenal
","The Old trilogy was capped by a film so wonderful and magnificient it is hard to describe the great moments.  Luke's progression as a jedi was a sight to behold, his confidence and courage is one of the many things that made ROTJ so great.  The characters new and old participated in bringing us a film that dealt with our deepest fears and our greatest triumphs.  The action was first rate.  The special effects are still better than most seen in todays films! The first two films in the Star Wars trilogy were fantastic and the finale HAD to be great.  I wasn't disappointed.  ROTJ was better is a more than worthy end to the six-part Star Wars saga.  Job well done!",10,0,0,3 August 2000
