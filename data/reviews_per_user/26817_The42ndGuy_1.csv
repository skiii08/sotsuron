Vertigo," Perfection
","Very, very seldom does every element of a film represent the medium at its best.  The best scenes in this one have unmatched visual flair, a score of substantial inherent beauty and incalculable impact within the film, and acting that doesn't get in the way of the other two.  Techniques from 'Vertigo' have been copied endlessly and still manage to work.  It is impossible to make a perfect film, but Hitchcock came closer than I've ever seen in this case.  Stunning every time.",10,2,4,5 July 2000
