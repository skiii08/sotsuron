Hereditary," Immensely Disappointed
",This film started out with so much potential and delivered on numerous things like being creepy and unnerving. It was far too long though and about half way through you could tell there was not going to be any sort of happy ending for this family. The film got darker and darker to the point were you knew nobody was going to even end up alive at the end. The ending well it was quite simply weird. There were some genuinely creepy and frightening moments in the film but not enough to gloss over the storyline they stretched over 2 hours. Some good acting but a weak script.,5,1,3,23 August 2018
Suicide Squad," So much potential. So little on delivery
","I will start by saying I started watching Suicide Squad with an open mind and actually looked forward to seeing what road this film would take us on.As soon as the movie started certain things started to agitate me. Margot Robbie's portrayal of Harley Quinn being one of them, her character was quite enjoyable but her accent kept on changing from scene to scene. Jared Leto's Joker not only looked awful but was awful in every sense of the word. Joker looked like a pimp on heroin, his laugh felt forced and not naturally crazy at all and the love story between him and Harley was far too soppy, it was like they had to get a love story in. It was like the writers/director hadn't read anything into the actual chaotic abusive and betrayal heavy relationship the Joker and Harley have. As far as the other characters go you get what you expect from Will Smith, if you like him as I do he probably makes this movie a bit more watchable although it is a samey performance from him. The biggest shame came from the fact the smaller characters really made the film a bit better, adding humour and likable moments. Boomerang and Diablo were enjoyable characters to watch as well as Enchantress, although some characters were just pointless as they didn't really do anything like Killer Croc. Viola Davis was brilliant as Amanda Waller embodying the sternness and efficiency of the character well. To sum up this film had potential but collapse under it's own hype and did not live up to expectations. Even characters like Deadshot played second fiddle to a soppy love story between Harley and the Joker. If I was asked if I'd rather watch Suicide Squad again or sit through the living hell that would be a High School Musical marathon, i'd choose the latter.",3,2,3,22 October 2016
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Thank the Force it's over!
","If you just like anything with big yellow writing at the beginning, or you like bright swords that make 'zum, zum' sounds, then you'll probably like this movie. Those who are Star Wars fans though should really be offended with how poor this movie is. It seems rushed, like they had to pack too much in and throw in characters just for merchandise reasons. The ending is absolutely stupid with the Emperor who is back killing himself by shooting electricity at 2 lightsabers, cos one couldnt hack it. Instead of just stopping he burns up. Then follows the most awkward on screen kiss going! Other things that annoy is the apparent death of Chewie as Rey blows up a transport with her force lightning powers because guess what shes a Palpatine, and Chewie is onboard. Fake out, hes not because apparently there was 2 transports, despite us only seeing one take off. In 5 mins Lando can summon a whole load of people to fight the first order despite everybody having lost hope in the Last Jedi. The Resistance celebrates the war ending after the Emperors fleet is defeated, despite the First Order still very much being out there and having a huge fleet and an army that can control the galaxy still. But hey the won against a threat that wasnt even apparent until the beginning of this movie so yay! The force can now teleport things and you can fight with someone in different locations, rip necklaces off people on different planets. The knights of Ren are awful and dont even speak, they instantly betray Kylo Wren when he goes good at the end, despite never even meeting the Emperor. Hux, yes arguably one of the main villains of the past 2 movies, the man who command Star Killer Base dies in the most ridiculous way ever. Totally undersells the character. All the Emperors Star Destroyers have planet killing lasers on them, but if you shoot the laser which is easily done it blows up the whole ship. Major design flaw there. These Star Destroyers were made under ice too and break through the ice to rise. Wouldn't this damage them? Also it appears they dont have any shielding. This is just a few of the stupid things in the Rise of Skywalker. There are so many more. Reason I gave it a 4? Some good acting from time to time and Fin and Poes bromance is infectious and fun.",4,0,0,12 January 2020
Midsommar," Overhyped
",A movie about a trip to stay with a pagan cult. It does not explain why the cult decides to torture people or kill others just because they want to leave. The movie is far to long and the plot is paper thin. Some people will say it is bizarre and great because it is different. Others will say the film never ever reached it's potential and tried to hard to provide alternative horror.,3,9,13,29 September 2019
