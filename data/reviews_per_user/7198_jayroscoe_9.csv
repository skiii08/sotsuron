Ford v Ferrari," Really a great film
",I'm not a fan of Christian Bale but this movie was much better than I was expecting. It's a classic tale of wild free spirited independent thinkers vs Managerail Idiocy No wonder Detroit was wiped out by the Japanese in the 80's and after,9,2,3,20 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Star Wars is Dead
","Don't believe the 10 star reviews- this was terrible
Thank God this was the last one . The original trilogy was excellent, the second was okay , but this last set was simply horrible. Disney has declared war on any White Male in all of their recent movies . In this set, they kill off Hans, Luke, and Kyle, yet Lando, Rey and everyone else is fine.
This was a pathetic ending to what started out as probably the best movie series ever, but was strangled by political correctness.",2,24,39,1 January 2020
Bird Box," Another film poisoned by Social Justice
",Yet another Netflix show where the main theme is ' All White Men BAD ! All Black Men Good ! ',4,4,10,29 April 2020
Yesterday," Could have been better
",Just watched this and thought it was nice but easily could have been much better. Definitely needed some cast changes- his agent was obnoxious and not funny at all and the main character was terrible.Where are all the straight White English male actors at ? This felt like a grooming gang movie. I do admit thought that the guy playing John Lennon was a ringer for him,3,3,5,8 February 2020
Aladdin," Meh
",Better than Lady and the Tramp remake but still makes the only white male in it an idiot.,4,1,3,12 January 2020
Kelly's Heroes," Excellent
","Great story, all star cast, the only people who don't love this movie are crybaby millennials who hate the military and have never served like I did. The only movie close to this is the original MASH",10,2,5,23 January 2020
Grave of the Fireflies," Revisonist history
","Japan does not even teach it's children about what they did in WW2- they have quietly censored it out of their history books. While I really wanted to like this movie, it made the Americans the bad guys.
Guess I will go watch Totoro again instead",2,1,24,22 November 2019
2001: A Space Odyssey," Fantastic even 50 Years later
","To really understand this movie, you have to have read the book. Then if all makes sense.
The special effects in this are still fantastic, even 50 years later. Like Forbidden Planet and the original StarWars, Kubrick was years ahead of his time.
Again, read the book first- then you can really appreciate the movie",10,4,4,7 January 2020
Black Panther," Where's the White Wakandans ?
","Seriously- if we have Black Vikings in Thor, Black Valkyries in Thor, why are the Wakandans all Black? Where's the diversity ?
Besides being boring, this felt like a 70's Black-sploitation movie.
I wish Hollywood would learn that Special Effects do not make a movie- a good plot does. And boring ? I literally fell asleep watching this .",2,9,13,25 March 2020
