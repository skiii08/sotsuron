The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Twilighter at heart but disappointed
","The only reason why I gave this movie a 8 is because Im a Twilight fan. I've seen all the previous movies from the series and nothing compares to the first film hands down; it was haunting, it lured you in, the music was spot on. Breaking Dawn was a disappointment cause I was expecting more even though it stayed true to the book. Pros: Follows the book almost perfectly, its all about Bella and Edward,lots of romance,The fabulous house and location in the first bit OMG unbelievable!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Cons: The score(music) was mediocre compares to the last 3. They have to stop putting so much white makeup on Edward!Bill Codon is satisfactory but what they should have done was bring back the director from the first film Catherine Hardwicke... her vision was way coolerAll in all I would recommend this movie if you are Twilight fan or a sucker for romance and adventure :)",8,2,8,10 December 2011
Stardust," This movie Rocks!
","First things first to all you haters out there DO NOT COMPARE THE BOOK TO THE MOVIE OR VICE VERSA! They are two different entities people...movie makers cannot possibly put the details of a book in a movie. If you think you can, then you can start a revolution. So don't get so boo hooey when the movie is not like the book. Ahhh since i have that off my plate I can start by saying that this movie rocks. It is fairy tale/ fantasy extravaganza brought to life. Great acting, casting and effects all together. It is the story of a boy who becomes a man and is in essence a love story. And whether you like to admit or not there's is school girl in all of a us thats a sucker for a good love story =)). This story takes place in a town that holds a secret..a great wall separates them from an enchanted kingdom, where no one has ever dared to tread the kingdom of Stormhold. The story revolves around Tristan, a young man in love with a girl called Victoria who couldn't care less (we all heard that one before). A star falls from the sky when he tries to woo her and he promises to bring it back to her for her hand in marriage. The quest becomes and adventure full of magic, murder, corruption and looooove.The magical Kingdom of Stormhold has just lost their king the star that has fallen from the sky is of great importance. 3 powerful Witches (Pfifer who plays and excellent villain!) that crave youth and beauty are also after the star. So basically everyones after the star. I can go on and on but Ill stop here! Whats good about this movie is its not predictable, which is rare in this day an age. It is a rich tapestry which slowly unravels. Never a dull moment!",9,4,6,25 August 2008
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," This movie was amazing..
","Hello people whats with the 4.6 what an exaggeration...Its sad that there are so many people out there that don't recognize quality. People love to whine; always the same song and dance about 'its not like the book!:..who cares about the book ugh..these people should stick to the library and not watch movies at all! This movie was better then the first which is unusual normally the sequels cant live up to the first films. Beautifly filmed, well casted and entertaining.I was glued to the screen from beginning to end. The chemistry between Edward and Bela is electrifying and their plight arouses empathy. The ending was like ugh!!oh no they didn't! Basically the ending makes you long for more; the crappy part is that we have to wait a year to find out the what happens next... Trust me Im so not a vampire movie person and this movie was the bomb.10/10 entertainment at its best",10,0,7,23 March 2010
The Witch," Time is precious don't waste it
","The worst recent movie I have ever seen. Utterly dreadful! So boring and over religious.I usually love historical dramas and horror films but it wasn't interesting in the least or scary, just bizarre. The story drags on and on and you get no answers. The stellar reviews its receiving is beyond me. The ending is weird and disturbing. I do NOT recommend this horrid excuse for a movie.",1,15,33,9 August 2017
