Mission: Impossible III," Incoherent and tedious
","Technically, MI3 is well done. That doesn't cut it. The story is just about characters following MacGuffins all over the place that serve no purpose. MI3's concept is simple: Alias meets 24, but in two hours. Ethan Hunt becomes Jack Bauer along with personal problems about being a spy in love. The whole thing feels too manipulative. You know what's going to happen next since the opening scene ends. It has no suspense. Just things blowing up with a nice scene or two. This comes from a guy who liked Mission Impossible and MI2.The quality of MI3 is probably at the same level of The Island. It can be enjoyed, but you have to give your share for that to work out. The main problem of the movie is the intense focus it has on Tom Cruise's profile. Other characters don't get enough screen time and lack in development for that reason. A movie with this kind of action would have been great with stronger characters you could actually care for. There was one bright point in the movie though: the tech guy at headquarters was played by no other than Shaun himself: Simon Pegg - his lines were golden and I wish he'd been in the leading role.So, it's worth seeing if you like Tom Cruise's face and good action. The story is a mess, the characters one-dimensional and the twists are just annoying.",4,0,0,13 May 2006
