Spartacus," Quite simply a masterpiece
","Forget Gladiator and all other pretenders, this classic still reigns supreme. The story of an inspired slave's quest against the mighty Roman Empire captures every emotion a cinema viewer can possibly expect ... this film is second to none. Kirk Douglas at his best is a mighty sight !!!",10,2,4,4 June 2000
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Where's my imagination
","This is the feeling I am left with after just watching this movie at the tender age of 25 years old.As an Eight year old boy I remember being in tears when ET went home, and held my heart in my hand when he was escaping  from the police in the memorable cycle chase.Funny how Childhood distorts fact and Adulthood hampers invention.
The bottom line is that viewed without an ounce of imagination this film is dreadful and cringe worthy ... however with just a touch it becomes a delight.This movie serves as a reminder that a great film is often  the product of a lucid imagination and not always a servant to special effects and computer wizardry.",7,0,0,3 September 2000
