Hereditary," Horror this good is few and far between
","My quick rating - 7,7/10. Horror tends to not be this good. So when gems like this rise up, you need to quickly get your eyes trained on them. The elements that make this so good are interwoven through a story of a disturbing family secret that seems to be more than just an accident in the family. In a good horror flick, you need to have some mystery along with the scares to keep you interested in just why it is happening. Or just go all out with gore and show boobs. Well, as each style has their own place and audience, the more true viewer tends to like a good story along with the scares, and if their needs to be blood, then make it memorable without being gratuitous. The balance here is kept fully in check, and as each bit of info this family finds, or opens if you will, the more drawn in they (and you) become. The acting in this movie is really quite good, with each character dealing with the things around them in a very realistic way. One wants to dive head first into the spirit world, while others are terrified of it. And all are effected differently due to this. An excellent entry into any horror collection, and really is a two watch flick to pick up on everything, well, not really, just the end will make you want to go back and pick up some pieces that were stuck in there. A must see for true horror fans that want to just peel away from the torture porn for a bit (and you know I am a fan of that, but we all need some balance to our movie viewing).",8,1,2,24 August 2018
The Babadook," An exceptionally made flick on a showstring budget
","An exceptionally well made flick on a showstring budget. Everything in this movie does its job. The story is basically a yarn on 'the boogeyman' tale, but this goes much further, and more personal. I must point out that this is a thinking persons horror movie that uses camera work, slight music, acting (that forgotten art) and story to scare you. No gore needed to frighten you around the corners of the house. I suppose I should just simply state the plot: A single mother and her slightly off son live in a suburb of Australia (I think Adelaide is a suburb, I am new to this Continent). The son believes there is a dark force haunting them known as the 'Babadook' which happens to be a quite disturbing children's book they have in their house. Well of course the mother dismisses this as nonsense. Well, we know from other movies what happens when evil spirits aren't believed in...The plot centers around the mother (played wonderfully by Essie Davis) and her spiral into madness. The book almost describes out the twists she will take on her journey. Every element of this movie is paid such detail, that it borders 'genius'. Keep in mind this movie was a kickstarter funded film, made on a 30,000 dollar budget. After watching, all I can say is it screams 'Get Jennifer Kent (writer/director) a budget and let's see what she can do' Definitely something that any drama/horror fan should be checking out. 7,2/10. Only negative I could find is the strange ending, and of course, I am not saying what that is. Enjoy.",7,3,7,21 March 2015
Ready Player One," Great movie, didn't read book, reviewed as a movie
","My quick rating - 8,1/10. I will make this clear. I did NOT read the book. This is watched and reviewed with that aside and do yourself a favor, don't read the IMDB reviews because all you will get is 'the book, blah blah blah' and zero stars. In other words, people who don't understand how to rate a movie. This flick is a visual beast, I cannot stress the sheer amount of detail that is conveyed through this movie. It is almost astounding that the CGI has come to such levels as this, to blend in and out of the real world seamlessly. Of course, through action scene after scene you know it is all animated, but you won't think a lick of that as you just watch in awe. Granted, a $100+ computer generated demo wouldn't be worth your 2.5 hours, but if you take a story and mix in some characters as well, you will find a hit. I really didn't think Spielberg could still pull off such action, yet with emotion, but alas, he does. The characters themselves, aside from the lead, aren't introduced in the real world until a ways in, so you kind of learn who they are long before you see. Kind of like the Internet, huh? What this movie has, is the creator of a video game world, called the Oasis, that exists in virtual reality and basically everyone lives in the oasis. It provides your gaming, dreams, life experiences, etc. All the things you want to do, but can't in the real world. This is partially one of my flaws of this movie. Assuming the Oasis is 'Facebook' lets say (last income report shows Facebook has 1.35 billion unique members) what do you think the chances of 5 people becoming online friends all live within miles of each other? Ok, put that part aside but it just isn't gonna happen. So as our characters are very briefly introduced, minus the main character, Wade (Parzival), we learn little things about them through their interaction in the Oasis. There really isn't much development to them, then again, they didn't want a 4 hour movie either. The nuts and bolts are there, enough to make sense to their avatars in the Oasis. Well, the creator (who had to be around my age) dies, but leaves behind an easter egg (hidden treasure in the Oasis to win) that grants the winner of three keys, in various challenges, the rights to the entire Oasis, and all the stock, and power that comes along with it. As anyone would want this sort of power and money (the word trillions is used) everyone is vying to solve these puzzles and win. This is where all your action comes into play. But along the way, human emotion does get involved, and leads to the actual underlying theme of this. Yes, throughout you may have thought it was just 'How many 80s references can you jam into a movie?' but really this is more of the game creators life unfolding to another generations eyes. Along with this, the movie also does a decent job of pointing out the real life struggle of how trapped one can become into this online world, ultimately to the point of losing ones identity. There are quite a few ideas that are tackled in this film and though they aren't all crystal clear in how, the end will at least give you an idea of what the movie was trying to say.
Now back to the book thing. One movie, in particular, that is imitated in this movie is 'The Shining' and is done quite well, I might add. I will tell you this, if you, like me, read the book first, and then saw the movie 'The Shining' you would be irritated due to the changes that were made. But if you go on, as I did not, and slam that movie, just like people slam this one, then you don't know how to critique a movie for its own merits. I am not going to go out of my way to read the book, and if I do read it, and agree that much was lost in translation, I won't be coming back to change my opinion. Just sit back, enjoy the plethora of cool references to the past, and enjoy a great movie for what it is. A visual masterpiece, a story that may become all too relevant in the near future, and a good time.",8,1,4,20 June 2018
Fast & Furious 6," Easily worth the price of admission
","Movie review:When I saw the first Fast and Furious, I very much enjoyed it for what it was. Racing action. That was it, no plot needed, although they put a cop in, blah blah. Well, the evolution of the Fast and Furious universe has changed dramatically.If you haven't seen the previous 5, it's OK, you will only miss out on some inside jokes, and character traits. The change it took was going from street racing to pro street racers performing high end heists (this occurred in the fifth installment) and now in 6 we have the culmination of all the characters that have appeared in the 5 others back for one last (?) big job. So, the crew is re-assembled by Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, this time not for cash, but to stop a terrorist attack. This includes (not limited to) O'Connor (Paul Walker) and Toretto(Vin Diesel) who are the main players ever since the first one, O'Connor the ex-fbi agent now rogue, Toretto, the street criminal turned hero. OK, can't sum up the whole backstory so now the 'family' has been reunited to stop the bad guy from stealing the final piece to creating a weapon capable of disabling the entire military infrastructure (they don't delve far into what/how exactly, just knocking out all communications). The mastermind behind this, Shaw (played very well by Luke Evans), is the one-step-ahead of everyone else criminal. Well, ultimately, Toretto wants nothing to do with it but there is a catch, a photo of Letty (thought to be dead Michelle Rodriguez) who was Torettos love and part of the family.So with this information, they decide with two goals in mind,save Letty and stop the attack, to take on this mission. One problem that occurs is Letty is now working for Shaw due to her memory loss after her attack as shown in flashbacks. OK, enough blabbering about plot, which there is more of it, and I dare you not to act surprised when several plot twists are revealed. Let's talk about action which there is plenty of. Keep in mind, checking things like physics and reality at the door are a must for these types of movies. The director (Justin Lin) does a superb job in choreography of the racing/car chase scenes which must be seen to be believed. Even though these scenes are impossible to fathom being possible, Lin films these scenes so precisely with every bit of attention to detail possible, edited together perfectly to inspire jaw dropping moments that may lead to disbelief and even clapping when you see them. No, really, it looks that good. Lin doesn't just stop there, he also utilizes his expertise in other action sequences including gun fights and also a very well filmed hand to hand fight. It plays out as a 'how to' manual for making an action flick, especially a summer blockbuster (Domestic Total as of May. 27, 2013:$117,036,995 + $197,000,000 foreign). But a movie being strictly eye candy wouldn't be enough. A major step up that is present is the incredible on screen chemistry of the 'family.' Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous play off one another so well, giving us some of the biggest laughs and one liners of the movie. All the characters are played so well, you will be surprised at how you actually are drawn in to the depth they provide in between explosions. Not what you would expect to be another major selling point of this type of movie. The evolution of this franchise now has taken the old die hard fans of the straight up racing from the earlier movies and brought in a whole new group of fans by introducing more of the action elements and complex (for action) stories that are not just fluff. At the end of the 2 hours, I believe you will leave this movie experience extremely satisfied with all aspects of this film, and also do to a major cliffhanger (don't stand up the second the credits start, trust me) that will leave you anxiously awaiting Fast and Furious 7, which I believe will be the final one (do not hold me to that unless I am right). Do yourself a favor and see this one in the theater. 8.0/10 IMDb 7.8 OK, I can't stop there without saying one thing that Heather and I could not hold back laughing about, no spoiler but the 'check reality' thing is so in focus in one scene it is really stupid, luckily it is surrounded by tons of action, but the runway a plane takes off from has to be somewhere around 500-700 miles long to accommodate the scene. That is all I will say, you will know what we mean when you see it. Thanks for going to the movie with me, Heather, those who read this (including you) know I 99% of the time watch movies at home, so it was a nice change of pace. 'Ride or Die'",8,4,6,28 May 2013
Southpaw," Very well acted boxing movie.
","My quick rating 7,0/10. Another stellar performance by Jake Gyllenhaal really sets this above the usual boxing movie. Jake plays an undefeated boxer, Billy, who in a tragic accident loses his wife. She is shot in a scuffle between himself and another hungry boxer who wants a shot at the title. Yes, you have heard the story before so you know he crumbles emotionally, loses everything and has to get his life back on track to inevitably fight the other boxer who caused the tragedy to occur. Same old story but what sets this one apart is the exceptional performances by everyone involved in this movie. Forest Whitaker as always is great and director Fuqua turns in a brilliant job keeping all the emotions right in front of the audience to make them feel the way the characters do. Very nice drama even if it is a standard plot you have heard before.",7,0,0,25 September 2015
Man of Steel," A retelling of Superman with all the bells,whistles and drama.
","Summer blockbuster season rolls on. I am pretty sure most of you know this is the story of Superman (DC comics). If you have seen previous movies, this movie somewhat combines Superman 1 and 2 together into it's own stand alone movie. In a far out galaxy, a planet that has been depleting it's resources is doomed to implode and the only chance for the race survival is in one natural born child, Kal-El (Henry Cavill/Superman) At the brink of the planets destruction, Jor-El (Russel Crowe/Supermans father) devises a way to send his son to Earth in hopes to save the human race and keep the legacy of Krypton alive. In a coup, General Zod (Michael Shannon)kills Kal-El in his own hopes to lead the people of Krypton to salvation, but instead is imprisoned and sent off into a dark land for all eternity. But not before Kal-El can send Superman off to Earth. Here we follow Cal (Clark as most of you know him by) as he must adjust to life on Earth along with the power and responsibility of possessing it. The movie spends an exorbitant amount of time showing the trials of being a superhero. That being said, it is done very well in script and acting. Throughout the course of this, Lois Lane (Amy Adams) character is introduced and is set on finding out who Clark really is. This of course leads to the romantic involvement that was destined to occur. If this sounds like a romantic drama, it pretty much is. But of course, Zod(and his counterparts) comes after Kal (Clark) to retrieve the DNA data from his now destroyed civilization which will lead to the action and summer blockbuster worthiness of this film. On the drop of a hat, the movie shifts the serious undertones the first hour or so had, and turns into a free for all of special effects and explosions that may make Michael Bay take notice (ala Zack Snyder). I do believe the drama and completely contrived romance was a bit long and drawn out. But the way this movie dismissed it completely to obliterate the city was more of a distraction in the storytelling to me. Sure it looked and sounded great in the theater (twice already this year to a theater? not sure what is going on with me) but overall the balance of drama and action just was not handled very well. I also believe with the sheer amount of material they tried to cram into the 2 hours and 20 minutes, they did the best they could. All the pieces were in place to deliver an epic story, but it fell just a little bit short in the presentation. Overall, I did like the movie, and would recommend it. I would be failing if I did not mention the obvious correlation of Kryptons demise being compared to what we have been doing to our own planet. Sit back and enjoy it for what it is worth, solid acting and story for one half, complete mayhem in the form of action and destruction in the second half and with that being known in advance, I believe you will like this movie. 7.6/10 IMDb 7.9 Thank you Ali and Jayden for a nice movie night and also a big thanks to the dude who gave us free passes on the way into the theater to make this a nice and cheap night out.",8,1,2,2 July 2013
Divergent," Stands out against other similar minded movies.
","Settling in to this film, I expected to see Hunger Games again. Set in a near-future Chicago, what we see is another take on the dystopian society. The central plot here is that growing up in this walled in world, everyone must fit into one of five classes. But of course, the question here is what if you don't fit into the nicely packaged definition of a single class, then you must be Divergent, or in this movie, a danger to the perfect society. When our main character, Tris (played very well by Shailene Woodley)finds out she is Divergent she must hide this secret and discover the reasons why it is such a secret and why society fears Divergents. I'll leave all of that for you to watch unfold in the various physical and psychological training exercises that are portrayed on screen. In a nutshell, the world painted is similar to that of Equilibrium but with much less action. This is not a bad thing, since this allows the cinematographer to reveal a very wonderfully crafted view of this world. The pacing of this movie moves along nicely as we plod through Tris trying to fit in as a part of the Dauntless clan. Friendships are made, lost, and so on as expected. Even more so is the romantic involvement with the mysterious Four (or 4) played by Theo James (which I believe over acted his part entirely too much). So the mystery of why the government wants to kill all Divergents must be unraveled and this leads to the majority of the story. I was happy with just sitting back and enjoying the view during many of the scenes that were almost breathtaking. Not reading the book, I hope that the movie did well to portray the story but I also know it is a trilogy so they couldn't go from start to finish all at once. Stand alone I believe the movie was quite well made and under-appreciated, swept under the rug by the highly successful Hunger Games series. You will be hard pressed not to see the similarities between them. I am looking forward to seeing what else this world has in store for us and would recommend that moviegoers join me to find out. Will you see silly acted parts, and scenes that are just there to draw you in with nice landscapes and perfectly choreographed music, YES. But why would anyone complain about something like that? I know I wouldn't. Enjoy this film, you won't regret the time you spent on it.",7,19,29,21 August 2014
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A very well made yet tedious journey from Tarantino
","My quick rating - 6,9/10. Well, this is a nice little niche movie from Tarantino. If you aren't familiar at all with the Manson murders, then a bunch of this movie will make little or no sense. That won't make the movie bad by any means. I believe some pretty good performances were turned in by all, for the most part. Although zombie Margot Robbie was a little distracting as Sharon Tate. Anyway, the movie follows the lives of a few Hollywood B listers in late 60s Hollywood, and the intertwining of their lives with the events of the Manson murders. That is a very blanket statement way of covering this, as a few Quentin inside jokes are slipped in along the way, most likely a lot more than I noticed on one viewing. Big nod to Bruce Lee though. I think Tarantino used his clout to try and make a movie to show off a bit of his friendships he has made and the knowledge he has about movies in general, to a good extent for the movie, but also about the only drawback to it. The length of this movie got tedious when it wasn't needed. Put that aside, and the movie wraps itself up, two hours and 40 minutes later, with a not so satisfying ending. It was just far enough off to make it more fiction. Maybe that was done for the sake of it being a movie more than a documentary, I really couldn't tell what they were shooting for at that point. But again, this is not a knock on the film, the movie has typical Tarantino blood abound, when need be, good one liners and fitting humor. Everyone is expecting Pulp Fiction all over again, even I will admit I often think about when he might capture that brilliance again. That is my fault for thinking that way, though. I doubt I am alone when doing that.",7,1,1,1 December 2019
Ex Machina," Excellent, albeit, deep movie about AI....
","My quick rating 7,9/10. A very well made movie that tackles a few interesting subjects. This philosophical approach to 'what makes us 'human' and how would you react if you could just be 'turned off' are a couple of deep subjects that are touched upon. This does lead to a slightly plodding pace at times since each part is very well written and often gives the viewers a moment or two to seriously consider what had just been said. The story involves a study for a man (who won his way into this test) to test a robot that has AI that simulates a human brain in rational thought and self awareness. Other movies have touched upon this subject (Blade Runner, anyone?) but this is more of a closed environment t demonstrate how the robot will react, and also does take ample time to show how the human male will respond as well. The acting is spot on and not overdone, but just has a very real feel to it. Alicia Vikander (who plays the robot, Ava) gives a stand out performance conveying her emotions by extremely subtle eye movement and limited facial expression. A very well made flick that should be seen by sci fi fans along with those that appreciate a real thinking persons story. Also a big thumbs up to the special effects department as everything looks so fluid and believable (though you know it is CGI). All around a treat for all. Enjoy.",8,1,5,15 May 2015

Mama," A very well made horror/thriller
","Movie review:I had to pick one for Mothers day, and since I wanted to see this anyway, it works perfectly. Very good choice. Knowing first off Guillermo del Torro has his name in the mix (he produced it, among other things I am sure) I was aware it was going to be a good film. The story is about a family that is torn apart by a massive collapse in the stock market. Well, that more or less leads into the actual story. When the father of two young girls goes on a murder spree, including his estranged wife, he packs up his children and speeds off to destination unknown where he intends to commit suicide. After crashing off the road, the three wander into a broken down house in the forest and just before he pulls the trigger, a strange 'figure' snatches him away, leaving the children to fend for themselves. The oldest daughter, Victoria (Megan Charpentier) catches a glimpse of the 'figure' flying out the door with the father in tow, but her glasses were broken, so she could not make out what she saw. The two kids are left alone for 5 years before they are found, but how alone were they to survive on their own? The search was funded by an inheritance from his brother to find them. Now after a short legal battle, it is up to Lucas (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) and Annabel (Jessica Chastain) to raise the girls that had become feral animals that were now under a psychiatrists care. Dr. Dreyfuss (Daniel Kash) arranges for the new family to move into a home where he would have access to this mysterious case. The children slowly become accustomed to their 'new' parents but also it becomes apparent that 'Mama', as the children call her, is also there. Mamas presence is known by an appearance of black moths and electrical disturbances that often go unseen. At first this is playful things like games with the kids, etc. but when Mama gets jealous and pushes Lucas down the stairs, putting him into a coma, it is up to Anabel to raise the kids she was hesitant to do in the first place. As Mama makes her presence more known in the house, she puts 'dreams' into Anabels head so she can see what happened. From these dreams, we see Mama stab a nun and running away with a baby (named Lily) she stole. She is followed by the townspeople to a cliff where Mama and Lily dive off to their death. There is more to this which should be seen to put it together without writing all of it out. This may seem like other ghost stories, and in a way it is, but this has so much feeling as to the why Mama is so trapped and engaged with this children. The movie as a whole moves at a very nice pace and uses subtle times to develop the characters without taking up too much time. The use of Mama does start as more of a ghost-type figure but as it progresses, the anguish Mama is going through begins to show through.Since this is a horror movie, I would be failing in not pointing something out, this movie is very creepy. There are visuals and camera-work that are used that will really scare you. The entire production quality of this movie is top notch. Very little, if anything, is left untouched in the story. It was the little things that were done to create the atmosphere in this movie that really pushed it along and made it so enjoyable. All things done, including acting, cinematography, to editing all run us through this tormenting story of Mama and her sheer need for closure. This all leads up to a crescendo that cultivates into the finale of a story that even though may seem like the usual haunting, is nothing but usual at all. So if you are looking for a gorefest, this is not for you, but if you want a very well made horror/thriller that will say more to your mind than any blood splatter will give, this is for you. 7.4/10 IMDb 6.4 Boo, IMDb, I am normally agreeing with ya, but this film is highly recommended by me. ENJOY (as warned to a friend of mine, don't watch this one alone on Mothers Day)",Null,1,2,12 May 2013

Thor," Another fine Marvel film that breaks the superhero mold
","Movie review:OK, slightly behind (I kind of forgot to watch this) but excuses aside, I enjoyed this movie. Yes, I am a comic geek, so may be a tad biased, although admittedly I did not read 'Thor' so the rating is on movie merits alone. The movie follows the life of a 'G-d' in the form of Thor(Chris Hemsworth), who is the god of thunder. He is raised in Asgard to become the heir of the throne to a pseudo-Greek mythological type world of people with extraordinary powers. When Thors arrogance to unleash a war upon a race of frost giants that has been ensuing for many years breaks the code of a treaty of peace, Thor is banished from Asgard without his powers and his mighty hammer to the end of the worlds, or as we know it, Earth. Yes there is a side story to all this, but it is weaved between events on Asgard and Earth to tell the hows and whys of the occurrences leading to Thors punishment. Well, now on Earth, without any power and no sense of what being mortal actually is which leads to some humorous scenes, he meets his new friends by being hit by a car containing astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her associates Professor Selvig (Stellan Skarsgaard) and Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings). These lucky folks decide that he isn't some wandering drunk and help him on his plight to retrieve his magical hammer. During the relationship with Jane and back in Asgard, Thors brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is able to seize the throne of king as Odin (Anthony Hopkins) falls ill, but does Loki have some ulterior motives here? The movie moves on with a steady hand of extremely well done character development that being helmed by Kenneth Branagh did not surprise me at all. A master of making you believe in the characters is something no one does much better, and in the unbelievable story material he was given, he scores an A+. The scenes in Asgard look absolutely breathtaking, the scenes in the frost kingdom look so dismal you can almost feel the chill, and earth, well, that is just New Mexico, nothing exciting (but some very good camera-work helps here). Of course, there is going to be some exciting action sequences to tide you over, but this movie is really about the acting and chemistry of the cast which is something to appreciate greatly. I only wish they would've given a bit more time to the romance between Thor and Jane (yes, I did just type that). Their love story seemed to be an afterthought swept under the rug to keep the comic book story going. Ultimately this movie, and Marvel studios, again bring out a quality picture about a superhero, but doesn't just use eye candy action to wow the viewer, but uses real emotions to draw the audience into the trials and turmoils that occur. 6.8/10 IMDb 7.0. Oh, after the credits, there is a bit of more info about the Shield that unfolds which is part of the ongoing story of the Avengers. Enjoy.",7,0,1,17 May 2013
The Witch," A slow paced witchhunt
","My quick rating - 6,5/10. A sound and great looking movie that plays at the mind more for the horror aspect than it does with gore and loud scare moments. More of a thinking persons horror/thriller that plays out well in the atmosphere created. Even with the moderately short running time of just over an hour and a half, though, this movie seems to drag on quite a bit and may turn off casual moviegoers. Don't let that stop you from seeing a well rounded film that comes at a time where the more gore the better is the norm.Overall worth a watch but I am slightly unsure what all the media attention was all about. I believe if it were not for this, then many would not have even known about this flick. Being supported by the Satanic Church was odd but effective for the media to jump on.",7,0,1,12 August 2016
Prometheus," Very well made sci-fi movie which is a good thing
","My quick rating 7,5/10. This is an excellent sci-fi flick. Interesting way to start a review, eh? It looks spectacular visually and editing as well. The story itself is unique (i believe it was a comic book at some point) but either way the plot will draw you in. Noomi Rapace does an excellent job in the lead, but no surprise there, she is a great actress. I did find the other characters a tad bit irritating aside from the Captain. Charlize Theron was used sparingly so not much to say (I read she was also considered for the lead). The action scenes are paced nicely and are used when needed not overdone. When the action scenes were used, they were filmed so well even with the mix of CGI often but I almost didn't even notice, well, almost lol. The obvious influence of the late H.R.Giger was also a nice touch, giving homage to the great artwork he graced us with. At 2 hours long, I was hard pressed to even notice how long it was since I was that into the film. One way to end this short blurb is I am looking forward to the sequel which is coming in 2017. I believe any sci-fi fan would agree and will be looking forward to it as well. Non sci-fi fans most likely will appreciate an interesting story and well made movie so my final thought, see it.",8,3,5,20 August 2015
Straight Outta Compton," Phenomenal movie
","My quick rating - 8,1/10. Phenomenal movie. The story, even though it is a biography, is superb and was well crafted into a movie. The acting is top notch and considering the characters they had to play, it is amazing they pulled it off so well. Obviously the music speaks for itself so no need to go there. I can't hardly find a flaw in this film, every aspect was just done so darn well. I have to put this up there for movie of the year and I really wonder come Oscar time if we will be hearing about this one. Maybe not for the music category, being NWA and all lol but I can see some other categories for sure. I can't say enough about this truly captivating story and how the movie does such a great job telling it right up until the end. No spoilers in case people don't know the real life story. All I can say to sum it up is SEE IT. I bet you will watch it more than once. 'Yo Dre, I got something to say' Enjoy.",8,7,38,16 August 2015
Fifty Shades of Grey," Nicely packaged nonsense, boring, insult to moviegoers
","My quick rating - 4.0/10. Not gonna review,the movie is very boring. Steamy sex scenes? Nope. Acting you drawing you into a romance? Nope. A plot that wasn't a cookie cutter romance of the geeky girl gets the hot guy? Naw, that is exactly what it was. Redeeming quality? Even though it wasn't supposed to be a comedy, at times it didn't mean to be,it WAS actually funny. Didn't read the books but even those that did say this movie was just plain bad and did no justice, those that didn't read the book seem to flow the herd and follow the sheep into the field of fans saying the movie was good and NOW want to read the book. Kinda funny since those who read the book disliked the movie and those that liked the movie NOW want to read the book? Why, to find out how inferior the movie was? Basically the definition of following the herd. Well, my curiosity has been fulfilled and I can safely say, avoid, it is bland, drawn out (takes 5 minutes to dialog what a contract says? boring much) Well, appears I may have typed enough for a review,but not gonna poison my website with the review, but IMDb, here I come.",1,1,4,1 March 2015
John Wick: Chapter 2," Fun to count the amount of headshots
","My quick rating - 7,5/10. Pretty sure that is also what I gave the first one. Well, the retired hit-man is back. The commercial tells us so. I do appreciate this movie for a slightly different reason than the first one. Where the first did rely a bit more on the story and development of the character, which is a good thing, this one doesn't dabble too much into that and just goes straight at you with action. Another good thing. The sequences are strung together so well, it is just nice to sit there and take each moment in. I could do without taking a vulnerable Reeves and turning him into a bulletproof superhero, such as this movie did. Yes, before you say anything, I know fully well this movie is paying homage to the great action movies out of Hong Kong, but even John Woo may have questioned Keanus invincibility at points of this flick. But checking reality at the door to watch this is not a problem and a good time to be had. Director Chad Stahelski showed that his massive amount of time shooting stunts for more films than I can name (and he was tied with the much missed Brandon Lee as stunt double in 'The Crow') pays off behind the camera lens. This may or may not be a spoiler, but I expect John Wick 3 to continue to go over the top. And a rumor of a Highlander redo? Sign me up.",8,0,2,17 June 2017
The Nice Guys," Quality buddy chemistry flick
","My quick rating - 7,8/10. Crowe and Gosling team up in an unlikely crime/mystery film that just works. The characters are acted out just the way they should be which is often rare in buddy flicks. Crowe plays the heavy while Gosling plays the heavy drinker. They get paired up when Gosling is a Private detective working a case that Crowe inadvertently gets roped into. The two of course have no interest in working together which adds to the comedy. This movie is filled with underlying dark humor that sometimes does miss the mark, but overall is entertaining. Also incorporating some little shout outs to spotting the time frame (Tim Allens name on the marquee at the Comedy Store for an example) points out the writers/directors attention to detail. Little things such as this pop up to make you appreciate the care that was put into the film. The story itself moves along very well as the mystery of Amelia (Margaret Qualley) plays out in the porn industry. Explaining what I mean would be in spoiler territory, so watch it to see. I will say that after the majority of the film being so good, the ending just seemed to run out of gas. It didn't let the audience down, it just didn't live up to the excellent work that was already presented. But overall, a very well made movie and I could be open to a sequel if they so chose.",Null,1,3,3 September 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," Excellent movie that does justice to the series
","My quick rating - 8,3/10. There really is no reason for a long winded review. Too many great things about this movie to point out. The way that 'Max' is used was done so well to make the main character seem as though he isn't the focus. Furiousa (Charlize Theron) was astounding in her role as the heavy (strange, huh?). The movie itself starts off in high gear and rarely lets up to allow us lucky viewers a moment to catch our breath. Visually stunning in a very dark way such as the others were : A world were gas=gold and water is a commodity. Violence is non-important, only survival is. So well doe throughout with every bit of attention paid to detail to make you feel the desperation. I could go on and on as many reviews I am sure have, but it is tough to keep up, I may just have to watch it again. Go in knowing you will like this movie for many reasons. It knocked me back a step since I am used to Hollywood screwing up true greats but this time they definitely got it right. Enjoy, I know I did.",8,1,10,29 June 2015
Warm Bodies," Well made, original take on the zombie world.
","Movie review:What an entertaining flick this was. I often don't start by saying this, but you should definitely see this movie. The story is about R (Nicholas Hoult) who is a zombie that is just plain sick of his mundane existence. Yes, you did read that right, the central character is a zombie. The zombie apocalypse has already occurred and the zombies quarantined outside of a walled in city just go about business as usual, wander around, groan, walk into things, the usual zombie like stuff. But R is different, he is lonely, bored and looking for companionship. The closest he has is a fellow zombie, M ( Rob Corddry).This of course is difficult because, well, he is a zombie. The audience is privy to what R is thinking which leads to some very amusing scenes from the very start. Well, like zombies often do, they get hungry, and need to travel to find food since they have already eaten everyone local to their area. When they set out for a search for humans, they run across a team from the city (that is run by the one and only John Malkovich) that is searching for pharmaceuticals. Well, in the zombie like feast, we learn that when a zombie eats a brain, he absorbs the victims memories, sort of like a daydream, and during the melee R attacks and eats the brain of our heroines boyfriend. Julie (Teresa Palmer), the aforementioned heroine, is saved by R and takes her back to where the zombies 'live' In this time, R slowly develops a small vocabulary to try and communicate but of course, she is still at first terrified of him. But this is a romantic movie and the two begin to develop a strange sort of symbiotic relationship, hers is need to survive, his is desire. Now this is basically the meat of the movie, but there hasn't been an antagonist yet. Enter the bonies, zombies that are far to gone and have no feeling but hunger, so we can call them the really bad zombies, not the regular zombies. When the bonies realize that not only is a human (food) hanging around the zombies, but the zombies are slowly regaining more human like traits. So, like bad guys do, they go after R and Julie. By this point, R and Julie are 'friends' and decide to warn the people of the city of the impending attack from the bonies and zombies alike (the ones that haven't started feeling). This movie plays out just so incredibly well, you may find yourself forgetting this is a zombie flick. Yet don't expect blood and gore, it is virtually non-existent. What does exist is an extremely original and well made movie that finds a way to excel where typical romantic movies fail, that is by making you believe in the characters so much, even under the ridiculous premise that it has and if you can look past that, you will absolutely adore this movie. Fine performances are turned in by Hoult and Palmer to make you really sympathize with the world they are stuck in. An excellent movie all around from slow moving amusement to a nice finale that will make you smile. 7.6/10 IMDb 7.1 My only gripe, I know they needed to use cgi, but it was pretty bad. I know, low budget. Very small gripe though. Thanks Bec for viewing this with me, it was nice to have someone in chat to laugh with, even if it was just typing LOL to halfway across the planet. Not very easy to watch a movie with someone when they are 15 hours ahead of ya. Timing is a b*tch.",8,1,2,2 June 2013
Alien: Covenant," Good tie in and well made sci fi flick
","My quick rating 6,6/10. After being drawn into the Alien world basically created in Prometheus (which did branch from the more horror 'Alien' and action of 'Aliens') I was glad to hear they were going to give us a sequel, which is part of bridging the gaps created in all of the alien movies thus far. I could attempt to explain the whole thing, but I don't actually know all the tidbits and don't feel like doing research. I do know this is basically bridging the gap towards Alien, the first film. After 'Prometheus', the synthetic David was left behind, and a crew 10 years later stumbles across an abandoned planet where he so happens to still be. They are on a mission for recolonization so in cargo are 2000 humans. Can you see where this is going? Having Ridley Scott behind the camera lens is a treat and it shows in the great scenes being put together throughout. The worlds created by HR Giger are again used some, not to a great extent, just enough to still look stunning. This one does add a bit more action into the film, which I was glad to see and is edited very nicely. Fassenbender does a good job in his double duty role, and they did a decent job of explaining as well. A nice beginning with a conversation between Walter (the newer version of David) and his creator. A deep question asked to start the movie off. Being a big fan of the whole series, I was thoroughly entertained but I can see why die hard fans are a bit annoyed. The actual aliens aren't used quite enough and for much of the movie, they aren't the big aliens that nightmares are made of but little aliens that give women nightmares (if you have seen the first 'Alien' you know what that means). Just like I was quite perturbed I didn't see 'Prometheus' in the theater, I would've liked to see this in the theater as well, but honestly, not sure it would've been worth 20 bucks...maybe 12 ;) And now that the bridge has been laid for the two time frames to meet, I wonder where this will go next......",7,3,11,3 June 2017
