Walk the Line," The story of one talent
","The idea of shooting a biopic dedicated to the life of the legendary musician Johnny Cash came to the film director James Mangold many years ago. It took him seven years to collect all the information, all the facts about Johnny Cash and his life. The movie covers the period from 1955 to 1968. Over the thirteen years Cash experienced so many things: starting from the exultation of triumph due to the large fees, affairs with the girls and finishing with the bitterness of defeat caused by divorce and drug addiction. 
The life of many famous celebrities proves the fact that their life is full of temptations and few of actors and singers can fight against them. Johnny Cash finally managed to conquer them. He found the strength to return to the stage, and not just to return, but to multiply everything that he had achieved before the life crisis. This return would not take place without the assistance of June Carter, whom Cash dedicated his best songs.
Mangold did not try to reinvent the wheel, trying to bring to the genre his 'director's vision'. He just showed the real life of the real person with all ups and downs.
Mangold's film is primarily a tribute to the great musician and his great talent. 'Walk the line' is a perfect reflection of the times when such geniuses as Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis Presley, Roy Orbison, Bob Dylan and of course Johnny Cash made first steps in their carriers. Director managed to recreate the atmosphere of those years, or at least he offered a plausible film that gives the viewers the opportunity to enjoy the life story of this brilliant singer.",7,1,1,23 April 2018
