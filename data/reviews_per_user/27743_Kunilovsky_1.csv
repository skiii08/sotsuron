The Devil's Advocate," Masterpiece
","Very impressive, astonishing and absolutely 'must have' movie. Although Keanu's performance not as good as Al Pachino's. While watching this movie you'll shiver at times and your heart will beat faster as you'll see some erotic scenes. This moive is definitely outstanding one.",10,1,2,31 October 2002
