Insidious: Chapter 2," Complete disappointment
","I was facing a decision making with my friends of which movie we should watch, most of them had this idea about watching HORROR. and we found Insidious Chapter 2. i rushed to check IMDb before we book and read some reviews about it. and 7 in IMDb is actually promising! and most of the reviews and votes where high. But, we were honestly was shocked and disappointed about everything in this movie, the story didn't add anything new, it's the same as watching a horror movie 20 years ago, so many things didn't make any sense. and the acting was not that good, except for Rose Byrne, she did great as ACTING. but the rest were in a comedy movie by mistake. we really wanted to be scared and jump off our chairs, but that didn't work at all except for very few scenes. I Don't recommend this movie to anyone, specially Horror fans. There are other great horror movies which can stick to your memory, such as The Others and the Sixth sense.",2,5,9,17 October 2013
