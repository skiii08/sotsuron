The Incredible Hulk," Bruce Banner has problems to control his anger. When he gets angry, he turns into a green monster called Hulk.
","This movie is much BETTER than Ang Lee's movie because it has a short screenplay, incredible effects and great actors. Edward Norton's performance is better than Eric Bana's. The Hulk from 2008 movie looks more real than the previous Hulk. The Abomination is a fantastic villain. On this movie, there's more action and the screenplay is identical to the 70's TV series. Ang Lee's movie screenplay is not bad, but the problem is that it is too much long and it isn't a screenplay that fans expect for this type of movie. Industrial Light & Magic didn't make it a bad Hulk effect, but it would be easier to use a body building and paint it. Rhythm and Hues made a Hulk that stands up to his appearance in comics. And it looks too much monstrous. In my opinion, Louis Leterrier's movie is the original version of The Incredible Hulk. Now I understand why Ang Lee's Hulk doesn't have THE INCREDIBLE at the title.",10,2,3,29 May 2011
