It," The aura from 80's is back and that's great
","***This my first review ever in IMDb, sorry if my English is bad** I was so excited for this movie but I got really skeptical when i was reading all this negative reviews here in IMDb. So let me get this straight, if you are a fan of the 80s golden decade of horror movies like my self GO AND WATCH IT NOW, if your taste of horror movies is different from that you probably this is not for you. I loved every minute of the movie i didn't get bored as others said. It was a horror movie and not a comedy. Don't read the negative reviews this movie is an '8' not more not less. I can wait for the second part...",8,3,5,15 September 2017
