Airlift," Airlift - Another magnificent movie in Akshay Kumar's career.
","Airlift is a Brilliant movie driven by Akshay Kumar in a splendid way. The conditions and the typical human attitude in that disaster were well portrayed in the celluloid. Must watch movie by every Indian. Nimrat Kaur's performance was excellent too. Akshay again proved that he only can do such kind of movies. I would say A Special 26, A Baby and An Airlift. A good start of 2016 for Bollywood. This movie will definitely bag some awards.Inaamulhaq, Purab Kohli also did their roles very well.Hats off, Akshay.Cheers, Prakash",10,3,5,24 January 2016
