Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Magic wasn't there but a seed was planted
","Most people comment about how they didn't like this or that. Or this wasn't just right. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to recreate the magic of the first one. Everything was so new and different and no one knew what to expect. The surprise of finding out who Luke's father was, the lurking empire, the rebellion and its desperation, etc. Then Han, a simple smuggler who didn't care about anything comes along and the kids changed him. That was the magic of the first one. The story line (and having decent actors goes a long way).Keep in mind, we all had many expectations going in and when they didn't get met, we were disappointed. This has happened to me in the past when someone really hypes up a movie and then it doesn't meet my expectations it reflects badly on a movie. Usually, I prefer not to know what other people say about a film before seeing it to go in fresh. Star Wars doesn't have that pleasure and TPM didn't hit a homer for sure.That said, I think that George planted a seed for a good sequel. I know that even the people who didn't like the first movie will rush out to see it. Why? Because we thrive on Star Wars. Even sub par Star Wars. With all of these comments that I am sure have trickled into Georges hands, I am expecting a much better run on Episode II.Last thing, if you hadn't seen TPM and read all these comments would you still go and see it? Did you see it more than once? Will you rent/buy it when it comes out? I think for most of us it will be yes.See you May, 2002.",Null,0,1,17 September 1999
