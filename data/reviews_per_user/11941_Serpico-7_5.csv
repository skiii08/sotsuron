Spartacus," The best historical epic ever made
","There is much more to this than can be discovered form just one viewing. Initially the scale of the movie and the strength of the acting will make a great impression.  Gradually you may begin to see the imagery (well this is a Kubrick film), and then you will realise just how special this is.",10,3,6,14 February 1999
LÃ©on: The Professional," A superior thriller
","Leon one of a handful of action movies that works at a level beyond that of explosions and big guns.  Admittedly it has both of these, and is very violent, but it also has a character all of its own.Luc Besson blurs the lines of good and evil, and unlike others  involved in this genre, actually portrays his 'action hero' as human rather than superhuman.  Reno's portrayal of Leon is superb, and is neatly balanced by Gary Oldman's (a bad guy in good guy's shoes).  What really makes the movie special is the relationship between Leon and Matilda (Natalie Portman). Slightly reminiscent, and certainly more effective, than that between De Niro and Foster in Taxi Driver, we see a somewhat disfunctional family unit form.  It is not often that a film can be said to be exciting and deeply touching.The film shows that when European and American cinema collide something extra special is created.",10,0,1,27 February 1999
Gandhi," An exceptional film about an exceptional man
","Gandhi was probably the most deserving Oscar winner of best picture in the 1980's.  What really makes this film special is Ben Kingsley.  Both the man and the movie required an exceptional performance, and that is what is delivered.  All of the major events in India's push for independence are portrayed, though I do think that a greater Indian rather than British interpretation of these events is needed to make this film an all-time classic.  A must-see.",10,8,15,27 February 1999
Lawrence of Arabia," The greatest motion picture of all time
","It is difficult to find the superlatives to convey the scale, beauty, drama, art and sheer achievement of this film.  Every shot is a major achievement of photography.  Every performer is exceptional (it is probably the best cast ever assembled), with Peter O'Toole giving a performance without parallel (which, shockingly, did not win an Oscar).  The story and settings are pure epic.  David Lean shows himself as one of the most gifted directors in th history of cinema, giving us an unforgettable experience.",10,0,2,26 February 1999
Life Is Beautiful," A superb tragi-comedy
","Roberto Benigni's Vita e bella, is in many ways similar to Chaplin's Great Dictator.  Both are comic attacks on fascism, but the former's is the more successful.  Benigni initially accesses the emotions of his audience through simple comedy, which is a pleasant mix of Keaton and Chaplin.  Romance ensues with his real life wife Nicoletta Braschi.  The first half of this film has been seen by various critics as being inferior to the second, but this is certainly not the case.  In the first section we follow the delightful romance that will eventually lead to marriage and the creation of the wonderful Giosue (Giorgio Cantarini).It is the first half where the audience can laugh the loudest and delight at the immense comedy talent of Benigni.  Unlike so many films nowadays there is nothing crude or course, his is simple innocent humour, which is all the more effective.  The way he ties together little strand in the film to create comedy elements shows a great writing ability, and a mastery of timing when it comes to their execution on screen.  Various incidents related to the rise of anti-semitism and fascism in Italy show that there are sinister forces at work which come to the fore in the second segment.Guido (Benigni) moves events on from Tuscany in 1939 to the last year of the war in a concentration camp.  In this period he and Dora (Braschi) have had their son Giosue (Cantanarini).  The five year old greatly reminds me of Toto in Cinema Paradiso, and plays an equally important role in his prospective film (though in Paradiso's case it is at the beginning of the movie).  The relationship between the two is very similar to that of Jackie Coogan and Charlie Chaplin (though Benigni, unlike Chaplin, keeps the best of the comedy moments).  Guido attempts to keep from the boy the horrors of what is going on, and this eventually manifests itself as a game where the aim is to score 100 points, with the winner winning a real tank (which, of course appeals to the young boy).  Comic moments are still present, that involving Guido's translation of the rules of the camp is particularly notable, but it becomes somewhat more difficult to laugh when we consider the gravity of what is going on.The emphasis begins shifts, and we realise that this is a film about human spirit above all else.  Guido not only appeals to the audience due to his comedy and sheer pleasantness, but also in the way that he loves his family and the measures that he will go to to protect them.This is certainly no Schindler's List, but it never pretends to be. Occasionally events seem a little contrived, but this does seem to work in the film's favour.  However, this film avoids the tendency of Hollywood to go far over the top in emotional and credibility terms.Benigni shines like a lantern throughout the picture, showing that he is a talent, not only in comedy terms, that far outshines his peers.  Cantanari is a delight, and Braschi also plays her part well.  There is even an appearance by The Magnificent Seven's Horst Buchholz as Doctor Lessing, a man who events change for the worse.Please don't let the fact that it, to all but the Italians, is a foreign language film.  The language itself adds a beauty of form to the film, much as it did in the case of Il Postino.  This has to be a certainty for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar, though something tells me that it will be overlooked for other awards as it is Italian and not a mainstream English language picture.Please see this film, and make up your own mind.  It is appealing in so many different ways that I'm sure that you will not be disappointed.",9,254,336,26 February 1999
