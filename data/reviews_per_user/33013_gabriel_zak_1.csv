Miracle," Medals were given to the wrong teams
","I really liked Miracle, even though I have been warned about the possible cheezieness in Walt Disney productions. But this movie was great, close to perfect. It might have been perfect if they only could decide which team that actually won which medal.When the medals were given out to the three remaining teams, it didn't match what Kurt Russel or 'Herb' was stating just before, and I quote ' Two days later we won over Finland...', while a short scene shows Finnish hockey players facing USA in the last game. Made me wonder why Sweden was getting a medal and Finland wasn't taking their part in the medal ceremonies scene at all.I am originally from Sweden and I can tell the difference between Finland's and Sweden's colors. But it still didn't quite fit with everything else. Since I go the feeling that something was fishy, I decided to check it up online, and to my surprise, USA won the finals, but over USSR, and Sweden got third, playing Finland in the Semi-finals.So this means that the whole movie is correct until it actually matters, which team won what. 'Do you believe in Miracles, yes, but not that USA was playing against Finland in the finals, they played with USSR.'",Null,0,2,6 October 2004
