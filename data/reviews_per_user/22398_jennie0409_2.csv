The Ring," Must-see for scary movie lovers
","This movie is a definite must-see for scary movie lovers. 'The Ring' has tons of twists and turns. When you think you've finally figured something out, another curve ball is thrown at you. This is absolutely the freakiest movie I've ever seen. The actors and actresses in the movie have done smaller parts and less popular movies, for the most part, but I believe this could be a big break for some of them. I think it could have helped the movie to have a big name or two, but if you go for the horror aspect, you won't be disappointed. I have never seen such a scary movie, which is also a comedy. The whole theater will be laughing throughout, as well as screaming and jumping! This is a thoroughly enjoyable film, and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves a great horror film. If you aren't good with scary movies, however, this won't be your favorite film.",9,0,0,2 November 2002
The Patriot," Proud to be an American
","This movie is simply incredible! To all those people who look for all the mistakes in the movie, both historically and in the story line, I say you have too much time on your hands....WAY too much time on your hands. Give it a break. This film is supposed to be fairly accurate, but not completely, because you have to add the element of drama to the history to make a movie. This movie is meant to evoke emotion, and in me, it does just that. The gorgeous and talented Heath Ledger gives an outstanding performance, as does the insatiable Mel Gibson and so many others in the fabulous cast of this movie. This movie is fairly gory, and while at first glance, I'd be 'grossed out' and not want to watch the movie any further, this is a great thematic element. It makes you truly feel for the soldiers and think about how much is lost in each and every battle, in every war. It makes you appreciate more greatly what so many men and women have given of themselves so that we, as Americans, can be free. For all those critics out there who say this movie is unpatriotic, you couldn't be any more wrong. This movie makes you feel proud to be an American, which is exactly what the moviemakers set out to do with this one (other than make a few bucks!). That's the very essence of patriotism.",10,1,4,25 December 2002
