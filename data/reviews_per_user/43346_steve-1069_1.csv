The Longest Yard," are you kidding me...
","What a worthless remake... Adam Sandler as a former professional football player, a disgrace. Have you seen 'Little Nicky', Billy Madison... it just goes on and on. I swear the making of movies is in the toilet. I must mention the other stupid football movie he made... the only thing about that was it was his stupid movie, not a remake. I feel sorry for the actors that have to lower themselves for work, by doing crap like this. I'm watching this crap right now... I have never seen such a worthless worthless worthless piece of junk in my entire life. The movie that used to be at the top of the crap list was Harlem Nights... any Adam Sandler movie will knock that from the top. Athletes as actors... need I say more.... rappers as actors... need I say more. This is just another example of the Hollywood machine churning out crap after crap... I have stopped going to the theater... and soon there won't be anything left on cable. Thanks",1,6,11,9 July 2006
