Mission: Impossible III," Can't want more from an action movie
","I don't really think one should expect more from a movie in this genre - it is fast, well shot, played expertly by Cruise, Fishburne and Hoffman (who go well beyond the usual portraying of support characters) and some of the action scenes are truly breath-taking. Although the first two installments in the M:I saga were nothing short of excellent, I do believe the third one to be the best in the series. Maybe one could find some minor discrepancies and drawbacks if he were to dig really hard into the story and its visual representation but I don't feel that would make justice to MI:3.",8,0,1,24 June 2006
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Would you sacrifice the world to give life to your loved one?
","I am a fan of part one and therefore could not wait to lay my eyes on the sequel. Finally, it did 'come to a cinema near me' - in the form of a preview shown at an awkward time. I did not think twice - even if I had to pay extra and stay late.The movie started slow. First, they showed us - in a couple of dated stills - the history of the prequel: how Hellboy was originally found - and then jumped a few years into the future to tell us how he first learned about the Golden Army. This first scene - with the little red horned boy brushing his teeth - left me with mixed feelings, it looked so odd and out of context.However, the film starts to pick up speed and really gets better by the minute. Prince Nuada is introduced with his swift martial arts moves that - I dare say - put to shame some of the scenes in the Matrix. But most importantly - the story is well thought through and when you think about it after leaving the cinema, it still 'holds water' so nothing of the beautiful imagery is spilled.And beautiful it is! It is breathtakingly hauntingly beautiful... There are so many fantastic characters, real and unreal blend perfectly - both the work of the CGI experts and the writers of the script. Most if not all characters are designed and executed with such perfect attention to detail on both levels - philosophical and visual - that it must really take a lot of thinking to find a weak spot.But trust me when I tell you, that you will not have a lot of time left for thinking. The visual storytelling talents of Del Toro have always been praised, but here the strength of their expression truly reaches a peak! Elves, Trolls, Gods of the forest and Giants of stone - one might think that he has seen it all in the LODR trilogy, however this director's vision is something else. Elves are white and ethereal but there is also something wicked in their chalky faces and cat-like eyes. Trolls are ugly, menacing and at the same time - comic. There is a plethora of cunning gadgets and a universe of seamless magic co-existing in an uneasy equilibrium in Hellboy 2.There are also some laughs - well thought through and perfectly timed - that were maybe missing from part one. But the most interesting of it all lies not in the visual stunts or clever tricks - it is in the simple fact that this film tells a moving story that touches the heart. It is a story about love and what it can make us do: betray and kill those closest to us, or lay our life down to save them - and be ready to destroy the world in the process...Remember I told you that the film gradually picks up speed? This masterful dance gets almost hectic towards the end - both visually, philosophically and emotionally. The mechanics of the Golden Army are deadly and perfect in their own way. Our hero saves the day, but we are told that he lives for the world to get destroyed. 'Would you sacrifice everything you know to give life to your loved one?' It seems that there is no correct answer to this question. And if that is so, then we are all going down in flames - just like Guillermo del Toro predicts in this second installment of his Hellboy saga.Go watch this movie. It is better than the polished and hollow 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull', because it has heart. It is much better than 'Wanted', because it is visually stunning, but not showy and it has moral integrity. It is even better than 'The Hulk' - which is the best of the three mentioned but still looks one-dimensional and shallow when compared to del Toro's masterpiece. I would not say it is perfect... but for its kind it is not just engaging - it is captivating, and it is a lesson in philosophical storytelling, given by a Master.",9,4,9,11 July 2008
Watchmen," This Movie is a Joke
","This is easily the worst high-profile movie I saw in 2009.Here is what you get:(1) a lethargic action thriller riddled with dialog exchanges that could put an insomniac to sleep, (2) some dark and psychotic scenes full of perverted violence, (3) a pathetic sex scene with latex-clad superheroes, and (4) an absurd ending which the director and screen writer may have considered quite wise, but is in fact complete and utter nonsense.The whole movie is a joke, so stupid at times, that I laughed helplessly at my own misfortune, having paid to watch it.By the time it ended most other people had left the cinema.It seems that even if one makes a meaningless, long, overly violent (at times) and otherwise profoundly boring movie with an absurd ending, there will still be people out there who would feel passionate about it.For an artist this should be a depressing thought.",1,7,14,19 September 2010
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," This is what happens when you hire a cartoon director to make an action flick
","I only give this movie 5/10 since it is supposed to be so high class and a lot of money was spent making it.Apart from that it is the worst installment in the Mission Impossible saga. It has by far the worst script so far, the worst dialogue, the least believable action scenes, etc.I had a bad feeling about the movie the moment I saw the director's name. The guy is amazing when he makes cartoons, but MI:4 proves that cartoons and films with live actors are two different things. Everything here feels fake and typical cartoonish dialogue and 'funny' moments simply do not work.It is also the first time when Tom has gone wrong when green-lighting a project, and I hope this does not turn into a trait of his.It is very regrettable that a script so full of stereotypes (like the ages-old stereotype of Russia and Russians that Hollywood has been feeding us with), the stereotype of the Arab world, etc. have been so easily and readily adopted by a director as smart as this one.I am really sorry they made this film, and really sorry I watched it.",5,6,14,30 December 2011
Reservoir Dogs," As effective a vehicle as a baby-walker
","I do not believe 'Reservoir Dogs' is a great film. It is worth seeing, yes, but mostly because of all the hype that has been created around it.If one tries to think with his own head, he is sure to agree that Tarantino's first movie is too pretentious and uninteresting, its space design is claustrophobic, and there is way too much blood that serves no purpose. It cannot keep the viewer's attention like 'Pulp Fiction' and it is far from the flamboyant directing of 'Kill Bill'.",7,0,1,11 February 2007
Lord of War," Good Message - Wrong Words
","Given the presence of high-quality actors like Cage and the importance of the theme, I would say that this movie falls short of expectations, because of the uninteresting way it chooses to tell you 'truths about life'. Although there is a clear and distinct storyline in 'Lord of War', I would not say that this is a story-driven movie, since there is hardly anything out-of-the-ordinary in it. What 'Lord of War' really is - is a 'slogan-driven' narrative. There is a short film-within-the film in the opening sequence that tells the story of the making and firing of a bullet. It starts at the factory where the bullet is made, then follows the route of the box full of bullets, and finally a black man shoots his Kalashnikov rifle, loaded with this same bullet, which zips through the air and bursts someone's head open. That's the whole message, told with the immaculate perfection of shortness. The moment it was finished I just knew that the rest of the story would just drag on and on, because, really, there is nothing more to it than that: dealing in bullets is dealing in death. Though true, it is totally unoriginal - we all know it and there is no reason to make another film saying the same words. Cage plays well, but there is something profoundly wrong about his character: he has no remorse, no second thoughts, no conscience. Where, then, is the drama? Nothing seems to touch him and, frankly, that's exactly the way how I feel about this film. Secondly, Cage's character is confronted with no real antagonists and therefore - no real challenges - in the movie. The CIA officer is completely lost against Cage and the African warlords all like him, so what is supposed to create suspense here? All in all it's an average achievement with some instances of particularly uninspiring thinking and the characters' words are as slogan-like and lifeless as they can be.",5,1,4,30 March 2006
Taken 2," A Solid Sequel
","Every now and then an engaging and well made film comes along that is either misunderstood or falls victim of a general negative trait in reviews that do not make it justice. I had read some negative opinions before going to see the film, so I wasn't expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised.Not sure why people did not like it. The first 'Taken' was not 'perfect' or 'best in its genre', but it was fun, and Liam's character was interesting, well acted and recognizable, so these are the exact traits 'Taken 2' builds upon.The story kept me interested and the solutions, devices, information seemed believable and were quite engaging. On several occasions I was at the edge of my seat, so the story-telling technique was good.What I did not like was the acting of Rade Serbedzija. Don't get me wrong: I like the guy, but I believe he has been continually given the wrong parts. He is simply not menacing enough to play the bad guy. For some reason any time a Russian, Turkish, Serbian, etc. mobster character is scripted, they turn to him to play it and he simply cannot cope with it. It is easy to see that Rade is good natured and has an agreeable character in real life, and this aura of 'goodness' carries on to the movies.At any rate – watch the movie and make up your own mind.",8,0,1,6 November 2012
Sin City," As Bad as It Gets
","I know it sounds like an exaggeration, but I will say it anyway. 'Sin City' is probably the worst high-profile movie I have ever seen.I wasn't too happy with Tarantino's 'Kill Bill' and Rodriguez's 'Dusk Till Dawn' can hardly be called a masterpiece, but their flaws seem almost negligible when compared to 'Sin City''s total lapse of reason.It is a film without a heart, made by people who have drifted so far away in their extreme vision of cinema art that the resulting product could not be saved by the impeccable acting, solid direction and innovative looks.'Sin City' is so full of pointless violence that there is hardly anything else in it.Do I need to be a fan of the original comics to appreciate how 'true to the original' the film managed to stay? Is that such a virtue? The story lacks any coherence, the dialog is so flat, they could have omitted it altogether.The fact that the film's overall rating on this site is way above 8.0 comes to illustrate the sad truth that no matter how bad a work of art is, there will still be people who admire it.For an Artist that should be a depressing thought.",1,30,64,19 December 2005
