Who Framed Roger Rabbit," The one TRUE movie that's perfect for all ages.
","I use to love this movie, when I was kid. Everyday, I would put the video into my VCR, and just be entertained at all the wacky slapstick humor that went on, in this movie.As I got older, I thought I wouldn't like the movie like I had use to, when in fact I had appreciated the movie even more. It was then I knew this movie was the one movie that anyone can watch and still love it, even after childhood.Allow me to explain: When your a kid, all you see is real-life people and cartoon characters coming together in a silly who-dun-it, movie. That's it! However, once you get older, you begin to realize more than that. You see as to WHY Roger Rabbit was the one being framed. Who the killer is, and why s/he did it. Plus, the purpose to Eddie Valiant's brother being talked about throughout the movie. That, and the plot itself.I have seen other childhood movies, only to look at them and see it as a movie only meant for children, such as 'Wizard of Oz', 'Willie Wonka', 'Cinderrella', and many others. But this movie stands out. This one doesn't always have those child-like humors, like the others do. I'm not saying that it's a bad thing to have that kind of humor, I'm only saying this movie is more down-to-earth, than the others.I don't know many movies have this kind of charisma that 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' does, so believe me when I say a movie like this is something one can watch again, and again, even after childhood.",10,0,0,12 October 2005
Underworld," Could have been better
","I thought this movie could have had some better fights. Allow me to explain: If you see this movie, most of the fights involve guns, guns, and more guns. I was hoping that the vampires and the werewolves would go head on, and they do, only cutting to a blackout, with lots of yelling and chomping, in the background. The only head-on fight was the final fight. The rest were shoot-outs.The plot was different, but I think it could have been better. It was mainly searching for someone that might be related to werewolves.I honestly think that if the fights were a lot better, perhaps the movie could have been pretty good.So, all in all, the action made this rating a little low, for me.It's not bad of a movie, but I think it needs less guns, and more fists.",3,0,1,2 February 2005
Batman Begins," Best....Batman....EVER!!!
","I have seen the other batman movies, but this one...WOW! There's something about this movie that stands out from all the other comic book films. The other four Batman movies made the villains look so off the wall. Meanwhile, Batman Begins makes the villains look more political, than anything else. The villains in the other Batman movies had their own hide-out, and their men wore uniforms most of the time. Don't you think out of all that, the government would step in and put a stop to all this? In Batman Begins, the villains try not to make themselves noticeable. They might be involved with the political issues, that way the government wouldn't think anything of it. I'm assuming that because of it, the government won't suspect anything. THAT, I believe is the work of a true villain.This new Batman is a lot tougher and meaner, than the other batman's, and you gotta love that! Plus, you have to wonder how in the world Bruce Wayne got all this equipment, without someone finding out. Surely, he couldn't have made all this stuff on his own, such as the batmobile (Which, let me say, is a MONSTER of a car). There had to be someone to have helped him out, and fortunately there was (And you probably already know who).I could go on about what makes Batman Begins the best comic book film ever made, but I know you wouldn't want to read all that. So I will leave you with this: Watch this movie! I can assure you that this will not look like a comic book movie, but rather a man in a costume whose out to bring justice into his city.You won't be disappointed.",10,1,1,19 June 2005
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," I liked it
","Alright, to start off, this is coming from a guy who has never played Resident Evil, however, friends are a great sorce of information. From what they have said, everyone was given a heads-up that not EVERYTHING from the game was going to be in this movie. Some things were gonna be added, some weren't going to be in there, and some based on the game were put on there. My RE friends liked the movie, knowing full-heartedly the outcome of what was going to happen. But from a person who never played the game, I have to say that it was well done. I like the writing (Mike Epps stole the show, by the way), the directing was good. All in all, not too shabby. But, if you're a RE player, don't take my word for it. If you haven't played the game, check out the movie and see what you think.",Null,1,1,9 November 2004
