Skyfall," A little old Bond.... A little new Bond.
","James Bond has always been a sort of cut out character, I mean after twenty some odd films of which I've only see a fraction I feel like I know him just like the long lost uncle that only comes to town for thanksgiving once every five years or so. When a bar tender ask James what he would like to drink or an extremely active girl ask him whats under his coat. I've got an idea of what he is going to say. People probably identify with Bond in there own way make up stories of how he could live so many years and still look so young or get shot at so many times and still remain free of holes, all fans reinitialize and that part of what makes the character so great we want to be him for all of the reason we say are unrealistic. That is what makes James Bond....James Bond.This film to me is a very good mixing of what has been done before and work as well as dazzling a little bit of a fresh tone to make it new and exciting. The film has a very good easy to follow story, without spoiling anything for you it's very easy to follow and for the most part is vary straight forward which makes it very easy to identify with the characters it gives you time to think about emotion of the character who in the past while good, where sometimes just there to get from one action scene to the next. The character are a bit more developed and the motive of the main characters is very clear. Visually the movie is quite stunning the vibrate colors and lust mix of landscapes and warm indoor quarters really set the tone for the movie and amerce you in the story. Often the story is told through visuals and colors as well which is kind of rare to see in a Bond picture. The acting is excellent everyone puts there piece of the puzzle together so well you lose yourself and believe the people you are watching are truly those characters.In all Skyfall mixes the old with the new in such a way that it is a sure fire can't miss for any Bond fan and a lurking delight for those just in the mood for a good movie with a great story good acting and grand visuals.",8,2,7,11 November 2012
