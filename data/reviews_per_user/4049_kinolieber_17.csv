Vertigo," Hitchcock in Love **SPOILER ALERT**
","I saw this film for the first time when I was in my twenties in 1969 and was not impressed. My opinion since that initial viewing had always been that (*SPOILER ALERT*) it was one of the few Hitchcock films that did not reward repeated viewings since so much of the film is taken up by the initial deception. Once you know who 'Madeleine' really is, that first hour is simply tedious.Then, when I was in my forties, I saw the restored film at New York's Ziegfeld Theatre in 70 mm. I fully expected to be bored by it. Instead, it was one of the most powerfully emotional film experiences I have ever had.
'Heartbreaking' is not a word I ever thought of applying to a Hitchcock film, but that is exactly what Vertigo is. I have seen it a number of times since its restoration, and far from being tedious, it seems richer and more complex, and yes, more heartbreaking each time. The final image of Scottie standing on that ledge is devastating. Is he there to look one last time at his love object or to follow her by jumping to his own death? Brilliantly, Hitchcock fades out on the image.
After seeing the film recently, I was amazed by how it breaks all the rules of the suspense genre. The way it reveals its 'surprise ending' two thirds of the way through the film, and then completely changes focus, first generating suspense over whether Scottie will discover Judy's secret, then over whether Judy will discover that he HAS discovered her secret, and then over what he intends to do about it. Finally, in the film's most wrenching turnabout, we experience Scottie's incredible rage over what has been done to him (How was it that Stewart wasn't even nominated for this performance?)and after the rage comes that final kiss when he has to be weighing the possibility that he may find happiness with Judy in spite of everything, and then, abruptly, even that possibility is torn from his arms as he loses her finally forever. WOW.",10,2,6,19 April 2002
The New World," There's a longer version coming out on DVD
","I love Terrence Malick's three previous films, and I liked much of 'The New World' but it felt jumbled somehow to me. As if the editing had been rushed and the film had not quite gelled. Since my faith in the director's talent and integrity is immense, I decided to see it again to try to 'get' whatever I was missing from a first viewing. So I attended a screening today at which producer Sarah Green spoke, and the audience was informed that the version that was released in December for Academy Award consideration, has since been replaced by a version 15 minutes shorter (which was not shown). She assured us we 'wouldn't notice' the changes. Then we were informed that Malick has already produced a three hour cut he intends to release on DVD. It's a sad state of affairs when one of the world's greatest directors can't release his presumably preferred version of a film to theaters - it has to be relegated to the home video market. In the trailer now being shown on the movie's website there seemed to be scenes and dialog which are not in the version I saw.UPDATE: October 18, 2008 The 172 minute version has been released. I just watched it and as I had hoped, it's a masterpiece.",10,10,23,8 January 2006
Training Day," appalling cliches, stereotypes, and hateful p.o.v.
","The plot of this film may pay lip service to the value of the rule of law, but everything else in it shouts the glamour of money and power, and the thrill of brutality and male dominance. How Denzel Washington could participate in this sham and still sleep at night is baffling. Shame on Ethan Hawke as well for putting this kind of dehumanizing 'entertainment' out in the universe.",Null,32,67,1 April 2002
The Danish Girl," The film equivalent of a coffee table book about Lili Elbe
","First the good: Alicia Vikander gives an excellent performance in a poorly written role. The music, when it's not loudly substituting for a decent script, is often lovely. And the historical context is illuminating, especially the very real danger of institutionalization. Other than that, what a mass of prestige picture clichés, laughably symmetrical camera set-ups and gorgeous landscape cinematography. And poor Eddie Redmayne. Completely out of his depth in the central role. Obviously, no one knows how well Lili Elbe passed for a woman, but no one, and I mean absolutely no one, would mistake Redmayne's Lili for anything else but an awkward, clumsy male in a bad wig. Granted, that would make an interesting take on this story: someone who believes they look like a woman but who doesn't. But that's not what this film proposes. Quite the opposite, which is why the audience consistently laughed every time the film suggested that Elbe herself, or other characters believed in the success of the transformation. The script is so cliché ridden and repetitious that even an actor as fine as Matthias Schoenaerts can't liven it up. And for some reason he is made up to look like a sweaty cadaver. And again,I felt bad for Mr. Redmayne, that he didn't get the directorial help he needed in the role and a better script that left him more to say than the trite and predictable lines in this one.",3,142,288,16 September 2015
Match Point," Better when it was called 'Crimes and Misdemeanors'
","IMO Crimes and Misdemeanors is a Woody Allen masterpiece. Match Point takes one plot thread from that film, reconfigures it into a straightforward tale of greed and lust, while drooling over the trappings of upper class English life and the bodies of the youthful actors. There is one clever plot twist, one excellent confrontational dialog scene. The rest is treading water, much of it with head barely above water. If you know Allen's films, and especially Crimes and Misdemeanors, this film will disappoint and depress you as a cynical commercial shadow of that great film. If you are new to Woody Allen the film may entertain in a superficial PBS kind of way. But don't be fooled by the hype. This is not the return of the great Woody Allen of years past. It's the last grab for marketplace share by a sadly fading talent.",5,5,18,1 January 2006
The Village," Not a horror movie (possible spoiler)
","The pressure on this director to come up with another blockbuster has unfortunately led the studio to hype the film as a thriller when in fact it's a sensitive, low-key allegory about the heartbreak of life in our times.  I found the 'surprise'  incredibly sad and left the theatre with tears in my eyes. My only complaints are that the film should have been 90 minutes instead of two hours, and that it would have been more effective with a little less of the shock sound effects and eerie music. There's a scene on a porch in which the two young lovers declare their feelings for each other that is exquisitely written and performed.  I hope the director breaks out of his thriller straight jacket and allows himself to produce something that reflects his obviously deep feelings about the pain of the human condition.",Null,0,0,30 July 2004
The Revenant," Bummer. Pointless but pretty.
","Beautiful in a self-conscious way, but often tedious. Aside from occasional moments of elevated humanity, it's mostly an overlong, gruesome spectacle of cruelty, pain and anguish, which after a while becomes almost comic in the unrelenting and extreme nature of the main character's ordeals (and the implausibility of him surviving them). Aside from a moment when DiCaprio's character gains insight into the pointlessness of his behavior, this is an unexceptional survival and revenge story gussied up by how-did-they-do-that? cinematography, portentous music, and a performance that screams 'Look what I went through to get my Oscar!' I didn't believe any of it for a minute.",5,6,11,15 January 2016
The Pianist," Words Fail
","But I'll try:Exhausting. Engrossing. Horrifying. Historic. Realistic. Poetic. TRUE.
Great story, great screenplay, great direction, great acting, great cinematography, great art direction, great music, TRUE.Best of 2002. One of the all time greats. Must-see. Masterpiece. Events depicted are only 60 years in the past and are TRUE. And finally, among the many emotions, identifications and questions this film inspires in the viewer is this one:When my liberty is about to be robbed once and for all, will I fight against the freedom robbers in time? Or will I go along, paralyzed, like a sheep to slaughter, hoping things won't be, couldn't be as bad as they seem?",10,0,1,5 January 2003
Moulin Rouge!," Not perfect, but achieves greatness
","This is one of those films that you simply HAVE TO SEE. NOW. ON A BIG SCREEN. There's really never been anything like it, but I'll make the following comparisons: 2001 A Space Odyssey, Pennies From Heaven, The Wizard of Oz.  Films that pushed the previous boundaries of cinema so far, technically AND artistically, and in such surprising and imaginative ways, that they inspired a kind of happy giddiness at the sheer awesomeness of what film can do. Films that provided so much sheer visceral pleasure that you wanted to go back and see them again almost immediately.
Since the film is now in release, I will not say anything specific about the it. Surprise and delight are so much a part of its fun. I will say this. It's not perfect, though maybe after repeated viewings I will change my mind. Not everything works. Aspects of it are unexceptional. Yet, even if only succeeding half the time, it deserves a place among the great films of our time.",9,0,1,7 June 2001
Garden State," What was the original ending? **SPOILER**
","**SPOILERS AHEAD**I loved the movie and have seen it twice. And yet I can't help feeling that the film is filled with a kind of melancholy foreboding that the ending seems to negate. I love a happy ending as much as anyone, and after adjusting to this one, it makes for a satisfying finale, especially with its Graduate-like intimation that they hardly know each other, really, and there may be some rocky times ahead for both of them. But think about it: They meet at a neurologist's office and she lies about her condition. Over and over it seems the film is intimating that she is headed for some tragic end or is hiding some tragic secret. And the film opens with his own premonition of death by plane crash.
So here's what I'm wondering: wouldn't it have made a more interesting and thought provoking film if his foolish departure from her resulted in his death in the plane crash he'd dreamed about? How fleeting are our opportunities for happiness, and how easily we can miss them if we don't recognize them. Not commercial, but I wonder if some such ending was originally conceived. Was it changed to the one we have now, a cliched sad ending tease/happy ending turnabout? One that will result in the film earning many more millions than it otherwise would have.
I love the film, every minute of it. Natalie Portman is glorious. I love the film's humor and humanity, the music, and the sweet melancholy mood, so evocative of that period of our lives Braff calls the quarter-life crisis. But I think a stupid tragic denouement would have been more in keeping with the tone of the rest of the film.",10,0,1,13 August 2004
Silence," Unapologetic story of faith, conversion and martyrdom
","SILENCE is beautifully filmed and strangely involving for such a grim and slow-moving tale. For a 2 hr 40 min movie, I never felt bored or felt that the story was unnecessarily stretched out. As an ex Catholic who, as a child, was intrigued by the idea of martyrdom and by tales of the saints who were killed because they refused to renounce their faith (and so, got an express ticket to heaven - a very attractive end result for one who feared hell as much as I did), I could identify in a more distanced way with the protagonists and their Catholic followers in Japan. I expected that in telling a story set 400 years ago, Scorsese would provide some kind of modern day insight (psychological, political,sexual) to the true events depicted in his narrative. Instead, all I could glean was that this was a film by a devout Catholic, about devout Catholics. Who would have thought Scorsese was possessed by such primal and dogmatic religious feelings? Shockingly, the Japanese culture is referred to more than once as a 'swamp' where nothing truly spiritual, much less Catholic, can grow. The inquisitor who persecutes the Catholics is portrayed by a lizardy actor with a high pitched voice, doing what I guess is the Japanese equivalent of a moustache-twirling villain. Cruelty, execution and torture take up a large part of the picture, and while accurate I suppose, is probably no worse that what was done by the Catholic inquisition in Europe. I was hoping for some kind of statement about religious fanaticism, and at one point, when a Buddhist is trying to reason with the priest, asking why it isn't better to focus on the common elements of the world's different religions, I thought the film was going in that direction. But it ends on an 'upbeat' religious note, when it is revealed that the priest held onto his faith in the Catholic god right up to the end. The film was premiered at The Vatican which says a lot about where it's coming from. There is a dedication to the priests and converts in Japan. I wasn't impressed by Andrew Garfield in the central role. I felt like he was miscast, so it's mostly not his fault - too young and modern (and who kept his hair so coiffed in the first half of the movie?). Adam Driver was excellent as always, but not sure why he felt he needed to lose all that weight for the role, he was really skinny and sunken-eyed. Liam Neeson, also miscast with his very tall stature and hard-to- disguise Irishness was good in a thankless role. The Japanese actors (except for the inquisitor) were fine, but most of their characters were never really developed into anything more than simple-minded worshippers or cruel torturers.",5,88,151,2 February 2017
2001: A Space Odyssey," Some remarks from someone who was there...
","I find the divergent comments about this film quite interesting. It's either a masterpiece and suprmely involving or it's a worthless boring fake. I think if you were in a Cinerama theatre and had the experience that Kubrick intended, there would be no doubt that you had just seen one of the great films of all time. The pacing of this film is absolutely dependent upon the overwhelming size of the image and the detail of the soundtrack. There is no way to describe in words the power of the first time I heard the Zarathustra theme in a Cinerama theatre. It went way beyond what you would experience even in a concert hall since the music surrounded you and the volume and fidelity were simply overwhelming. This is a film that had people shaking and giddy following the title card! And so it goes for the rest of the film. What may seem slow and uneventful on a video screen was just what was required for an audience to absorb all the visual and aural information. Those stills for example, at the start of the film were accompanied by desert sounds that were so real you expected a cricket to hop out from under your seat. And the long sequences outside the Jupiter ship involving the AE35 unit are entirely engrossing and set one up for the silent horror that ensues. I just watched the film again for the I don't know how manyth time, and every time I see it I am surprised by threads I never noticed. This time I was amazed that the film is so much about murder. Murder as the basis for evolution, murder of humans by machines, murder of machines by humans. And has there ever been a greater metaphor for our technology dominated society that the sequence of the man jogging in his giant squirrel cage while the saddest music you have ever heard plays on the soundtrack?",10,32,62,20 May 2001
2001: A Space Odyssey," beware bad prints, lousy projection, bad sound
","just a note to warn IMdB users about the current re-release. At New York's Astor Plaza theatre the print I saw was blurry, colors were not true and often bled like bad video, and the sound was mostly unimpressive and sometimes outright warbly like some pathetic summer camp projector. I never thought I'd say this and incredible as it may seem, seeing it on DVD was actually better.Also - I'd like to put this question out there. Maybe someone knows.  This is the third time I've gone to see a re-release of a classic film which has been 'digitally restored' (Doctor Zhivago, Wizard of Oz, and now 2001: A Space Odessy) and the print was unexceptional or actually poor. I'm starting to suspect that these prints are not struck from original negatives, but are created after the film has been digitized for DVD from digital information. This would explain the poor quality. Does anyone know?",10,0,1,19 December 2001
Mystic River," Bogus 'tragedy'
","**SPOILER**Mystic River is being accepted in the U.S. as a serious, tragic tale of the terrible consequences of violence and abuse. What it really is, is a manipulative revenge tale about the sensitive inner life of a vigilante murderer. I  was appalled by Laura Linney's big scene at the end where she praises the murderer for his kinglike qualities. I think it's in there not so much for its ironic 'Lady Macbeth' horror, as for its balancing effect on all those moviegoers who actually agree with her and see the Sean Penn character as flawed but heroic: a kinder, gentler Dirty Harry.   There's a reason why the film makers eliminated a crucial moment from the book: In the book, the Kevin Bacon character promises the Marcia Gay Harden character that he will prove that the Sean Penn character committed murder and that he will prosecute him for it. Instead, Eastwood plays it cozy, leaving the legal consequences of the vigilantism ambiguous, just in case his core audience happens to think that what Sean Penn's character did was wrong, maybe, but understandable and justified. And after all, who got hurt? Just some loser pervert, right? Or as the film describes him, 'damaged goods'. What a load of horse manure.",1,141,204,3 November 2003
The Wrestler," It's not called 'The Wrestler' for nothing
","something that should have been obvious to me before going in. But the art-house cred that the film has gotten, the film festival screenings, the huzzahs from the critics, and Aronofsky's previous films made me think this would be much more than what it is: a fairly conventional, low-budget retooling of the same material that made 'Requium For A Heavyweight' such a sensation in the 50's. Set in the world of professional wrestling, it hypes that 'sport' while at the same time bemoaning Rourke's character's fate, a typical commercial ploy these days in movies: condemning and exploiting at the same time, e.g., the poor, sad, lonely character played by Marissa Tomei, forced to do all that dirty dancing. Don't get me wrong: it's not a bad film, of its kind. And it could just as easily be sold as something for WWF fans. In fact it probably will be. But if it were, I certainly would have no interest in seeing it. So be warned: there's an awful lot of 'professional wrestling' in 'The Wrestler'. And what remains, minus the nudity and grisly violence, could have just as easily been a network television movie.",5,5,17,25 December 2008
Arrival," Powerfully emotional
","This is an intelligent, entertaining and powerfully emotional movie about an international close encounter of the third kind. The film's catharsis released a flood of emotion in me - it's that good. Definitely worth seeing. The Canadian director straddles the art-film and commercial film worlds. As a commercial enterprise, the film is unusual in that it is devoid of guns, explosions, chases, fistfights and the other tropes of alien visitation movies, that it has a female protagonist, and that gives precedence to feelings of love and loss over those of terror and aggression. Can't say enough about Amy Adams' performance. The score by Johann Johannsson adds immeasurably to the film's effectiveness.",10,4,12,11 November 2016
La Vie En Rose," Where are the subtitles to the song lyrics?
","Just watched the DVD of this amazingly powerful film, very much in the style of classic Hollywood biopics. But am still scratching my head over the bizarre decision to skip the subtitling of the songs! I could see if her choice of songs, and the songs that composers chose to write for her, weren't so incredibly personal. But they are, and were included and placed in the film precisely because of the way they comment on her life. Leaving non-french-speaking viewers in the dark is a crime. As if the lyrics to her songs didn't matter. Even when the composer comes in at the end and plays her the song that convinces her to appear one last time and she cries out 'That's my life!' we are left wishing we knew what she was talking about!",8,2,4,4 July 2008
