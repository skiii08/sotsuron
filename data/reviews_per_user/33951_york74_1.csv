Marie Antoinette," A perfect example of counterhistory
","I finally saw the movie: I really was prepared not to like, but in the end I enjoyed it very much. It's not a movie about the real Marie Antoinette. It's just a personal dream about her and in that sense the film works beautifully in my opinion. I did not find it boring at all. It was a pleasure to watch, like a picture to be framed. And despite its countless inaccuracies, it is even more historically accurate than some would-be historical movies like 'Elizabeth'. And in the end I found some of my personal Antoinette in Coppola's vision. It's a perfect example of counterhistory, which must be watched with an open mind.",8,1,3,21 November 2006
