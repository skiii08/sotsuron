Blade Runner 2049," Very well done
","Beautifully filmed. This is one to pay close attention to, even during the slow scenes (of which there are many). It's not the action-filled sci-fi that most are accustomed to or expected. It's interesting how many of low reviews have spelling errors. This one's not for you, fans of The Last Jedi.",9,1,12,21 December 2018
