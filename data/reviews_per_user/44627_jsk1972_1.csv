Requiem for a Dream," Not many films leave me feeling drained
","Not many films leave me feeling drained, but this is one of them. I've seen Darren Aronofsky's second film (his debut film being 'Pi') on several occasions and the end result is the same: I sit watching the credits roll at the end, and it somehow seems inappropriate to do anything for at least 5 or 10 minutes, sitting instead in quiet contemplation of what I've just witnessed on screen.If you've ever considered taking drugs, be they illegal ones, or prescription ones, watch this film first. You may change your mind.Without getting into tedious plot summaries, of which there are many concerning this film I simply suggest that you go and rent, steal or borrow this film. You won't be disappointed. Shocked? Almost certainly. Disappointed? Certainly not.Oh, and THAT soundtrack. I can't think of anything that could work better.Along with the magnificent Vincent Gallo film, Buffalo 66, this has got to be a very strong contender for my favourite film of all time.",10,0,1,20 December 2001
