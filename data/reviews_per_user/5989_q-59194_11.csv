The King's Speech," Wonderful performances and restrained, exquisite and beautiful photography greatly dilute the so-called 'inspirational' effect, which is the high-level of the film.
","After watching this movie, I thought about a problem. He was a king. He had to face his stuttering to face her people. However, How many people choose to suppress their problems and choose to remain silent?I hope everyone can understand the power to defeat oneself.",9,0,0,12 April 2020
Black Swan," The ending brings the whole movie to a climax and is impressive
","The film is filled with dark tones from beginning to end, very frightening, very depressed, both music and photography are extremely attractive to the audience.",8,0,1,12 April 2020
A Star Is Born," The plot is average, but the music is excellent.
","It is basically the 76-year version that was directly adapted. Some adaptations are quite interesting.The songs are very good. Gaga's performance is not bad and natural, but due to the limitations of the script, this character is completely pale and completely dependent on the male. The first half is good, but the editing of the entire movie is very problematic",6,0,0,21 April 2020
My Neighbor Totoro," Dreamy and romantic.
","Miyazaki's most pure and innocent, gentle and tender work. There is no contradiction, suspicion, conflict and disaster, and even the 'ghost house', the jungle, and the monsters are impregnated with childlike and pleasant colors. Everything is beautiful.",8,0,0,27 April 2020
The Pianist," Films that make people cry.
","It is not the music or the inhumanity of the war that hit the soul,but the humble stubbornness of a person who wants to live.The film is restrained and calm as if it is not at all involved in the director's feelings, but the knife hits the point to make people sad and stunned.In the end, the pianist, who had already languished so quickly, stumbled among them, like a sinking leaf.A person bears the sorrow of a ruined empty city.I don't know when he searched for food and water in the empty ruined buildings and saw the jars of tables, chairs, bottles and jars that had been lucky enough to keep the whole body in the flames of war, including the canned pumpkin. Did he still have the strength to mourn the owner who doesn't know if he is still alive?",8,0,0,22 April 2020
The Favourite," 'Love has limits.' 'It should not.'
","Undoubtedly, The Favourite is extremely entertaining, but it is still very 'Lanthimos'. The film reverses time to 18th-century England, and the story is taken from the real event between the Duchess Sarah Churchill and Queen Anne. Curiously, unlike most orthodox British court dramas, the primitive etiquette and political laws of the upper class society have been reduced to the fringe, and the movie has been replaced by the strange and absurd triangle love talk under the power structure. Absurdity always is the first consideration for Lanthimos to build a character survival system.Lanthimos uses a large number of wide-angle lenses, fisheye lenses and low-angle upward shots to create a grotesque, alienated atmosphere.For most people, these lenses may not be as visually comfortable, but when you choose to accept this shooting method, everything are full of other charms.",7,1,2,26 April 2020
The Theory of Everything," For Hawking, everything has its theory, but love does not.
","The focus of the film is not Hawking's scientific achievements, but his life and emotions. The actors perform well, especially the stubborn and painful entanglement in the eyes of the Jane. There was a lot of soft light and warm light throughout the movie, and the covered filter diluted the pain of the disease he endured. As an ordinary person, I can't help but think, when he suffered such torture and hardship, did he really think of giving up? Fortunately, he is not an ordinary person, but a person who wants to explain everything with a simple and beautiful equation. The cosmic stars at the end are magnificent, how can the person who holds the universe in his mind be an ordinary person?",8,0,0,13 April 2020
Room," Mom,say bye bye to room.
","The story is from the perspective of the victim, talking about psychological self-help. It chose a very interesting entry point.Aside from the movie, the prototype story of the movie is really cruel and heartbreaking.",8,1,1,17 April 2020
Ex Machina," Ethical Science Fiction Movies
","A sci-fi film that mainly discusses the Turing test in a chat format (in fact, it is better to discuss it further), all aspects are very detailed, such as visual effects and scene settings.The director's grasp of the suspenseful atmosphere, the control of the rhythm, and the trick of revealing the secret a little bit like onion peeling are much smarter than many movies of the same type.",7,0,0,17 April 2020
Joker," Is joker too sick, or is our world too crazy?
","DC gave director Todd Phillips a lot of creative space to shoot, and with the wonderful performance of Joaquin Phoenix, 'Joker' has the art and commercial value of the film.We may sympathize with Arthur 's injustice and malicious bullying in the movie, but if there is someone like Arthur who laughs in front of us today, we can really understand the real emotions and emotions behind his laughter Idea?",8,2,3,10 April 2020
The Fighter," The performances of the actors are almost very good.
","The fighter plot is indeed very routine,the turning points of the characters in all the inspirational works are quite the same in this film. But the whole film is well-made, and the sound effects of the script rhythm photography and editing.What impressed me is that every character in the movie, even the supporting characters are so real and vivid.",7,0,0,13 April 2020
