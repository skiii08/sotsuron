Ali," I Really Liked It!!!!!
","This is 1st good attempt by anyone to make a biopic of the greatest boxer of all time, i have seen b movie versions and they are a waste of time to say the least.This movie however broke that finally and although reviews have been bad and monies taken in america werent as great as 1st expected, it did better here in england im happy to say and im glad it did.Will Smith plays the leading role to absolute perfection, his timing and everything is spot on, even the boxing scenes were breath taking, whether or not you like the film, Will Smith should not be overlooked for awards that are shortly coming up, if you dont believe this then remember that the man himself Mr Ali said he wanted Smith to play this role and was delighted when he was chosen.I cant really put into words how much i enjoyed this movie, many people who went to see it did not know much about Ali and what happened to him etc, but for those of you who are fans (like me) this will be a great watch (if only for Smiths performance).  For those of you who expect to go out, watch this and learn about the man from this movie do not expect this as its not intended for this, its intended for those of you who know a lot about boxing history and Alis history.Anyhow thats enough, you make you own opinion im merely voicing mine",Null,0,0,7 March 2002
Back to the Future," The Best Movie Ever Made!!!
","I think my one line summary sums this film up straight away, i have been watching this movie since i was about 7 or 8 years old and now im almost 20 and im still watching it and loving every minute of it and even though i know whats gonna happen next everytime i watch it, i simply dont care as its that classy a film, this film is living proof that a simple idea, a great script and some good and some slightly unknown actors can make a film that will stand the test of time even watching it now i keep have to remind myself it was made in 1985!!!! I know thats when its set and everything but to me the hallmark of a good film is that no matter when it was made it still seems like new.Michael J Fox was the perfect choice for this role as he was new and was great at the teenager who got caught up in the middle of everything and had to get his parents together, this film launched his career and rightly so. Christopher Lloyd as the manic Doc Brown, pure class, whoever choose him deserves every award going plus a few medals as well for good measure, hes ace, great as the mad scientist and gets more and more funny as the trilogy goes on. Thomas F Wilson as the bully Biff(what a name haha!) who picks on everyone, including his father to brilliant comedic effect, wish i could have seen more of this guy in bigger films after this one as i think given the chance he could have been one of the big guns in america, but hey what do i know right.I cannot be bothered going through the rest of this, just go and watch this movie, if you havent seen it, rent or buy it, if you have got it watch it, if you are from another country and cant understand this get it translated ok.  This film will be great even in a 100 years time its still great after 17 years out there and there arent many people who dont like this film and theres a reason for this.",Null,0,1,2 February 2002
