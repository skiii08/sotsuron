Despicable Me 2," Lacks it's originality, but undeniably cute
","Honestly there's nothing new that 'Despicable Me 2' offers especially in storyline. It's more about Gru a-changed-man (after being villain at the first movie) is recruited by an institution to undercover and reveal a crime. He is accompanied by Lucy, his new partner and of course the minions to find out who's the bad guy and what's he planning.A spy thing and fighting against bad guy has already been common these days. Besides the studio make the same formula like in any those movies and most of times are predictable. The conclusion for massive conflict is also very simple that makes audience exhausted and would feel they're watching a repeatable movies. Gru's character who become a hero this time is boring, I still prefer to see a bad Gru which is quite impossible. Luckily, they have cute characters (Minions and Agnes) that audience wouldn't mind to see it although having poor storyline. Just seeing Minions move, walk or talk would make people at least smile. Minions have more portions in this movie which is reasonable and not surprising. If it wasn't Minions character, 'Despicable Me 2' would be so horrible and disappointed. Overall, 'Despicable Me 2' is just an ordinary animation movie but still enjoyable to watch. What makes it special because of the cuteness of Minions and Agnes that save the entire film. Just bring kids watching these, they're definitely gonna love it.",6,1,4,4 July 2013
Iron Man 3," Fine Superhero Movie
","'Iron Man 3' is a satisfying superhero movie with almost similar formula from other 'The Avengers' franchise. This movie is fit as an opening summer film: it's big blockbuster movie with massive action scenes and really fun to see. The studio has right decisions choosing Shane Black as director instead of maintaining Jon Favreau who had destroyed second installment. He knows how to handle this franchise well without adding unnecessary scene and silly jokes like the second one. And of course there's no complaint about Robert Downey's performance as Tony Stark, he's done great as usual.Still there are some weakness in 'Iron Man 3'. Unlike the first 'Iron Man' which had offered spectacular action scenes but still realistic in storyline, this film is too cartoonish and predictable, also nothing fresh in it. I think they don't want to take any risks and making it at the safe zone like most of 'The Avengers' franchise. They try to satisfy the fans without attracting new viewers. Also the villain is under- developed, there is similarity character between Mandarin and Syndrome in Disney's Pixar: 'The Incredibles'. I suggest not to see it in IMAX 3D, it's a waste. Although the 3D is not horrible but there is nothing special in it.Afterall, 'Iron Man 3' is an amazing, thrilling and entertaining summer blockbuster movie. Most people who see it would agree about how cool this movie is. The studio undeniable creating flawless visual effects that make the action scenes look real. Marvel 'The Avengers' fans, teenager and kids are gonna love it. I'm personally quite disappointed after watching it cause there is no improvement in this third installment that I'm waiting for. 'Iron Man 3' is below the first 'Iron Man' and also not as good as 'The Avengers' or even 'Captain America' but Shane Black success to lift up this franchise into a better future after a mess in 'Iron Man 2'.",6,2,9,26 April 2013
Shaun of the Dead," Too much jokes for a zombie film
","'Shaun of the Dead' is a quite hilarious British bloody comedy that is successfully making fun of Romero's zombie film in an appropriate manner. The script undeniably delivers few laughs which is the purpose of the film and duo Simon Pegg-Nick Frost are fit to make that happen. Unfortunately the movie falls short with non-serious issue and idiotic character. Everything in this movie is only for jokes, nothing more than that, even they solved the ending also with illogical jokes. Shaun character is like an unnecessary hero that drag all his relatives into zombies invasion while Ed character is too dumb and sometimes annoying. Overall, Edgar Wright's 'Shaun of the Dead' makes a zombie film less painful than ever with some smart and funny lines. But strangely the movie troubled with the joke itself, it's too non-serious for a zombie film even for a parody and some jokes aren't placed in a right time that makes it still few steps behind 'Zombieland'.",6,2,5,29 May 2014
Argo," Brilliant!!
","What I could say about Argo is a fun, thrilling, well-acted and well- organized film making. I couldn't expect more from this movie, it's simply perfect. The entire cast do their part very well and the script is smart that make audiences enjoy watching it. It slowly increase the tense until end of the film that make time pass very quick when watching this. I enjoyed watching it and really don't mind to watch it all over again. Once again Ben Affleck shows his quality as a director. I think he is at the top of his career.Academy Awards make the right decision for choosing Argo as Best Picture this year. Although it's not like a typical Oscar movie but I think film which win Oscar shouldn't always be boring and having complex story. And definitely Argo is better than other nominated movie this year so it's really well deserved.",10,0,3,2 April 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Fully entertaining and great watching experience
","I watched it at midnight show yesterday and didn't expect too much after seeing early rough reviews from the critics, but after the movie ended I felt nothing wrong with this and truly far from disappointment. Once again J.J.Abrams shows his directing ability and continuing to amaze audience after what he had already done in 2009 with a solid piece of work. 'Into Darkness' is one of the most entertaining and satisfying action movie I've seen this year. It's fun, thrilling and spectacular at some scenes especially last 45 minutes of the film. The acting from their three main casts (Chris Pine, Benedict Cumberbatch and Zachary Quinto) also can't be taken lightly. Especially for Zachary Quinto, his character here has a lot improvement and he has done his challenge incredible. There's no doubt about the visual, it's been outstanding and stunning, you couldn't ask more than this. The IMAX visual is also amazing and worth to see.Besides that, 'Into Darkness' has less complex story. Character of the villain is not introduced clearly and appeared too sudden. The thing is probably because 2009 'Star Trek' has already been too perfect, J.J.Abrams had made high standard in the first franchise that even himself hardly to level it. I think J.J.Abrams has pulled out all of his idea in first 'Star Trek' reboot that makes this movie not that special and feels repeatable. The storyline in 'Into Darkness' isn't as complicated as the first movie so don't worry if audiences haven't watched the previous movie, they still could enjoy this. Afterall, 'Into Darkness' is a great action package and something you shouldn't miss. It might be not as good as the first franchise but it's still one of the coolest movie you'll ever experience. It may be too early to say that it's the best summer blockbuster movie this year, but it could be the great one. I personally love 'Into Darkness' and wouldn't mind to see it again.",8,7,18,11 May 2013
The Babadook," Beware of the Babadook
","Original and truly terrifying, 'The Babadook' proves what a horror-fiction movie could do with involving more on psychological emotion from it's protagonist character rather than shocking audience with ghost appearances. It has totally different ways to scare compared with James Wan's 'The Conjuring' or 'Insidious'. The movie focused on Babadook, a scary creature from children's tale but even The Babadook appearance itself wasn't much exploited and seems too mysterious. The d√©butant director, Jennifer Kent has successfully and smartly convinced also planted images of Babadook character at audience's mind without much showing what it really looks like and keep them guessing at the ending part. Babadook only appears couple times at shadow, sounds or some hallucinations. What definitely makes this film that scary is a standout performance from Essie Davis. Her acting as Amelia greatly portrays a destroyed and depressed mother who have unwell circumstances to raise her only son. At first half of the film, audiences were dragged to feel the stressful condition and sympathy to Amelia but she with her gesture and changed behavior would surely scare them when it reaches last 20 minutes. 'The Babadook' is a respectful and undeniably creepy old-school horror movie that is rarely to find these days. With also supported by strong performances from Essie Davis, spooky suggestive premise and surrounded by annoying score, makes Babadook easier to sneak in your midnight sleep and haunt you as worst nightmare.",7,70,140,8 August 2014
About Time," Sweet and funny family drama
","'About Time' perhaps not the first movie which includes time traveling in a romantic movie, but it's the most successful one I guess. At first, audience could be quite confuse of this time traveling thing, it isn't explained clearly and seems illogical. However, the movie flows smoothly that make people forget about that thing and enjoy the story. Once again, Richard Kurtis as director and writer has emphasized that he is the one for romantic comedy drama after a clever combination sweet drama in 'Love Actually'. 'About Time' is unexpectedly sweet and no wonder some audiences admittedly cry during seeing this. Some scenes feel really emotional though. The movie is not only focus in the relationship between Tim and Mary, but also the relationship with his family. Also fine performance and chemistry from their entire casts have raised the sweetness from this movie. Overall, 'About Time' is sweet and some scenes are quite hilarious. It is undeniably the best comedy romantic drama so far in 2013. Really suitable movie for family or couple, a must see!",8,0,3,6 November 2013
Fast & Furious 6," Just for entertainment, nothing more
","There is nothing I could say about 'Fast and Furious 6' besides a fun movie with dumb storyline. I must admit that the action scenes in this movie is bigger and cooler than other previous series but in storyline, 'Fast Five' is much better. 'Furious Six' undeniably has more action sequences, car crashing and bigger explosions which is fun to see in the summer season. It's what all 'Fast and Furious' fans expected to be. Besides that massive action stuff, there's nothing left you could expect from this movie. The quality of storyline is so bad and dumb that makes this movie goes nowhere and no different from their previous franchise. The more you think, the more you feel silly about this movie. For example, the scenes when Brian pretending goes to jail for searching information about Letty that even their team and Toretto himself had already known about it before Brian told them, so what does he go to jail for? The cast in 'Furious Six' are also flat and standard. As Indonesian people, I'm really proud of Joe Taslim for his first Hollywood movie debut. I know that he doesn't speak much but it's just enjoyable to see him fighting and taking quite important role. Overall, 'Furious Six' is kind of good movie to see this summer and one of the great one from the series. But if you're searching for a good quality movie with strong storyline, it's not that kind of movie.",6,1,4,23 May 2013
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Suspense and satisfying Captain America installment
","'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' is undeniably the sequel that fans of Marvel: The Avengers and Captain America itself, wanted. As usual the movie has suspense and entertaining factor as an action pack movie that has been power of success from all of The Avengers franchise. The opening and some no-gun combat scenes are remarkable that would give excitement feeling. Also some good performances from it's supporting role (Scarlett Johansson, Robert Redford and Samuel L. Jackson) has helped Chris Evans to develop as main character, without them the film would feel empty though. The only thing that goes wrong with it is the movie has no element of surprise also it lacks heart and originality from 'Captain America: The First Avengers'. The first installment successfully portraits the old-school personality of Captain America as a hero and offers engaging love story that could differentiate it with the other The Avengers character. Perhaps this sequel got cooler action sequence but it doesn't have the uniqueness that memorable in mind like 'The First Avengers' did. Overall 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' fulfills the duty as blockbuster entertainment and important yet satisfying entry from the franchise that would easily guide audience's curiosity into 'The Avengers: Age of Ultron'.",7,1,3,6 April 2014
Pacific Rim," Man vs monster at it's best
","In the future time, there's giant monster called 'Kaiju' which has risen from beneath of Pacific ocean and ready to overtake earth. Some teams try to beat the monster by jet and tank but it takes many days to defeat it. To level the combat, special forces from around the world build robots named 'Jaegers'. 'Jaegers' is operated by 2 pilots whom minds are locked into one so they could move the robot based on their movement.'Spectacular' is the best word to describe 'Pacific Rim'. All of the action scene is captured really detail from the fight in the water, land or even on sky although it seems length of the movie is too short for massive problems like that. They tells first Kaiju's attack in fast way and just skip through the existing of 'Jaegers'. Also there's a little bit let down in storyline about human. It feels too boring and standard in storyline which is unusual for a high class director like Guilermo del Toro. And one of the most fatal mistake is there are no well-known actor here who could support this movie and make it more commercial. The actors don't act bad though, but in a summer big-budget movie, they should hire at least one popular actor as main role. Overall 'Pacific Rim' is one of the most satisfying movie at this summer season, it's big, fantastic and fun. Most credit should be given to the special effects members who create the combat between robot and monster look real. Also the IMAX 3D is incredible and worth to see. Unfortunately 'Pacific Rim' suffers with weak storyline that makes it flaw.",7,0,7,12 July 2013
Oblivion," Excellent blockbuster movie of 2013!
","'Oblivion' is a massive and stunning sci-fi movie. Joseph Kosinski as director once again entertains audience with cool and thrilling scenes which he had done it before in 'Tron: Legacy'. The plot itself is quite alike with Tron: tense at the beginning and becoming slow after the second half. There are also great stuff in cinematography, score and visual effects. The cinematography makes this movie more alive and beautiful, the score is very loud that increases the tense in this movie. The casts also not disappointing, especially Tom Cruise as leading actor though it's not his best ever performance. Tom Cruise is suitable when he acts in action movies. He is a cool and good looking guy which won't make people feel bored watching him and also give profit for this movie.At some points, 'Oblivion' is not original movie. The ideas could be coming from some movies like 'Wall-E' or 'Alien: Trilogy'. The storyline is really ridiculous and non-sense, the ending is also a little bit disappointing. Besides that thing, 'Oblivion' is still a good and entertaining action movie. So far, it's one of the best blockbuster movie this year. Definitely better than other disappointing movies recently like 'A Good Day to Die Hard', 'OZ the Great and Powerful' and 'G.I.Joe: Retaliation'.",6,2,4,14 April 2013
Man of Steel," Snyder brings back Superman franchise into his version
","This is a Superman movie that fans are waiting for. 'Man of Steel is one of the most thrilling and coolest movie I've seen this year. The movie opens with loud and promising story about how Kal-El was sent to earth. The plot itself is quite fast though, not what everyone think that it would be long introducing of character like 'Batman Begins' did. 'Man of Steel' tells Clark's childhood by doing flashback that is clear enough for audience. And the last 1 hour action of the movie is just epic. The action scenes really thrill, it makes something that you won't ever forget and miss this summer. Henry Cavill is satisfying as Superman, he's absolutely more fit than Brandon Routh although there's no challenging line for him.The weakest part of this movie is their plot and storyline. The storyline is silly, predictable, too hurry and just a formality that would guide to a non-stop action climax. Don't expect the storyline would be as complex as Christopher Nolan's Batman cause it's totally not. The other character is also not introduced well especially Lois Lane character that appears too sudden and many coincidences, and Perry White character could be acted by any actors besides Laurence Fishburne. May be Zack Snyder doesn't want to make same mistakes like 'Superman Returns' did. It's rather impossible to focus on storyline while he wants to create a full action movie especially in the first franchise. That's acceptable why most critics hate this movie, it's definitely because of mess storyline that really matters for them. It seems 'Man of Steel' have two sides of audience here. Audience who minds a solid and structured storyline would disappoint of 'Man of Steel'. But, audience who seeks an entertaining and massive action sequences are gonna love it. For me, Zack Synder has succeeded to open a promising franchise from one of the oldest Superhero in history for fans and non-fans with a spectacular and punches action scenes although it's a little bit exhausting in the middle. Hopefully the sequel would focus on a relationship between Superman and Lois Lane which doesn't happen in this movie.",7,3,8,14 June 2013
Divergent," Another fine acclaimed novel on a big screen
","Several years recently, there are many women's adventure novel put into motion picture. Not many of them got great response, the rest just failed and disappointed. 'Divergent' is more likely in the middle between those films. It's not that horrible but not so special either. The theme is quite familiar and seems formulaic with other fantasy movie. It has an uninteresting plot, soulless and predictable at climax which could make some audiences feel exhausted after seeing this. Luckily 'Divergent' is still engaging as a movie and an impressive performance by Shailene Woodley as Tris has also raised this first installment from disaster. Perhaps 'Divergent' won't make me curious to see the sequel but the movie undeniably has a fine premise as opening franchise and got potential to be fascinating.",6,0,2,29 March 2014
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," An unnecessary tale to be told
","Before watching 'Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters', I had already known that this movie got horrible reviews from critics, but I still curious and watched it on DVD few hours ago. To be honest, 'Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters' is really that bad, no wonder the movie fails and got extremely nasty reviews. There are a lot of foolish scenes and plot holes like, how could human easily chase witch that using a broom and could run so fast, at early scene it showed how great Muriel (Famke Janssen)was but she suddenly got weak at the end with no reason, doesn't she with her power just disappear and kill Hansel easily? Every time Hansel or Gretel had been on crisis situation, they awkwardly had a back up to help them which is so coincidence. The storyline itself is predictable and boring, the 88 minutes length felt so long and made me wanna finish it as quick as possible. Luckily I didn't see it at cinema when it came out last January. The visual effect is also standard and the make-up for the witch is ridiculous. Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton didn't act bad actually, they were just choosing wrong movie this time. Overall, 'Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunter' is a really poor movie and feels wrong in every aspect. Its should be just straight directed to DVD which still doesn't worth to own it either.",3,1,4,19 June 2013
Dallas Buyers Club," Matthew McConaughey at his career's best
","If it's not because of great performance from it's leading actor, 'Dallas Buyers Club' would be a failure and forgettable. Luckily, Matthew McConaughey responds the challenge confidently and even beyond it. He really portrays Ron's character as a stubborn selfish person who try to survive from AIDS. Undeniably Matthew McConaughey is flawless and no wonder he is appreciated with an Oscar from his performance in 'Dallas Buyers Club'. He shows commitment on acting as a professional actor by transforming his body and give an all-out performance. Not forget to mention Jared Leto who also steals attention as Rayon. Overall 'Dallas Buyers Club' is inspiring and strong in storyline but it felt boring sometimes in some scenes.",7,1,1,11 March 2014
Now You See Me," Fun, but fails to amaze
","'Now You See Me' started quite convincingly that makes audience curious of how they did that trick. Their first show at Las Vegas as The Hourseman when they rob a bank is really interesting to see and I thought this movie would be promising, complicated and mind blowing. But unfortunately after that scene, this movie becomes slow and tries to be smart for audience which is actually not. I found myself bored and exhausted watching half of the movie. There are many questions to this movie that has no answer to be explained. The trick itself is kind of impossible and not makes any sense that only could happen in a movie. In other words, audience is forced to accept that the concept of the movie is brilliant. The chemistry between characters here are also poor development, chemistry is one of the most important aspect if people want to create this kind of movie. It's too shamed, they have so many talented casts here that should be exploited. Compared with what 'Ocean's Trilogy' had done about their casts, 'Now You See Me' not even close with that. Overall, 'Now You See Me' is an enjoyable movie to see and quite fun. But don't expect this movie would make any impacts like their magician predecessors did in 'The Prestige' and 'The Illusionist'",5,3,8,9 June 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Ranks among the best X-Men series
","At first, the idea to unite the old and new face of X-Men team is brilliant but could be risky too. Thankfully Bryan Singer knows what he's doing and seems comfortable with the material it has, 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' never get confused or lost with bunch of mutant character and always focus to the main topic. All top form casts are placed where it should be and given almost same portion on each significant character while the plot itself is nicely structured and the future-past time are neatly set. The mixed of action-drama-comedy are put in a right place and never reduce fun factor this movie offers. A hilarious escape scene, thoughtful yet compelling time twisted storyline guided with charismatic performance by James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, all ended with stunning action climax, it's a first class entertainment which the fans and non fans of X-men franchise are expecting. Overall 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' is an elegant, emotional, entertaining action-packed that is worth to see at any season. And once again Bryan Singer proves himself as an X-Men specialty. He succeeded to bring nostalgia from the original X-Men casts and give more chances for younger member to shine by continuing the respected-solid foundation that Matthew Vaughn had created. It is the X-Men series that audiences have missed since 'X2' and got potential to be the most remarkable superhero movie this year.",9,5,8,21 May 2014
The Fault in Our Stars," Just okay
","More likely backed-up by best-selling novel from John Green, 'The Fault in Our Stars' is an honest yet faithful love story which containing some positive messages to inspire teenagers. The plot flows as a good drama should be, thanks to screenwriter Scott Neustadter and Michael H Weber who finely adapt John Green's genius idea into a soulful play and beautiful drama. The script for two central characters, Hazel Grace and Gus are well developed. It really shows how Hazel's feeling to Gus grows as much time they've spent together and how they need each other to live despite their imperfect conditions. Besides that, the movie seems taking advantages from Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort's chemistry who easily makes an adorable couple and put some sweet moments from it. Unfortunately, 'The Fault in Our Stars' isn't without it's faults. The other characters beside Hazel and Gus may only just supplement, seems unimportant and sometimes annoying like Van Houten character who looks stupid with his strange behavior and builds an awkward scene every time he appears. Also the film emphasizes more on meeting true love rather than people's attempt on surviving from cancer that makes it missing some points. Don't expect the drama would be as complex as '50/50' or 'Dallas Buyers Club', because what 'The Fault in Our Stars' offers is much focus on couple dating and having romantic dinner. 'The Fault in Our Stars' is an average good and sweet drama supported by lovely performances from it's two impeccable stars. But nothing much you could get in it that makes this movie felt just enough on being okay.",6,5,10,24 June 2014
Non-Stop," A non-stop thriller with non-sense story
",Non-Stop undeniably succeeds to give a bumpy ride for audience. It has an interesting premise that would make people guess and curious on what happens at the end while actually it ends disappointingly. The ending of the film ruins the tension they had built from beginning and added a non-sense moment in it. Also the hijacking purpose is quite silly and not explained clearly. Luckily there's Liam Neeson who more or less has secured this action flick for not falling into a disaster even though Bill Marks' character seems having similar personality with Bryan Mills' in Taken. Overall Non-Stop is good enough as entertainment and the thrilling thing quite works but don't expect smart storyline could come from this movie cause it will disappoint you.,6,0,2,15 March 2014
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Hiccup and Toothless deliver another great adventure to fill the holiday season
","After positive responds from both critics and audiences at the first installment, DreamWorks Animation with their creative team once again successfully to extend Hiccup and Toothless' adventure through larger scale of entertainment. 'How to Train Your Dragon 2' is darker, more grown-up in storyline and more fun in action sequences than it's predecessor also some touches moment lifts this sequel from just a forgettable kids movie. Actually the film introduced unconvincingly at first quarter of it with too hurry plot and ordinary premise but when it enters half hour until the last battle scene, it never stops to amaze and all that mistakes seems forgivable. Overall with smart script, heartwarming drama, focused theme about the emotional bond between dragon and it's rider and adorable characters all presented with stunning animated visual makes 'How to Train Your Dragon 2' a perfect yet delightful franchise to see with family. Perhaps it's not as classic or as original as the predecessor but still 'How to Train Your Dragon 2' will definitely entertain and satisfy all ages audiences and totally something you shouldn't miss this summer.",8,6,13,7 June 2014
Frozen," One of the most overrated animation in 2013
","I have no idea why most people really love this movie. 'Frozen' is a typical Disney's princess animation movie that having almost the same formula from others. It actually has a quite convincing premise, how the two princesses were separated because the other one has an icy power. The middle of this movie is undeniably interesting, they got me curious what would happen at the end of it. Unfortunately the ending is not what I expected, it's lame and seems to be forced in such big conflicts. The conclusion is just too ordinary for Disney studio. Overall, 'Frozen' is still above average of other disappointed animation in 2013. It's an entertaining movie to see with family especially for kids. But still far away from Disney's classic like 'Lion King', 'Beauty and the Beast' or even 'Tangled'.",6,2,9,4 January 2014
22 Jump Street," As naughty as '21 Jump Street'
","Never change the winning formula perhaps the best choice to continue this sequel. '22 Jump Street' is pretty much the same movie as it's predecessor. The storyline itself has some similarity from previous installment, if in '21 Jump Street' two police officer, Jenko and Schmidt undercover at high school to find drug dealer, while this time they go undercover as college student. Fortunately repetition doesn't always mean bad thing, the film seems taking positive side from '21 Jump Street' and gets more upgrade in action sequences, the relationship between Jenko and Schmidt as partner and especially some smart jokes. Couple of jokes are really that funny with added bizarre moment which audiences could never predicted.There are two dynamic duo whose role can't be separated from '22 Jump Street'. The rising director, Phil Lord-Christopher Miller who was known as the creator of 'Cloudy With a Chance of Meatball', 'The Lego Movie' and of course '21 Jump Street' seems comfortable to exploit some material from the first installment they've built also the way they inserted additional scene at end credit is brilliant, while Channing Tatum-Jonah Hill's chemistry keep audiences entertained at the entire scenes in it. Overall '22 Jump Street' is a film that despite following the formula from it's predecessor, feels even more fresh and solid. It levels the standard of '21 Jumps Street' and watching it, could be a cure to wipe out some stressful feelings.",7,5,12,11 June 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Not so amazing but still entertaining
","While the studio was too busy to create spectacular action sequences, 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' struggles with nonstructural plot, comical script and weak character development. The movie is overstuffed with unnecessary material and some coincidences moment that would make audiences feel exhausted also appearing many new characters affected this second installment into unfocused at storyline. Marc Webb as director seems confused to gather the two main villain and failed to introduce them properly. Surprisingly, the positive side of the movie comes from Peter Parker-Gwen Stacy's love story. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone successfully to portrait two teenagers who are madly in love and their chemistry put this movie into a different level of superhero franchise though it sometimes feels more like soap opera. Overall despite poor executed at storyline, 'The Amazing Spiderman 2' is undeniably romantic and still entertaining as summer blockbuster movie, also an unbelievable performance from Andrew Garfield has stolen sympathy that is needed and promisingly opens a gate to the next chapter of Spider-Man.",7,3,9,30 April 2014
Hotel Transylvania," So horrible and boring
","Once upon a time, Dracula built a hotel where is isolated and far from human existence. Hundred years later, Dracula planned to celebrate big party for (Mavis) his daughter's 118th birthday and brings all of his connection to stay at his hotel. A day before the party starts, teenage human called Jonathan come to hotel after experience long journey. Dracula who find out him at his hotel, is so panic and tries to get rid of him before the party starts. Unfortunately, Mavis and Jonathan meet and fall in love that forced Dracula to pick right decisions for his daughter.'Hotel Transylvania' starts with an interesting and promising storyline that make people hope these would be so fun and hilarious. The concept is quite attractive and make me curious what would happen next when they introduce hotel for monsters. Unfortunately, the movie left with a disappointment. The storyline is not focus, sometimes really annoying and the plot is flat from start through the end. They tried to make people laugh with it's joke which is not funny at all. Also Jonathan's character is too annoying, they should put him in right role. Overall, 'Hotel Transylvania' is mostly just a joke. The animation perhaps not bad but with that standard storyline, unfunny line and annoying character, this movie become so forgettable. It felt like 90 minutes length are very long time during watching this movie. I personally feel frustrated, sleepy and wish this movie would end really quick.",3,3,6,7 July 2013
12 Years a Slave," Definitely the best movie of 2013
","There's almost nothing could be complained from 12 Years a Slave. It has an incredible story, organized plot, powerful performance from ensemble casts and beautifully filmed. Perhaps the theme is quite common about slavery and racist thing but 12 Years a Slave offers something that other kind of movie doesn't have. The movie has heart and flows smoothly without any flaws. Credits also should be given to three main casts (Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender and Lupita Nyong'o) who steals attention with their unbelievable performance. It's no doubt that this movie has put the highest standard of a slavery movie which usually comes out every year. 12 Years a Slave is simply a masterpiece and one of my favorite for sure.",10,0,3,23 February 2014
Edge of Tomorrow," This year's most surprising blockbuster movie so far
","With thrilling action sequences, clever sense of humor and surprisingly intellectual storyline, 'Edge of Tomorrow' shows a real deal of summer blockbuster movie and proves itself beyond expectation especially after unconvincing trailers. Perhaps the theme and alien character looks familiar with some popular sci-fi movies but it's still combined perfectly as an entertainment. Doug Liman as director smartly exploited 're-setting the day' aspect without making it complicated and escaping it from being dull with some quality combat moments also inserting lovable drama that is commanded by memorable chemistry from Tom Cruise and Emilly Blunt have carried whole scenes in it. Overall 'Edge of Tomorrow' feels more satisfying than it might have been in any ways and shows how the non-sequel-reboot blockbuster movie should be done. It's definitely much fun than I have ever imagined and pleasurable to re-watch it over and over again.",8,241,317,28 May 2014
The Wolverine," A fine entry for X-Men series
","'The Wolverine' has improved a lot better than 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' but there is still something missing from it. Undeniably X-Men franchise couldn't stand for spin-off film, this would make it more like an ordinary superhero movie and not X-Men franchise, just 2 mutants appear in this movie: Wolverine and Viper, also the peak action scene isn't special. Fortunately, all of the actor here acts acceptably although most of them are Japanese and not well known at Hollywood industry. Some action sequences are still stunning though especially the scene when Wolverine fights on fast train. Overall 'The Wolverine' is still fun as summer entertainment. James Mangold as director has been brave to shot and bring Wolverine story at Japan which rarely happens in blockbuster movie. But it's too shame this movie lost in slow plot, repeatable and overlong storyline that sometimes make audience feels bored. And don't leave theater early because it has additional scene after end credit.",6,4,25,24 July 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," An epic conclusion of the trilogy
","'The Dark Knight Rises' took time 8 years after 'The Dark Knight', Gotham City has been in a peace moment after Joker's terror that almost destroyed the citizen. Batman who is accused responsible for Harvey Dent's death become a fugitive and never show up again. This time, new villain called Bane who is believed Ra's Al Ghul's apprentice in League of Shadow, ready to blow up Gotham with his nuclear bomb. Also almost all police in Gotham is trapped in the tunnel which makes Bane and his army easily take over the city. In this chaos situation, Batman who has been beaten once by Bane and send into a prison, must recover and rise to defeat Bane and shut down the nuclear bomb.'The Dark Knight Rises' opens with loud and massive scene then become slow at next 30 minutes. It shows a process of how Bruce Wayne tried to be back in action after has been retired for 8 years. The real tense felt in the last one hour of the movie, the spectacle increases more until the end. And the last scene emphasizes there will be no more Batman sequel from Nolan. Many new characters also don't interfere storyline of the movie, besides all of them take their role seriously especially Anne Hathaway and Tom Hardy. Anne Hathaway is suitable as Selina Kyle, a selfish, beautiful, elegant and smart thief. Tom Hardy with only his voice and movement, has been successful to bring a fearless villain and could be a memorable one. It's quite hard to compare between Bane and Joker, both of them has their own way to rule Gotham although Joker is more unpredictable and ruthless that makes him more match as Batman's main villain.Overall 'The Dark Knight Rises' is satisfying as the closing of the trilogy and once again Christopher Nolan has put it in a perfect way to end this. I must admit, Nolan's Batman trilogy is one of the best superhero franchise ever made which would increase the standard of this genre. His Batman trilogy is adapted with reality happens in life, not just a CGI entertainment that destroy a lot of buildings when fighting against bad guy and doesn't care about people in that ruin building. I've seen 'The Dark Knight Rises' 4 times already and still amazed by it's neatness in every element includes editing, visual effect, cinematography, costume design and sound effect. It could be tough challenge for every director chosen to reboot it, because Nolan's Batman is a simply masterpiece which is hardly for everyone to at least level it.",9,2,4,7 July 2013
The Croods," A forgettable movie from Dreamworks Animation
","I think The Croods quite works as kids movie, kids will love the character on this movie and the acceptable story. But for me this movie is unnecessary and so predictable. The story could be made a little bit more complex than this, especially the ending, they should stop the ending earlier without adding some scenes which ruins it. Still there is positive side from this movie. No doubt visual effects from Dreamworks Studio is great, although not the best. I actually enjoy and laugh at some scenes of the movie, it's ridiculous but funny. The best thing from the movie is the 3D, it really works. The 3D effect really watchable and consistent in every frame. Dreamworks animation continue their good looking 3D after making great shot in Madagascar 3.Overall The Croods is a good family movie and will entertain the viewers by it's eye-popping 3D. But compared with other Dreamworks Animation best creation like Shrek, How to Train Your Dragon or even Madagascar, it still below standard",6,2,8,31 March 2013
Monsters University," It's fun, but still hoping more from Pixar Studio
","In 2001, movie fans was amazed with the appearance of Pixar's creation 'Monsters, Inc'. 'Monsters, Inc' is one of the most brilliant and original animation movie ever made. The movie wasn't only successful at box office worldwide, but also it's favored among kids and adults audience even for critics too. No wonder the studio without any doubt continuing this franchise after over 10 years. 'Monsters University tells story happened before 'Monsters, Inc'. It has a lot more focus on Mike's character, how he wanted to go to college, dreamed to be a fearless monster and joined scare competition, how he first met with Sulley and annoyed by his behavior.'Monsters University' is kind of prequel that is necessary to be made because in 'Monsters, Inc' they didn't explain much about Mike and Sulley's relationship before and how they could be best friend which is quite important. 'Monsters University' is fun, interesting and colorful movie. The relation between Mike and Sulley is well-developed in this movie, from they hate each other because of their differences to become a good team. But there is still something missing from it. Pixar used to create deep storyline and a heartwarming moment that this movie doesn't have. The storyline is quite safe and feel less emotion if compared with 'Monsters, Inc'. It's too shame because 'Monsters University' is just continuing brilliant material in 'Monsters, Inc' and should make it more right though. Also Randall's character is unnecessary here and feel to be forced in this movie, I think he should just appeared directly in 'Monsters, Inc'. Overall, 'Monsters University is acceptable, entertaining and not disappointing at all, it's also funny that audience would easily enjoy especially kids. Definitely it's not as dumb as 'Cars 2' and worth to see as a family entertainment. But I'm still hoping much more from Pixar Studio that has brought masterpiece creation like 'Toy Story, 'Up', 'Wall-E' and many more. Besides animation from Pixar only comes out once a year, so they have time to make it more serious than this.",7,7,14,21 June 2013
Thor: The Dark World," 2013's best superhero franchise
","I have no expectation before watching this movie after a disappointment that 'Iron Man 3' had marked months ago. Unpredictably 'The Dark World' is above what I think it would be. 'Marvel: The Avengers' franchise has never been this much fun since first 'Iron Man'. Alan Taylor as director dares to take risks in storyline and makes it out from comfort zone. Some action scenes are entertaining and sometimes hilarious, especially when Loki involved. Thor character is shown much more development than the previous movie. In 'The Dark World', Thor is described more grown up and more responsible to save Asgard and Earth from villain's threat. Also the studio has succeeded to exploit Thor's power in this movie that doesn't happen in first franchise or in 'The Avengers'. The presence of Malekith has succeeded enough to give good impression as villain. Perhaps there's quite disorganized in plot and some jokes aren't in the right place. Overall, 'Thor: The Dark World' is one of the most memorable superhero movie this year, also great one from 'The Avengers' franchise. The IMAX 3D is worth to watch though.",7,2,7,1 November 2013
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Safe sequel from the franchise
","Undeniably 'Catching Fire' has more complex story than the previous movie. It isn't only about the game but also about rebellion from community who against the Capitol. Half an hour of the movie is about Katniss and Peeta doing Victor's Tour to districts and continued with conflict amongst them. Just don't expect too much that battle in the arena would be so fun like in 'The Hunger Games', the game is a little bit strange this time but it's revealed at the end of the movie. The most vital of 'Catching Fire' is existence of Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss although the entire casts also can't be underestimated. Jennifer Lawrence steals the show with her talent and takes her role seriously as icon of this movie. She makes Katniss' character more alive and could be becoming one of the best female hero ever created. Overall 'Catching Fire' is a solid entry of the franchise, it also has heartfelt moment. Perhaps it's not as fun as 'The Hunger Games' but the film succeed making audiences curious of what would happen at the next chapter.",8,1,19,23 November 2013
Godzilla," A 'Godzilla' reboot that is needed
","Without any doubt Gareth Edwards' 'Godzilla' offers a massive impact into live-action Monster movie. It provides many jaw-dropping moments that hardly to find at any typical movie. Some destructions are captured really detail and all the battle is just spectacular. Credit should be given to visual effects department that has created an outstanding look for Godzilla character. The way it swims, walks and roars are perfectly designed. The only flaw from this reboot is, the movie lacks in humanity side. It shows more damages buildings and roads that is caused by monsters than how many innocent people was sacrificed from the tragedy itself. Also Ford Brody character is too heroic though. Overall, 'Godzilla' is a serious yet ambitious film-making and a reboot that is needed. It pays all the mistake Roland Emmerich had done years ago with much upgrades at visual and significantly more logical issue in storyline. Aside of some weaknesses, 'Godzilla' is probably the most stunning and entertaining movie so far this year also great experience to see it at IMAX theater.",8,13,27,14 May 2014
