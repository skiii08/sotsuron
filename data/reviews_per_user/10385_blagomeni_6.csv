Despicable Me 2," lots of fun for everyone
","I am a sucker for modern day animated movies. This particular form of art has outgrown its previously targeted audience, the children. I have not seen recently a single one of them that was not layered and thick with contents that only adult audiences can fully grasp and appreciate. This is even more the case with Despicable Me 2. From the very beginning of the movie audience can not but fall in love with the main character Gru and the army of his little helpers, the Minions. The gags, the language, grimaces and the tempo of narration ads up to the enjoyment and fun this movie is so full of. The scene at the restaurant when Gru goes on a date with the shallow gum chewing 'lady' in a tiger patterned dress is alone worth the ticket money. The smartly placed scenes where Minions are the main cast made me laugh so hard that tears ran down my face. I genuinely loved this movie and can only say that if you feel down and depressed these gray Autumn days, watching this entertaining piece of art will definitely bring some joy to your life. I give it all five stars.",9,0,0,26 May 2014
Divergent," Dystopian world of limited choices
","I love science fiction, I do, but somehow I am not really that much into dystopian stories. Those stories always contain a thread of gloom and sadness that does not do much for me. I am actually a deeply optimistic person which may not be gleamed from the surface of my personality. Divergent is a story of young love, growing up and finding oneself. The movie more or less follows that pretext and delivers a compelling story. I suppose that one needs substance to make a movie based on a book. I have not had the pleasure of reading Divergent before watching the movie, and to be honest, after seeing the movie I will definitely not. Unfortunately this leaves me without bases for comparison and deprives me of insight which would help me decide if this is a movie worthy of the story from the book. This is a smoothly flowing story that contains hardly any stumbling points and unnecessary parts. The young cast is likable, very lovely and good looking. They all do a good job and leave a glimpse of promise for their future endeavors. I left the cinema thinking of a nice glass of red, not about the movie I had just seen. That tells a lot about the impression it left on me. If you have time to kill and do not care much how, go and see this movie. If you decide instead to spend time with friends over a nice meal, it may be a better choice. I am looking forward to seeing both main cast actors in new projects. I think they have more to offer at least while they are as good looking as they are now.",6,0,1,26 May 2014
Ender's Game," sci-fi at its best
","It does not happen often that a movie adaptation of a novel does the novel justice. This is fortunately the case with the movie adaptation of Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card. I have had the pleasure of reading the book before I saw the movie. After a few scenes into the it I realized that the depiction off the story, places and characters is very similar to what I had imagined when I read the book. No one can expect that a book of a couple of hundred pages can be squeezed into two hours of a movie. The director, fortunately, had no such intention. Still, the most important aspects of the story are present. Even though occasionally shown out of the sequence of the novel, in order to make up for the omitted sections of the book, they still tell a convincing story that flows smoothly and without any obvious gaps. I wholeheartedly recommend reading the book before seeing the movie. The intimate knowledge of the story would make it possible to follow the movie with far better understanding. It would also make the movie more entertaining. Nevertheless, even as a stand-alone this movie is a very entertaining feature. This movie is a story of humanity and the loss of it. It is also a story of socialization of the young people and personal growth. But most of all, it is a story of how far would one go to defend their family, their group, the species. The main characters are shown faithfully in comparison to the characters from the book. The young actor, Asa Butterfield, who was cast in the role of Ender is a very good choice. Barely seventeen, he took his role seriously, convincingly bringing the character of Ender to life. The supporting cast beautifully complemented the main character. Apart from a couple of seasoned actors, the rest of the team comprises of very young people. Regardless, they were up to the task and they performed their roles in coordinated concert. I saw the movie at a pre-opening screening. The CGI was impressive and I can only imagine how it may look in the iMAX version. This film is definitely a must see for the sci-fi enthusiasts. Those who are not much interested in the genre would also be entertained. I am looking forward to seeing the iMAX version. I can comfortably recommend this movie. It will not disappoint you.",8,0,1,26 May 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," delicious piece of cinematography
","The Grand Budapest Hotel is a movie that is equally perfect and sweet as one of the 'Mendl's' pastry boxes so frequently featured in the story. It is like a box of presents tied firmly with a shiny silk ribbon. This is one of those movies you can enjoy on several distinct levels. The most striking layer of the movie, at least to me, is the use of colors, props and sets. The ever present pastels vary from earthly yellow to raspberry pink and then back to grays and browns. Some parts of the movie are shown in black & white, masterfully blended in the story so that they are hardly noticeable. The next layer comprises of the special makeup effects combined with the use of contact lenses and outrageous hairstyles which add to the visual attractiveness of the movie. The story, though funny and daring, does mostly serve as a scaffold supporting the visual treats that are masterfully plastered on it. The use of language and narrative techniques wrap the entire project up like the previously mentioned silk ribbon. Each and every cast member contributed immensely to the beauty of the project. Starting with supporting roles, it is simply impossible not to mention the very short but absolutely adorable appearance of Tilda Swinton who is transformed beyond recognition. Edward Norton, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel and many others contributed to the perfection of acting in individually flavored manner, blending seamlessly into the flow. Ralph Fiennes is adorable in his role of M. Gustave. His character is stimulated to brilliance by the performance of Tony Revolori. The intricate ballet the two perform serves as the backbone of the story. The sets are amazing. Models blend perfectly with the locations in the Czech Republic. Open spaces and winter scenery provide the canvas for the dynamic story telling. This is a visually stunning movie that may not please our average moviegoer. It is an exercise in masterful application of cinematic techniques and tools. I had a great time watching it and would wholeheartedly recommend it. You will most probably leave the cinema with a mischievous smile on your face.",8,0,4,26 May 2014
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," gorgeous vistas of nature
","Socially awkward daydreamer, Walter Mitty lives in a world that has very little in common with his actual surroundings. The tedious daily routine made him escape into a more bearable world of imagination where he sees himself a hero, a complete opposite of who he actually is. All this starts to change when a missing photograph sets him on an adventure of his life. Bullied by his boss, Walter decides to embark on a trip to Greenland continuing to Iceland and all the way to the mountains of Afghanistan in search for a photographer whose photo, 'frame 25', got misplaced. During his voyage, Walter gradually embraces the world that surrounds him, slowly replacing his daydreaming with real world adventures and thrills. Ben Stiller, who plays Walter, is as charming as ever. His small stature and generally funny features make him a fitting actor to play the role of Walter. Supporting cast are all up to the challenge. Even though most of them are very famous actors and actresses, not for a second does it feel they take over the focus. The story of the movie is centered around a missing photograph, appropriately so since the movie is brimming with stunning photographic treasures. Masterfully executed scene transitions and gorgeous vistas of nature from Greenland, Iceland and mountains of a place that is a stand in for Afghanistan are simply breathtaking. This movie will make you feel good. It is worth the spent time and money. I enjoyed it very much.",7,0,0,26 May 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," Some movies simply have to be pleasing
","Some movies simply have to be pleasing. They have to provide a certain amount of satisfaction to movie goers because they are directed by a renowned director or they cast actors who give their best in each and every role they play. The Wolf of Wall Street should have been one of these movies. This feature gets off to a strong start. For a while this initial putsch keeps you moving forward, expecting something to happen, something that would make you think, 'Yes! This is the movie I've been waiting for so long that I've forgotten what a good movie feels like'. Sadly, it does not get to be this movie. While getting to know the plot and the main characters something creeps into the mind of the observer. The nagging in the background becomes slightly louder with each new scene or dialog. In the end, the nagging becomes so loud that one can only shout, 'Shut up! , I want this to be a good movie, I want it to make me feel good.' Still, despite excellent performances by the actors and Martin Scorsese's best efforts, it fails to be this movie. Perhaps I'm spoiled, accustomed to certain probably unfairly high standards and expectations from the names of DiCaprio and Scorsese in the credits. Even if it were so, this movie is still full of much of which is unnecessary. So many narcotics floating around in the scenes that I ask myself, how is it even possible that these people could stand on their feet every morning. There are also a couple of scenes where there was no reason to show nudity. Don't get me wrong, I love nudity in movies. I do, honestly, but I also expect it to be a part of the story, a part that independently and harmoniously knits the plot together with all other elements of the story telling. In this feature, some of the nudity is simply embarrassing. Margot Robbie did not need to bare it all. All compliments to Ms. Robbie, but she should have thought harder before agreeing to the scene. Jonah Hill's pleasure trip during the party scene was also a bit over the top for me. What I liked best about this movie is Leonardo. I do not want to sound like a broken record, but the man is an excellent actor. He gave his best to this movie and it is simply not his fault I did not enjoy the movie as much as I wanted to. Fortunately enough there is one scene in the movie which alone makes it worth seeing. After taking more than a few Quaalude Lemmon 714 pills, DiCaprio's character looses the use of his speech and of his legs. This is when we get to see DiCaprio give one of his best performances I have seen since he portrayed Arnie Grape in What's Eating Gilbert Grape. In these few minutes he shows us what a great actor he is, and how little is required to make a masterpiece of a short sequence. This is not a bad movie by any standards. I did like it, but not to the extent I wanted to. I expected more. I would still tell you all to go and see it. Perhaps we can compare notes? Cheers.",7,2,3,26 May 2014
