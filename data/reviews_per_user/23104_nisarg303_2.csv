The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," An Adventurous Journey..
","The Hobbit : An Unexpected Journey directed by Peter Jackson. The team of 17 Oscars of 'The Lord of the Rings Trilogy' is back with another trilogy. The Lord of the Rings Trilogy is by far the greatest adventure story put together on screen.The movie starts with detailing of Bilbo – the hobbit (Martin Freeman) who is living a simple life with his book and his food. A Long bearded wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) recruit him for an adventure with a company of thirteen dwarfs led by the legendary warrior (Richard Armitage).The Excitement starts when the adventure begin with Thirteen group of people led by Thorin. There are many scenes and many more creatures where you can not imagine what you seen on the big screen. But, Peter Jackson knows how to shoot those scenes.The scene that involves the mountains turns into life and fighting with each other is one of the best scene in the movie. Another one when Gollum (Andy Serkis) plays a riddle game with the Hobbit.In the acting department, Martin Freeman as Bilbo is perfect in his role. The brave Thorin played by Richard Armitage is superb and Gollum in his small role played by Andy Serkis is amazing to watch specially in riddle game scene.For the first time the film was shot at 48 FPS, I've seen in normal 24FPS in 3D as one of the best 3D yet.So, In this era of Special Effects, These filmmakers are always amaze me with their imagination and the presentation. Thumps Up for Peter Jackson's The Hobbit. Go and see this adventure, you'll never disappointed..",8,5,13,17 December 2012
