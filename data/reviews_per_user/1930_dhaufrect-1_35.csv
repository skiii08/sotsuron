The Avengers," Avengers are A +
","An example of inspiring cinema directed for young and old alike, 'The Avengers' is does it all in this recent block buster. I agree with Rabbi Scott of Houston's Congregation Emanu El, when he described the pleasure he derived from the mesmerized youngsters in the audience as much as his own enjoyment of this super hero film. Robert Downey, Jr. is Iron Man once again, and he gives another uniformly perfect performance. Chris Evans is Captain America, and he too is outstanding as this superman-like individual fighting for truth and justice and the 'American Way'. Mark Ruffalo plays Dr. Bruce Banner/ The Hulk and he too is well cast and successful with his part. Thor is portrayed by Chris Hemsworth, and he too is exemplary with his performance. Of course, there is Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, the leader of this brave crew. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff, is very convincing and an extremely tough ing√©nue in a film which is not directed by Woody Allen. Joss Whedon has written and directed this smash hit in 3D, and I advise that it be seen with this medium, since the special effects are enhanced to the point of overwhelming reality. Don't miss this remarkable Marvel comic piece. It is worth the effort for you and all the youngsters in the audience who will be glued to the screen.",10,12,25,25 May 2012
The Big Lebowski," It is a riot and well worth the time.
","'The Big Lewbowski' is an absolute riot.  It is filled with slapstick comedy with bawdy overtones.  There is no need to think.  The film is easily digested, and it is a belly buster.  Jeff Bridges plays The Dude, a Lebowski with charm who is a Los Angeles hobo.  He is assaulted by thugs at the beginning of the film.  His bowling buddy, John Goodman, Walter, is hysterically funny.  They have adventures that test the limits of humor. One should sit back and relax and really enjoy the casual presentation.  The drama is charming.  The characters are lovable.  The cinematography is excellent.  Even though it is a comedy, it has the feel of a fantasy with episodes of cartoon like floating through the sky by our protagonist.  This is a classic and should be in the DVD file of true film buffs.",9,1,2,26 May 2004
Fight Club," Difficult to Watch
","'Fight Club' is difficult to watch. It is filled with violence for violence sake without any redeeming qualities. Norton is a youth looking for a change of life style at an early age. Pitt plays a vulgar young man with pure violence on his mind. He infects his contacts with the same concept of life. Scene after scene is filled with blood and gore. Most of the violent behavior is purely hand to hand combat as in real boxing. If the author meant for us to be turned off by the physicality, then he has succeeded. The pace is frenetic, and the acting is just as fast. I could not give this cinema a high score simply because of the dark, depressing mood it exudes without projecting some sort of uplifting characteristic's.",3,0,3,1 March 2005
Memento," 'Memento' is an unforgettable film.
","'Memento is an unforgettable film. It is a challenge to the viewer, and provokes great doubt in one's own thought processes. It is about a man named Lenny played well by Guy Pearce. He witnesses his wife's murder, however, this fact evolves throughout the film. Lenny has to continually photograph his own life with a Polaroid camera in order to elicit his own memory traces. This is due to the fact that he suffers from anterograde amnesia from the concussion he received during the trauma to his wife. The cinematography is remarkable in that it transitions repeatedly from black and white to color. Neurologically, it is an accurate portrayal of this infirmity. Artistically, it is absorbing to the point that it deserves great praise. The director shows intense insight. The actors all give a convincing performance, and I can highly recommend this movie which is now out on DVD. One should not go into this drama with a preconceived notion of reality, for each moment is a shocking surprise time after time. It is a great movie. Don't miss it.",9,2,5,1 November 2004
Alexander," An Epic Bore
","'Alexander' is truly an epic bore with little if any redeeming qualities. In fact, it's worst quality is the extreme length. This film lasts a tortuous 3 hours and 20 minutes. One can count the minutes, thus Oliver Stone should be ashamed to have splashed this disaster on the silver screen.There is such a waste of great actors. Anthony Hopkins is abused by his role as narrator. Christopher Plummer is wasted as Aristotle. Val Kilmer plays Phillip, Alexander's father. They all give an adequate performance, but there was so little to work with because of the weak production. The scenery is spectacular, but so is the failure of this epic drama. Perhaps the 'R' rating will keep some folks away from the theater. I fear, however, that it will be used to simply attract the unsuspecting moviegoer. This would be a great one to miss. Staying to the end is a major challenge.",1,3,4,5 December 2004
Hot Fuzz," Bravo to 'Hot Fuzz'
","Bravo goes to 'Hot Fuzz' the 2007 film now available on NetFlix Instant Download Streaming. The British humor is rampant throughout the entire film and it is pure enjoyment. The director is Edgar Wright. It was written by Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg. The cast includes Simon Pegg, Martin Freeman, Bill Nighy, Robert Popper, Joe Cornish, Chris Waitt, Eric Mason, Billie Whitelaw, Nick Frost, Peter Wight, Julia Deakin, Tom Strode Walton, Troy Woollan, Rony Lowings, Bill Bailey, Paul Freeman, Trevor Nichols, Elizabeth Elvin, Stuart Wilson, Lorraine Hilton, Kevin Wilson, Nicholas Wilson, Tomothy Dalton, Jim Broadbent, Paddy Considine, Rafe Spall, Kevin Eldon, Karl Johnson, Sampson, Olivia Colman and Edward Woodward. The story is about a London police sergeant who is being promoted but out to a country town which is not of his choosing. The activity is hysterical and the action is terrific. I highly recommend this comedy and gave it 9 stars. Dale Haufrect",9,0,0,20 April 2015
Troy," An Epic Failure
","'Troy' is an epic in name only. As a cinematic version of the story from the Iliad, it is an epic failure. Perhaps there is a strong adolescent interest to observe Brad Pitt. Such a presentation only makes the audience more interesting than the product on the silver screen. There are magnanimous scenes with the Trojan warriors at battle frequently enough to bore even the avid war film buff. The most astounding fact about this movie is the presence of Peter O'Toole as the king of Troy. His role is such a B movie is depressing to say the least. It is a waste of a fine actor, and one would only hope that he does not repeat this mistake. Brad Pitt has gained a substantial amount of muscle to portray Achilles. He gives an adequate performance, but it is not a memorable film. In fact it is difficult to find kind words for the epic mistake.",3,1,3,24 May 2004
Midnight in Paris," Allen does it again.
","Yes, Woody Allen has written and directed another hit film that is funny and nostalgic and socially meaningful. Indeed, 'Midnight in Paris' is so enticing that it outshines even some of his most recent hits. Owen Wilson is a prince of a character as Gil, the present day writer who is carried back to the years of the great impressionists and interacts with them as easily as if he were transported by a time machine. This is a romantic comedy that will entertain you while it also brings to question relationships and the meaning of life: common themes in Allen's works. None of his fans should miss this masterpiece. Don't let it slip by unless you are home bound and wish to pick up the DVD or Blu Ray at a later date. One may find that Vickie Christina Barcelona was funnier, but this cinema is both clever and deep in meaning. It is a top film of Woody Allen's and a first class film of quality and intellect.",10,2,6,6 June 2011
Hotel Rwanda," 'Hotel Rwanda' is an historical drama.
","'Hotel Rwanda' is an historical drama with good merit. Terry George has directed this film independently, and therefore the budget constraints peek through. There is a very intense performance by Don Cheadle as Paul Rusesabagina who does his best to save lives in a tragic situation in Africa. His wive, Tatiana Rusesabagina played by Sophie Okonedo is equally as inspiring in her empathic portrayal. Nick Nolte plays Colonel Oliver, a United Nations Colonel, who is practically impotent in his ability to give aid to an impossible situation. Nolte is a drawback for he seems to read lines without any regard for believability. He fails to convince the audience that he is really a young United Nations military person. This movie is worth seeing for it's historical importance. An epic portrayal is lacking, but the essence remains. It is not a film of entertainment, but it is one for education.",7,2,4,16 January 2005
Closer," Relationships in Turmoil
","'Closer' is a very dynamic film. It illustrates the turmoil of two relationships that are steeped in love at first site. Natalie Portman Alice, gives another perfect performance that even surpasses the prior one in 'Garden State'. Jude Law is excellent as the doting acquaintance who develops amorous click with his professional photographer, Anna, played by Julia Roberts. Clive Owen, plays Larry, the dermatologist who is duped into this original triangle by Law's character. Indeed, the duping on the chat room via the computer is a humorous comment on today's writing atmosphere. Jude Law plays a writer of an obituary column who is elevated to editor only because of the death of his predecessor. There is raw sexual exhibition in a London strip club. The story if dynamic. Mike Nichols has directed another winner. He has maintained his successful ability to communicate in film. Bravo to this cinema.",10,1,3,16 January 2005
Captain America: The First Avenger," A thrilling fantasy is 'Captain America: The First Avenger'
","A real thrilling fantasy is 'Captain America:the First Avenger'. It is directed aptly by Joe Johnston. And it was written by Christopher Markus as well as Stephen McFeely. The protagonist is Captain America (Steve Rogers) aptly played by Chris Evans. He initially is rejected by the Selective Service for military duty in WWII. But he is persistent in his pursuit for physical success and eventually winds up on the front lines. Hayley Atwell plays Peggy Carter, and she portrays a dedicated woman with super heroine gusto. Sebastian Stan is James Buchanan, (Bucky Barnes). And Tommy Lee Jones gives his usual precise performance as the Colonel Chester Phillips who is in command and needs to be convinced that Captain America can handle the challenges frequently encountered. Hugo Weaving is Johann Schmidt with a red skull as his persona. He is menacing in his portrayal of this mean, dark character. It is an action packed film that can please the adult as well as the young at heart. It got a two thumbs up.",9,0,2,15 September 2013
Rush," 'Rush' is worth watching
","'Rush' is another cinematic success for its director, Ron Howard. It is a 2013 film written by Peter Morgan and is currently available on NetFlix Instant Download Streaming. The film is just over 2 hours long, but when it was over it seemed like I had been in the cinema about 30 minutes. The film centers on the battle for the 1976 Formula 1 World Championship, and the rivalry between the Austrian 'professor' Nikki Lauda and the British playboy James Hunt. The two are depicted as enemies, but in actual fact they were good friends who trusted and respected each other on, as well as off- track. This bit of artistic license does not spoil the film and is reasonable in order to make the battle between the two for the F1 crown more intense. The film is nicely paced. We are introduced to both characters through their own narrative and scenes that leave the watcher in no doubt as to their background and philosophy on life. The two are first seen in competition in 1970 at a Formula 3 race at Crystal Palace (where they have a coming together) and sets the scene for the rivalry throughout the film. I'm not sure if this is further artistic license. The two definitely did race each other in F3, but I am not convinced as to whether this actual incident occurred. After that we are given a whistle stop journey between 1973 (when Hunt came into F1) to 1975. We are shown the dangerous nature of F1 at the time with the Francois Cevert accident at Watkins Glen in gory detail ‚Äì although this does not seem like gratuitous, but necessary to bring home just how unforgiving the sport was back then ‚Äì and it truly was (of the top 12 points scorers in 1976, F1 cars were to claim 3, 1 ended up in a wheelchair and 1 had his career ended by a leg crunching crash). I gave it 9 stars.",9,0,1,18 May 2015
The Aviator," 'The Aviator' flies high.
","Leonardo DiCaprio gives an outstanding performance as Howard Hughes in 'The Aviator'. He evolves into a true replica of both the image as well as the persona of this complex character. Martin Scorcese is right on track in his direction of this excellent production. Jude Law is especially classy in his portrayal of Errol Flynn. Katharine Hepburn is portrayed by Kate Beckinsale and she gives a very convincing performance. Alan Alda is Senator Ralph Owen Brewster of Connecticut who assaults Hughes publicly in his Senate hearings. The psychopathy of Hughes is very believable and pithy. DiCaprio has obviously studied the psychiatric background of schizophrenia with intensity. One is overwhelmed by his characterization, and sympathy evolves for this extremely wealthy character of an earlier time in American History. The airplane scenes alone are worth the price of admission, and my hat goes off to everyone who participated in the making of this important movie. If one enjoyed 'A Beautiful Mind', then this movie will be equally if not more provocative.",10,1,3,16 January 2005
L√©on: The Professional," 'Leon: The Professional' is a great film.
","'Leon: The Professional' is a great movie from 1994. The director and the writer is Luc Besson. It is currently on NetFlix Instant Download Streaming. Luc Besson's movie L√©on (The Professional) gives us an intense story which is maximized in potential by the casting of the movie done by Todd Thaler. Every aspect of the movie delivers to the audience and makes an impressive overall package. Jean Reno plays a character named L√©on who has learned to repress his emotions in order to perform his job as a 'cleaner', or hit-man. His secluded world is shattered by the young girl named Mathilda who lives on the same floor as he does in an apartment building. When she turns to him for help, he learns about living a normal life, even if the circumstances which unite them are far from normal. The performance delivered by then twelve-year old Natalie Portman as Mathilda is nothing short of brilliant. Her ability to relate to others with body movement and facial gestures is matched by few, she really brings raw emotion and believability to a difficult role. Mathilda and L√©on are unexpectedly thrown together, but learn to value life from their chance encounter, and how valuable a friendship can be. Jean Reno as L√©on gives us a solemn and calculated character who sets all of his energy on his assignments until her is given something else to care about. Mathilda gives him the daughter that he never had, while L√©on serves as a father and friend to her. Gary Oldman, as the corrupt DEA Agent Norman Stansfield, offers the viewers an amazingly wired and electrical performance which pushes the envelope. He moves the story along by his actions. Oldman offers us a memorable portrait of a sadistically obsessed man who stops short of nothing to get what he wants. The Professional is what movie-making is all about. Without the overuse of special effects, a large shooting location, or a commercially star studded cast, we are given all that could possibly be asked for in a movie. Portman, Oldman, and Reno, along with Danny Aiello as the hit-contractor Tony remind us that there is no substitute for great acting. There are elements of comedy, drama, and action, and great original music by Eric Serra adds to the energy the film already encapsulates. The most impressive thing about the movie is its story which is basic but is maximized by all the other elements which go into the making of the movie. Simply put, an intense and impressive movie. I gave it 10 stars. Dale Haufrect",10,3,4,20 May 2015
The Village," Waste of Talent
","'The Village' is a waste of good talent.  M. Night Shyanlam has written and directed a real loser for some fairly good actors.  There are some exceptions to a scathing review.  There are moments of great photography, and there is a color quality that speaks for itself.  The eerie music is wasted on a bad film.  There is little to enjoy.  Bryce Dallas Howard remains remarkably good as the blind Ivy Walker, Hurt's daughter.  She is true to form, but another waste of a good performer.  Joaquin Phoenix also gives a good performance, but the stilted peculiar stage business is boring to say the least.  Don't waste your time or money on this cinema.  It is a mundane example of childish storytelling.",2,1,2,8 August 2004
American Psycho," 'American Psycho' is a thrilling thriller.
","American Psycho' is a thrilling film currently available on NetFlix Instant Download Streaming. It is directed by Mary Harron. And it is written by Bret Easton Ellis with the screenplay by Mary Harron. Set in the 1980s, the book follows the story of a 27-year-old Harvard graduate named Patrick Bateman, who goes on a killing spree and murders 'twenty, maybe forty people.' It was originally slated for circulation in 1990, but Random House pulled out of distribution, fearing backlash. It was later released as part of a Vintage Series, and quickly sold over 250,000 copies, becoming one of the most popular (and, to some, important) literary works of our time. In the movie, Welsh actor Christian Bale portrays Bateman gleefully tongue-in-cheek, whether it's confessing to manslaughter over the phone ('¬ÖI just had to kill a lot of people!') or dancing to Huey Lewis and the News' 'Fore' album before hitting an associate over the head with an ax. Patrick is a troubled guy. On the surface, he appears to be normal ‚Äì he's a Wall Street broker with a secretary, an expensive apartment suite, his own limo and a fancy business card. But on the inside, he's a monster ‚Äì complete with an insatiable blood lust and lack of empathy for fellow human beings. (If he can indeed be classified as one.) As a film and a novel, 'American Psycho' is an attack on the absurdities of the '80s yuppie era ‚Äì sometimes the satire isn't very subtle, in fact it's often made very clear, but I liked it. Because the movie is so eccentric and over-the-top, and Bale is so loony and maniacal, the satire needs to be equally strong ‚Äì and it is. Whether it's business men drooling over each other's fetishistic business cards or Patrick discussing the nuances of modern pop music before killing more victims, 'American Psycho' hits strong and hard ‚Äì this is a great, overwhelming cinematic and visual experience. It cannot be condemned for being unsubtle ‚Äì it never was. The performances are wonderful. Bale is superb as Bateman, totally embodying the character. As a man bewildered by his environment, and wanting only desperately to fit in, Bateman listens to Genesis and 'Hip to Be Square'; finally we have proof that too much Phil Collins and Huey Lewis will turn you into the next Ed Gein. Perhaps some fans of the novel will dislike Bale's performance (at times, it almost seems comical, such as when he murders his coworker Paul Allen, played by Jared Leto). But I thought it was the perfect mix of introspection, self-hatred, outer-loathing, lust, conformity and schizophrenia. Bale manages to capture all of this perfectly, and by the end of the film, I could not imagine anyone else in the role. Willem Dafoe, Chloe Sevigny and Reese Witherspoon all have co- starring roles, but at the end of the day it is Bale who really drives this film home ‚Äì he's the reason it's worth seeing, and in part the reason it exceeds beyond the typical restraints of its genre.",8,0,1,6 May 2015
Hugo," A delightful piece of Museum quality artwork is 'Hugo'
","Martin Scorcese has directed another museum quality piece of artwork in his cinema, 'Hugo'. It is written by John Logan with screenplay by Brian Selznick and it is a must see film. My only regret is waiting for the Blu Ray since I do not have the 3D enhancement that really must have made a huge difference in the actual theaters. It is set in the 1930's in Paris, and the depth of field and fading perspectives are spectacular even without glasses. The colors are brilliant, and the acting is especially well due in part to Scorceses perfect casting. The boy is very intense yet innocent. His intrigue with the past as well as his interaction with the other characters brings tears to ones eyes. Ben Kingsley emotes a fine performance as an artist with emotion that permeates the screen. Sacha Baron Cohen is superbly cast as the station inspector who has humor, discipline and finally a delicate heart that matches his empathy for Hugo. Even the former Vampire character, Christopher Lee, plays Monsieur Labisse and he too has a heart as good a gold. 'Hugo' is a film to be seen by all ages. It entangles the soul in a very compelling manner, and I recommend to see it in the original 3D if you can find it in such projection. Don't miss it even if you see it on the Blu Ray Disc, it is a treat to be relished and treasured for a very long time to come.",10,3,6,13 March 2012
Warrior," A Superior film worthy of the title 'Warrior'
","Gavin O'Connor and Anthony Tambakis have written a superlative screenplay for 'Warrior', a film most deserving of all of its great praise. Nick Nolte gives an expected great performance as Paddy Conlon, the father with a sordid past and compelling abandonment issues. Joel Edgerton and the British performer, Tom Hardy, are perfectly cast as the brothers (warriors) and Note's sons. The casting is perfection itself. The fight scenes are brutal yet so compelling that one finds oneself sitting at the edge of one's seat with the excitement of a real match.It is difficult for me to cherish this film any more than I have already expressed, and I would put it at the top of my next 'Must See' list if any of the movie buffs have not yet watched it. It is now available in Blu Ray Discs and well worth the rent or purchase. It is a film that you will remember long after your viewing.",10,0,3,26 January 2012
Dreamgirls," A Real Dream
","As can be confirmed by the nominations, 'Dreamgirls' is a real dream of a film. Condon has directed a masterpiece of musical art that can compete with the best. Jamie Foxx underplays well as Curtis Taylor, Jr. His character is consistent throughout the film, and his singing abilities have already be shown in his prior work. Beyonce Knowles plays Deena Jones, and she too is perfect in her part. Her stage presence is beautifully displayed in this great example of her profound talents. Eddie Murphy deserves every bit of his nomination for best supporting actor by the Academy. He delivers a powerful performance as James 'Thunder' Early who has a premature demise due to drugs. Danny Glover also underplays his character of Marty Madison in a way that keeps him believable and sincere. The shockingly, pleasing performance was delivered by Jennifer Hudson. Her singing is superior, and her performance is one that no serious lover of musicals should miss.",10,1,2,26 February 2007
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," 40 - Year old Virgin is for the under 40's
","'40 - Year Old Virgin' is a slapstick comedy that will definitely entertain the adolescents in the crowd. One should be warned that every other word is the 'F' word or something similar. However, it is rated R and therefore entertaining to the younger folks without reservation. Many of us older fogies got a lot of belly laughs as well. John Stewart gave it a good review on his Cable Network show 'Comedy Central', and the plug was well taken. One should not expect to see an academy award winning performance by anyone, but give it a chance and have a great time at the movies. It is clearly understood now why it this cinema has done so well at the box office. It may prove to be a rental success as well. I gave it an 8 purely out of infantile entertainment value. See it. You'll like it.",8,1,5,22 August 2005
The Intouchables," 'The Intouchables' is Touching.
","The French film, 'The Intouchables' is a very moving story based on true to life characters. It is directed by Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano. And it is written by Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano as well. The story involves a wealthy quadriplegic man who is aided by a black man of little means. The plot quickly evolves and is checkered with bits of comic relief as in many of Shakespeare's plays. There are moments of tearfulness as well as outright laughter interspersed in such a way as to make this a very satisfying experience. I can highly recommend this French film with subtitles for it's humanity that is quite evident from beginning to end. In addition the sound track of cars racing down the road give one's sound system a vigorous workout.",10,1,2,12 September 2013
Bridesmaids," 'Bridesmaids' is a comedy hit.
","Paul Feig has directed a comedy that will bring you to tears. He has turned the writings of Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo into a side splitting comedy that just won't quit. It is not a 'Chick Flick' as many may presume, but it is rather one hilarious scene after another as I have not seen in many years. The costuming is great. The casting by Allison Jones is perfect, and the cinematography by Robert D. Yeoman is very effective. I don't know if he kept a straight face while filming, but it must have been a very difficult task. The audience should thank the producers for providing the audience with a full two hours of fun and frolic. I doubt that it could have been any better, and more just like it would be welcome from these truly professional comedians. Please don't make it too long a time before the next sequel, the audiences are eagerly awaiting another side splitter.",7,0,3,14 March 2012
Meet the Fockers," Very Funny Film
","'Meet The Fockers' is a very funny film. The zenith of it's success is the performance given by Dustin Hoffman. He plays a middle aged Jewish lawyer who seems to have never practiced his trade. He is financially dependent on his wife, played by Barbara Streisand. She is a working sex therapist for the elderly, and the concept alone is a humorous one. She gives a fairly good performance in a role that is funny in it's own right. Ben Stiller plays their son who is introducing his in-laws to the folks in their humble abode in Florida. Robert DiNero is the retired CIA agent and father of the bride. He tries to maintain his inner circle of secrecy with his own family, but eventually bends under the psychological assault by the Fockers. The title is funny. Hoffman is funny, and the experience is worth the effort just for his performance alone. It is light, and can be a pleasing cinema experience. Do not look for a classic, but do find a very enjoyable couple of hours at the movies.",6,0,1,16 January 2005
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," An unusual improvement with 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes'
","Rupert Wyatt has directed a surprisingly improved episode of the traditional 'Planet of the Apes' series films. It is definitely unique and incomparable to prior editions. James Fanco plays Will Rodman, a current day scientist involved in a similar fashion to the very well recognized book and film, 'A Perfect Day for Algernon'. He is adequate in his role yet subservient to the perfectly designed chimpanzees who are the real stars of this cinema in a similar way to 'Rosie', the elephant in 'Water for Elephants', also a well made picture.This movie very much compels great empathy for the lower mammalian world, and gives pause to the hectic world we are currently experiencing globally. One should not be fooled by the title but rather relax into the dramatic story about to overwhelm you with drama, comedy and solace. Hollywood has done it again. Let's hope it keeps up the great record.",9,1,2,6 February 2012
Hero," 'Hero' is a winner.
","'Hero' is a winner of a film. It combines all of the elements of 'The Matrix' and 'Kill Bill' to provide excitement beyond one's expectations. This film stars Jet Li. Tony Leung Chiu Wai plays Broken Sword. Maggie Cheung plays Flying Snow. The culprit is the King of Qin played well by Daoming Chen. The war games are done is a dance like fashion that defies gravity. The cinematography alone is worth the price of admission. Color speckles the canvas on the screen in such a way as to emulate a visit to a fine museum. Don't let this masterpiece slip away. It is now on DVD. Even without the understanding of the Chinese language, one can have a great theater experience. 'Hero' is a 10 in my book.",10,1,2,7 March 2005
Million Dollar Baby," 'Million Dollar Baby' is A Compelling Daram
","'Million Dollar Baby' is a very compelling drama. Clint Eastwood has directed a very controversial masterpiece. He portrays the retired boxer and now trainer, Frankie Dunn. He has not seen his estranged daughter, Katie, in years. He persists in writing to her weekly, but he never receives a response. He is associated with Morgan Freeman's character, Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris, also retired and suffering from the loss of his right eye from an earlier fight. The real star of this picture is Hilary Swank who gives a very believable performance of a moderately young female boxer to be. She aches to be trained by Eastwood's character, and finally earns the right to do so. The emotional and complex ending is too overwhelming to describe in this brief epistle, and one should not spoil it for the viewing public. Suffice it to say that you should bring your box of tissue, and chew on the meat of this drama for a long time after it is ended on the screen. It deserves as many thumbs up as it can get.",10,5,9,1 February 2005
Garden State," Garden State a brilliant comedy.
","'Garden State' is a brilliant success of a comedy by Zach Braff. He has written, directed, and starred in the best comedy of the year. Despite the fact that it is an adult comedy, the audiences are replete with a younger crowd. Zach's girl friend, Sam, played by Natalie Portman, is deliciously funny. The stage business is remarkably sharp and plentiful. There are many rapid surprises of humor which will embrace one with the laughs that this cinema so rightly deserves. There is only one major medical flaw in this film. Zach's character refers to an incident in his childhood when he accidentally pushed his mother down. She falls and hits her neck, yet becomes paraplegic. The correct neurological term would be quadriplegic, but the medical preciseness in unnecessary because the flow of humor is so fast and furious. This is a great comedy, and it should be on everyone's 'must see' list for this cinema season. Don't miss it.",10,0,1,4 September 2004
Shrek 2," Excellent Cartoon
","'Shrek 2' is an excellent cartoon. With the new computer generated images, this format is an enhancement on cartoons in general. Mike Myers plays the voice of Shrek once again. He is the ideal choice for this role. Eddie Murphy's voice is again a stroke of genius as the delightful donkey. Cameron Diaz is the voice of the Princess Fiona. Julie Andrews is the voice of the queen. Antonio Banderas gives a good boost to this movie with the clever voice of Puss In Boots. And John Cleese gives a believable interpretation of the voice of the king. The story is well organized. The music is catchy, and the overall effect is quite entertaining. It is worth the DVD, especially to entertain the grandchildren.",8,0,0,16 February 2005
Big Fish," 'Big Fish' is a fantasy par excellence!
","'Big Fish' is a delightful fantasy.  It is well delivered by the director, Tim Burton.  The screenplay by John August is a perfect fit to the silver screen.  Albert Finney plays senior Ed Bloom, a story teller who pores his heart into his never ending stories to his son, Will.  Billy Crudup, Will Bloom, is perfect in his underplay of the son searching for a portion of communication with his estranged father.  He has not spoken to his dad in several years, and he searches for a line of communication through the adventures that he recalls as childhood fairy tales.  Robert Guillaume plays the family's doctor taking care of the dying father with a gentle and understanding hand.  He gives a very comforting performance.  Mathew McGrory plays Karl the Giant, and the camera angles are very convincing in solidifying his character.  All moviegoers with a sense of imagination should see this movie.  It is a compelling, warmhearted film.  It is truly a fantasy, par excellence.  Put it on your must see list.  A box of Kleenex may not be a bad idea.",9,3,4,27 August 2004
Alice in Wonderland," 'Alice without Malice'
","'Alice In Wonderland' is a charming film that is now available on DVD and Blu Ray. It is Tim Burton's version of Lewis Carroll's classic novel by nearly the same name. I don't agree with the malice that is heaped upon this film by many critics. It is unjustified malice, and it fails to recognize the great genre of fantasy. Fantasy does, indeed, provide far more leeway for the director to experiment with his chosen field. The computer generated imagery seems to enhance the story rather than detract from its intentions.Johnny Depp gives a very entertaining performance as the Mad Hatter. His facial expressions are truly unique to this exceptional actor. Mia Wasikowka plays a very convincing Alice, and her emotional roller coaster is well appreciated. Alan Rickman is the voice of the Blue Caterpillar. His voice in this film is worth the price of admission. Anne Hathaway portrays the White Queen in a believable performance. And Helena Bonham Carter does likewise for the Red Queen.Despite the fantasy genre of this movie, it has scenes that might be frightening for the very young. It is a very slick film, and it is worth seeing for those who are young at heart.",9,2,3,3 June 2010
Departures," 'Departures' is literally a departure from the ordinary film.
","Yojiro Takita has created a masterpiece of cultural and musical cinema that literally overwhelms the audience with humor, emotion, sensitivity and great talent. The story surrounds a Cellist in the symphony in Tokyo. He is Daigo Kobayashi, played so perfectly by Masahiro Motoki. His wife, Mika Kobayashi, played by Ryoko Hirosue, is equally as artful in her role as an adoring spouse willing to grow and learn in their marriage. After the symphony owner closes the organization, the couple moves to Daigo's original home town village where he is desperate for a job (now in debt for his beautiful cello). The very most outstanding role is that of Ikuei Sasaki, played so well by Tsutomu Yamazaki. He is the 'Okuribito' or one who prepares the body for cremation. His believable and sensitive portrayal of this unusual job is remarkable. There are of course musical interludes with the cello as well as the symphony that powerfully supplement the already dynamic cinematic experience. It is not a film for those who are unable to appreciate the sadness of the death experience, however, I highly recommend this film and its honest approach to a delicate subject that is handled with dignity for one of life's most common experiences. It is now available on DVD and a 2008 film not to be missed.",10,0,0,10 February 2012
Man on Fire," 'Man on Fire' is long but exciting.
","'Man of Fire' is a long film, yet it maintains the the audience in suspense till the end. Creasy (Denzel Washington) is an international assassin who is hired by a Mexican CEO to protect the daughter, Pita (Dakota Fanning) from the Mexican kidnappers who are rampant in that country. Dakota is a naive young girl who trusts everyone. She plays well and endears the audience for more. Denzel is his usual intense self with another outstanding performance in a difficult role. Pita's mother, (Rafha Mitchell) is also well played and her emotions are worn on her sleeve throughout the film. Christopher Walken plays Creasy's old friend who attracts him to Mexico to obtain employment from Pita's father. There is intrigue, and violence. The cinematography is at times television in quality, but this technique is useful during some of the more hectic scenes.'Man on Fire' is worth an afternoon at the movies.",7,0,0,16 May 2004
American Gangster," 'American Gangster' is spectacular.
","Ridley Scott has directed a masterful film. His talents have once again sparkled the silver screen with heightened emotion mixed with violence. The scenes of interplay are subdued sufficiently to appease the general audiences. The historical aspects of the movie is profoundly interesting and only somewhat surprising in view of the era from which the story is drawn. Denzel Washington plays Frank Lucas, a powerhouse of an individual who seemingly single handedly takes over a major crime syndicate in New York. Russell Crowe plays Richie Roberts, the adversarial New York, Jewish cop who sticks with his convictions despite multiple trials and tribulations on duty. He too delivers a convincing performance that is far underplayed as he can so easily do. Ruby Dee plays Mama Lucas, the little momma who can keep Frank eating out of her hand. This film is well worth the price of admission, and it provides an education of the era that will stay with you long after it is over. I highly recommend seeing it on the big screen.",9,0,4,12 November 2007
The Bourne Supremacy," Excitement Par Excellence
","'Bourne Supremacy' is an excellent sequel to the original movie which is likewise a winner.  The energy and excitement of Matt Damon's performance is unsurpassed.  One becomes exhausted by the time the film reaches a climax. There is no secret that this movie is a great success.  The numbers alone attest to that.  The acting is solid.  The photography is fluid.  The musical score is compatible with the pace.  After the 'Bourne Identity' was released, one could not wait for the sequel to arrive.  It is now here and it is a smashing success.  I would recommend anyone with a desire to see a thriller, that this is the one for this summer season.  Put it on your must see list.  And one should be prepared to catch your breath for a mind boggling climax.",9,3,4,8 August 2004
Shark Tale," 'Shark Tale' is a musical hit.
","'Shark Tale'is a real musical hit. Katie Couric's voice is heard as Katie Current.She is delightfully cast in this role. Will Smith plays the voice of Oscar the energetic fish. Robert De Niro is the voice of Don Lino, and he does a whale of a good job. Angelina Jolie plays the voice of Lola,and her character is as sexy as the actual star. This cartoon done with much computer generated animation is a charm. It is not as satisfying as some of the original Disney cartoons of the 50's, but the music is worth the rental. It is now on DVD and one should see it with the kids. The credits are just as much fun as the film. The children will be enchanted.",7,0,2,10 March 2005
