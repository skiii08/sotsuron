50 First Dates," Bristol Bay
","The only thing that bothered me about that movie is that Bristol Bay is never, ever ever that calm, and that boat would have been eaten alive in Bristol Bay.Other than that I loved the movie. I thought it was pretty funny. For those people that are complaining about Adam Sandler moving into more romantic comedies, I think they need to expand their ability to think and handle more substantive issues in their movies.Anyway, that boat would have been ripped to shreds in Bristol Bay, nor would anybody be hanging out on the deck drinking drinks, because they would be trying to stay alive in the 80 knot winds and freezing temperatures. Living in Alaska, I hate it when people seem to show complete ignorance towards the state.",Null,0,0,28 February 2004
American Beauty," Why did they make this film?
","I feel worse for having seen this film. This film depressed me and gave me no real reason for hope at the end of it. I understand that this may be a reality for some people, but that's not a good enough reason to make a film.This film had no redeemable qualities, I would recommend that unless you are sadistic and like being depressed that you skip this one.",5,0,0,12 May 2003
