Blade Runner 2049," A relatively 'happy' ending to a depressing 163' of film
","BLADE RUNNER 2049's qualities are the acting, direction, unremittingly bleak photography, great computer-generated effects, and female beauty to die for.The film's main weakness is the plot, which rambles on and on and on. Yes, androids want to be more than electric sheep, that was obvious to Philip K. Dick when he wrote the novel that became the BLADE RUNNER of 1982. But Gosling's character's odyssey to track down Deckard (Harrison Ford), supposing that he is his father, is just too far- fetched to make any real sense, even if one appreciates that the android desperately wishes to feel human emotions. The memorable sequences are Gosling's lovemaking with a melding of two women, and Sean Young's brief return to the screen in all her beauty. The disappointing sequence is the climax underwater: In such a polluted world, you'd expect that water to kill you if you came into contact with it. Surviving all that time while fighting killing machines is just too improbable.Robin Wright's talent is sadly underused and the presence of a dog is truly mystifying - unless it, too, is an electric sheep.By the end of it, there was a bittersweet reunion between Deckard and his daughter, making for a relatively 'happy', if rather pointless, ending. Sadly, by then my life was 163' shorter with very little to show for it. Disappointing 6/10.",6,10,24,5 October 2017
Hereditary," Fine direction, good acting and yet...
","Ari Aster, who debuts as director, has done a very fine job of keeping the spectator riveted without using conventional music or scary sound effects. In fact, the scariest moment in the movie comes from young daughter's swallowing in her saliva. Toward the end, one hears what appears to be a yoga mantra, and never has any mantra sounded more terrifying.The claustrophobic atmosphere is appropriate and well exploited but the moment Joanie comes in with her supernatural contacts, the film begins to go over the top. There is far too much gore in a film that actually tries to be subtle most of the time. And Peter's coronation as Paimon in the end struck me as a damp squib, after all the shenanigans and cruel killings.Finally, Gabriel Byrne is simply wasted as Steve, a husband who apparently just misses the plot altogether and has no authority at all within the family. What about sleepwalker Collette and all her miniature furniture and people? Couldn't see the point of it. Admittedly, this is not my type of movie, but I cannot honestly give it more than 6/10",6,1,2,5 July 2018
A Star Is Born," Apparently serious, actually glib approach to serious subject. Lady Gaga steals show
","Bradley Cooper took on the tough task of directing, singing and acting in, the latest version of A STAR IS BORN. To be honest, I have never found this story particularly interesting, and in fact I suspect that the 1954 version with James Mason and Judy Garland borrowed quite a bit from Charlie Chaplin's LIMELIGHT (US 1952), and the 1976 version, with Streisand and Kristoferson was a mishmash that relied solely on starpower and deservedly bombed with critics and box office alike.And now, this third version which I do not find any better than its predecessors. Lady Gaga singlehandedly keeps the film interesting. Her unusual beauty and wonderful voice kept me wanting to see her, eagerly waiting for her to come back on screen.Sadly, the character who plays her father comes across as very uneven, unintentionally funny, and it is hard to decide whether he is just greedy, or a liar, or both... and at one point he seems willing to beat the stools out of Maine but, before you know it, he is conveniently doing something else.
Bradley Cooper took on too much: he should have directed only. Although be begins well enough. he is far too long on screen, giving the impression that he cannot have enough of himself.Ally's manager is also played by a completely unremarkable actor.To make matters worse, Jackson Maine, the character he depicts, is a drug addict and an alcoholic who feels continually and annoyingly sorry for himself. In the end, his decision to cop out of life makes him a real loser.I do not know if Cooper sings his songs in the movie. If so, perhaps he should have sung only, because his voice is quite pleasant.Photography is generally very good, the second saving grace after Lady Gaga, and dialogue is rather patchy.Even after he has died in script, Cooper does not go away. At the slightest opportunity, everybody remembers and cries over him. It must have been tough for Cooper to get rid of himself - which is a pity because this film could have done with about 20 minutes less (overall) and 30 minutes removed from Cooper's performance would have hurt none at all.",6,5,8,25 October 2018
Wind River," Atmospheric
","I guess shooting an entire film in the snow and cold helps render it very consistent in terms of atmosphere, and atmosphere is indeed WIND RIVER's strong suit. The acting is competent, even from Renner, who has a difficult part because in the midst of his silences he keeps distributing pearls of wisdom about losing one's children, how to live, and other existential predicaments. Still, he comes very effectively across as a terrific shot and the man you need around in times of trouble. Graham Greene is outstanding as the experienced and attentive head of the police force in the reservation. He does not appear much, but promptly commands attention. Kelsey Asbille I did not find convincing. The motley crew that rape the Indian girl all sound convincingly depraved, and certainly there is an eerie sensation that there is no law and it is sheer survival out there.Direction is sound and assured, but far from exceptional.The screenplay opens in media res, is credible and with many punchlines, but at times dips into some annoying moralism. Also, suddenly it veers into a flashback which explains what happened at the beginning, that caused the Indian girl's murder. I found it a clich√©- ish form of storytelling that detracted from the film's modern look and even technology.Those minor reservations aside, WIND RIVER is an above average film well worth watching.",7,3,7,23 August 2017
The Death of Stalin," Intelligent, splendid political satire with Monty Pythonesque touches
","I had never heard of director Armando Iannucci but I take my hat off to him for an excellent script, a wonderful sense of dark humor, and for extracting truly top drawer performances from Russell Beale (absolutely fabulous as Lavrenti Beria), Michael Palin (as Molotov) and Steve Buscemi (as Nikita Kruschev). With a mainly British ensemble, the Monty Pythonesque touch about this dark comedy is hardly surprising. The best part is the way each individual in the Soviet leadership is saving his skin while trying to further his interests i.e. rise to the top. The way they differ about things but ultimately all vote 'unanimously' is hilarious, as is the way that Stalin and Beria draw up 'lists' of people to be executed.As the saying goes, 'the greatest truths are told in jest.' It is certainly the case in THE DEATH OF STALIN. Of course, it is not historically faithful, of course it is a kind of spoof that comes out at a curious time when Brits and Russians trade expulsions of embassy personnel; and yet, it nails something about the depravity of those times, and of the MAN OF STEEL (Stalin) who is believed to be responsible for the deaths of some 20 million people.Given the scarcity of thought-provoking movies these days, I was very happy to have watched this film which I see as a minor masterpiece and possibly the best movie I have watched this year.",9,7,11,9 May 2018
Pirate Radio," Good fun but unnecessarily long
","I can think of very few films with a more enticing soundtrack than THE BOAT THAT ROCKED (aka PIRATE RADIO), and for that alone it is worth watching. Other pluses include assured direction and photography, and very good acting by all, including shiny small parts by Branagh and Thompson. Dialogue is good, with some very sharp one-liners, but the film is needlessly long, especially at the end, when the boat sinks, a sequence that is milked to death. Were that sequence economical enough to shorten the movie by 10 minutes, I would have easily given this film one more star. Alas, 7/10 is the most I can give to a film that is otherwise great fun to watch.",7,1,2,23 January 2018
The Prestige," Frankly, this is one movie I'll never watch again

BlacKkKlansman," Profoundly racist film by Spike Lee
","Spike Lee has, from his earliest film, depicted whites as dumb, exploitative, manipulative, redneck, and uncivilized, among other negative traits.In contrast, he portrays the black person as the victim, the enslaved soul of goodness trampled underfoot, and demeaned by whites. The only good souls among the latter come from the Jewish, a minority biblically known to include various races, including the Falasha, a black tribe hailing from Ethiopia. In other words, from Spike Lee's standpoint, the only good whites are those who are not completely white.I am a white born in Mozambique, Africa, and am proud to have had, and to continue to have, blacks, Chinese, Asian Indians, and mulattoes among my friends.While I find political correctness a destroyer of art, and welcome the fact that Spike Lee does not hesitate to blast it, I find BLACK K KLANSMAN a profoundly racist film. The highly intelligent black rookie quickly outsmarts all daft whites in the police force, launching an investigation into KKK with the very help of the white estabishment Lee so attacks.Lee directed the excellent 25TH HOUR in 2002. In it he showed talent that he has sadly withheld from the public since. Which is a pity, because he could have been a director of the highest cut. Instead, he has elected to go on racist tirades of dubious moral authority.Direction is heavy-handed and biased; acting is pedestrian; script is uneven and you have to suspend your desbelief to unbelievable lengths to believe the action (especially when the white woman is trying to plant a bomb in Laura Harrier's post box); and cinematography is mediocre, to put it mildly.Best avoided, unless you are a diehard Spike Lee fan.2/10. One star for the exquisitely beautiful Laura Harrier and the other for the superb recreation of Afro hair styles of the 1970s.",2,45,93,20 March 2019
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," The greatest truths are told in jest
","Director Stanley Kubrick made three films of absolute genius: PATHS OF GLORY (1957), DR STRANGELOVE (1963) and 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (1968). The first two were on the subjects of war and treason, but while the former was extremely serious, DR STRANGELOVE is a dark comedy which tells many truths about the delicate balance of the nuclear bomb and peace, in contrast with FAILSAFE, a film which came out on the same year but which approached the subject of nuclear conflict from a much more factual and formal angle.I can safely say that DR STRANGELOVE made me far more aware of the world's perilous balance, because my guffaws at some of the film's funny lines caused my mind to imagine the real consequences much more realistically than the serious-minded FAILSAFE ever could. To that end. the acting was first class: Peter Sellers is very good as a feeble US president, a powerless British commander, and the mentally disturbed Dr Strangelove, who reminds me of Werner von Braun, with his SS past and trip to the Moon future. Sadly, Sellers gives Dr Strangelove a distracting Indian accent, otherwise he is a joy to watch. George C. Scott is marvelous as the US Armed Forces commander with side interests and an eye always firmly tracked on the military solution, conveying suspicions about the Ruskies and sending shivers down your spine with his mad eyes and his confidence in US military capacity; Keenan Wynn does well with a tiny part and his quip about Coca Cola Company's power is so outlandish that it is frightening; Peter Bull is superb as the Russian ambassador called to the War Room, who uses the opportunity to take spy shots; Slim Pickens, as commander of the aircraft which delivers the bomb, is memorable in his desire to serve his beloved country, to the extent of going down with the bomb; and Sterling Hayden is also at the top of his form as the base commander who loses his marbles and orders the air attack on Russia, and then takes the coward's way out.Great photography, special effects, fitting soundtrack, and fantastic dialogue, full of sharp one-liners, always pursuing the absurd and darkly comic angle, complete the bouquet. Masterpiece! PS: And so I learned not to worry... if not quite to love the bomb!",10,5,7,10 June 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Ultimately uneven, despite superlative acting
","THREE BILLBOARDS is a well-intentioned film that exposes social wounds and, above all, what individual anger and vindictiveness can do. The idea is great, putting up three large billboards to draw attention to a young girl's rape and murder, but the plot begins to falter quite rapidly, with far too many actors with individual problems and not enough drive to air them, let alone solve them.The script leaves much to be desired, with obvious credibility loopholes. It reminds me of FARGO, but with far less humor and a much greater foreboding that everybody stands to lose, regardless of what happens.Action sequences and photography are highly competent. The cherry on the cake is the acting. Mc Dormand is superb. Harrelson, in a much smaller part, sublime, functioning almost as the all-seeing eye and authority, even if he cannot catch the killer and is dying of cancer. Both deserve to be nominated for Oscars, at the very least.Although his is a highly engaging performance, I found Sam Rowell's part rather thankless, and his character repellent, as a cop who has his private set of rules and is not smart enough to realize that his anger will cost him. He seems to be changing into someone more thoughtful by movie's end, and that's perhaps one of the film's stronger messages - that revenge really gets you into more trouble than it helps.The film also includes a completely unnecessary, and malicious, attack on the Catholic Church, without any connection to any other part of the film. One can only wonder what Director McDonagh has against the Catholic Church but his hatred clearly runs very deep. His direction is less than inspired and ultimately uneven. With such a stellar cast, he should have invested in a better script, one that does not cop out on an open ending. 7/10",7,1,3,16 January 2018
The Shining," An unusually sloppy Kubrick effort
","I first watched THE SHINING shortly after it came out, in 1980. By then, I was already a firm Kubrick fan, after watching THE KILLING, PATHS OF GLORY, DR STRANGELOVE, CLOCKWORK ORANGE, BARRY LYNDON and, above all, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.Unfortunately, I found THE SHINING well below the quality of its predecessors and, in truth, Kubrick entered a downward path from then on, even if his movies were always interesting and imaginative in a variety of ways.THE SHINING opens with an unusual piece of sloppiness, provided by the overhead tracking shot up to the hotel, and you see the overflying helicopter's shadow on surrounding hills and ground for a few seconds. It sets the tone for a recurrent mixture of careless shots with masterly sequences, all ultimately undermined by a script riddled with credibility holes, an unconvincing supernatural presence, and a mansion/hotel that is not as haunting as Kubrick would like it to be, among other goofs and structural shortcomings.Naturally, in light of the above, direction is disappointing: Kubrick is unusually sloppy and unobservant of detail. Cinematography is uneven, with some brilliantly executed sequences, and some pedestrian ones. Finally, the acting: Jack Nicholson is supposed to play the paranoid and schizophrenic Torrance, but he plays Jack Nicholson, trotting out all his usual mannerisms; Shelley Duvall shrieks far more than she acts; Danny LLoyd, her son, seems a bit spaced out, but perhaps that is part of the powers that eventually cause him to neutralize the family¬´s nemesis; Scatman Crothers I remember for massively bandy legs and the pictures of beautiful topless black women on the wall, rather than for the quality of his acting; and Philip Stone is the exception, with a short but well performed part.Nothing memorable about this Kubrick effort, least of all the rather pat ending.",3,5,13,15 November 2018
Dunkirk," Credible WWII Movie Inevitably Laced with Computer Effects
","Good WWII movie, admitting early on that historical accuracy is not its intention, and told in Quentin Tarantino fashion, flashing back and forward between incidents involving army, navy and air forces trying to flee Dunkirk (France), or help others make their way back to the UK.According to Commander Bolton (played by Branagh), 400,000 men were on beaches of Dunkirk awaiting removal, and supposedly only about 10% of those men would get out of France - or so were Winston Churchill's calculations because the overriding priority was to use all resources to protect UK territory. Direction is sound, photography competent (though computer effects are obvious), and acting is in such small patches by so many people that no one really stands out, with the possible exceptions of Mark Rylance, who embodies the famous courage of common British people as he takes his small yacht to Dunkirk and rescues British forces stranded at sea along the way; and Tom Hardy, who gets the plum part of the Spitfire pilot shooting the hell out of Messerschmidts and Heynckels.It is refreshing to see a movie about Brits played by Brits, no Americans about, which is historically accurate as the USA pursued its isolationist policy at the time. It is also credible that, at the beginning of the movie, the Brits should want their countrymen to travel first out of France and leave the French to their fate. It is not so credible that, by the end of the movie, Commander Bolton should say that he wants to stay behind to help the French get out, nor do I imagine the Admiralty agreeing to such a senior officer staying potentially within grasp of the enemy just to help the 'frogs.' It is an unfortunately overly sentimental touch that - in my humble opinion - smacks of Brexit apology.In fact, what happened was that Churchill ordered the destruction of the French Navy's fleet, then the world's largest, so it would not fall into German hands and be used against Great Britain -- and many of the French ships were sunk with French servicemen inside. So much for helping the 'frogs'...Perhaps that is why Nolan is not interested in historical accuracy about the events at Dunkirk.All told, it is a film well worth watching that pays deserved homage to the British people's courage, intelligence, resourcefulness, firmness of purpose, and capacity to find the silver lining in the direst of situations.",8,13,25,20 July 2017
Non-Stop," Non stop rubbish
","What a pity to see acting talent like Neeson and Moore wasted on this nonsensical plot.
For starters, almost the entire film is spent inside the aircraft, and before that, for a few minutes, inside an airport, making it an almost unbearably claustrophobic film. As if that were not unpleasant enough, Moore disappears from the screen for long periods, almost as if she leaves the plane, only to return to speak a few pointless lines to Neeson. She is not even seen mingling with other passengers, she does not appear in passenger group shots, but, rather, moves suspiciously around the toilet area, near the air hostesses and cockpit, and she contributes ZERO to the plot, apart from what appears to be a sudden blossoming of unexpected love for Neeson in the movie's last frames. Neeson, usually a highly reliable actor, is apathetic and never comes into his own in this flick - but then, he is not helped by a script that variously makes him a hero or a vlllain, and where passengers facing bomb and other threats actually have the luxury of watching TV and learning that Neeson is a psychopath cop, as if personal data like that were conveyed over TV, especially when there are hundreds of lives at risk in an aircraft under attack from a villain who is anything but credible or menacing, and who, for no apparent reason, actually saves Neeson from passenger lynching at one point.There is another, NYPD cop on board, but he is just as dumb and gullible as the would-be robbers/criminals, and tenderfoot as the little girl who reminds Neeson of his own dead daughter. So schmaltzy...The final straw in terms of credibility is the bomb that explodes and yet the plane is able to land with everyone apparently unscathed. I could have kicked myself for watching this NON-STOP rubbish to the end. Best avoided. Gets 1 star because I can't zero it.",1,4,6,29 January 2018
The Favourite," Disappointingly pretentious, pointless and psychotic film
","THE FAVOURITE appears to be about Queen Anne (an illustrious unknown to me, even after reading about her) and her sexual and other vagaries while supposedly leading her kingdom -- though Lady Marlborough (Weisz) is the real power behind the throne, and the queen's firm favourite and sexual consort.That is, until the character played by Emma Stone bursts upon the mud; She has fallen out of grace because of her family's misfortunes and she is a distant cousin to Lady Marlborough. She rapidly surmises that the queen is the only way out of menial service, and she jostles to become the queen's favourite, and in the process engages in personal war with her cousin, with bad consequences for both.Overlong, very pretentious, pointless from a historic and didactic standpoint, this film is something of a psychotic foray, and its greatest attempts at shocking are the use of profanities and expletives. It is also a sexist film, in which males are portrayed as stupid, vain, irrelevant, powerless and risible.Lanthimos' direction is disordered, as reflected in the credits that you cannot read, and in the over the top performances (Colman reminded me of Kathy Bates in MISERY (1990), but without the bite of that performance); it keeps repeating lugubrious scenes in the palace's corridors; dialogue is repetitive; and the annoying and anachronistic soundtrack, including what appears to be a most disagreeable and jarring beat of a pendulum, had me wanting to walk out early on.Lanthimos also shamelessly borrows ideas from TOM JONES (UK 1963), which showed England's royal court as a place of carnal, Epicurean, and other excesses - but at least TOM JONES posted superb acting down to the smallest role; it had a crisp pace, running on zany comedy interspersed with shocking reality; and it did not need offensive language to make its point.Ultimately, the caged rabbits are the queen's real favourites and they reflect the film's level of intelligence. The vague ending only emphasizes the pointlessness of the entire exercise.Finally, I fail to see how this dud can get such a high overall IMDB rating when so many reviews award it 1 or 2 stars. Best avoided.",2,5,12,1 March 2019
2001: A Space Odyssey," One of the greatest films of all time, the greatest sci-fi
","I first watched 2001 in 1970, and 13 I was then. It blew me away, taking me to a time, an atmosphere, a vision that far surpassed anything I had seen or read. Batman, The Time Machine, and anything else that even vaguely related to sci-fi promptly became scrap by comparison with this ode to spacial beauty, this timeless tale of man vs machine, and this celebration of human intelligence... and its limitations.Visually stunning, musically memorable, with a great director. Stanley Kubrick, in his greatest form ever, this is a movie that I have re-watched many times, and always I find new angles and details, and renewed pleasures. It is best watched on the 70mm Cinerama screen in a proper movie house, but the DVD and Blu-Ray versions already offer considerable quality, allowing one to take in the subtlety of photographic composition, and glorious special effects, that have been imitated ad nauseum, but never equalled.It is a most intelligent film, one that leaves you thinking for days, and me in awe of how human beings managed to come up with this visual wonder.Pity the most you can give this masterpiece is 10/10!",10,2,2,23 January 2018
The Disaster Artist," Disaster indeed!
","Why should one go back over a complete misfire of a movie, like Wiseau's THE ROOM, or Ed Wood's work? At least the latter, of the late 1990s, featuring Johnny Depp, had awesome performances in Depp and Landau. In this one, much as I might try, I could only be annoyed by Wiseau's accent and repeated stupidity. Dave Franco does well in his part, but it is not exactly memorable, either.Perhaps I'll be accused of lacking humor, but I could not see anything funny about Wiseau's extravagant behavior and the derision with which it was received by the rest of the crew. This movie within a movie drove me to snoozing about 25' into it, and thank God that I was able to catch on my sleep at least. In the end, this film pays homage to a complete failure. Perhaps it's symbolic of the way moviemaking is going, bereft of ideas, and increasingly unrealistic productions that teach one absolutely nothing about life and how hard it is to survive just the day to day.2/10 - mostly for Dave Franco's sympathetic and humane performance.",2,9,18,15 January 2018
Mystic River," Eastwood's best work after MILLION DOLLAR BABY
","In MYSTIC RIVER, Eastwood brings a clinical eye to bear on the truth, regardless of how hard it might be to swallow. He examines with the same clinical eye the development of the characters of the main figures. Tim Robbins and Sean Penn post superlative performances, but Bacon also does well, albeit in a less eye-catching manner.Interestingly, Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden reflect the strengths and weaknesses of their husbands.Ultimately, Eastwood's clinical also bores clinically and inexorably into the many appearances that pass for reality in the minds of people, and his sober approach is, in my view, what adds real greatness to this work and to that end, it is helped by superlative cinematography, great action sequences, and, most of all, a lucid and highly intelligent script.Eastwood's direction is sublime.MYSTIC RIVER is a must-see masterpiece.",10,3,5,10 April 2019
American Made," Better than I had expected
","I have just watched 'American MADE' at the local movie house this afternoon, and I was very impressed with two aspects: Doug Liman's direction and Tom Cruise's performance.Liman I did not, and do not, know (yet, but in this form I'll be very happy to see a great deal more of his work). His direction is steady, intelligent, sensitive in extracting Cruise's greatest performance to date, and also very effective in action sequences, and in finding humor in all manner of situations that are usually not any reason to laugh. He even manages to get hardboiled drug smugglers like Pablo Escobar to sound jocund, and that's no mean achievement!Liman also makes extremely intelligent use of speeches by Presidents Carter and Reagan, giving the movie a firm time capsule.Cruise I had never, until today, rated a serious actor. Today, I saw real quality, experience, and even spontaneity in his acting. It is a wonderful performance that does much to keep the film firmly anchored in reality in spite of all the unusual goings-on involving state, police, drug barons, and all manner of criminals - plus his ever enlarging family.American MADE is superbly photographed and its soundtrack is, in turns, inspired, appropriate, and unobtrusive, allowing the viewer to stay tuned into the action.It is also a cautionary tale, which even carries a Nancy Reagan snippet about not smoking, drinking alcohol or consumming drugs -- and, of course, not getting involved with anything that breaks the law and leaves you exposed to recruitment by state institutions that will exploit you to the marrow, among other perils. Barry Seal made the wrong choice to begin with, and once he did he was, willingly and otherwise, pulled further and further into the quicksands of state and criminal opportunism. Hopefully, this will resonate with the youth, in particular: avoid that first step that breaks the law. In light of all the positives above, I give this movie 9 stars out of 10.",9,6,13,31 August 2017
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Anti-war masterpiece
","In my humble opinion, this is Director David Lean's finest film (just above BRIEF ENCOUNTER, OLIVER TWIST and GREAT EXPECTATIONS) and, albeit less famous, spectacular and beautiful than LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, it is a more self-contained and perceptive film, in regard to human emotions and pitfalls.Frankly, I do not give a toss whether this film is historically inaccurate. It does not claim to be true to life, and there is a great lesson to learn from it, notably that following principles to a T does not pre-empt the emergence of contradictory situations, such as when Colonel Nicholson (sublimely played by Alec Guinness), who had refused on principle to have his officers work 'like coolies,' ultimately is quite ready to relent on that demand when he becomes entranced by the notion that the bridge could last 600 years, and the British Army remembered for its construction.Guinness deservedly picked up the Best Actor academy award for his role as Col. Nicholson, who stubbornly wants to maintain conventional and civilized values in the jungle and in the face of an enemy of a different and opposing culture, embodied by the Japanese camp commander, brilliantly played by Sessue Hayakawa.Holden acts as a kind of comic relief, an American caught in the middle of British POWs in Burma, and his role is reminiscent of the one which won him an Oscar in STALAG 17, where he acted as the in-between fellow who managed to bribe the guards and get the goodies, but who has enough decency in him to earn the viewer's sympathy.Jack Hawkins is superlative as the British commander who leads the operation to destroy the bridge on the River Kwai. Why he did not pick up a best supporting actor Oscar beats me. He is the very embodiment of the stiff upper lip British officer with touches of sardonic humor and complete professionalism.And, finally, James Donald, as the medic with the bird's eye view (an eagle is seen flying over the forest some 3 or 4 times during the film), who sees all with detachment and concludes that war is madness. His is a minor but crucial role, and he delivers with great aplomb.Photography, action sequences, script, and soundtrack are all of the highest quality. THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI is, without a doubt, one of my all-time favorites and perhaps the greatest anti-war war movie ever made. 10/10",10,3,4,31 March 2018
Whiplash," A study in bullying and acceptance thereof: drummer's blood
","Simmons may have picked up a supporting actor Oscar for this performance, and he may have deserved in comparison with the rest of competitors for that award in 2014, but it has to be said that he is a repulsive and manipulative bully and that his character is no example to anybody - quite the contrary. In fact, his eagerness to label others with derogatory and even insulting adjectives quickly becomes difficult to watch.If that is what is required for the human being to exceed his limitations - be it in music, sport, art, or any other field - then this is out and out human rights violation and I would rather live with a bit more mediocrity.Tellers tries his best in a difficult part, but the very ambiguity at the heart of his character's nature - in turns accepting and rejecting Simmons' bullying - detracts from the spectator's sympathy. His search for personal greatness as a drummer, at the expense of love and family, is a welcome warning to anyone thinking of following that path.And then I have a real problem accepting that Charlie Parker was the 'greatest musician of the 20th Century,' as the central characters claim, and I do not care for the final rendition of 'Caravan,' a wonderful piece of music that the two of them (Simmons unwillingly at first, then encouragingly) turn into a near solo drummer show.The unremittingly bleak photography and atmosphere; the characters' apparent failure to learn and become better human beings; and the director's emphasis on highlighting meanness and the absence of redemption with his chiaroscuro backgrounds, all made for an unpleasant movie experience for me.",6,3,5,23 October 2018
Prometheus," PROMETHEUS: a jumble rehash of sci-fi and other classics, sinks deeper than TITANIC
","Ridley Scott, producer and director of PROMETHEUS, has the cheek to copy the stylish interiors of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY; to have a kind of mutant (played by Fassbender) act like a highly scientific BLADE RUNNER who models himself after LAWRENCE OF ARABIA; two completely pointless characters played by Theron and Pearce, who bring to mind FORBIDDEN PLANET; the ship's sole survivor reminded me of Sigourney Weaver's character in ALIEN; the ship's navigation area and crew bring to mind STAR TREK and STAR WARS; and brains blow up inside glass headgear in a manner reminiscent of MARS ATTACKS; and ultimately Scott sets up a suicide scene that sees spaceships sink deeper than he sank TITANIC in 1997. Finally, as the piece de resistance, the last creature we see is a copy of ALIEN, the film that projected Scott as a director.Frankly, Scott should be heavily fined for copying others' ideas and foisting them on the public as something new. To make matters worse, the film is overlong and does not make any sense at all.I could kick myself for watching it to the end and I vow to steer clear of it, if ever I set eyes on it. The two stars are for special effetcs and photography.",2,5,7,1 November 2018
Casino," Scorcese repeats many ideas of GOODFELLAS... CASINO is a far cry!
","The only thing that kept me watching this movie was to learn what happened to the character played by de Niro, apparently blown up by a car bomb at the beginning.As in GOOODFELLAS, there is voice-over narration, this time by de Niro and Pesci (Ray Liotta was the narrator in the former film), but it is nowhere near as effective, and often provides unnecessary, even distracting asides, that only further lengthen a film that could easily have done with 30 minutes less. Curiously enough, GOODFELLAS also had de Niro and Pesci in the cast, led by a highly inspired Liotta, but the only performance in CASINO worthy of any mention is that of Sharon Stone, who portrays a truly repellent character (the incident where she binds up her daughter and confines her to a cupboard is a bolt from the blue and struck me as unconvincing, perhaps because nothing in her actions toward her child suggest anything so excessive). She is very convincing, however, in her descent into drugs and her relationship with her pimp, the 'real' love in her life, as opposed to the source of wealth that de Niro represents to her.Pesci reprises his exceedingly violent character of GOODFELLAS and kills people as routinely as one would flies. This time, however, he is less credible because he is reportedly clever enough to take over the running of murky business from other ruthless criminals, but then commits excesses so stupid as to make suspension of disbelief impossible. His affair with Stone is also difficult to swallow. I could accept a blow job or one-off sex because she is too drugged up to reason it out, but surely he knows that de Niro will not tolerate it, and he is just too flippant about it. Ultimately, his character is just not rounded enough to stand, and so wayward as to become confusing, annoying, and ultimately lose the viewer's interest.The character played by de Niro is a very odd customer indeed, and the actor's talent is sadly wasted in a part much too ambiguous for me to enjoy. He wants to go clean but stupidly allows ultra-violent chum, Pesci, to join his casino and childishly believes Pesci's promises of good behavior and compliance with the 'legit' nature of the casino operation. Even harder to swallow is that he should entrust the key to his fortune to Stone, even after he finds her cuddling her up to her pimp again. De Niro seems rather unsure about the role, too. I spent the whole movie waiting for the character to do something but ultimately he accepts everything like the Good Samaritan: he takes in dangerman Pesci, marries pimp Woods-infatuated Stone, has a distant relationship with his daughter that unexpectedly turns into something closer, loses half of his fortune without a whimper when he has seemed money-driven from the start, and is just too polite and quiet to convince me that I haven't wasted close on three hours watching purposeless characters going nowhere.Photography is competent, somewhat reminiscent of GOODFELLAS but less inspired. Direction is very disappointing, especially in light of the standards set by Scorcese in TAXI DRIVER and GOODFELLAS.",3,4,8,7 August 2017
Green Book," Superb first half; unnecessarily long, moralistic and schmaltzy second half
","There is much to enjoy in the first half of GREEN BOOK, solidly anchored in the performances of the two leads, Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali, in a competent direction, good script, excellent photography, and excellent recreation of the 1960s.Sadly, the second half becomes increasingly moralistic and schmaltzy, and Ali's performance increasingly manneristic. GREEN BOOK also boasts a happy ending, which is bound to help its box office but which struck me as downright dishonest in light of what was actually happening in the US at the time.Mortensen's performance is the only consistent quality item in the film.",7,3,7,26 January 2019
