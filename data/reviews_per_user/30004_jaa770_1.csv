Lucky Number Slevin," A must buy in a 3 months
",A must see movie for those who enjoy twist and a massive supply of quick liners and metaphoric dialog. A movie for those with strongstomachs and who think Lucy Lui is completely irresistible. If this was DVD Tuesday it would go down as a buy.Very smart and very interesting. Has elements from many different types of movies.I would compare it to another movie but there is none like it. Just make sure to pay attention to everything.Don't watch the previews to this movie. They ruin the plot and thats all the fun.,10,2,9,7 April 2006
