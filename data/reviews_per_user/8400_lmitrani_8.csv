Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Funny at times, but offensive to Jews
","Borat is funny at times, as he visits the U.S. from Kazakhstan to do a documentary on his experiences. However, much of the humor is gross and sophomoric, and hardly funny for mature adults. Most troubling for me as a Jewish person is the many scenes and statements that are offensive in the extreme to Jews, and include some of the worst stereotypes. I can't believe that other people, even of other faiths, have not picked up on these instances and denounced the movie for that reason. Can you imagine any film that included similar 'jokes' about African-Americans? I cannot, which makes this one so intolerable. In his politically incorrect interview with feminists, at least they're given a chance to reply, unlike the JewsOK, there were some funny and imaginative episodes but they lacked subtlety, good taste or redeeming social value. Very few sequences made me laugh, since they were somewhere between amusing and mildly funny. I rated this film SEVEN for being creative and fast-paced, but would put it near the bottom of the scale if judged strictly for sensitivity to Jews. I realize Sacha Baron Cohen is Jewish, but that does not justify for me how he portrays and characterizes fellow co-religionists.",7,1,6,15 November 2006
Spider-Man 2," A Hugely Entertaining Film that Challenges Our Values
","Spider Man IIHere are some challenging questions posed in this film: · Is it all right to commit an evil act as a means to an end that is very good? · Can we defeat evil with diplomacy, rather than force? · Is it OK to lie to someone you love to protect him or her? · Can you renege on a promise to a deceased ancestor if you now see that the pledge is no longer good for you? · If the person you meant to destroy turns out to be a trusted friend, what do you do? · Should you marry someone who constantly flirts with danger like a racecar driver or astronaut?Few films ask these questions, and when they do, we expect the director to be a Woody Allen, David Mamet, Ingmar Bergman or Spike Lee, and the film to be a serious work of art. But these questions are all raised in Spiderman II. Believe it!Make no mistake that this movie delivers special effects, heroism, and exciting chase scenes. But the real payoffs for me were the cosmic questions posed above. The story is standard fare of an evildoer (to borrow Bush's expression) who wrecks havoc in order to monopolize a chemical needed to develop a super energy source. At first, he's a world-renown scientist (Alfred Molina, now playing Tevya in Fiddler on the Roof on Broadway) until his experiment backfires and turns him into an eight-limbed monster known as Doc Ock (for Octopus). It's then Spiderman's job to disarm him.None of the characters, however, are stereotyped as good and bad guys. All have personalities that reveal the good and bad in all of us, and each is challenged at some point to make a moral decision of great consequence. That these questions can even be framed for us to consider would in itself make the film worthwhile.The main actors, Spiderman/Peter Parker (Toby Maguire) and his girlfriend, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) are as expected very likable: introspective, humble, caring and sweet. Unlike crime-fighters like Clint Eastwood and the Terminator, Peter doesn't sport macho mannerisms, and Ms. Dunst does not flaunt bare skin or hanging breasts. (As you may know, Peter is to Spiderman what Clark Kent was to Superman, his ordinary citizen identity.) Many male viewers will identify with Peter's hesitancy about commitment. Does he avoid asking Mary Jane to marry him because it would detract from his mission in life to fight crime and evil, or is that a convenient excuse?Other interesting people are Spiderman's sympathetic aunt (Rosemary Harris) and the flamboyant editor (J.K. Simmons) at the local paper. Cameo appearances by Willem Defoe (Green Goblin) and Cliff Robertson (Uncle Ben) tie this movie to its predecessor. James Franco, the Goblin's son, is back and wants to avenge his father's killer, Batman, who unknown to him is also his best friend, Peter Parker. You now see why I posed the questions at the start of this piece. The action scenes mix nicely with poignant moments. Some viewers may not appreciate this nuanced script with its moral complexity, but I expect them to be few in number. Early box office returns seem to support this opinion.Seeing this production at an IMAX made it more enjoyable, but you should appreciate it wherever you see it.",Null,0,0,6 September 2004
Knocked Up," Remarkably entertaining despite Stretching Credibility
","Although the film was enjoyable and lived up to the critical praise it received, there was one major premise that rang false. The story in a nutshell is that Alison (Katherine Heigl), a TV reporter, meets unemployed Ben (Seth Rogen) in a local bar, becomes pregnant from him that same night, and spends the rest of the movie coping with her predicament and the relationship. There are several funny incidents involving her gynecologists, her sister, and their adventures trying to enter an exclusive club. What was not at all credible was that Alison would have pursued any kind of ongoing relationship with Ben in the real world. Alison was a very attractive woman who probably could have dated anyone, and could hardly go anywhere without being hit upon. Ben was just the opposite: unattractive, overweight, with no money, no job, no career prospects, and friends who were a bunch of losers. When she learned she was pregnant, I couldn't believe she would call him about it, since she otherwise had little interest in him. She certainly did not need him for his breadwinner's role, and she showed little chemistry for him other than their impending parenthood. However, I might concede that the one-night stand itself may have been plausible because they were drunk.This was one of the very few movie couples I rooted against and hoped that their relationship would collapse; I won't spoil the outcome for you. The other couple in the film -- Alison's sister Debbie (Leslie Mann) and her husband (Paul Rudd) Â– was very likable, credible and worthy of my support.There were also incidents in the movie like the trip to a Vegas strip club and dinner at expensive restaurants that I did not see how Ben paid for with his meager bank balance.If you can overlook what I consider these major stumbling blocks of credibility, then the film was fine. I, however, could not ignore them. The other characters in the movie like Alison's sister and brother-in-law, the club bouncer and Ben's buddies were sharply drawn and highly believable. The pacing and music were good compliments to the story.",7,0,2,15 June 2007
Cast Away," Engaging Thriller, without a Villain
","I finally saw Castaway, and thought it was an absorbing drama of human resourcefulness.   I resisted seeing it for fear that the time spent by the Tom Hanks character in isolation marooned on an island would be boring. It wasn't.  The cinematography is great ... beautiful sunsets and skylines, crashing waves and natural beauty.  The endurance skills he develops are admirable, as are the ways he tackles small crises and shares his thoughts with us.  His survival episodes engage us, including building a fire, searching for water and food, communicating for help, fighting the elements, looking for life on the island, attending to his wounds, simulating a human companion, and maintaining his sanity.  His appearance after an extended period, with a full beard and loincloth, make him look like a genuine prehistoric man.  The film's strength is how Tom Hanks makes it all believable.  It would be hard for a lesser actor to pull it off.Adding to the movie's appeal is the simplicity of the story.  It's man versus nature for survival; what could be simpler?  An auxiliary but equally straightforward plot is his courtship with Helen Hunt.  There are no complex motives to decipher, nor cruelty or violence.  We can all safely root for Hanks as he battles his loneliness, his environment, and his separation from his fiancÃ©e.  It can roughly be compared to Jaws, with the non-human `enemy' changed from a whale to the forces of nature.The air crash that leads to his ordeal is magnificently dramatized, but is not for the faint of heart.  Those with a fear of flying may not want to see it, although the plane itself is not a commercial airliner.  Even his romance with Helen Hunt, dismissed as contrived by some, rang true for me. That may be because attractions between people around 40 are rarely shown in films, and are seldom resolved as depicted here. The publicity for FedEx in the film is extensive and positive, and probably merited.  I certainly recommend this movie.",Null,0,0,7 February 2001
Enchanted," Hugely Entertaining Fantasy with Love Lessons for All of Us
","I have another movie to recommend; it's title, Enchanted, describes how I felt about it. When I entered the theater, I thought I made a mistake. This was a Disney movie, and many in the audience were kids. The opening scenes further reinforced my mistake, since all I saw were animated, cartoon characters.But 10 minutes later, a dramatic turn takes place. The cartoon princess-to-be has her storybook romance with Prince Charming (the animated kind) derailed as she's catapulted into New York's Times Square, where she emerges from a manhole and is surrounded by real people. Much later, Prince Charming leaves Fantasyland and comes to New York to claim his bride. Are you still with me? This being a romantic comedy, here's where the complications come in. Before the Prince arrives in New York, Princess Giselle (Amy Adams) has met a handsome, engaged lawyer (Patrick Dempsey) with an adorable six-year old daughter. Add the lawyer's girlfriend to the mix, and you have your basic story. Let it develop at its own pace, and don't prejudge its uniqueness. I urge you to accept the fantasy premise of animated characters and humans interacting, and just follow the enchanting and refreshing story. (The last films I saw involving human-cartoon interaction were the 1988 Who Framed Roger Rabbit? and last year's Pan's Labyrinth, award winners in several categories.) This is a great 'date movie,' since all aspects of relationships are discussed: commitment, dating, fidelity, jealousy, infatuation, serendipity, accepting imperfections, and even questioning if Prince Charming is indeed the best candidate for 'happily ever after.' What stands out most is dialog about relationships and what's meaningful. One would need to be hard-hearted not to appreciate fantasy Princess Giselle, who is described as a 'Hallmark Card brought to life,' and her gallant Prince Charming (James Marsden), who is no shoo-in to win her heart. Guys can be reassured that if even Prince Charming has romantic barriers to surmount, it's even harder for us. Women might recognize that someone other than that Prince may be a better choice. As the story unfolds, the characters switch roles; animated ones develop human qualities, and vice-versa. All four protagonists, or five counting the six-year old, are likable. Trust me on this one. Don't be afraid to shed a tear. This movie has been #1 at the box-office, and received great reviews. Enchanted features many other audience-pleasing elements like special effects, a Cinderella scene, villains, two songs, waltz dancing at a Ball, elaborate costumes, a King-Kong like rescue from a skyscraper and wonderful scenes from New York City's Central Park, the new Time-Warner Complex and Times Square. There's also a surprise ending.The best-known cast member is Susan Sarandon, playing the mother witch of the Prince. However, the cast is well suited for their parts. See the film, and give me your feedback. I did not make a mistake in seeing this after all. It's more than a kid's film, despite the Disney animation. And shouldn't all romances include some stardust?",9,1,2,16 December 2007
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Imaginative Enactment of Classic with Impressive Special Effects & Fine Storytelling.
","The long anticipated Harry Potter has something for everyone.  Fans of the book, which I did not read, are treated to what I understand is a faithful reproduction of the text.  Although people like me will not know about muggles, hogwarts, goblins, wizards, elves and Sorcerer's Stones, that disadvantage can be overcome.  The wide range of villains and obstacles for our heroes to conquer will satisfy adventure fans.  The unusual number of surprises and defiances of convention should delight magic aficionados. Admirers of good performing will appreciate the ensemble acting of Harry Potter (Dan Radcliffe) and classmates Ronald (Rupert Grint) and especially Hermione (Emma Watson II).  Veteran actors Maggie Smith, Richard Harris, John Hurt and John Cleese ably support them.  Feminists will appreciate how Hermione takes charge in critical moments in an effort to rescue her male companions.  She does it with brains and wizardry rather than force and violence.  I admire her spunk.  There are two spectacular sequences, one involving an air game resembling hockey and the other a chess match with violence at every move.  Other special effects -- involving wizardry, secret passages and unusual adversaries like giant creatures and three-headed dogs -- keep the audience at the edge of its seat.  The castle that houses the school campus is itself a sight to behold with forbidden chambers, fascinating architecture and lively student body and faculty.   Of course, there is the classic battle between good and evil, but many characters have elements of both.  Action scenes are plentiful, but not to the extent that character development and plot are neglected.  The fast pace ensures that no one will be bored, although the multitude of characters with weird names and obscure powers (e.g. potion making, levitation) is sometimes hard to follow.  In short, Harry Potter is not groundbreaking, but a fun movie that knows how to pace itself and end on cue.  It tells a good story and allows our imaginations, often constrained since childhood, to flourish again. It's suitable for children and adults.  Despite some violence, there's no profanity, nudity or anything offensive for younger eyes.  However, it may be too intense for children under six.  Adults can also enjoy this as escapist entertainment not unlike an Indiana Jones movie.  At my showing at 6:30 in the evening, all viewers were grown-ups.  I look forward to the sequel.",8,0,0,3 January 2002
Blow," A sweeping overview of the 1970s cocaine trade free of moralizing
","Blow, unlike the other current drug movie Traffic, is told from the dealer's viewpoint and based on the true story of George Jung.  It traces his rise from a beach bum selling joints to an international cocaine kingpin who develops an efficient network of contacts.  There's little moralizing about the drug trade, except to imply that it was mostly an indulgence by East Coast college students in upscale colleges, and not the cause of crime in urban areas.  The public discussion about America's drug problem has all but disappeared.  Ecstasy seems to have replaced cocaine as the drug of choice among club-goers, while blow (one of many names for cocaine) is apparently abundant and cheap.  With celebrities like Robert Downey, Jr. and Daryl Strawberry in constant trouble with drugs, public opinion seems to be shifting to the view that drug (ab)use is more a problem of personal responsibility (demand) and less that of the distributors (supply).  If you want to take any `message' away from the film, that would be it, and it would be similar to the one in Traffic.Johnny Depp as Jung dominates almost every scene.  However, his character did not seem ruthless enough for a top dealer.  I don't believe dealers at that level are as charismatic and personable as he is in the film, but rather paranoid, nervous, short-tempered and physically unattractive.  Of course, a movie with a persona like that in the lead would not be a moneymaker.  Similarly, I don't see his qualifications to teach a prison course since he had little education of his own.  Alas, Depp's money management, as you'll see, is not as skilled as his cocaine dealing. Although Jung is depicted as a victim of double-dealing, many so-called drug-kingpins are notorious for doing the same to other associates.  That is rarely shown in films where the dealer is also the protagonist.  We empathize with Depp throughout the film, but especially in those magical moments when life seems perfect: he's in love and in a happy marriage, his daughter is born, the money is pouring in, and he's recognized for his success.The much-publicized Penelope Cruz is too thin, not that pretty and no great actress.  Paul Reubens, a.k.a. Pee Wee Herman, is a believable local distributor, although gays would no doubt object to the flamboyant behavior and attire of his character.  Depp's relationship with his father, player by Ray Liotta although he's only eight years older, is a constant throughout the film.  Despite the tension between them caused by his dealing, there's a strong bond that is endearing; his relationship with his mother is just the opposite, but worth witnessing.  Depp's voice-over narration and his relationship with his parents, wife and daughter are the glue that keeps us interested.  Like other films of this type, we meet fascinating characters, including low-lifes like the infamous Pablo Escobar.  Finally, it's always nice when the camera whisks us off to exotic places like Mexico, Columbia & Manhattan Beach.In sum, Blow offers many vicarious experiences about the 1970s when coke and disco were king.  For those of us who were in our 20s & 30s back then, the film offers additional nostalgic memories, including groups like KC & the Sunshine Band.  The update at the movie's end about Jung's current status provides a fitting end.  Blow will not teach you anything new, but it's an easy movie to enjoy for its conflicts, characters, plot twists and cinematography",8,0,0,27 April 2001
The Martian," A fast-paced rescue mission to Mars captures our curiosity with visual delights
","The Martian, a movie rightly praised by critics and audiences alike, deserves its accolades. Following an accident on a voyage to Mars, Matt Damon is separated from his crew, and stranded with limited supplies to stay alive until he can be rescued. The story that follows is suspenseful and engrossing. It has great photography of the surface of Mars and space, humor, science lessons, and a daring rescue attempt.The scenes with Matt Damon as the only one on screen, talking to himself and audience, are surprisingly absorbing and entertaining. He needs to calmly solve a number of survival tasks to stay alive by overcoming potential shortages of food, water, and power sources. The strategies discussed to rescue him, as well as his separation from his crew and communications with NASA in Houston provide a fast-paced story that never lets up. Will the mission succeed? If you like '70s Disco music, you'll hear lots of it since that's all he's left with up there. The musical score when we don't hear disco also works well.There are neither contrived romances nor political issues. The Martian combines all elements of an entertaining film: a main character we love, many plot twists, and spectacular space shots that are a feast for eyes.The Martian can also be seen as a contemporary example of how far we've advanced in ensuring diversity of cast members in major productions like this one, which has been #1 in box-office receipts for several weeks. The leading roles are acted by women (Jessica Chastain as crew commander and Kate Mara as second in command), a Latino man (Michael Pena as Martinez) as co-Captain of the mission, an Asian man as key 'architect' of the ground crew to plan a rescue mission, and two African-Americans, one a manager (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and the other a scientist (Donald Glover) who solves the technical problem of how to resolve the engineering challenges. (Ms. Chastain was also the key person in Zero Dark Thirty who located the hiding place of Osama Bin Laden and advised the mission to kill him. However, that was a true story.) But don't white males also have prominent roles? Let's see. The two chief ones are played by Matt Damon, the stranded astronaut, and Jeff Daniels as NASA director. While they occupy lots of screen time, they're limited in their decision-making. As the lowest ranking crew member, Mr. Damon can only wait and hope to be rescued; in decades past, it would be the 'damsel in distress' being rescued by her Knight in Shining Armor, usually a white male. Jeff Daniels, although the NASA head, is disrespected by the African-American scientist who barges into his meeting, presents the engineering solution he alone developed, takes over the meeting without asking to be recognized, and insults the NASA director by asking, 'Who are you?' One of his key decisions is reversed.Can you imagine this happening if the demographics were reversed? What about another white male in the chain of command? He's told he'll be fired when the mission is over. Can a case be made that diversity efforts have gone too far, replacing one set of demographics who were previously minimized (women, African-Americans, Latinos, Asians) with a newer one (white men)? I leave it to you to decide if another episode in the film can be considered political correctness: a key piece of the engineering solution to the rescue mission is controlled not by the U.S., but by China. For more evidence of this trend, note that TV's latest superhero is Supergirl, and in the next Ghostbusters the leading roles will be played by women. Will the next 007 be Jamie Bond? Stay tuned! I suspect that whether or not you agree with my observations will depend on your own identity group, or your support for political correctness. None of these observations, however, should detract from an immensely enjoyable film.",8,1,4,11 November 2015
