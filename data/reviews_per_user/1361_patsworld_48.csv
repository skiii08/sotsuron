Moneyball," Moneyball Hit's One Out Of The Park
","This is one of those baseball movies where, even having been a baseball fan back in '02 and vividly remembering the Oakland A's phenomenal run, there's no way the suspense and eagerness to see this team reach success won't grab you. The cast is believable, I can't think of a single character I would have changed, and Brad Pitt has handed in one of his best - if not his very best - performance. Kerris Dorsey, as Billy Beane's daughter is a delight and has a dandy singing voice, too. The song she sings will stick in your mind and, like me, will likely find you whistling this tune as you leave the theater. If you're not familiar with the workings of building a baseball team, or keeping one motivated to build on a winning streak, this film will give you a good inside glimpse of how it's done. I'm thinking you're going to really enjoy this film. I sure did!",Null,0,0,6 October 2011
The Avengers," Avenger Action Galore!
","Plenty of action, lots of humor, heroes you root forwell, this film has it all. Admittedly, I adore Robert Downey Jr (love the romantic interaction between Iron Man and Pepper) and really like Mark Ruffalo, so this didn't hurt. And speaking of Mark Ruffalo and his Hulk character.I have to admit for a few minutes of thinking, 'What the heck good is this as a Super Hero? All he does is get mad and smash things. What kind of help is this?' And of course, this being a proper Super Hero movie, The Hulk eventually becomes useful rather than simply destructive and clears up most of those doubts. And in all honesty, what, exactly does Captain America do? Except for reflecting things off his shield, that is? Or am I getting too picky here? Possibly so. All in all I found it to be exactly what one would want when going to see a Marvel Super Hero movieincluding the set-up at the end with a hint for a further adventure. Go Super Heroes! Assemble!",9,5,11,11 May 2012
Million Dollar Arm," A Feel Good Movie That Will Have You Smiling When You Leave
","In a spate of recent sports themed movies, all of which were good, I have to say I consider this one the best. Toss together some baseball history, an excellent script, terrific casting, great acting, a bit of the squalor, beauty and toe-tapping music of India and Viola! You end up with a good film. To try and single out one single actor in this film I liked the most or was most impressed with is impossible. Every one was amazing. You don't need to be a baseball fan or even know that much about the game to appreciate this picture. I and my companion (who is about as far from a sports-minded person as you could find) for the viewing were both thrilled with this one. When the people coming out of the opposite door at the end of the picture smile and say, 'Good movie, wasn't it?' You know you've seen a good movie. There are some I want to see again.this is one.",9,36,43,22 May 2014
Men in Black 3," Men In Black III Carries On With The Fun
","I really did enjoy this film equally as much as the first two. Good plot line and there were only a few exceptions I would have liked to have seen. Emma Thompson was fine as Agent O, and the story line with her involved was a good one, but I did miss Rip Torn. He made such a cool curmudgeonly commander. If Agent Frank, the dog, was in there, I must have missed him in the excitement. Since he became one of my favorite characters previously, I was hoping to see him in this one. Josh Brolin was completely phenomenal as the young Agent K. Unbelievable how much like Tommy Lee Jones he came across. And I adored Michael Stuhlbarq as Griffin. What a cutie! Altogether it was a fun film experience and I'd certainly recommend it to anyone who liked the first two in the series. This one won't disappoint. It didn't me.",8,2,5,10 June 2012
Captain Phillips," Best Tom Hanks Role – Ever. Oscar For Sure
","This is a brilliantly intense movie. A powerful picture. Even having lived through the time when this episode happened, and remembering some of what occurred, the suspense wasn't lessened one iota. Now if a film can be made under those circumstances, and be this gripping, that is an extremely well done movie. And this is beyond extremely well done! Tom Hanks, as Captain Richard Phillips, is riveting. The end of the movie, his emotions, brought me to tears. I can't admit to being a die-hard Tom Hanks fan, but his role in this picture is phenomenal. True, the Somali, Barkhad Abdi, as Muse the Pirate Captain, is fantastic. And considering he had no acting training and this was his only film, even more so. I'm thinking he should get a nod for Best Supporting Actor. But Tom Hanks simply shines like the star he is in this picture. The pride in the Navy personnel, and the Navy Seals, will really come to the fore in this film for most viewers. Like I said, this is a film so well put together, so well presented that I'm not surprised I haven't talked to anyone who left the theater after seeing this one without a feeling of awe. One of the best I've seen in a long , long time.",10,0,4,24 October 2013
Iron Man 3," Excitement And Suspense Galore!
","Iron Man Three is the best yet! Seeing a different side, a more tender side if you will, of Tony, as Pepper has become so much more important in his life, is exactly what was needed to add a new dimension to the Iron Man. As usual, Robert Downey Jr. is both captivating and beyond fun to watch. Reckless and ruthless is a fabulous combination. And in this one, he has to use more ingenuity than he's ever been called upon to use before. When all looks lost, that's when Iron Man reaches down and pulls up even more genius. Don Cheadle as Colonel James Rhodes is the perfect partner for him to be working with and Guy Pearce as the villain, Aldrich Killian, makes a tremendous bad guy. This one has a cool little twist in the plot in regard to the bad guys and frankly, I can hardly wait to see the next installment in this exciting series.",9,2,5,17 May 2013
If I Stay," Not As Good As It Could Have Been
","Here's the thing, in the movie Field of Dreams, with Kevin Costner, everyone was perfect. Each role done to perfection – all except the wife. Bottom line is she simply tried too hard. Her supposed enthusiasm was irritating to the point of absurdity. The one bad note in an otherwise perfect symphony. In this picture, If I Stay, that honor went to the mother. As the wife who supposedly was part of the wild live band scene in previous years, she overplayed her part to equal imperfection as that mention above. She bopped around, acting like an aging hippy more than anything and it, again, struck the one false note in the melody. Other than that, my only concern was this movie rather dragged on. I mean, it was a tad short of plot – the girl dies, does she stay? Does she go? So it sort of lagged here and there. I guess I was expecting more somehow and I was a bit disappointed with this one. I had so looked forward to it, and it isn't a bad movie, just not what it could have been, I think. Light on action, heavy on emotion, it's okay. But that's all I can say. It's okay.",6,0,4,4 September 2014
Gravity," The Only Stars To Shine Here Were In The Visual Effects
","Okay, for me, Sandra Bollock and George Clooney do very, very well in comedy or a lighter-type movie. Neither one is especially remarkable at drama. For this one, for me, they simply were not believable. The plot was predictable, the dialogue lame. I was vastly disappointed with the writing....even with Bollock's soliloquy moments, they just didn't ring true. They weren't believable. Nor was she. I kept waiting to be swept away, to be caught up in the whole drama, but it never happened. And I'm the type of person who lives in the movies I see. I become part of them. Not this one. Those of us who went to see this picture all came out with the same feeling. The visual effects were stunning. Fantastic. That part was not only gripping but frighteningly realistic. In fact, I'm sure there's an Oscar involved there. But not for Bollock or Clooney. In fact, if they are even nominated for this one, I'm going to think something's radically wrong with the whole process. Not that this is a bad movie, it isn't. Or that they were really bad. They just weren't...how to explain it? They weren't enough. They weren't sufficient for the idea, the moment. Just not as spectacular as I had expected or been led to believe. However, the feel and emotion of deep space, incredible. I know for sure I don't ever want to be there! That part of this movie was something none of us will be forgetting any time soon.",7,0,3,18 October 2013
The Impossible," Wrenching But Perhaps Worth The Watch
","I thought I was ready to see a movie about this subject by now, but in actuality I wasn't. There are some events that have occurred in a person's lifetime that never seem to fade9/11and this horrendous tsunami for example. Happenings so painful and emotional that time doesn't seem to help numb the brain, the heart, enough to be able to offer any sort of dispassionate observation. This film is excellent. The casting and the acting couldn't have been better. And I guess I'm glad I saw it, but then again.there were parts I was unable to watch and I left the theater wanting to just go home and cry. The movie has resurrected all the pain, the sorrow, I felt watching that shocking scene unfold, watching so many lives be swept away, so many families ripped apart, so much loss. I will only caution youif like me you are haunted by such tragedies... you might want to think twice about seeing this..or at the very least take a huge handful of Kleenex along with you.",8,0,0,24 January 2013
42," Jackie Robinson Played Into History And Into Our Hearts As Well
","How many movies have you seen lately where at the end, the audience applauds? Not very many? Me neither. But for this one, we did. And rightfully so. What a great film! In Harrison Ford's portrayal of Branch Rickey, you see the sorrow for things past, the joy of the game, and the hope for a better future. As for Chadwick Boseman's Jackie Robinson – the casting here was inspired. You live with him through the pain he had to endure – and granted, this movie only shows a tiny portion of how difficult it must have been for him to display the strength and determination it took to change the world of American baseball - to be allowed to do what he loved and was so good at without restrictions. If you're like me, you will cringe to see the ignorance and hatefulness many people exhibited toward fellow human beings, and you will rejoice in watching as this nation was helped to begin the slow – too slow, but without people like Rickey and Robinson, it could have been so much slower – turn into becoming real, tolerant-of-each-other Americans. For anyone with even the slightest interest in baseball, and for everyone with an interest in seeing civil rights take a giant step forward in the world of sports, this picture is a must. For all its pain and all its joy, I love this movie!",9,0,0,25 April 2013
Argo," Argo Is Riveting!
","The Town was a movie that most certainly gave evidence of Ben Affleck's skills. Argo takes it a step farther. He has grown into, not only an excellent actor, but a smashing director as well. He is one of the best! Here he has created a film that has Oscar written all over it. Very likely for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor as well. From the first sight of the murderous mob of Iranians to the last frightening and infuriating moment, this picture moves you along with your interest totally intact. It is gripping! Many of us remember how this true story unfolded and ended, but never-the-less your attention will not flag. Not for a second. Alan Arkan has one of the best roles ever in this one, and John Goodman continues to get better all the time, too. As dramatic as this was, Affleck allowed Arkan and Goodman to interject a bit of humor to lighten things up now and then. Sheer perfection! This picture is the best I've seen in a while and I've seen some good ones lately. Affleck scores a winner with this movie!",9,2,4,25 October 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," Into The Darkness Soars Into Excellence!
","I am amazed and surprised at how much I like this new series of Star Trek. I was an enormous fan of the original Star Trek. Didn't care at all for the Second Generation stuff. But this set? Wow! I liked the first one in 2009 but I really like this second one – Into the Darkness. Who would have thought they could possibly come up with a set of actors who resemble the original crew enough to satisfy us die-hard fans and yet who impart their own take on the characters? Chris Pine has the charm, audacity, and humor that William Shatner displayed – and yet there is that fresh difference. Zachary Quinto cast as Spock was a brilliant decision. He is amazing. Karl Urban as Bones, is excellent. His, 'Damn it, I'm a doctor, not a .' is enough to get a great laugh from the audience. Simon Pegg as Scotty couldn't be better and John Cho as Sula is perfection. In this film, Benedict Cumbatch as Kahn was also a fantastic bit of casting. Well, I could go on. The casting, directing – everything was terrific. All in all, I'd say this is one fine movie. Plenty of action and enough small tie-ins from the original Star Trek showing up to thrill all of us Star Trek fans. Just a whole lot of action and fun. Don't miss this one. It's great!",9,3,8,25 May 2013
Rise of the Guardians," A Movie Destined To Become A Classic!
","This movie is magical and utterly charming. In this film DreamWorks did it all exactly right. Every voice is precisely as it should be. Perfection! Chris Pine, Jude Law, Hugh Jackman, too many to list if you didn't know that was Alec Baldwin doing the Russian accent for Santa, you would never guess it. The characters, all of them, are endearing, totally engaging. Sad moments, glad moments, hilarious moments. I haven't laughed this much in an animated movie since.well, never, actually. As I said, this one is destined to become a classic. A wonderful family movie and best of all it doesn't just appeal to the children, adults will love it too. Every adult in the audience,while I was there, seemed as captivated as the kids. And how many movies do you go to these days where, at the end, people applaud? They did for this one. And rightly so. I know I came out of that theater wishing I could somehow have my own Little Baby Tooth...and the friend I was with wished even more that she could have one of the Feisty Elves. You'll totally understand what I mean after you see this delightful movie. Don't miss this one!",9,83,107,30 November 2012
Spotlight," One Of The Best And Most Important Movies I've Ever Seen
",".and I see a lot of 'em. This film shows how professional journalists work to uncover a tremendous story – said professionalism so sadly lacking in today's media world - with hard work, dedication and honesty. How finding out the truth and exposing it was crucial to bringing hard to grasp facts to the focus of the entire world. I see Oscar winners written all over this picture. Best Picture right on to Best Male Actor – and two of them should be nominated here, Mark Ruffalo and Michael Keaton. Terrific performances by both. This movie moves right along, bringing it all together in a way that almost numbs your mind by the time it's done. When the end credits roll and it shows how this single story brought out atrocious child molestation scandals, not only in America, but all over the world, and you see the long, long list of places, you can hardly manage to get up from your seat and walk out into the world. You are stunned. This is not a spoiler, but I have to say, at one point in this film, without a word spoken, you watch the camera scroll down pages of names and facts, and in the background you hear a chorus of innocent young voices singing a Christmas carol, the hair on the back of your neck rises.you KNOW you are watching something brilliant. And that's what this production is, brilliant. Without question one of the best pictures you will ever see. And the one that will have you thinking and talking about it for a long, long time after.",10,6,11,4 December 2015
Begin Again," Melancholy With Music
","This is Mark Ruffalo's movie. He is always good but in this film he's great. Keira Knightley is very good in her role, but it plain and simple is Ruffalo's picture. There's some good music in this one, both old and new. Knightley has an adequate voice but not a strong, pure sound by any means. Sufficient for this film and the songs she sings. But make no mistake, she won't become a super star recording artist, let's put it that way. Watching and listening to the creation of music, and viewing the possibilities come to life in Mark Ruffalo's character's mind is fascinating. Adam Levine's voice it entirely too high pitched for my taste but for fans, I suspect he's fine for them. All in all, it's a pretty good, musical movie. And refreshing to see something that's not just another trashy, vulgar movie, the type of which we seem to have way, way too many lately.",8,1,3,24 July 2014
Life of Pi," An Astonishing Movie!
","Just got back home from watching Life of Piand I am stunned! This has to be one of the best movies I've ever seen – and I've seen a lot of them. The closest that comes to this picture was seeing Avatar in 3D. This movie will take your breath away. One the way home, we all played the, 'What was your favorite scene' thingand this is giving nothing awaybut at one point this little boat is floating out in the middle of the ocean with the sky reflected on the water, the same brilliant colors above and below so you can hardly tell which is up and which is down. To say that it's beautiful doesn't come close to doing it justice. And that is only one scene that will leave you amazed. This picture has so many Oscar's in store for it that, frankly, the rest of the list should simply pack up and stay home. There was not one single word, not one single scene that should have been any different than what it was. And Suraj Sharma who is Pi Patel carries so much of this movie brilliantly, playing against nothing but the ocean and a tiger, that it's nothing short of amazing. Nobody should miss this film. It's one you will never forget!",10,2,5,29 December 2012
Doctor Strange," Can't Wait For A Sequel
","Okay, I'll start right out by admitting I'm a huge Benedict Cumberbatch fan so went in to this with high expectations. They were met! The role of Captain Strange allowed us to see Benedict change and grow into this character, which he did in splendid fashion. There was not one role miscast in this one. Everyone was terrific! The special effects are phenomenal. And in addition to the action -­ lots -­ there is some laugh out loud humor, too. I would have gladly given this movie 10 stars but for one thing toward the end of the picture that I did not like­ - it made little sense and less logic. No spoiler here,­ you check if out and see. Also, when I see a movie I like I enjoy sitting through the credits while still wrapped up in what I've just experienced before venturing out into the real world. Was glad I did. This is one of the pictures where you want to hang around for a few instead of bolting out ­as there's a cool, short scene that you don't want to miss along the way through those credits.",9,2,5,12 November 2016
Lion," An Emotional Journey
","What a fabulous film! The first half has sub-titles which could turn some off, but shouldn't. It's set in India, they are speaking Indian and it's all when this lad is very young, becomes lost from his brother, his family. Some of it is difficult to watch as, in truth, this sort of thing does happen to so many youngsters there. But it will grab your heart and hold on tight. There should be an Oscar for those 12 or 14 years old and younger. I thought that when Sixth Sense came out and I think it even more with this picture. Sunny Pawar is amazing. He, and his voice, will stay with you – well, if like me – probably forever. The movie loses the sub-titles and switches to English when this little lost child is adopted by a family in Australia where Nicole Kidman as his new mother is wonderful. This is an emotional movie from beginning to end. Dev Patel is one of my favorites anyway and he literally shines in this picture. Perfection. I felt wrung out, but not unhappy when I left the theater. And this is not a spoiler but you won't discover why the movie is titled Lion until the very end. This one has Oscar winners written all over it.",9,2,3,18 February 2017
American Hustle," Mediocre At Best
","Saw the movie American Hustle this past week. I know it's getting a lot of press and gaining some awards but I'll tell you, I wasn't all that impressed with it. In fact the first half of it is so boring that I actually fell asleep! The individual performances are good, in fact, very good, but the story isn't. It's slow moving and too vague to be exciting. Even the end seemed too little, too late. Not enough to rescue the film for me, that's for certain. It's sort of a sting story but nowhere near on the level of 'The Sting'. I sure wouldn't be awarding it any prizes. Sorry but if this is supposed to be what is classified as the best, something is missing. Perhaps a writer, or a good director, or.....",6,3,6,19 January 2014
Rush," What An Intense, Brilliant Movie!
","I am positive that this film will be nominated for Picture of the Year and Ron Howard Director of the Year. Absolutely can't miss! Daniel Bruhl as Niki Lauda and Chris Hemsworth as James Hunt, racing rivals in the '70s were both phenomenal. In most pictures, with two leading characters, there will usually be one everyone likes and one they don't. Not in this film. Both are captivating and likable. Amazing talent in this picture. Even those viewers not totally into auto racing will enjoy this one because in addition to spectacular racing history and scenes, this one has a great story. I've got to admit there were a few agonizing moments where I was unable to watch, but I wouldn't have been able to tear myself away from this movie until the end for anything. This one is a winner!",10,2,3,10 October 2013
Oblivion," Exciting Science Fiction
","I do love a good Science Fiction movie...especially one that has a baseline of truth that could actually be applied to humans and earth. This one has just that...and Tom Cruise. He is superior in an action film. Not only can the guy act, but he really gets into the action part of it with a vengeance. Not all that many movie actors are so believable and enjoyable to watch as Cruise. And he does shine in this one. Morgan Freeman's always wonderful. His part wasn't all that long in this one, but what there was could only be termed choice. I wouldn't miss a Morgan Freeman film any more than I would a Tom Cruise movie. Together they're terrific. Throw in a few nice twists and it all adds up to a picture well worth spending money to see.",9,1,4,8 May 2013
Man of Steel," What Was Good Was Good, What Was Too Long Was Too Long
","What is it with some producers these days? There are those who seem to suffer from a no shut off valve ailment. Trust me, long doesn't necessarily equate to better. Take this movie as a good example. Had about an hour of never-ending battles been cut from this film, it would have beenwellsuper. As it was, it seemed like just another villain who will not, can not, die epic. The casting is perfect. Every single character was portrayed by the right actor and actress. No quarrel with that part. But the battles and fights that seemed a constant assault on the senses were over-load. I attended this movie with a friend who is a true to the bone Superman fan, has never, nor would ever, miss a single movie about Superman...and even she came away from this one unhappy. Bottom line, too much, too long, too aggressive. Too bad.",6,2,5,20 June 2013
Trouble with the Curve," Trouble With The Curve Hits A Solid Home Run
","Clint Eastwood has being a curmudgeon honed to perfection. How refreshing to see a mature actor creating appropriate roles, and not trying to be a plastic version of his - or her, for that matter in many cases - former self playing inappropriately younger parts. He is excellent in this movie. Amy Adams is, as in every film I've seen her in, a total delight. I never was a fan of John Goodman in his earlier years, but the older he gets and the meatier the roles he takes on, the more appreciation I have for him. And Justin Timberlake has a role absolutely meant for him. He is a sexy little hunk, no doubt about it, with personality to spare. Oh, I loved this movie! The exhilaration of baseball, the heart-tugging familiarity of family issues.this one has a lot going for it and I enjoyed each and every minute of it. It's as good as expectations built it up to be. I would advise you not to miss this one!",8,41,55,11 October 2012
Hugo," Hugo Is Hugely Entertaining
","For very early cinema enthusiasts,those mesmerized by magic, fans mad for Martin Scorsese....anyone who enjoys the pure pleasure of an excellent movie, by all means, this is a film to experience. It's a splendid example of a delightful, feel good, wonderfully made movie. There is perfection everywhere, the movie fairly sparkles with it. The story line combining fact and fiction is a masterful accomplishment. The casting is a total joy... Ben Kingsley's portrayal of a young/old Georges Melies is probably my favorite among his vast list of achievements, and the young lad, Asa Butterfield who is Hugo, will win your heart and break your heart in turn. This will, without question, be nominated as a Best Movie of the Year, because I believe it is exactly that. It truly is a movie not to be missed. You will leave the theater thoroughly satisfied that this was the movie you decided to lay down your money to see. Worth every penny, too!",10,5,10,30 November 2011
We're the Millers," Unexpected Enjoyment
","Okay, my expectations for We're the Millers wasn't too high when I went to see it. And granted, some of it is overly crude and too gross, but a lot of it is laugh out loud funny, too. This is not a movie that's going to win any awards, but it is not a bad movie if you just want to be entertained for an hour or soÂ…and are not a kid. This is not a movie for kids, but for grownups who aren't the sort to be put off by a few of the scenes, it's a funny film. And I don't suppose those folks are going to be interested in seeing a picture like this anyway, soÂ….. At any rate, it's refreshing to see something that isn't geared to the teenage mindset, brimming over with vampires, or moronic party, party, party time, or the sort slam-bang full of non-stop violence as to make your head hurt, so that I quite enjoyed myself for the most part. Like I said, a few scenes I could have done without but then, nobody asked me about the content, or how to present it, when it was filmed. Jennifer Aniston continues to prove what a delight she is. She's one of the few actresses who appeal to both male and female viewers. The males for obvious reasons and the females because , although she is gorgeous, it's the rare version of beauty that isn't threatening because she IS so very likable. The perfect star for a comedy movie. And Jason Sudeikis is terrific. Just perfect for comedy and yet has the ability to carry serious moments equally as well. This had a fun plot, if one can get past the drug-running aspect of it, and after all, it's only a movie, so why not? Had some good music with Will Poulter, who played the 'son' super doing his thing to Waterfall. All in all, better than you'd expect and a dandy opportunity for some laughs.",8,1,5,25 August 2013
Bad Teacher," Bad Teacher Is A Bad Movie
","Trust me, there are no redeeming qualities about the character that Dameron Diaz plays in Bad Teacher, nor in the movie, for that matter. What I wonder is, who actually looks at a screenplay for something so empty, so worthless as this movie and says, 'Oh yeah, this is something I want to put time and money into producing.' Surely not anyone with the ability to judge good from bad, entertaining from non. There are movies I've enjoyed, that have characters in them you simply want to slap, they are so despicable. But in those films, there is a reason for them being so unlikable. Not so in this effort. This main character is simply a waste of time as a human being. Has Diaz's career sunk so far down that the thought of accepting just any role that comes along is fine with her? Why else would she associate herself with this garbage? Money? Frankly, there isn't enough money offered that would allow me to want my name and face associated with this movie. A great big zero as far as entertainment. Save your time and your money for something worthwhile. This movie isn't it.",Null,2,6,4 October 2011
Now You See Me," Couldn't Have Liked It Better If I'd Made It Myself!
","This movie is a joy! Illusion, deception, secrets, twists, turns, suspense.it's got it all plus plenty of action. Some of my favorite stars are in this one: Morgan Freeman, Mark Ruffalo, Jessie Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Michael Caine.just the line-up alone should tell you that you have a treat in store. And you do! There were more people in the audience than usual for this one, and they were all as happy as I was, evidently, with the way the film went because a good half of us applauded the end. If you want action with a pretty fair plot involved – which is so often rare in the land of action films – and a picture that will keep you guessing all the way through, this is the one for you.",9,2,6,6 June 2013
Mamma Mia!," Mama Mia
","Oh what a feel good movie! For anyone who loved ABBA music, this will be so enjoyable that, like me, you're going to want to see it again. How refreshing to watch 3 older actresses have such meaty parts - singing and dancing all over the screen. And who cares that Pierce Brownan hasn't the world's best voice? It was perfect for this movie and his character...which I may add is excellently played. The casting is about as perfect as it could get and frankly, I wouldn't change a single thing in this show. You will leave the theater in an upbeat mood and, like it or not, the ABBA music will be stuck, right there in your head, to be hummed, sung, or even given a little self-conscious dance to (when you think nobody is looking) Gotta love this movie! Thank goodness they are back to making fun movies again. And this surely is one!",10,1,3,22 July 2008
The Fault in Our Stars," See This One With A Clutch Of Kleenex
","Oh how I cried, but oh how I loved this movie. Learning to deal with cancer while learning to deal with life presents problems that a person will have no knowledge of unless having gone through it, or having known someone who has. As this film leads us to discover, with a strong family, a good friend or two, as much humor as you can dredge up, and love, it can be done as well as it can be done. Shailene Woodley as Hazel and Ansel Elgort as Gus will grab your heart and break it in the process. Their roles were played to complete perfection. The plot, the dialogue, the actors and actresses chosen to be these people...it was all flawless from my point of view. I know I wasn't the only member of the audience to be shedding tears but those tears drew us into this picture and made us a part of the story. This is a good one.",10,0,1,26 June 2014
To Rome With Love," Not One Of Woody Allen's Successes
","Woody Allen movies seem to always be either a hit or a miss. This particular film didn't even rise to the miss category. It was predictable and dull. There were a few funny lines, which all happened to be Woody's, but even those were few and far between. Woody's last effort, Midnight in Paris, was a delight, pure perfection. This one, however, is so forgettable as to be not worth bothering with. I will say I enjoyed Alec Baldwin's part, but that wasn't nearly enough to carry the movie. It was clear how Allen wanted to have the mix all come together and easy to see what he was striving for with each episode.but none of it really worked. Over-acted and under-written. I would say skip this one and wait for Woody's next film. Odds are it will be a hit.or at least something better than this one.",4,13,28,26 July 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," An Unexpected Disappointment
","I've been a fan of Tolkien, the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings forever. And I never would have thought there could possibly be anything to shake my fascination, my enthrallment with it all. Not, that is, until I finally got around to watching The Hobbit, An Unexpected Journey. This film could have benefited greatly by some serious editing. A great deal of it should have found its final resting place on the cutting room floor. The best I can say is there were inches of brilliance amongst acres of boredom. It's quite easy to see that somehow greed and the desire to drag this story out and make twice as much money on it byÂ….well...dragging it out were put into play. If you haven't seen it yet, my best advice is, don't. See something entertaining instead, because this certainly isn't!",6,2,5,18 April 2013
Avengers: Infinity War," No Spoiler Alert -But HATED The Ending
","Okay, plenty of action, lots of humor, excitement galore...so why the 1 rating from me? Because, and I'm not telling you one word about how it ends, this has to be the WORST way to end a movie I've ever seen...and wished I hadn't. The heck with it. Guess who won't be lined up to see how the next one goes? That would be ME 'cause frankly, at this point, I don't care.",1,45,96,10 May 2018
Here Comes the Boom," Here Comes The Boom Brings It - 100%
","I've always enjoyed Kevin James because of his comedic talent but this movie shows he not only has humor but he has heart. And plenty of it. What a terrific feel good movie! Henry Winkler was wonderful – as was Salma Hayek and everyone else in this film, for that matter. In spite of the fact that, in a row ahead of me there was the unwelcome distraction of a half dozen empty-headed teenage girl who evidently didn't think they could live for an hour or so without their cell phones lit up like miner's lamps...until I shut them down with some choice words...the movie was one that got us caught up and kept us there until the very end. A good film for the whole family – finally. So many of these pictures leave a lot to be desired in that respect but this one didn't fail us. I'm not even a fight fan, but I was right in there for the fight scenes feeling each and every punch. By the end of the movie the audience (even the previously mention girls might have forgotten to fire up their phones for a few minutes, had I not already encouraged them in that direction) was totally engaged in the action. The Boom leaves little room for doubt, it's a good movie! I sure do recommend this one. You'll love it!",9,5,9,18 October 2012
Hotel Transylvania," What a Fun Movie!
","Really, this one is fun! The animation was wonderful, the plotyes, there was a plotwas good and I can honestly say this ranks right up there with some of best animation films I've seen in the past few years. It was properly sinister in an amusing way. The characters were given personalities and facial expressions that were right on the money. This was a delight – with music – and even the music was pretty good. Got to say this is probably the only thing I've ever liked Fran Drescher or David Spade in. Seriously. I was thoroughly entertained with this picture and will probably end up buying copies of the DVD as gifts for others. I think, if you like animated movies, you are sure to enjoy this one. If you didn't catch it in the theater, be sure to grab the DVD.",8,0,2,15 February 2013
Everest," Everest As Intense As The Weather Surrounding The Mountain
","Having read the book, I knew what to expect. However, seeing it unfold on a big screen, in 3D, made it even more chilling (no pun intended). First off, I will never, ever understand the people who willingly put themselves into, not only harm's way, but a terrifying, frigid, unforgiving harm's way such as this. The entire cast was more than up to the standards a movie like this demands. Harsh, heart-rending, and either exhilarating if you are into such self-inflicted misery, or puzzling and perplexing if you are like me, not seeing the need or necessity to scale a huge, unwelcoming, unpredictable piece of the planet such as Mount Everest. Make no mistake, this is not a happy, uplifting picture, but it is gripping and intense.",8,0,1,3 October 2015
The Artist," Enjoyable But Certainly Nothing New Or Original
","Another movie that leaves me torn and divided. I will say right off that I very much liked this film. Loved the performers and the characters they played (Uggie the dogif there isn't an Academy Award for him, there certainly should be!) However, in having said that, I will say there was nothing original here. At all. There were echoes and pieces of various and sundry old movies, many of them silent. You could easily see Gene Kelley, who was handsome and could dance, but couldn't act his way out of a paper bagand yet you loved him. I did. The lead character, George Valentin, played by Jean Dujardin was that character. There is no way you could not like him - immensely. Berenice Bejo as Peppy Miller, the ingénue with a heart of gold who makes it big, was perfect and John Goodman's Al Zimmer was one of Goodmans's best. You actually like him in this role. But movie of the year? Not likely. The novelty of making a mostly silent film was different for this day and age, but certainly nothing new. The plot was old and well-used, predictable, even while it was being enjoyed. And again, I will say I liked this movie, in spite of it all, probably will see it again. Do see this, by all means. if for no other reason than to see what old, silent movies were like. Because this is nothing more than a compilation of a great many of them only with better actors and better film.",8,0,1,1 February 2012
La La Land," I Can See Why This Won So Many Awards
","I loved this movie. This is not a spoiler but it didn't quite have the happy ending I would have liked. However that didn't change my liking of this film. Gosling and Stone were wonderful. Had absolutely no idea Gosling was such a fantastic pianist. But he most certainly is. A natural. And the music from this movie is wonderful. When you come out of the theater humming the music, it's good. And I did. Here's the thing- instead of the raunchy movies with nothing but foul language in place of real dialogue - why isn't Hollywood making more musicals? It's obvious the public loves them. That we will gladly spend money to see them over and over- and happily buy them when they come out in DVD form. We need more lovely movies like this!",9,4,11,11 January 2017
Woman in Gold," Woman In Gold Is Pure Gold
","First of all, there can never be a bad movie if it has within its cast the superb Helen Mirren. She is that good. And Ryan Reynolds is no slouch in the acting field, either. I so enjoyed his role in this movie as a young attorney, feeling his way into a career and having the case of a lifetime dropped in his lap. Watching him learn and cope was perfect. Nicely written, well plotted, and I very much liked the shifting back and forth from the early war days as the legal problem was set up to the present time as the solution unfolded. For me, there was one scene where Katie Holmes, as Reynold's wife, has a rather abrupt flip-flop in her thinking that had me convinced the writers couldn't find a better way to accomplish thator perhaps they simply ran out of timewho knows. But all in all it was a work of art about art. A fine film.",8,0,1,14 May 2015
Beauty and the Beast," Disney Needs To Return To Pure Entertainment
","Okay, Emma Watson did a great job. Who knew she could sing so well? As did Dan Stevens as the Beast, Kevin Kline as Maurice and Luke Evans as Gaston. Josh Gad as LeFou - this actor has such a charming face, so likable. Why did they have to make him a flaming whatever? For the most part, the cast was wonderful. In so saying, however, frankly I SO love the 1991 animated Beauty and the Beast that there can not possibly be any improvement on it. When I hear 'Mrs Potts' sing, I want to hear Angela Lansbury. When Lumiere sings Be Our Guest, I want to hear Jerry Orbach. Seriously. This is a good version, if a version absolutely had to be made. But did it, beyond having to mix in some liberal views? Here's the thing, Walt Disney must be up there somewhere shaking his head in dismay. Not sure who or what is in charge of the Disney world now, but obviously someone who simply feels compelled to throw in politically correct foolishness to the nth degree – even if it means spoiling the movie for thousands and thousands of previous Disney fans. Come on. Stop the insanity and get back to entertainment. Enough with the politically correct spoilage. Get back to 'family entertainment' will you, Disney people?",7,2,8,23 March 2017
Jersey Boys," Sing Out Another Hit For Eastwood!
","In a theater packed with more people than I've seen attending a matinée in a long, long time, it would seem that each and every person in there enjoyed a toe-tapping, finger-snapping, head-bobbing, 'I-want-to-sing- along' experience during this dance down memory lane. And it wasn't only those who were there when all of this came down, but those too young to have been a part of that scene were having a great time. The casting and directing could not be more excellent than they are for this movie. And it isn't only the music, which is marvelous, but the look into the relationships of the people involved in this moment in time that is fascinating. A peek into their history, their character, the way their lives played out - this is a well put together film When a picture ends with people applauding, you know you've just seen a winner. When you walk out and hear folks saying, 'I'm sure going to have to buy this when it comes out.', you really can appreciate the fact that you weren't the only one in there having a fun time. There are only a few directors whose films you know you can always count on for quality – Eastwood has most certainly proved he's one.",9,52,70,20 June 2014
Edge of Tomorrow," Groundhog's Day On Steroids
","Tom Cruise scores again as the hero of this combat action film. He simply can't be best in these roles. He's tough, believable, and fascinating to watch. In this movie, which if you don't appreciate almost constant action you might not be such a fan of, Cruise's character dies almost instantly and is wakes over and over again, each time getting stronger and smarter. Watching him begin this picture as someone scared witless and totally unprepared for what he will be required to do – and evolving into an intelligent, powerful, capable fighter is brilliant. Emily Blunt is also believable in the tough character she portrays. Good plotting, super acting and a movie that you'll get sucked into before you know it as you find yourself rooting for Cruise to hurry and learn what the violence and action is determined to teach him...this is good entertainment.",9,0,3,24 July 2014
Dark Shadows," What a Disappointment!
","Rather than 'how do I love thee', let's play 'how do I loathe thee'. This movie could have been so entertaining could have been a real tongue in cheek, hilarious take-off of Dark Shadows. I had anticipated such. Instead, it was witless, pointless, and worthless. Tim Burton obviously couldn't determine whether to go for funny or scary and as a result, it was neither. The premise of a movie was there, but it was pretty much there – and gone to the point of being invisible. The characters were without form and substance (in fact, all the female characters could well have been interchangeable, they were so look-alike and blah), the action rather meaningless. I'm thinking the team of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp had best go back to square one and start over again because once upon a time that combination was sure to result in something wonderful. That expectation was dashed and done in here. I almost dozed off several times and by the end of the film was rather disappointed that I hadn't allowed myself to do just that. At least I would have felt I'd gained some refreshing sleep from my time rather than ending up with a couple of wasted hours.",5,3,7,17 May 2012
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Oh. My. God.
","You have never seen Michael Keaton in a role like this. He turned in an absolutely stellar performance, the best role of his entire career, at least up to this point. You might think you know Michael Keaton. Not even remotely. I not only see Oscar nominations here but I'm betting a win for Keaton. Emma Stone as Sam is almost certain to get an Oscar nod. Zach Galifianakis as Jake, Edward Norton as Mike.the entire cast is extraordinary in this film. There is so much about this imaginative, sometimes funny, most of the time gripping, harsh, gritty, painful movie. Stunning is all I can say. This picture captures you right from the beginning and doesn't release you until the end. You will walk away knowing you've seen something out of the ordinary. And as much as I'd like to, I can't even say anything about the ending. You see it. You see what you think. But by all means, see this movie!",10,2,9,4 December 2014
Moonrise Kingdom," A Touching, Funny Film That Is A Sheer Delight
","This well plotted picture, filmed in the subdued, slightly softened film effect of the 1960s, was a joy. I can hardly say enough good about this movie. Excellent casting – the mix of seasoned performers who in no way steal the film but rather enhance it to perfection – the young unknown leads, precocious youngsters attempting to live a life of freedom, could not have been played better by Kara Hayward as Suzy and Jared Gilman as Sam. Edward Norton as the Scout Master was yet another example of brilliant casting. Melancholy, hilarious, poignant, upliftingthere were not many emotions untouched, and marvelously, in this production. Bruce Willis is a dear and I've got to say that Bill Murray is getting better and better at the craft of acting as he gets older. Never a big fan (although how could you not have enjoyed Meatballs) I am becoming one with each recent movie of his that I've seen. Don't miss this one. I can guarantee you will love this movie and probably, like me, want to see it again. Well done on every single level!",10,2,4,19 July 2012
Unbroken," Angelina Jolie Has Created A Masterful Film
","This was a hard movie for me to watch as I'm not comfortable with cruelty either in person or in a picture. And this film was all about the harshness, the brutality, the enormous cruelty of the Japanese toward the American prisoners of war. It was also a movie about triumph – and not triumph of any one side in a war because I don't think there ever is a triumphant side, only destroyed and dead people left behind an outdated, barbaric way to solve issues – but about personal strength and triumph in the face enormous adversity, of beyond believe pain and misery, and the ability to go above and beyond all of it. Jolie pulled no punches in showing it all. The casting was spot on, the dialog was believable, the pace of the movie was right...in essence, there was nothing about this movie that wasn't exactly right. If there is any fairness in the world, this film and the people involved in it, both in front of and behind the camera, should be in for a whole lot of awards. Bottom line, if you're looking for a good movie, one you won't soon forget – especially in the knowledge that this is a true story – here is your opportunity. See it, by all means.",9,1,7,16 January 2015
50_50," 50/50 is about 90% perfect
","I'm about 90% certain you're going to like 50/50. I'd be 100% sure if, once again, the screenwriter hadn't decided the plot, cast and dialogue wouldn't be enough entertainment and so threw in a bunch of superfluous explicit sex talk. Other than that, this is a heart-tugging film that will leave you caring for the people in it and hoping for things to turn out the way you'd want them to. The topic of cancer, the treatment of that topic, the responses to the cancer will resonate for those who have either gone through it, known someone who has, or is involved with someone who is currently there. The emotions are honest and compelling. This is one of the movies where the time flies by so fast you won't realize how long you've been a part of their lives...because you will be sharing many of the feelings exposed in this movie. There are plenty of light moments where you'll be laughing out loud as a bonus. This is a quiet sort of film that you will be remembering for some time. Do see this one. It should be on your must see list.",9,0,1,13 October 2011
The Nice Guys," There HAS To Be A Sequel
",".and not only that, but if they're smart, they'd be filming it already. Plenty of violence, lots of laughter and excellent chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe. I'll tell you, I'm not really a Russell Crowe fan, but he was perfect for this role. I heard people, as they were leaving, saying things about hoping there'd be another one with The Nice Guys before too long. Personally I think there is going to be a market for a series of them. It was that good. The daughter, Holly, played by Angourie Rice, was a tad on the precocious side but in the grand scheme of things, it worked rather well. This is reminiscent of good detective films from the past with a modern slant and these tough detectives, with their history and issues are sheer entertainment. Crowe showing a vicious side as well as a tender side is the epitome of the tough cop-type and Gosling, trying to be father, find another drink and still earn money detecting is a hoot. Bring on another one. And soon!",9,7,14,9 June 2016
The Martian," Well Worth Watching
","Wasn't sure I wanted to see The Martian all that much, but after viewing it, was glad I did. There was not the horrid sense of doom and gloom I had anticipated, in fact, there was hope, humor, suspense, and for me, although gripping, the occasional feeling of being so isolated, so alone that it was momentarily stunning. This is a good movie to show the ingenuity of man when the chips are down, for those of us positive people, the proof that we can, indeed, do whatever it takes to survive when called on to do so. Matt Damon, as the left behind for dead astronaut, was wonderful in this role, portraying fear, despair, humor, hope, determinationall of the emotions the role demanded. And in 3-D, the view of the heavens was spectacular as was the feeling of being one person so alone on such a large, stark, basically unfriendly planet. I do recommend this film as one to see that will leave you feeling secure that there are people – not merely MacGyver– for those who remember the I-can-do-it-all-with-only-a-paper-clip-and-a-rubber-band kind of guy that was on TV years ago – out there. To imagine that our astronauts are so able leaves the audience feeling good about the program and the people involved. And in this case, with world cooperation when needed. It's solid entertainment.",9,3,7,11 October 2015
