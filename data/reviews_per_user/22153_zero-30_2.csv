Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," what was he(George Lucas)thinking?
","Could this picture have been worse?  Well, yeah but not much.  For easy reading purposes, the top five reasons why it was a waste of money:1.  NEEDLESS RACIAL STEREOTYPES:  Yeah, fun.  Tell me the aliens (sorry, can't remember the name of the race) who took over Naboo weren't supposed to be of Asian ancestry.  We nehd approovahl ohf the sin-naat. Sure. Nearly every alien was supposed to be some ethnicity. Insulting. 2.  REALLY REALLY BAD DIALOGUE: Wooden and unfeeling. Did Anakin and the Queen really have an exchange that went, 'I care for you' and 'My caring for you will remain'?  Or did I imagine it? Lousy. 3.  BADBADBAD BAD BAD ACTING: Yes, they had good actors(except the children), but with no characters to play and no dialogue to say how good could you be? Plus, any movie that totally wastes Ewan MacGregor should be burned. 4.  JAR JAR: Ok, you defend him. Unfunny in every way possible. Fake looking too. 5.  NO BUILD UP FOR THE VILLAIN: Sorry, but you can't show Maul just standing around looking vaguely sinister a few times and expect the audience to be care about the climatic battle scene at the end. Plus, he looked like an Insane Clown Posse roadie. Zero character development for the villain. For everyone actually.Sorry to rain on anyone's delusional parade but this movie was just made to fatten the bank accounts of Lucasfilm.",3,0,1,29 June 1999
Cube," don't read this if you liked 'cube'
","'Cube' is a near-worthless excuse for a movie.  Pitiful acting, a lousy script and grade zero production values.  All this would be bad enough had the movie's premise not had some promise.  Memo to the filmmakers: You're supposed to make the audience care about the characters, not hate them. Not worth the price of a rental.  grade: D-",2,2,7,23 June 1999
