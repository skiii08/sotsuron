The Blair Witch Project," A masterpiece of suspense and terror...not horror
",Being in the woods in the middle of nowhere is scary in and of itself-scarier when you tell ghost stories-scarier still when you're in a ghost story. This simple truth has finally been exploited to(almost)maximum effect and create a truly gripping movie.Blair Witch Project is a brilliantly conceived and executed filmthat unfortunately cuts itself too short just as it's momentum finally starts to build to a fever pitch. The situation for the three protagonists gets increasingly desperate and weird and genuinely scary but the climax is overly abrupt to say the least and leaves the viewer distinctly unsatisfied(although the last shot is haunting). The film also spends too much time concentrating on the three tired young filmmakers bickering amongst each other and basically breaking down mentally(although the actors all give very impressive performances-It's easy to forget that this is a movie and not a documentary while you're watching it). These scenes are very well done but go on too long and it's nothing you haven't seen in Deliverance. They detract from the overall impact in the long run. I would still recommend this film but I have to admit I needed just a little more gore and a little less mystery.,9,1,1,26 July 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Poorly written letdown
","The Phantom Menace has everything the other SW movies had save for passion, sophistication, subtlety, warmth, humor(Jar Jar is not just unfunny but anti-funny, since he sucks the life out of whatever scene he is in-and yes he is offensive too), suspense, soul, and respect for the audience. That leaves us with a movie that is basically a long, boring, shiny commercial for the next movie in the series. On the bright side, I enjoyed seeing R2 and C3PO, Darth Maul's surprise CAMEO appearance was exciting, and you get to see a little more of what jedis are capable of, which is kind of cool. The star actors did OK considering but the characters were severely lacking in personality, in stark contrast to the endearing humanity and friction produced between the principals in the original trilogy.I wish I didn't love Star Wars so I could just excuse this film and maybe even enjoy it but this movie was terribly disappointing. The plot is both more complicated AND more simpleminded than the other movies in this series. Lucas needs to hire a good director and a screenwriter while he's at it before his space epic becomes a bad running joke",1,0,1,8 August 1999
The Others," Very good movie
","I'd dubbed this a quiet classic when I saw it last summer but the second viewing definitely pales next to the first, if only slightly.Nicole Kidman's performance is Oscar-worthy, the atmosphere and intrigue is established perfectly, the supporting cast is wonderful, but the story doesn't quite stand up to too much scrutiny. The emotional development of the story is deliberate and thoughtful while the supernatural logistics of the story seem kind of arbitrary, and that kind of undercuts the final punch of the plot - the suspense is strong but the explanations are invariably weak. Themes of penance and spiritual absolutism introduced at the start don't quite make it to the finish line, at least not explicitly enough. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend but the weaknesses made themselves known the second time around.",9,0,0,20 June 2002
Full Metal Jacket," First half is a great film in itself
","It's like a broken record now but I do agree the first half of FMJ was some of the most gripping movie footage I've ever seen. I would almost say that it is a companion piece to the first 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan-it showed the intense mental violence that is perpetrated on G.I.s before they ever hit foreign soil. Lee Ermey created one of THE great screen characters in movie history.The rest of the movie is thoughtful and more subtle than anything in Platoon and the other more famous 80's war movies but it's still kind of tepid and too conventional to mesh with the boot camp sequence, which is electric and unflinchingly real. I still rank this movie as probably my favorite war film but have to admit it's uneven.",8,0,0,7 July 1999
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," As the world fizzles
","I found the first Terminator scary and the second a perfect piece of pop entertainment. The third is just what you think it is: little better than an afterthought. The parts are there: The situation is urgent, The new Terminator is terrifying, and Arnold's bot is milked for even more genuinely funny deadpan, but with a surfeit of choppy action and dearth of any other emotional material, you're left with a movie that doesn't take itself seriously enough to warrant the audience's loyalty. Not to mention the unforgivable lapses in logic and decidedly unintelligent hunting techniques of the new cyborg. The buddy I went with remarked about the lack of pause or reflection that made the previous films relatively moving experiences and I agree; without them, the franchise has devolved into an extended chase sequence.",7,0,0,8 September 2003
Ocean's Eleven," Fizzy
","Shows how easily intelligent direction, great cinematography, and bona-fide star power can redeem what could have been a stale heist genre exercise. The mechanics of the heist and the love story -between George Clooney and the snappy, dazzling Julia Roberts- are preposterous but Soderbergh is more interested in dialogue, cool(not hip, but genuine cool), and elevation/subversion of the mainstream aesthetic than airtight storytelling. Good choice, it turns out, as we get to witness Brad Pitt, Carl Reiner, Don Cheadle, Andy Garcia and others riff on familiar 'dirty dozen' type setups and fashion memorable characters out of just a few minutes of screentime each. An imminently forgettable good time. 8.5/10",9,0,0,20 June 2002
The Dirty Dozen," surprisingly good
","Refreshingly devoid of heroism(while remaining gleefully knee-deep in sensationalism), this movie honestly surprised me with it's depth. Lee Marvin is a marvel as a tough Army major assigned to whip a bunch of violent Army felons into shape for a covert mission in German territory. John Cassavetes and Charles Bronson, both smoldering, anchor the charismatic cast of convicts(half of whom remain rather anonymous, unfortunately), and Telly Savalas adds an addled charm as the psychopathic Pvt.Maggett even though his character's story arc is somewhat mishandled down the stretch. The film is rollicking at times but it remains clear-eyed throughout, and revels in the coldness of armed conflict as opposed to cheap dramatics it could have plumbed out of such a familiar story.",9,1,3,20 June 2002
From Hell," Okay
","Gothic trappings and dreamy visuals try desperately to cover the stench of exploitation in this violent, speculative retelling of the Jack the Ripper incidents. Johnny Depp, who plays the clairvoyant detective on the trail of the murderer, is a wonderfully intuitive actor but has always lacked a certain screen presence/charisma, an attribute that works in his favor in films like Dead Man or Nick of Time but detracts from performances in, say, Blow from last year, films where we need to believe he has the magnetism and deep motivations the script is telling us he has. His ethereality, for lack of a better word, is a mixed bag here, as the murders and intrigue behind the killer's identity far overshadow and out-interest whatever internal conflicts the Depp character carries. On the plus side, the love story, between him and a potentially doomed prostitute(Heather Graham) makes sense and adds needed poignancy to balance out the carnage the directors(Hughes Brothers) are so eager to wallow in. The murders are inventively, brutally shot, and as the camera lingers unsympathetically on the grisly aftermaths the connection is eloquently, methodically made between the polite economic violence of the London elite and the cold brutality of being on the bottom rung. Nifty piece of work there. The fact that the Hughes are good at what they do(exploitation) doesn't get them a pass but it does lead them into some interesting territory almost in spite of themselves. 8/10",7,0,1,20 June 2002
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The Best-no question
","This is the truly dramatic meat of the trilogy-the one that pulled you into the lives of the rebels. The one that made their cause seem so desperate and so necessary that you just had to see them topple the Empire. An unseemly puppet named Yoda helped put this elaborate saga in historical perspective and brought depth  and mystery to the concept of 'The Force' that was only touched upon in Star Wars. The genius of the trilogy(yes-it remains a trilogy until Lucas makes up for that Phantom Menace crap) is the way it effortlessly draws you in and immediately makes you forget you're watching a mere'movie'.  The Empire Strikes Back, more than any of the others, is responsible for bringing the whole drama of the saga into people's minds.",10,0,0,7 July 1999
