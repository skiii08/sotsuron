"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," strong debut from Schwimmer
","RFR hits all the right rom-com targets - I laughed, I teared up, I cheered for the little guy and boo-ed the buff villain. Pegg has some laugh-out-loud lines, especially in tandem with Moran as his Irish mate Gordon. Moran holds his own in the comedic moments - perhaps the funniest moment is when he appears in the dressing gown after some love drama, and asks, 'What did I miss?'. The fight between the two layabout friends is hilarious, the staging somehow reminiscent of a Friends episode (didn't Ross and Chandler once fight this way?). That's a compliment - Schwimmer has strong comedy pedigree and uses it to full effect. Also, good to see a US director move seamlessly through a UK film setting.If you are in the mood for light, entertaining fare, Friday-night date stuff, then RFR won't disappoint.",8,32,46,17 February 2008
The King's Speech," you can keep your shilling
","It is 1939 and Britain's defence of the realm against the impending Nazi blitzkrieg depends on the king not stammering during a radio broadcast.Of course, the war effort was in fact more complex, but hats off to the myth-makers responsible for The King's Speech in spinning this tale so skillfully towards such a conclusion. History and films should never be conflated, and anyone who wants to harp on about 'historical inaccuracies' in a movie should have their library card confiscated.Leaving the real King George VI aside, the cinematic regent finds his selfish big brother abdicating at a time when the nation is facing its darkest days. He employs a maverick Aussie speech therapist to help him with his speech impediment, and their bromance culminates in the king successfully addressing the nation, in turn kick-starting the war effort and taking the first step to giving Jerry what-ho.Firth is suitably regal and vulnerable. As for Geoffrey Rush - has he ever made a bad film? Bonham Carter, as usual, drips aristocratic ice. Guy Pearce plays bad guy Edward a shade too buffoonish, but you have to expect heightened contrasts when cinema takes on history.There have to be thousands of stories from WWII that are more inspiring, and significant, than the tale of one extremely privileged being's attempts to get a speech right, but fair dues to the film-makers for keeping this tale credulous. And making me care.",8,0,1,8 May 2011
Lucky Number Slevin," two movies in one
","Hitchcock was the master of the tone change in a film, wrong-footing his audience into thinking they were watching one genre before revealing another. It is a hard trick to pull-off these days, with trailers giving so much away and information overload wherever you look. So it was a delight one night to turn on the TV and come across this film that I had never heard of.I came damn close to switching the thing off halfway through. The goofy hoods, quick-fire comments, and lame put-downs had me labeling this an under-realized student film. Then it all turns around. Josh Hartnett puts in quite a performance here; his split personality role had me hating his smarmy bonhomie at the beginning, but crying in sympathy at the end.And I say no more for fear of spoilers. See it cold, and enjoy the journey. For the first 20 minutes I thought 'What are this cast doing in this movie?' More fool me.",8,3,4,12 March 2013
Skyfall," Bond is back, for better or worse
","An ex-agent bent on revenge against M wreaks havoc on MI6, and only Bond can stop him.It is difficult to talk about Skyfall in its own terms as it makes such overt intertextual reference to the preceding two films, and the franchise as a whole. Under siege from the slickness of the Bourne movies, the parody of Austin Powers, and the backstory angst of Batman, the 007 franchise decided to re-invent itself with Daniel Craig and Casino Royale. It all got muddled in Quantum, and Skyfall puts Mendes at the helm to set the ship straight. Casino Royale seemed to be at pains to mitigate, if not exactly justify, the misogynistic legacy of Connery, Moore and Brosnan. Bond had been done over in his early double-O career and love was his weak spot. Skyfall turns it all around once more, taking aim at a female M, and using Moneypenny to show women do not belong in the field, but behind desks as secretaries to M and 007. The Aston Martin returns to symbolise this reversion to the old patriarchal order. A woman is shot but Bond mourns the whisky spilled as collateral damage. A shaken not stirred dry martini might not have been worth a damn to the Casino Royale Bond, but his shaken drink is 'just perfect' this time. Bond is getting on, his bones creak, and the Qs are getting younger and lippier. But the more the world changes, Skyfall seems to say, the more Bond will stay the same. We are even back to the villains wanting to talk him to death, rather than just shoot the bloody menace.Not so much a new outing then, or even a re-boot, but a re-set of the franchise to traditional values - for better or worse.Great use of locations, especially Istanbul and Scotland (Bond, the quintessential Englishman, apparently grew up in Scotland - no wonder he has issues. Though it does explain Connery's accent). The action sequences are top class, and Bardem cuts loose to great effect as the evil genius. The attempts at modernity falter, however: M is called to a parliamentary committee to account for three executed undercover agents, and lamely quotes Tennyson. Bond's backstory (turns out Batman and Bond both have loss anxiety) is touched upon only to be dismissed by a one-liner quip as Bond watches his childhood home go up in flames. The script strains to keep it all coherent and plausible, and suspension of disbelief is required in greater degrees at some points. Personally, I couldn't always mange it and so my enjoyment of Skyfall was patchy.So Bond is back, and will be back again, baggage unloaded, and any nods to PC mores or gender politics have been jettisoned like an unwanted passenger in the Aston Martin. The traditionalists will be happy with this re-invention and threading through of New Lad culture tropes. For my part, I had grown fond of the vulnerable Casino Royale Bond. Skyfall works partly as an apology for that incarnation. A shame really. I'll miss him.",7,2,6,18 December 2012
The Young Victoria," more royal drama
","The Brits do so love their celluloid royal myth-making. With The King's Speech bullying the awards season as I write, it seems the appetite for dramas on the human frailties of these oh-so-put-upon super-rich pampered layabouts has yet to be satiated.Dodgy socio-politics aside, this is an entertaining representation of the challenges faced by a young woman who most think of in terms of an icon of empire and grief. Emily Blunt, so erotic and chilling in My Summer of Love, is much more gritty here as the young princess stifled by the competing claims of wannabe advisers and mentors. Rupert Friend is given the daunting task of bringing to life a man most famous for dying on his wife. Albert's challenge is less to win her heart than to win her mind. In that he competes with Lord Melbourne (a perfectly restrained Paul Bettany), and that three-way intrigue throws up enough drama and twists to compel viewing. In wonderful counterpoint to this is Jim Broadbent as a mad King William, played full throttle for camp.Engaging enough as royal dramas go, the high production values and fine performances make Young Victoria worth seeing.",6,1,1,11 February 2011
Finding Neverland," the gentle Scotsman
","Powerful acting from an impressive array of names makes Finding Neverland a deeply moving film. The play Peter Pan is the shining light Barrie crafted to clear the shadows that clutter everyday life. The film, like the play, has a magical, translucent quality. Depp inhabits Barrie fully. The accent wobbles now and again with patches of Leith and Brigadoon breaking through, but Barrie's quest to show the child in us is the best of us is lovingly depicted in Depp's characterisation. Winslet, once again, rises to a challenging role. With outings like this and her stint in Little Children and Jude, she is inheriting the mantle of Streep as actress with the most range. We don't see enough of Julie Christie these days, but her rare gifts are all the more appreciated when so potently displayed. A great actress doing justice to fine writing - every word she utters is like cut glass. Hoffman cruises but does not disappoint in a role that seems to have been written for Jim Broadbent. And all credit to young Freddie Highmore - in such distinguished acting company, he elicits and earns our tears the most.An air of sadness orbits Barrie, his child-like behaviour a counter-point to it. His writing, his take on life, are triumphs of the human spirit. Elegiac, life-affirming, and timeless, the movie embodies the life and work it chronicles.",7,3,3,27 January 2009
In Bruges," Bruges will never look the same
","Poor old Bruges. I've never been there, but the name of the town will now forever evoke the collocation 'shithole' in my mind.Ray and Ken are two assassins sitting in out in Bruges after a botched job. 'Why Bruges?' asks Ray. Why indeed, the answer becoming clearer as the opening banter gives way to a darker undercurrent.Colin Farrell has never been better, playing the dumb-but-deadly Ray. The humour, though not always successful, is daring at times. Delightfully, the film makes no attempt to pander to an American audience. Delicate souls from the The States might come out of this one chest-thumping. Farrell's courting of a local film PA sets up most of the comedic moments, along with his reluctant mentoring by Gleeson. When called upon to provide some deeper emotions, Farrell rises to the occasion with aplomb.Gleeson, who has quietly built an incredible CV that includes Braveheart and Gangs of New York, is as dependable as ever. When the boss charges him with a repugnant task, his inner turmoil is all-too-evident.Both men, so used to acting in foreign accents, clearly revel in the exchanges in unadulterated Irish English.The casting of Ralph Fiennes as London hood Harry Waters is less successful. Fiennes appears late in what appears to be almost a cameo, but the holding back of his presence is somewhat undercut by featuring his visage prominently on the poster. His performance is too derivative of Ben Kingsley in Sexy Beast, and comes across as poor parody. He does share one of the films best moments with Gleeson in the pavement café, in a heated discussion revolving around an insult to his kids. But his character arc is forced, and his demise far too contrived, telegraphed as soon as the dwarf appears in school uniform.The running gags about dwarfs committing suicide, and the fighting prowess of the Vietnamese, are fresh and inventive. Gleeson and Farrell pitch their odd couple routine to a tee. In Bruges is both funny and moving and is not to be missed.",7,4,8,24 November 2008
Gravity," great effects, middling drama
","An astronaut with a tragic past finds herself alone in space after a catastrophic event engulfs her shuttle. It is only through facing certain death that she re-discovers the will to live.This is perhaps the most immersive, compelling use of the 3D format to date, though given that the format has failed to live up to its potential, that is not exactly high praise. The arena of space is thoroughly explored in 3D, and the swinging camera, extreme close ups and mammoth wide shots suitably convey the claustrophobia and agoraphobia that space must engender in astronauts. Sound design is also persuasively authentic, though the screeching soundtrack that cuts before silence in the open sequence could have been toned down a decibel or two. The special effects are top notch and clearly the film's biggest selling point. They unashamedly draw attention to themselves, which unfortunately means they work at the expense of the narrative.The plight and journey of Bullock's character would have been much more cathartic if more thought had been given to dialogue and tempo. Instead, she swings from one mini-disaster to another, Bullock apparently channeling Annie Porter doing her best to drive that bus in 'Speed.' Bullock's performance is engaging rather than outstanding. Clooney, on the other hand, is simply miscast. Like the effects he is too obviously cinematic, too much his cheeky, charming self, too much a reminder of the artifice and Hollywood-ness of it all. I suspect a more grounded character actor like Stanley Tucci might have excised this role of the frivolousness Clooney's presence inspires.Wonderful effects, a considered deployment of 3D, and a story that is enjoyable if not exactly sublime, make this a good outing for those who enjoy event cinema. Like Avatar, this film's weaknesses will come into sharp focus on DVD. And with a running time close to 90 minutes, the filmmakers should win awards for economy and self-discipline. Big screen cinema, but not one to re-visit.",6,1,2,29 December 2013
Unbreakable," gets better with each viewing
","David Dunn takes the train home from a job interview in New York. He rests his head against the window, looking tired and sad. A little girl stares at him through the seats in front. A hot woman sits down next to David, he slips off his wedding ring, and gives her some chat. But he comes on too strong, she feels uncomfortable, and she changes seat. David goes back to leaning against the window, encountering the reproachful stare of the little girl. This momentary failure of his moral compass is about to be surpassed by cataclysmic events.Unbreakable surprised and entertained me the first time I saw it. I am discovering it rewards you with repeat viewings. That opening scene is charged with sadness and regret and sets up so much of what we will discover about David's family life and a deeper inner turmoil he feels. It contrasts with another scene of family and children later in the film, after David has decided to embrace the gift he has. Sitting at the breakfast table, reunited emotionally once more with his wife, he shows his son a newspaper story, and silently mouths 'you were right' and 'don't tell Mum'. The son is vindicated, the father redeemed, and their tears are imbued with joy and yet restraint, as Mum is cooking two feet away and can never know.These quietly powerful moments reveal Shyamalan's powerful instincts as both writer and director. Scorsese said directors are 'managers of emotions,' Shyamalan's Unbreakable is a fine example of what that means. In the rescue scene, look at how the fact that the mother is dead is revealed. Look at how Dunn is rescued by the children he has just freed. From putting down the phone to Elijah, who tells him what he should do, through the rescue and breakfast reunion with his family, not a word of dialogue is spoken. That is a sign of a filmmaker with unerring instincts.Of course, 'unerring' is ironic in light of Shyamalan more recent outings. Signs, for example, takes the same constituent elements as Unbreakable and the end result is risible. But Unbreakable is a fine film that gets great performances from Willis and Jackson, two actors who tend to be only as good as the directors collaborating with them. Dunn's journey from self-denial twice over (after the car accident and then when initially faced with Elijah's question), through discovery, to full flowering and then horror at the manipulation he has fallen prey to, is subtly and movingly portrayed beat by beat by Willis.And the surprise ending, when you first encounter it, is breath-taking. On repeat viewing, you appreciate more the exhausting emotional changes Dunn has come through up to that moment right before they shake hands. The handshake becomes a thing of tragic beauty. Dunn's sadness, so long carried and at such cost, is cruelly thrust once more upon him.Shyamalan, since Lady in the Water, has been almost reduced to a figure of fun. It is a great pity - viewing Unbreakable makes you hope that he can recover form and produce more work of this calibre.",9,0,1,6 September 2008
Inglourious Basterds," less than vintage Tarantino
","It is schlock over substance in this WWII re-write from Tarantino. A film destined to be remembered solely for Christoph Waltz's chilling performance, this is a flabby outing from Tarantino that could have been so much better with some discipline in the editing room.The story hardly matters, being merely the backdrop for the standard fare of bitter banter exploding into violence that we have come to expect from Tarantino. Amusing at first sight, these sequences do not stand up to repeat viewing, as most people's return to Pulp Fiction will testify. In IB, the sequence in the basement pub, where the Gestapo agent is introduced to rack up the tension, extends interminably. The Bear Jew is given a big build up to no real effect - by now, we know how this particular episode is going to end, diluting the visceral effect. Waltz is dazzling, sinister and absurd, and manages to eclipse an inspired performance from Brad Pitt as Lt. Aldo Raine. There is a truly laugh-out-loud moment when Raine gives us a display of his linguistic dexterity with regard to Italian. Mélanie Laurent as Shosanna Dreyfus is plodding at best. At only one time did I experience a cinematic moment - when the film projects on to a wall of smoke.At times this feels like Valkyrie, The Comedy. For Tarantino, success has led to bigger budgets, and a corresponding lack of people prepared to honestly critique the film in the making, which is why the hunger and discipline are clearly absent from this film. The film is neither dull nor memorable, and that just isn't good enough from a filmmaker who has set the bar so high for himself.",5,7,15,27 November 2009
Bloody Sunday," the Greengrass take on recent UK history
","Greengrass brings his own brand of Cinema Verite to one of the UK's most notorious and shameful episodes in living memory. The iconic image of one brave soul waving a white hankie as he carries a wounded comrade is faithfully recreated, signaling the director's intent to give an interpretation, but an accurate interpretation, of the events that unfolded that day.The film's documentary-style works, just as it does in United 93. That film famously cast unknowns so as not to detract from the power of events. Here, Nesbitt's presence does at times seem jarring, but only in the early moments as he goes on to give an outstanding performance as the convivial Ivan, overwhelmed by a massacre no one could have predicted. The panic of the crowd, the echo of the shots being fired, the incredulity of the reactions - all are believable, and powerfully so. Were the Paras as deliberate and calculating as the film makes out? Isn't there a chance this was a few low IQ numbskulls whose ill-discipline got out of hand? The portrayal of the UK military in particular marks this film out as polemical in its handling of the material. However, given the obfuscation and emotion swirling around Bloody Sunday, how could it be otherwise? Anyone interested in history who thinks they can get it from a film should not be allowed to handle sharp cutlery. However, as a start point to generating curiosity about this event, the film is well-executed. Hopefully, it can be used to begin the social education of future generations as The Troubles start to slip from living memory. Greengrass has made this niche of film-making his own, and on this outing, that niche is in good hands.",8,2,6,16 January 2010
The Secret in Their Eyes," This is cinema
","Recently retired law-enforcer Esposito goes to see his old boss Irene to talk about a novel he wants to write, based on a disturbing rape-homicide case they worked together 25 years previously. His jottings stir memories and passions long neglected but never eradicated.Campanella's genre-mix, part period piece set in the Dirty War years of Argentina's late 20th-century police state, is a joyous emotional odyssey. The opening comedic tone is almost screwball comedy, giving way to the tragedy of youth and beauty mutilated in its prime, in a simple p.o.v shot timed to perfection that simply takes your breath away. The pacing of the film is exquisite, moving from sequence to sequence and shifting tonality in a manner both daring and effortless.There are incredible performances from the leads. Ricardo Darín as Esposito carries the weight of the world on his shoulders, despite the flirtatious and foul-mouthed quips. He is an essentially good man in a corrupt universe. Like James Stewart in Anatomy of a Murder, he has a drunk for a side-kick, irascible Sandoval (Guillermo Francella), a man whose aversion to phone conversations is matched by his penchant for self-annihilation. For him, redemption can only come in the form of sacrifice. Irene (Soledad Villamil) has her own regrets, centering on a parting at a train station, a sequence that book-ends the first two-thirds of the film, before the narrative moves on to explore if there truly is anything beyond the deceptive succor of memory.Despite the overtly political setting of the story, the film stays resolutely with the individual characters and their personal dilemmas. That is not to say it shirks the big questions. What is the sum total of a life? What does it mean to do the right thing in an amoral world? How do we go on knowing all we live for has been taken from us? Is there a punishment crueler than death? The film not only poses the questions, but dares to answer them, flooding the audience with catharsis in waves.I haven't seen a film this moving, so satisfyingly complex, so rooted in human frailty, since The Lives of Others. Watch The Secret in Their Eyes, watch it again, take your friends, talk about it, celebrate it, love it. Bravo.",10,3,5,26 August 2010
Black Book," unfortunate directing choices
","I'm never quite at ease when the Holocaust is used as set dressing for a genre film. If you are British and of my age, memories of the Holocaust come to you in black-and-white footage with Olivier providing the commentary and that oppressive 'World-at-War' music playing. Anything less than the gravitas of that programme seems insulting. Verhoeven isn't the subtlest of filmmakers, so I wasn't expecting surprises.The director says he likes to shock audiences, but I think all he does here is baffle them. The two moments that are most discussed are the full-frontal genitalia shot and the bucket of shite scene. Both are shown graphically when they could have been implied through reaction shots. Verhoeven claims to be following in a tradition of Dutch realism, but it seems to me he should be making documentaries. Why create a fiction and then puncture it with heavy-handed shock tactics? The naked shot would have been sexier if blocked around the male actor's reactions. The shite shot would have been more appalling if we only heard rather than saw what happened. Our minds can imagine more extreme emotion that filmmakers can compel. Verhoeven standing with a megaphone shouting: 'Go! Be aroused!' or 'Go! Be disgusted!' does not do it for me.The plot twists and turns and is over-cooked, the acting is above average, the score is overdone and intrusive. People arguing about historical accuracy is laughable: Anyone who decides to bone up on the Dutch resistance by watching a Hollywood movie shouldn't be let out alone.All in all, the in-your-face OTT style that works so well for the director in Total Recall is ungainly in this setting. If you want sex, intrigue and Nazis mixed in the perfect blend, check out Gloomy Sunday.",5,6,11,15 January 2008
500 Days of Summer," relationships comedy subverts the genre
","It would be misleading to call 500 a rom-com. At the very outset we are told, 'This is not a love story.' And so it proves to be, after a fashion, though it is not giving too much away to say boy gets girl, and girl gets boy.Tom is wannabee architect who has strayed from the path and needs to find his way back. Summer is a girl who does not believe in romantic love. Both will prove to be the essential catalyst for the other.So far so generic, but flashing in an ostensibly random fashion between the 500 days of Tom and Summer's relationship, the film achieves an episodic feel, while at the same time chronologically following the seduction, love gained, love lost, closure achieved pattern of so many other relationship movies. The jump-cutting between days also allows for some fun moments, most notably when Tom enters an elevator on top of the world and exits bitter and jaded. Kudos to Joseph Gordon-Levitt for the range of expressions he employs to pull this off. Zooey Deschanel stays mainly deadpan as Summer and it works, as the woman's thoughts and behaviour keep you slightly off-kilter.I smiled more than a few times. The song-and-dance sequence is ripped from Enchanted, and Bill Forsyth invented the older brother taking relationship advice from his primary-age sister in Gregory's Girl, but in a well-worn, tired genre, 500 manages to be fresh without appearing too contrived.",7,0,2,22 November 2009
Midnight in Paris," let us go then, you and I, when the evening is spread out against the sky
","Gil is a jaded screenwriter, materially successful but longing to write 'real' literature. He finds himself in Paris because his fiancé Inez is the daughter of a Republican philistine businessman and he happens to be in the town on an M&A venture. When Inez's insufferable friend from college shows up, Gil takes to wandering the streets alone at night. And then magic happens.Gil takes his novel to the luminaries of the Lost Generation and his life is affirmed. 'Prufock is my mantra' he declares at one point, and indeed the ennui of Elliot's poem is the barrier he must overcome if he is to break free and live a fulfilling life. Gerturde Stein advises him not to give into despair but to write in a way that provides an antidote to it. That is to be Gil's journey.Literature graduates will get the most fun from all the in-jokes. My favourite was Gil explaining to Man Ray, Dali and Bunuel that he has somehow time-slipped into their era. They see this as a matter of course, but he tells them 'That's because you're Surrealists.' Gil has been brought there because of a nagging dissatisfaction with the circumstances of his own present. His bride-to-be is sexy but shallow. His career is to serve up consumerist entertainment. The Jazz Age offers so much more, including a romantic alternative. But then those living in the 1920s seem to hanker for a Golden Age of their own...Owen Wilson as Gil is so much the Woody Allen character that his performance borders on impersonation. It works in a good way. The jokes come regularly, the film is modest in its intentions and honest about them. Quite simply, it is charming. This is the film the term 'a gem' was invented for.The fun continues when you get home and look up all the in-jokes and characters you weren't too sure about (the audience I saw it with didn't see too clued up on The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock - the pun on that poem's most famous line was met with silence). It is Allen at his whimsical best, and that is always worth seeing.",7,1,2,15 October 2011
Hotel Rwanda," profoundly moving
","Paul Rusesabagina is the human face of a conflict the West chose to ignore. In ages that pre-date multimedia, conflicts like this occurred and were forgotten because no one took the time to chronicle them. Our consciences no longer have that luxury. Nor, however, do we feel any moral compulsion to action. Especially when it comes to Africa. The continent is, after all, the heart of darkness, and we choose to believe that evil deeds that take place there are beyond our comprehension or powers to intervene.Hotel Rwanda gives the lie to that myth by showing the human faces of the genocide that took place. Rusesabagina's initial prevarication is admissible with the benefit of hindsight. Most of us, in similar circumstances, would choose 'not to get involved.' As filmcraft Hotel Rwanda excels by telling an African story. Nick Nolte is good as a compromised UN General, but it is Cheadle who shines brightest as a man called to act in a way nothing he has done previously suggests he can. This is not Africa through the prism of the white man's eyes. Africans commit, Africans fail to act, and Africans rise above in an African conflict. The West is complicit, historically and contemporaneously, but responsibility for the horrific acts that are let loose ultimately belong to Africans. As do the plaudits for the heroism.Hotel Rwanda is an important film, a fine film, that humanises and lays prosaic an ugly chapter in recent human history few of us chose to contemplate or condemn. Tense, shocking and cathartic in equal measure, it will live to do for the Rwandan conflict what The Killing Fields did for Cambodia.",9,0,0,12 October 2008
Once," making music with the Irish, both traditional and new
","Breath-taking. Life affirming. Are there any superlatives left unwritten for this film? A Dublin busker comes across a Czech woman selling flowers and The Big Issue. She has a broken Hoover; his Dad knows how to fix such appliances. He writes his own songs; she has access to the pianos in a musical instrument shop. And a flair for making canny business deals. His heart has been broken, her dreams have been severely corrupted by life's realities. We never know their names. But more importantly we get to know their music.Like Before Sunrise, this film takes two wanderers and anchors them for a short, magical time in each other, before setting them apart once more. Like Hedwig, it weaves a simple story around some great songs. But Once is a stand-alone film, an absorbing, moving tale, full of great music, interesting characters, and acutely observed moments. At one point the busker plays his demo tape to his Dad as a prelude to leaving home. Dad loves the music, and practically shoves him out the door. His heart is breaking with love and pride, but it is all left unsaid. The girl makes one declaration in Czech that says it all (you'll look it up - everyone does). That the busker has no idea what she said is symbolic of what makes this film so delicious.If there is a God, all films will be like this from now on.",10,2,5,16 March 2009
The Town," classy crime thriller
","Following Gone. Baby Gone, the re-invention of Ben Affleck continues apace with this highly satisfying crime thriller set in and encapsulating the Boston neighbourhood of Charlestown. Affleck is Doug, the hood with a heart of gold, the brains of a crew that includes loose canon James. When he falls for a bank clerk from one of his raids, and then inserts himself in her day-to-day life, the consequences prove lethal.The plot complicates and unravels deliciously, but it is the characters and their intertwining neuroses that keep your attention here. Doug is cut from the same cloth as De Niro's character in Heat, a man whose moral compass is askew with regard to social mores, but rigid within the terms of his own world. James, on the other hand, is Begbie from Trainspotting, or Edward Norton in Rounders, a walking liability whose moral code, if he has one, is known only to himself. The Town may lack originality, but it pays off in spades in terms of genre expectation. Doug's motivations are tied up with not wanting to be his Dad (the ever-competent Chris Cooper), fretting about abandonment by Mum at the age of six, and carrying the regret of failing to be a contender when pro ice hockey gave him a shot.Love interest Clare (Rebecca Hall) has family ghosts of hero own to deal with. Doug and Clare meet across the soiled socks in the laundromat, a low-key affecting scene that Affleck controls with aplomb. The critics who in recent years called him washed up as an actor must be hiding behind the couch.The only wobble is Pete Postlehwaite as the local crime kingpin, in his ultimate role, oozing his usual visual charisma but making an unfortunate accent choice. The mother storyline, also, resolves in a manner you will see coming from miles away.The Boston locality is utilized evocatively, and the whole thing moves along with pace and verve. Affleck has proved himself an astute filmmaker in recent years. Good to have him back.",8,3,4,11 February 2011
Closer," we're happy, aren't we?
","Dan makes eye contact with Alice on the street. They fall in love and end up living together, through a brief detour to the emergency room. Larry and Anna are the victims of a practical joke, a potentially illicit encounter becoming acute public embarrassment. But Larry's rough charm wins through and Anna is won over. Or is she?Patrick Marber's screenplay of his own play wears its stage origins on its sleeve. Scenes take place in one room, with little or no inter-cutting between locations. People talk a lot. But it works, because the emotions seem authentic, and the observations acute. The main device is not to lead up to and reveal major decisions, but to join the action when the characters are dealing with the consequences of that decision. You have to pay attention as often you find yourself playing catch-up with the characters.Julia Roberts is as impressive as she has ever been as depressive Anna. Larry figures out she can only be happy by making herself unhappy, and that is the key to his victory. It is the antagonism between the two males that drives the drama. 'I could take him in a scrap' says Larry, and his confidence is not misplaced. Natalie Portman as Alice is woman with a past, one she is forced to re-visit when Dan's cruelty reaches its zenith. She has her own battle with misanthropic Dan to sort out. You can see why the actors were attracted to this - Marber's script calls on them to act and react, to the petty and stupendous cruelties that all of us recognise from our own lives. They do the material ample justice. Nichols directs unobtrusively, perhaps pipped for a medal here by writer, actors, and editor. Compulsive viewing, though one to watch with the love of your life.",Null,2,4,2 September 2011
Battleship Potemkin," not watching a movie but assessing history
","It has no doubt been years, maybe decades, since anyone came to this movie cold. Film buffs, film school students and historians are obliged to view it, compelled to tick it off on their Viewing List so they can talk about the evolution of varying shot size, juxtaposition, and the Odessa Steps sequence. In fact, my Viewing List recommended watching the Odessa Steps sequence only.An attempt to access the film in terms of empathy for characters, emotional catharsis, or intellectual stimulation, is fraught with difficulty. The film is silent, foreign, ancient and propagandist. Yes, the shot flow, when analysed, reveals significant steps in the evolution of cinema narrative. However, The Boneshaker Bicycle was an important step in the development of bikes, but I wouldn't want to ride one. BP no doubt thrilled its contemporary audience, and film theorists can tell us why it is important. Personally, it just felt too far away in time for me to embrace it.An important film, yes; but not a wonderful one.",Null,0,0,28 October 2008
Taxi Driver," the film Scorcese will be remembered for
","Almost four decades since Taxi Driver was first released, and after countless critiques and analyzes, it is still startling to watch this film and be impacted by the beauty and brutality it portrays. From that opening moment when the cab bursts through the cloud of steam rushing up from the depths, the score emphatically invoking a sense of rising dread, we are transported to another world that is both convincingly seventies New York, and its psychological rendering through the scopophilic lens of a deranged mind.The violence, filth and profanity so searingly presented are well-documented, less remarked is the quiet moments that work in counter-point to Bickle's inexorable decline. Most memorable is his initial seduction of Betsy, the ostensible honesty of his flirtation both seductive and horrific. Shepherd's contribution to this masterpiece has been related historically in terms of how tough the shoot was for her facing the hostility of Scorcese and De Niro, but in this scene she is no lightweight; a woman told she is lonely and wanting, but confident enough not to dismiss the messenger out of hand. It is only her genuine response at this moment that makes the poignant last scene of the film pay off so handsomely.The careers of De Niro, Foster and Scorcese went stellar after this, deservedly so, all three arguably failing to match this apotheosis in their careers (though Scorcese certainly has the best claim to counter that argument with Goodfellas). Direction, acting, music, editing and effects seldom gel so well in creating an emotionally complex tale. Hailed as a masterpiece, and deservedly so.",10,0,0,6 June 2010
Capote," the artist as voyeur
","Never meet your heroes, we are told, as they will invariably disappoint. Any Truman Capote fans will testify to the veracity of that after this chilling account of Capote's process of researching his non-fiction work, In Cold Blood. Hoffman has been lauded for his portrayal of the writer, another success in the niche of acting as impersonation that has proliferated in recent years (Ali, Ray, The Hours, Walk the Line, The Aviator...). The horror of the crime, the self-absorption of the writer, the disdain of the killers - this is a story that appears to lack redemption and offer up only squalor. The film rises above that material by focusing on the symbiotic relationship of Capote and Perry Smith, two incomplete, emotionally stunted individuals, feeding their mutual need for as long as they can make it last. Clifton Collins Jr. matches Hoffman's performance with chill and vulnerability as the naive but ruthless Smith. The film's triumph is to have you rooting for Smith against the antagonistic Capote. When Capote finally gets what he wants - a full confession from Smith - the irony is that the raw horror of it breaks him, forcing him to confront his own amorality. The quiet power of the killer forgiving the artist at the climax is stunning. This is a complex film, disturbing, that dares to challenge big themes, and rewards greatly.",9,1,2,12 January 2009
Lost in Translation," lost in transition
","Travelling for work, staying in cookie-cutter hotel rooms, negotiating soul-crushing airport transit lounges, enduring forced bonhomie in stilted conversations with people we hope never to see again...Modern working life alienates and dehumanizes us on distant shores. At times like this, we may reach out and take succor in a human connection that could only be forged in such circumstances. Lost in Translation depicts one such connection.Charlotte and Bob meet in Japan. Some aspects of that arena are conveyed in ludicrous, hilarious detail - the uninvolved translator, the kitschy hotel lounge, the indecipherable menu. Other details are less well conveyed, such as a cringe-inducing and borderline racist depiction of a Japanese call girl. But the fact is this could be Dubai, or Bangkok, or Mexico City. Two troubled individuals wash up in an unfamiliar and alien land without the will or skills to navigate their way through. The landscape they explore is their own under-realised lives. They give each other the strength to go on.Subtle but powerful performances from the two leads, and an understated but steady hand from Coppola, make this a fine achievement. Some wonderful comic moments, especially a hospital encounter between Murray and a local that was surely ad-libbed, are finely balanced with pathos and emotional depth. One to savour.",9,1,1,16 December 2013
Gone Baby Gone," how are you feeling right now?
","A child goes missing. Her aunt is more concerned than her mother, and contacts police, media - and two private detectives. The detectives are more accurately debt collectors, but they know 'the neighbourhood,' and work this to gain the grudging respect of the police they liaise with. Except something is not quite right...Casey Affleck again shows his youthful looks belie an acting maturity. Matched up with Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman, he more than holds his own when the other two are performing at the top of their game. The case gets closed and PI Patrick somehow gets on with his life, till a once suspected paedophile enters his orbit, and that encounter forces him to re-visit the missing child case. He asks questions of everyone, but ultimately the toughest questions are the ones he is forced to ask himself.Ben Affleck's debuts with aplomb. There is a slight pacing problem that kicks in when Harris and Casey share a bottle of rum outside the hospital in an overlong dialogue scene, but hell, that is small potatoes compared to the big questions and complex plotting this film offers up. This is a film that does not condescend to its audience; the choices Patrick makes seem authentic and the consequences show up in suitable shades of grey. A moving and deeply satisfying film, that demands repeat viewing.",9,1,2,29 November 2011
Burn After Reading," Burn after watching
","OK, the film is not as bad as the summary heading would suggest, but this is still pretty tepid fare from filmmakers from whom we have come to expect more.Two fitness trainers come upon a forgotten CD-R containing what they believe to be classified information. They set about blackmailing the author, CIA black sheep Cox, who quickly realises they are out of their depth and allows his own demons to wreak vengeance on these ill-prepared charlatans. Meanwhile Cox's wife is at it with his sex-obsessed best mate.It's all very convoluted and tawdry, but it doesn't matter, because the bottom line is - there is no one to like in this film. The writers, the directors, the actors - no one goes out of their way to create an ounce of empathy for any one of the God-forsaken beings who inhabit this narrative. The Hardbodies manager comes closest, but even he is so wimpy and unassertive that his demise barely registers. Pitt and Clooney are clearly in contempt of the men they portray. They have enough craft to cruise through the role, but their attitude towards the men they represent is contemptible.It is all very amusing, slick and fast-paced, but in the words of the final on-screen character - what did we learn? His answer is: Not to do it again. I hope the Coens were listening.",5,3,8,10 February 2009
Hugo," lost boy fixes broken man
","I took my two kids, 10 and 8, to see this tonight, thinking I like Scorsese and Ben Kingsley, they like 3D and child leads, so we'll all be happy.A straight tale about two kids from opposite side of the tracks who go off on a robot-building adventure would have really entertained my children. A straight telling of the story of Georges Méliès and his contribution to the early days of cinema, filtered through the Scorsese aesthetic, would have really entertained me. Instead, what we get in Hugo is neither one nor the other, and so it is all a bit flat and lifeless. There is the heavy-handed morality tale element that no Hollywood film can travel without, this time about a broken boy fixing a broken automaton in order to heal an old's man's' broken spirit so he can love life again... It is layered on a bit thick, tipping the story over into gooey sentimentality.And Sacha Baron Cohen is criminally under-used.The opening sequence does show a heightened awareness of how to use 3D, and this element is kept up throughout. We know Scorsese loves cinema, but his attempted homage here is at the expense of emotional power in the narrative. It was the same failing that de-railed Gangs of New York, the attempt to incorporate reverence for history undermining the drive and pace of the storyline.I left the theatre admiring the photography, and re-writing the script in my head.",5,7,13,15 December 2011
Wanted," McAvoy falls from grace
","James McAvoy hits a career setback in this disjointed, unoriginal action flick about a fraternity of assassin weavers.Wesley struggles in the rat race day after day, hiding from hideous boss Janice in his cubicle, popping pills for anxiety while aware that his girlfriend and best mate are at it behind his back.This is an unlikely start for a superhero, but Wesley discovers he is descended from a line of super-assassins who go back a millennium. He undertakes training in order to kill the rogue assassin who shot his own father.Pretty quickly, the inconsistencies and coincidences seep in and sink this film. The assassins' victims are chosen by a loom. No explanation given. The assassins heal their wounds by bathing in a magical fluid. No explanation given. They are capable of gravity-defying feats. No... you get the idea.In a perhaps unintended irony, David O'Hara is presented as McAvoy's father, both actors struggling to suppress their Scottish accents under an American one. The Fraternity can defy physics, but linguistics seems to defeat them. What is it about Scottish male actors that they cannot master an American accent? (The guilty include Brian Cox, Sean Connery, John Hannah, Ewan McGregor... Kelly Macdonald shows the women are different).It is all very flat and unconvincing. WHY did the loom start to name the Fraternity as targets? If they were a problem, why didn't the loom just name itself for destruction? What brings about Jolie's change of heart at the end? The comedy is tepid, the 'You're the man' line being a typical example. All in all, a bit of a waste of time.",2,1,3,24 November 2008
Control," absorbing portrait of a talented but torn individual
","Before Morrissey and The Smiths, there was Ian Curtis and Joy Division. Their music was already retro by the time I was old enough to buy my own records; I had a vague awareness of Love Will Tear Us Apart as a decent track by a band I wasn't particularly enamored with. Although scenes of Joy Division performing and recording are copious in this film, the good news is you don't have to be a fan of the music to appreciate this assured debut from photographer Corbijn.Fine acting and subtle helming make this an above-par cinema experience. Samantha Morton is spell-binding, utterly convincing as a teenage schoolgirl fumbling her way through relationships with sulky, spotty boys. A 30-year old seasoned actress giving such an utterly convincing portrayal of pubescent naiveté and guile is quite a triumph. Sam Riley encapsulates the ill-fated Curtis. The problem with biopics is we often bring our own knowledge and intimacy with the subject to the performance, daring the actor to try and push that aside. In recent years, we have seen some take up that challenge magnificently (e.g. Ali, Capote, Ray, The Queen), while other have fallen short (Goodbye Bifana). I came to Control unencumbered by any emotional attachment to, or photographic memories of, Ian Curtis, but I believed in this portrayal of a talented, poetic, troubled, conscientious lead singer of a 70s band. I do have visceral memories of 1970s Britain that the film evoked wonderfully. Ford Cortinas, flares, record players, boys in make up... Corbijn fills the frame with stark geometric lines (most obviously in exterior shots of council house high rises), conjuring up the bleakness and isolation of the times. Jim Callaghan and the Winter of Discontent are never mentioned, but they permeate every shot. There is a deft economy in dialogue; marriage is mentioned, and then happens, Ian talks about joining a band, and then sings at their gig. Given Corbijn's CV you would expect competent framing; that he is able to handle shot flow so well proves he is as good a director as he is photographer.Joy Division and Ian Curtis are iconic figures in 70s and 80s Britain, pioneers in the Manchester sound and an indispensable part of the soundtrack that defines those times. The film pays off as a thumbnail portrait of one aspect of Britain's recent cultural history. More importantly, it succeeds as cinema, offering a nuanced tale of one man's demise that will resonate with audiences non-cognisant with the UKs musical heritage.",8,1,1,9 January 2010
Tropic Thunder," comedy, fast and furious, and plenty of it
","A bunch of prissy actors making a Vietnam War movie are thrown into guerrilla-style movie-making by their put-upon director. A series of freak accidents sees them fighting heavily-armed heroin producers in the Golden Triangle of South-east Asia.Now, having said that, this film needs a plot outline like Bill Gates needs a handout. The comedy is hit-and-miss, but comes so fast, and in such quantity, that you never need to dwell on the dull moments. Audiences will be discussing their favourite lines for years to come. Personally, pretty much everything that came out of Robert Downey Jr. as a method-obsessed Aussie star (taking the pish out of Russel Crowe may be the bravest decision Stiller made in this film) was a gem, but 'I don't read scripts, scripts read me' takes some beating. Stiller is always better when reacting than acting. Here, he tries to be the funny one too often, and so gets little chance to do what he does best. Jack Black is a disappointment, the over-acting that served him so well in School of Rock is cringe-inducing here.It is not as cynical as The Player, or as playful as Bowfinger, but TT finds its niche in the genre of Hollywood parodies based on its shotgun approach. The comedy works best when it comes from the interplay of characters - Lazarus and Alpa Chino especially. It is less funny when parodying well-known scenes from Platoon, Apocalypse Now and bizarrely, Close Encounters. Tom Cruise does outstanding work as the ego-maniacal producer, but that particular archetype is slightly too well-worn. Cruise does well with a familiar type, rather than breaking new ground.TT needs more than one viewing to appreciate all the gags. I for one will go back to it.",7,1,2,2 November 2008
Enchanted," Yeah, I was enchanted, too
","I went along at the insistence of my seven-year-old daughter, who saw the trailers on the Disney channel. On a wet bank holiday Thursday, there wasn't a lot else to do. Entering the theatre, I thought, 'Grin and bear it.' Oh well, call me Grumpy... What a cracking little film! How could they NOT give a Best Supporting Rodent award to that chipmunk? The mime is the funniest thing I have seen in ages. James Marsden as the prince raises at least a smile in every scene he appears in - his 'peasants' line never gets old. I laughed, and I cried, too - I can't remember WHY now, but it is that kind of film, you get totally caught up in it. There were even gasps from the audience I watched it with (when the pigeon gets snackish...).I thought Stardust was very well done and now Enchanted comes along and possibly tops it in the feel-good stakes. Either Hollywood is getting much better at this stuff, or I am mellowing in my old age.",9,2,3,20 March 2008
No Country for Old Men," bewitching, profound, immortal
","Are there any superlatives left for this film? The Coen Brothers take mighty risks in adapting McCarthy's nihilistic novel for the screen. Those of us who are Beginning-Middle-End type film-goers will be slapped around the head by the iconoclastic narrative structure of this film. And yet there are two types of film that deserve the mantle of greatness; those that have you leave the theatre asking questions, and those, not unrelated, that make you want to watch again. No Country is both.Historians, with the benefit of hindsight, will look back and tell us that unforgiving wars, peak oil, and/or economic uncertainty gave rise to such bleak visions. Locked in the present, we can only gaze upon such images and think, 'Yes, this is how it is is.' I hated the ending. I invested so much in Llewelyn Moss, and felt cheated. I did not want to spend time beyond his demise with Chigurh. But I am open to the thought that my investment may have been misguided. The Coens clearly invite you to look again. I will. It is a privilege to be there when artists take their work to the next level. No Country has pushed the boundaries of film-making. A product of its time, or timeless? Future generations will decide.",9,3,6,7 July 2008
District 9," the humanity of prawns
","A blend of wry comedy, social critique and sci-fi, District 9 is a genre hybrid that works on every level. A deceptively simple script weaves in its references to apartheid specifically and prejudice generally in a subtle but recognizable manner. However, that is more a motif than central concern in this character-driven tale of one man's journey to discover his own humanity through forging a connection with... well, a large prawn.Containing acceptable and unobtrusive CGI, and decent action sequences, the film's stand-out element is the performance by Sharlto Copley as Wikus Van De Merwe. A low-level official catapulted through nepotism to a status he is ill-equipped to handle, Wikus finds himself infected by alien technology to the point where his very existence is threatened.And that is as much as you need to know, because like many viewers, I came to District 9 with certain expectations induced by the hype, but found it refreshingly different. A judicious splash of humour is threaded through, mostly regarding sex with ugly aliens (and the aliens are protected by 'human rights' groups), and humane feeling is with the aliens, of course. In the longer term, this film may just cause a seismic genre shift. After District 9, it may be difficult to take seriously yet another film that has a spaceship settle on Manhattan as its final destination. Expect the likes of Bogota, Tripoli, Kobe and Glasgow to be the future dropping-off points.Fresh, entertaining, moving and socially relevant, District 9 is a multi-layered film that even gets away with an ending mostly designed to set up a sequel. Down and dirty sci-fi at its best.",8,0,2,12 February 2010
The Number 23," pitiful ending
","If you have seen Johnny Depp's Secret Window, De Niro in Hide & Seek, Memento or The Machinist, then you have seen The Number 23. I enjoyed the acting, but found the script a bit too self-important. The film was atmospheric enough, but the ending just did not pay-off. My first thought was, 'Again?' The whole exposition that is then relayed is also less-than- convincing. Why would anyone go on a date with, let alone marry, someone they see leaving an insane asylum? Also, I couldn't quite figure out the reason why the wife and doctor went to such lengths to cover up for the protagonist. Anyone who hasn't seen the above films will find this an enjoyable DVD to rent. In terms of current trends in film-making, however, it comes across as tired and formulaic. I keep hearing this rumour that Hollywood has run out of ideas. On the strength of this showing, there may be some substance to it.",4,2,3,19 July 2007
The Lives of Others," it's for me... and you, and everyone
","A soulless Stasi agent goes about his work diligently and thoroughly, training fledgling agents in the various techniques required to strip their fellow citizens of their humanity. His life is disrupted when the humanity of one of the citizens under his surveillance seeps under his skin...This is a life-affirming piece, delicately and lovingly charting the journey of one man from joyless cog in the wheel of a tyrannical state system, to collaborator in a rebellion based on personal freedom and dignity. The setting is East Germany before the fall of the wall, but the message ripples out to all individuals who feel their society offers them a life less dignified than they deserve.I hesitate to say any more for fear of despoiling a cinematic experience you should come to unencumbered by the biases of any particular reviewer. You will be moved deeply by this film, and come away feeling better about your life. What other recommendation do you need? See it.",10,5,6,7 January 2009
The Game," Hollywoood-style entertainment at its best
","Nicholas Van Orten is a billionaire who has forgotten how to enjoy himself, and how to connect with anyone else. An ex-wife with whom he has little or no contact, a younger prodigal brother, and memories of a father who took his own life are the only human points of contact in his orbit. Pretty poor fare, and his plight is hardly going to top anyone's sympathy list.Fincher gives the whole thing high production values and a sinister sheen, adding pace and intrigue throughout. He makes excellent use of shadows and light, casting Van Orton's home is a particularly frosty hue. The story moves along briskly and economically, Van Orten fighting to retain control (his biggest fear being to lose control) of a situation that escalates rapidly in a series of adrenaline rushes. The sleek cars, expensive suits and chrome office buildings give way to Mexican dirt and dust and a bus ride with chickens. And that is the game just starting.Michael Douglas may lack range, but he can match any actor alive in the sneering stakes. Sean Penn is a nice counterpoint, rash and unruly but somehow charming with it.This isn't a film with a message (except for the inevitable thinly-disguised morality tale element Hollywood so often insists on), and you probably won't watch it twice. But for slick, high paced entertainment that keeps you guessing till the end, this is a great one-off film.",8,4,6,26 October 2008
Unknown," good set up undercut by awful pay off
","Unknown proves the old adage that a film can never be better than its script. And this is a bad script.A man awakens from a 4-day coma to find an imposter has taken over his life. He sets about finding out why he has been replaced, but the answer is not what he expects.The film does a good job of building intrigue in the first hour, largely aided by the acting quality of Liam Neeson and the quality character actors he is surrounded by, notably Bruno Ganz as a jaded post-war relic, and Frank Langella who proves the catalyst for the third act.Despite Langella's acting kudos, it is his arrival that derails any sense of plausibility and cathartic pay off this story might have offered up. Langella, we are led to believe, heads a crack unit of black-ops agents who are so good their very existence has yet to be proved.With that information now available, we start to backtrack to the beginning of the action and are expected to believe that these crack agents (a) forgot their briefcase at the airport, the one containing all their IDs and money (b) decided to go back and get it without telling his colleague what he was doing (and why not just PHONE the airport and have it sent to the hotel?) (c) had the foresight to have a back-up in place for their male agent, but neglected to have a back-up for the female agent (d) sent an agent to the hospital to kill one of his own in a way that would not raise suspicion i.e. injecting something into his drip - and yet the same assassin kills two hospital employees by breaking their necks, which might raise some suspicion... (e) has another of their top agents put herself in front of a bomb because of some half-cocked notion that her photo will connect her to said bomb...The incongruities pile up to sink this film faster than Neeson's second taxi. Clearly conceived as a Bourne rip-off, this suffers from the lack of attention to detail that plagues many mercenary commercial movies. All in all, a bit of an insult to the intelligence.",2,1,1,4 November 2012
The Hurt Locker," War is a drug
","When new bomb disposal expert and team leader James shows up, his reckless abandon to his task garners the respect and awe of his comrades, while instilling others with fear and repugnance. James, we realise, is in it for the kicks, regardless of the consequences.If you can come to The Hurt Locker unencumbered by the hype the film carries around like so much over-stuffed baggage, you will enjoy a tense, rambunctious action movie about male bonding in extreme circumstances. There is no polemic here in the style of Green Zone: Iraq just happens to be the war of the moment, but you could just as easily take the theme of male addiction to thrill-seeking and set it in any combat zone. Yes, there is the usual Uncle Sam machismo shamelessly on parade, and the collateral characterisation of Arab characters. This reaches its zenith when one unfortunate local finds himself strapped with a bomb that looks beyond defusing. 'He is a family man with four children' plead his compatriots. Why is this appeal always favoured by filmmakers? Are single, childless Arab men really so disposable? Still, the patriotic zeal does not smother the film the way it does others (e.g. Black Hawk Down), and the pacing and interpersonal conflicts are enough to keep you hooked from beginning to end.There are some nice little touches, especially in James ill-fated attachment to a local street kid. Ralph Fiennes and David Morse contribute excellent cameos, and there is a sequence involving cat-and-mouse with a sniper that is as powerful as it is understated.'War is a Drug' states the opening title, and the rest of the narrative does little more than elaborate on that theme. Good Hollywood style entertainment, but nothing more.",7,2,4,22 October 2010
Children of Men," over-hyped?
","If I had to sum up Children of Men in one word, it would be... flat. I liked an awful lot of things in this movie. Post-apocalyptic is probably my favourite genre. Michael Caine is a revelation, the quintessential British hero, a podgy guy in an armchair wearing a cardigan. I shed tears when Theo escorts Kee and her baby down the stairs in a war zone, the baby's cries causing a lull in the fighting. Julianne Moore and Clive Owen excel in their roles. The production design is spot on, based on the theme 'Only Britain could be this crap.' The Greenpeace, Guantanomo, Tate Modern satirical moments were slightly annoying but not intrusive. So why did I not get more from this film? I can only guess that it failed to live up to my expectations. I had heard so much about this film, the trailer looked fantastic, but Theo's journey was less than compelling. Perhaps it was too much exposition. Michael Caine's rendering of the story of Theo's son's demise felt a bit clumsy. The turning point for Theo is when Kee tells him she believes he is the only one she should trust, but this key moment is pitched low-key. It is a good film, but it could have been great. In sum, a bit of a missed opportunity.",6,3,6,20 April 2007
Garden State," cute
","Large comes home for his mother's funeral, catches up with old friends and meets a special new one. Simple stuff that is never overblown. In fact, the tone and economy of the treatment raise the film above the usual rites-of-passage finding yourself fare that, on the surface, the film resembles in many ways.Garden State is funny and touching for the first two-thirds of the film. The funny moments revolve around lines, often deadpan, that have you smiling long after the film is finished. 'Silent Velcro. You lucky bastard' may be my favourite, followed by 'I still can't believe you are not retarded.' Large accepts his old friends for what they are, be it grave robber or minted delinquent. He can't quite figure out what to do about his repressed Dad, and he is a bit mixed up when love hits him right on the back of grief. He gets there, in a slow, low-key journey of self-discovery that is fairly convincing and entertaining to go along with.The films' flaws are the all-too-easy ways Large falls back in with his old mates, especially when it is revealed how abruptly and traumatically he was wrenched away from them. In the last 20 minutes the film has to tie up its romance plot line and dutifully ticks off the boxes, though it feels as if the real meat of the film has been left behind. Still, this is a movie that will resonate deeper with twentysomethings facing some of the same issues as the protagonist. For the rest of us, it is a cut-above film that will bring a smile to your face.",7,0,1,7 August 2008
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," lean, stylish, taught and cerebral
","Edmund Burke's admonition, 'All it takes for evil to thrive is for good men and women to do nothing,' is one theme underlying this depiction of an unsettling episode in US 20th century history. However, given the events shaping the early 21st century, another guiding theme would seem to be Santayana's, 'Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.' Shining light on the past to illustrate the present could easily lead to celluloid finger-wagging, but Clooney's direction and the acting by the principles excels in this wonderful film that gives food for thought while never sacrificing character and story. The combination of tight close-ups, black and white photography and library footage gives the film an authentic 1950s feel, not just in art direction but in terms of the claustrophobic atmosphere produced by the Senate committee hearings. Wry parody on cigarette advertising adds humour, as do cultural references to contemporary figures such as Liberace, waxing lyrical on the search for the right girl. All of these are interesting, well-integrated tangents to the main story, the courage required to face up to political power. David Strathairn as Murrow never falters, combining rapier-like wit, intelligence and articulateness with moments of self-doubt and genuine fear. This is an unflinchingly political film, the likes of which are too few and far between. The story works purely as a re-telling of events that took place a lifetime ago. However, it also asks the question, where are the Murrows who will stand up to present-day demagogues? Contemplating the answer to that question is bleaker than the events portrayed therein. Good night and good luck, indeed.",9,0,1,3 November 2007
Brave," Love Scotland. Love Pixar. Not too keen on this.
","'Brave' has been taking some hits, especially since garnering an undeserved Oscar, and it is not hard to see why. By Pixar's own high standards, and especially their famed commitment to storytelling, this film fails to engage with its audience. My kids came out of Toy Story and Monsters Inc saying 'Wow', but reacted to Brave with 's'awright.' That clinches it for me.The problem lies in the supernatural element that compromises character-driven action. Nemo's father goes on a journey that forces him to face his fears. He overcomes his challenges by compassion and daring. Merida goes on a journey instigated by, and resolved with the help of, Will O' the Wisp. This deus ex machina element robs Brave of the cathartic power previous Pixar films have achieved.The visual comedy was also rather sporadic and subdued. A few clichéd pokes at Scotland were unimaginative; haggis as inedible, no pants under kilts - moments that also passed children by. The suitor with the incomprehensible accent raised a smile with us, but we've had more and better laughs with Pixar in the past.Back to basics, Pixar people.",5,4,6,18 March 2013
The Adjustment Bureau," ropey
","A young man running for the US Senate meets a mysterious, charismatic woman on the night he loses the election. He falls in love instantly, but higher powers have decreed they cannot be together, and set out to keep them apart.Great acting talent compels you to the first two thirds of this movie, but the inherent promise is of a great pay-off, and instead we get a damp squib. Matt Damon plays David Norris as a humanised Bourne, a man driven to seek something out and fairly unstoppable in his insistence. Emily Blunt is Elise, and as usual lights up the screen with her naturalism. I first came across her in My Summer of Love, and was recently impressed with her in My Sister's Sister. Yet again, as in Salmon Fishing in the Yemen, she takes a very average script and raises it up a notch. I think I may be in love with her. Anthony Mackie plays the near-omnipotent others beings as human and fallible, which makes it all the more interesting - think a down-to-earth version of Wings of Desire. But what lets this movie down is that the premise is intellectually unsatisfying. It is laid out in its starkest terms by Terence Stamp as Thompson in his denial of free will. Apparently, anything noteworthy human kind has achieved has been due to the guiding hand of these higher powers, and anything dark - wars, genocide, environmental damage - is our own poor fault. So free will was an experiment that failed, and has been replaced with the illusion of free will.Except... David and Elise have a love so strong, so unprecedented, that they have caused the higher powers to re-think the whole grand scheme.Now, David and Elise have chemistry, but they aren't Romeo and Juliet, or Anthony and Cleopatra. They're not even Thelma and Louise. They're more Jack and Rose. So it is a hard sell to say these two have a love unprecedented in human history. And to base the ending, and so the whole film, on having the audience buy into that.So go along to Adjustment Bureau for the ride, but don't get your hopes up about the destination.",4,2,2,13 October 2012
Prisoners," atmospheric but slightly beguiling
","Aaron Guzikowski fashions a deliciously twisty script that keeps you engaged for the lengthy running time of this film. With Jake Gyllenhaal as a broody and forceful guide through the mystery, and Hugh Jackman invading Michael Shannon territory as a regular guy suddenly capable of terrible acts, there is a lot to enjoy in this cerebral thriller.Two little girls go missing while their families enjoy a Thanksgiving dinner. One father, Keller (Hugh Jackman), lets his frustration with events overtake him and decides to beat information out of the initial suspect. The moral dilemma of the film hinges on the fact that in order to stop the victimization of the innocent, Keller may be victimizing the innocent.The actors do the script justice, Terrence Howard as Franklin, the other father, being as soppy and indecisive as Keller is driven and unrelenting. Melissa Leo as Holly Jones displays a quiet power, the rock that can resist the crashing wave that is Keller's rage.As finely crafted as the script is, there are a few refrigerator questions, and some other questions that niggle before leaving the theatre. Detective Loki seems to be the only cop working the case. Actions by other cops are inferred, but the lack of briefings and incident room activity seems off-beat. Paul Dano as Alex Jones brings his calling card creepiness to the show, but this character is the most problematic, saying - or not saying - only what is required to complicate the plot in the most fiendish of ways. In the end, the characterisation here veers away from plausible toward mechanistic. His initial comment that lights Keller's touchpaper seems, on reflection, a shade too conveniently timed and phrased.These quibbles aside, it is refreshing to encounter a script that forces you to pay attention rather than spoon-feeding information, and has you asking questions and discussing the story, and the themes it invokes, for days after. Guzikowski is a screenwriter to watch out for.",7,1,2,11 June 2014
Into the Wild," we are not alone
","Like most readers of the Krakauer book, the news that a Hollywood production of this tale was in the offing made me feel something akin to dread. The book describes a troubled young man, perhaps a genius, who perversely has a life-changing effect on practically everyone he meets, but may have been, at heart, a misanthrope. Krakauer makes sure his reader is aware that, despite his meticulous research, we are dealing with educated guesswork. The plot synopsis on IMDb states: 'Along the way, Christopher encounters a series of characters that shape his life.' This is simply wrong. The fact is these people were shaped by Chris, but failed to influence him in any fundamental way that would divert him from his ill-fated course. Why Chris did what he did is ultimately unknowable.Sean Penn's triumph is to preserve that ethos. Yes, it is beautifully shot, has a wonderful soundtrack, and a host of character actors step up to the plate and give outstanding service. From the book, Ron Franz stays in the mind most, a man sleepwalking through life till he encountered Chris, whom he wished to adopt. That character takes a while to surface in the film, but when he does, Hal Holbrook inhabits him completely. As Chris's father, William Hurt shows just as he did in History of Violence that range and economy are his forte these days. We admire Chris for the strength of his convictions, the vitality he radiates, but there is always the urge to condemn, or at least finger-wag. He has the self-obsession of the true artist, and the hurt that creates in those around him is very real. Penn makes the brave decision to put this at the heart of his film, by having Chris's sister narrate his tale.Imagine, if you will, that this young man had not died, but had been found by hunters alive but enfeebled, then nursed back to health. The tale of a young man who went to live in the wilds of Alaska but ended up poisoning himself would have been tabloid fodder. Chris McCandless would have been a figure of ridicule and public scorn. But he did die, and that is the price tragic heroes pay for their status. Still, like most people, I would much rather he were alive, to enlighten us on what he learned from his adventure.It is a rare pleasure to have a film live up to a book. Penn's portrayal complements rather than mimics; I felt I got different things from the film, rather than merely re-visiting the book's pleasures. Comparisons with Grizzly Man are inevitable but in a good sense, both films focusing on the triumph of the human spirit in dark circumstances.",9,1,3,11 February 2010
Alice in Wonderland," the unimagining of Alice
","The most fun to be had at this movie is trying to figure out what they thought they were going after thematically, and guessing at what point they veered off course.Alice is on the cusp of adulthood, fleeing from arranged nuptials, and chases the White Rabbit down the hole again. The film then becomes The Matrix, with Alice as the Chosen One destined to fight the indestructible demon and save Sion/Underworld. This she does in very ho-hum fashion, and returns to the real world all grown up and ready to assert herself. And there's Johnny Depp, being mad and Glaswegian at various turns.I think it was meant to be about leaving childhood behind, and taking control of your own life. But as one glimpse at the buffoon Alice is meant to marry telegraphs the fact that this won't happen, there is no intrigue or ambiguity. An engagement with more feminist issues might have kept this juggernaut on track, but I think the 3D excitement steamrolled past such considerations. It's all just a bit pointless and silly, in the end.",4,2,5,28 May 2010
The World's Fastest Indian," uplifting gem of a film
","Hopkins is outstanding in this true-life tale of Kiwi Bill Munro who sets out to break the land speed record in the twilight of his life. That Bill Munro's tale was little known outside his native Invercargill is a tragedy for the man but a boon for film-goers, keeping the dramatic tension at a peak throughout. Will he make it to Speed Week? Will he be allowed to race? Will his heart hold out? Will he survive? The film is upbeat and feel-good without ever being sentimental or manipulative. Cynics will say Munro comes over as Forrest Gump meets Crocodile Dundee, that the plot is cookie-cutter from Straight Story or Broken Flowers. Ignore them, these people are doomed to unhappiness. Supported by a host of on-form character actors, Hopkins gives a lifetime best performance in a film that is inspirational in both film-making and life-affirming terms. Budding actors should study the scenes where Hopkins talks about the early demise of his twin brother, and what it means to him to finally see the salt flats. You will come away from this film feeling joyous.",10,2,2,2 January 2008
Avatar," Avatar on DVD in 2011
","Having missed out on the event that was the Avatar cinema release in 3D, I finally got round to watching the 2D version on DVD. Whatever this event carried on the big screen, it is distinctly underwhelming viewed on DVD in your own living-room.The story is Dances with Wolves and a hundred other culture clash templates. The characters are two dimensional and lack complexity. Sigourney Weaver as the scientist was the best hope for this, but she seems naively unaware of the military-industrial complex surroundings that pay the bills. While the storyline and characterizations are disappointing, Weaver's scientist clamouring for a cigarette and smoking in labs was both sickening and outlandish. Could Cameron really not finance this without pandering to the evils of Big Tobacco? Nice special effects but hardly spectacular. After that, there is not a lot to say about this film really. Ideas-wise, it is smarter than Transformers but more lightweight than Jurassic Park. Even Titanic provoked more thought. As an event, it will be discussed endlessly, but as a film, it inspires very little.",5,2,4,5 July 2011
The Artist," I will not talk
","A movie star finds his life falling apart when a technological innovation, 'The Talkies', arrives, and the old is swept out to make way for the new. However, salvation is potentially there, in the form of a young star who feels she owes a debt (and feels so much more), if only the star of the silent screen could let go of his pride...You don't have to look far for films that document the cataclysmic effects of the arrival of sound to silent film - Sunset Boulevard, and Signing in the Rain, to name two genre-opposed examples. Stripping a film of dialogue is also not that rare - consider Daratt. And utilizing the retro feel of black-and-white in the modern age is passé since Ed Wood and Schindler's List. What is rare, possibly unique, is the combination of these elements to create a film that taps into the current desire for nostalgia and feel-good cinema.Jean Dujardin shines as George Valentin, giving a masterful pastiche of the eyebrow-dominant mode of acting of 1920s screen heart-throbs. His charismatic performance most skillfully evokes the period. Bérénice Bejo as the aptly named Peppy Miller poses, grins, winks and melts hearts while holding the pain of an unrequited love for the unwitting George. The directing perfectly complements the theme - George encounters Peppy first on equal footing, later when he is in his ascendancy, and then a bit later on stairs, framed in starkly geometrical terms, with a chastened George making his way down, and an effervescent Peppy going all the way up. They talk, with her occupying the elevated position.'I will not talk!' proclaims the opening title card, and the narrative never lets up in its exploration of this essential thematic strand. George won't/can't talk to his wife, Peppy and George never talk about their attraction, George refuses to talk on screen, his closest companion is a gesture-reliant dog...I have seen this in the cinema on three occasions and each time the audience have applauded at the end. Whether this is a reflection of the quality of the film, and/or the desperate need in our times for nostalgia and uplifting cinema, I do not know. There is something about this film that touches people. A homage to cinema, and an unashamed crowd-pleaser (perhaps the only thing that gives away the fact that the film is French), The Artist is quite simply a triumph. I am not sure if it will last the test of time, but harrumphing about it now would be churlish. Well-crafted, great fun, worthy of the tears you will undoubtedly shed, I recommend it unreservedly.",8,1,3,19 January 2012
Departures," the rituals that sustain us
","Almost three decades since starring in Juzo Itami's classic The Funeral, Tsutomu Yamazaki once more shines in a tale woven around the rituals, traditions and theatre involved in Japanese death rites. The irreverence that makes Itami's classic such a delight is present here. Daigo's first day on the job playing a stiff in a DVD for the funeral business comes back to haunt him in hilarious fashion later on. However, there is also reverence, the film respectfully pointing out that the people who do this necessary but thankless task do not deserve the disdain and revulsion that their profession often attracts.Daigo loses his job as a cellist, returns to his inaka roots and stumbles into a job as an undertaker. Too ashamed to tell his wife, he slowly warms to his apprenticeship under the masterful tutelage of Sasaki. As he goes about his business, the inevitable traumas of a childhood long forgotten bubble to the surface as he goes about re-acquainting himself with the town. The conduit for the negative feelings towards his profession is Daigo's wife Mika, who takes punitive steps on discovering his new employment.Screenwriter Kundo Koyama has to take credit for a script that moves along briskly, juxtaposing black farce with raw tenderness, all done seamlessly, and acutely observed. Lipstick on a corpse produces gales of laughter, and you are reminded that sometimes the best fun is had at funerals. Daigo moves towards a form of reconciliation and redemption through the promptings of those around him, and the comfort of his cello.It would be all too easy for material like this to lurch into sappy sentimentality, but the film tugs at the heartstrings without overtly manipulating its audience. Motoki has to take some plaudits for this for a performance that amuses at times but hints at deep inner turmoil at others. Hirosue is less consistent, at times indulging in the head-bobbing, giggly, saccharine sweet girlishness that is the forte of the Japanese TV drama actress. She has one line in the climactic scene of such stunning obviousness I am surprised it stayed in, but for the most part she redeems herself in the tense interactions with Motoki over their differing views on his new career. Overall, she convinces as the supportive but put-upon wife.From Kurosawa's Ikiru through The Funeral and now Okuribito, Japanese cinema has a rich vein of movies that exploit the rituals of death. How those rituals comfort us, enchant us, and see us through to a place where the pain still exists but might come to an end, is laid bare in Okuribito. It is an absorbing, moving tale, full of laughter and tears, that celebrates the intricate details of a Japanese rites of passage while laying bare their universal function. Best seen in the cinema, to get the full effect of the luscious orchestral score.",8,78,91,18 February 2009
The Holiday," Corny? No. Crap? Yes.
","This film is absolute drivel. Romantic comedy is a tough genre - we live in a very cynical age, decades after Betty Blue and an absolute eon since An Affair to Remember. These days, if people like each other, they get it on, and there are very few social, ethical or religious barriers to prevent it. Therefore, to make a romantic comedy work, a lot of filmmakers have turned to supernatural barriers - the time-slips of The Lake House and Groundhog Day, the curse/wish-fulfillment in Big, a fictional mental disability in 50 First Dates - to keep their romantic leads apart. When they stick to more prosaic story lines, the modern audience isn't convinced. Nancy Meyers seems to be aware of this and and two elements of this film reveal that. First of all, she has this self-reflexive habit of commenting on Hollywood conventions, Eli Wallach's exposition on the term 'meet cute' being the most glaring example. Secondly, she seems to be winking at the audience when she has Kate Winslet declare that 'Corny is good!' Except that this film isn't corny, it's flat. How you can put Cameron Diaz and Jude Law in the same room and fail to create any chemistry at all is incomprehensible. Maybe they cancelled each other out, hot-plus-hot-equals-cold. Only Winslet's character achieves plausibility. Jake Black's comic potential is never exploited, and he looks embarrassed when he slaps high-fives with the pensioners, a scene that exhibits a gushing rush of sentimentality. Cameron Diaz's character is just two-dimensional, and Jude Law's character makes no sense at all - single fathers cannot go out on the pish and the pull as much as this guy, it just isn't feasible. All I got from this film was a new-found respect for Hugh Grant - the guy can take this kind of material and elevate it to something that touches you. The Holiday, however, is as crass, commercial and convincing as a dancing Santa lamp ( I have one, it's rubbish). Worth a look if you are interested in why romantic comedies so often fail, even with a stellar cast, but otherwise - avoid at all costs.",1,4,11,14 July 2007
Wedding Crashers," pretty poor fare in a tough genre
","Another romantic comedy that is just not up to par. Let's start with romantic - Owen Wilson's character doesn't have to work very hard to be with the girl. Zak is obnoxious from the off, there is NO REASON this woman would be with him. We don't respect her for that choice, so we don't respect Owen Wilson choosing her. And the climactic scene - could they be more obvious in ripping off Four Wedings and a Funeral? Unfortunately, the comedy also falls flat - Vince Vaughn, who I liked in The Break-Up, is really forcing his humour here. All his lines seem contrived, like he is trying too hard. The quail hunt was the first time I smiled, and thank God for Will Ferrell, who livens things up with his cameo. There's a nice little montage for Wilson's lost days near the end, but there are no laugh-out-loud moments like There's Something About Mary or Four Weddings. As for the other stock characters, it was great to see Jane Seymour as smoldering as ever but she is wasted as the horny mum. Foul-mouthed granny was cringe- inducing, while the gay little brother was out of sync with the feel of the film. Only the scary little sister was a worthy creation. In short, a worthy cast ill-served by a poor script.",3,1,1,23 July 2007
The Wolf of Wall Street," needs a sharper, more precise scalpel
","A young man gets power drunk on money, and the drugs and sex it affords him, while manipulating stocks and shares.The Wolf of Wall Street is in one sense Goodfellas transported to a different arena. Adrenaline junkies do bad things to achieve their high, abuse drugs and women along the way, and then give up their erstwhile allies to avoid a harsh prison sentence, all the while regretting not their bad deeds, but the fact that they have to live like 'ordinary schmucks.' This parallel narrative has its good points, as The Wolf of Wall Street has the same outrageous behaviour, quiet malevolence, and absurd comedy as the gangster flick. Where is falls down is that it over-indulges those excesses in repetition - every time they sell stocks it is basically the same scam. There is too much speechifying; Jason says the same thing, and too much of it, in every speech. The film also fails to show the social ramifications of Wall Street malfeasance. Scorscese is drawn to characters who live in excess, and in doing so both enthrall and appall. Unfortunately, he seems taken in by Jordan, when a little bit more objective distance might have layered this narrative in a more satisfying way. There is a small flavour of this at the end, with the FBI agent's gaze on the subway train. However, it is a fleeting moment of an element that needed to be laced in more. Notwithstanding the fact that Jordan's amoral deeds are laid bare, we are to a certain extent invited to sympathize with him, by virtue of the amount of time he spends on screen and the exclusion of time given to the consequences of his actions.With Goodfellas Scorscese re-invented the mafia film, but The Wolf of Wall Street, while being an entertaining ride, does not give us anything that Wall Street, or even Rogue Trader, has given us already, except with less pomp.In short a good, but not great addition to Scorscese's oeuvre.",7,2,4,1 February 2014
The Last King of Scotland," the gap year from hell
","'All aberrations of nature are possible.' Freshly graduated in medicine, young doctor Nicholas Garrigan chooses Uganda over Canada to escape his father's stifling influence. He ends up with a surrogate father in the shape of Idi Amin, and being stifled becomes the least of his problems.Kevin Macdonald's adaptation gives its protagonist the standard arc from ignorance through awareness to a form of redemption. Garrigan gets caught up in events he is too immature and self-centered to comprehend. His own downfall is foreshadowed by characters in his periphery. Older, wiser Sarah resists his seduction and silently pities his gullibility to Amin's charm. The pompous Embassy staffer is hardly likable but his realpolitik cuts right through Garrigan's naivety. Garrigan sets out to drink, lay a few women, have some fun. When he wakes up to the real world, he finds himself carrying a Ugandan passport, culpable in murder, and charged with carrying out assassination on behalf of Her Majesty's government.McAvoy is perfect as the young doctor mentored and then destroyed by a more powerful, charismatic monster. Forest Whitakker has been universally praised for his depiction of Amin, and rightly so. Garrigan tells him he is a child and that is what makes him so scary. True, but scary isn't the half of it. Cleverly, Macdonald keeps Amin's atrocities off-stage, so that the slow dawning of the man's terrible nature comes to the audience at the same time as it comes to Garrigan. When it does rush in, in a scene of brutal mutilation to Garrigan's lover, the shock is visceral. Unfortunately, there is an element of Heart of Darkness here, Africa viewed through the white man's eyes as savage and untamed. There are shades of grey; Garrigan and the Brit diplomats are unsavoury, though certainly more palatable than Amin and his henchmen. The only virtuous, and in the end heroic character, is the black doctor who eventually saves Garrigan, only to be summarily disposed off for his troubles. It is an ignoble, perfunctory death, symbolic of the 300,000 Amin inflicted on his people.More than biopic or historical drama, Last King is the tale of a weak man taken in and then beaten down by an overpowering, charming but destructive presence. Like the doctor who gave his life for Garrigan, we hope he goes on to live a life worthy of the sacrifices made for him. It is a pity Nicholas Garrigan is fictional, I would like to know if he lived up to that call.",9,0,1,28 July 2008
The Wrestler," casting genius
","Randy 'The Ram' is an aging wrestler, a respected, almost venerated veteran of the ring on weekends, but a grocery clerk living a lonely existence in his trailer park home the rest of the time. The physical and pharmaceutical abuse over the years catches up with him, and he is forced into a re-evaluation of his life.Mickey Rourke's comeback is now the stuff of legend, and he is so convincing as The Ram here that it is difficult to remember the incredulity, the sneering, that initially greeted the idea of Rourke carrying a film made in 2008. 'Comeback' is also slightly misleading, because the Rourke who charmed us in Diner and seduced us in 9½ Weeks is a completely different animal from the pumped up, haggard, speech slurring wreck of a man The Ram has become.This is nothing less than an acting masterclass. You feel every grunt and gasp as The Ram stretches a muscle, bathes a cut, or has a staple pulled from his skin. Aronofsky said in an interview that Rourke is an actor who remembers his lines after you shoot the scene - that is surely a joke, as Rourke exceeds the physicality of his role to give moving speeches, most notably when telling his estranged daughter how sorry he is (before messing up royally again), and in his showcase bout with a former nemesis, when he shows he has true love in his life - with his audience.This is a small film with a big heart, the quiet tale of one man's obsession with his job and failure to match that dedication in his personal relationships. Rourke gets strong support from Marisa Tomei as Cassidy, or possibly Pam, a stripper with her own relationship issues, who struggles to resist her feelings for Randy. Evan Rachel Wood as Randy's daughter Stephanie convinces, as do the other players in small roles, most notably a vicious, small-minded store boss who is as much a sociopath as any David Brent, and will rings bells for suffering employees in workplaces around the globe.The locations ooze grit, the hand-held camera keeps it all tight and intimate, and the script is spare and colloquial. The true genius was having the vision to see that Rourke would pull off this role. A satisfying movie with a startling 'making of' backstory.",8,0,0,9 March 2011
Dark Shadows," well well, a lifeless vampire film
","A vampire returns from being buried alive after 200 years, looking to restore his family name. But an old enemy awaits.This is a quixotic, incoherent film that seems to want to do too many things at once. The quirkiness attends to Burton's reputation, even though the make-up and sets seem to be recycled from previous projects. Depp gets to feed his addiction to playing pasty, cartoon-ish characters. The producers get to cash in on fans of the TV show, even if it means forsaking something like having the plot gel. Johnny Lee Miller continues to set new records for a good actor choosing bad projects.Victoria is hired as the nanny to little David - though we never see them in a scene together. One ghost appears regularly but is usurped at the end by another ghost who is unfortunately very similar to the first ghost, causing momentary confusion. Apparently Barnabus is in love with Victoria, but all the sex he has is with two other women. At least gratuitous vampire sex is something I've never seen in a film.Depp has a few funny lines, but the family is too big and spread too thin on this canvas for the audience to care about anyone. Michelle Pfieffer seems to be there simply to have her name on the poster. Barnabus is in love with a woman who is now a ghost leading another woman to him that he can love as a surrogate except she will also die... huh? Last of all, the setting up of a sequel with the final shot is crass.Completely missable.",3,4,6,13 October 2012
Inception," Great entertainment
","Nolan showed with Following that he is a cut-above the rest, and stays on track in this thrilling movie. These days it is difficult to separate the hype from the film, so much so that much of the criticism of Inception seems to be along the lines of 'It's not the greatest movie of all time.' No movie is, bar one, but if you can take a grounded approach to Inception you'll enjoy Nolan's most original and thrilling creation since Memento.Cobb is an extractor, stealing information from the sub-conscious mind of dreaming victims. Our flawed hero has a secret, one that draws a female nemesis into his work and threatens to undermine all his endeavors.The particular endeavor at hand, to plant an idea rather than extract one, proves a bit of a MacGuffin to take Cobb on a journey to battle his own demons on a CGI-infested landscape. The plot-plus-effects adds up to The Matrix meets Eternal Sunshine. Cobb has to get to the heart of the beast, Limbo, in order to win the ultimate battle. Getting there, he encounters crumbling worlds akin to warming Antarctic shelves (and Jim Carey's own subconscious). That lack of originality aside, the whole thing is done with aplomb. DiCaprio again displays a range that he gets little credit for, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ken Watanabe complement him perfectly with loyalty and skepticism. The ending is predictable, but not a cop-out. Personally, I would have preferred a more definitive ending, but I can respect and understand why Nolan makes the choices he did.Final note: big screen, please.",8,0,3,16 November 2010
Defiance," Jews that fight
","Fine acting performances help compensate for average production values in this WWII tale of Jewish partisans living in the forest in Belorussia while the Holocaust is unfolding. The three Beilski brothers disagree on just about everything, except the need to survive. Zus (Liev Schreiber) is the hothead, harbouring simmering jealousy at his brother's leadership role. Tuvia (an immense Daniel Craig) is that reluctant leader, taking care of the elderly and sick through a winter in a forest because his conscience won't let him do otherwise. Asael is the younger brother stuck in the middle, unsure which of his brothers to follow. Played by Jamie Bell, this is the first role I have seen him in where he did not bring to mind Billy Elliot. Language-wise the film is a muddle, the actors sometimes speaking in foreign tongues and at other times heavily-accented English. If the switch is meant to signal something, it was lost on me. The female characters serve mostly to create conflict among the men, or highlight their vulnerability. But the film on the whole convinces and holds your attention. It builds nicely at the end when the Bielski group seem to be pinned in an unwinnable situation. On the whole the film avoids sentimentalizing, especially in one funeral scene where the oratory by the rabbi succinctly captures the suffering of the Jews in WWII. Not a great film by any means, but better than I expected.",7,0,1,13 February 2011
The Good Shepherd," alone, friendless and far from home
","In Bourne and The Informant, Matt Damon has made a small career in roles playing loners who negotiate their identity in relation to working for The Man. The Good Sheperd fall into the same category. Damon is Edward Wilson, a self-contained individual recruited to the fledgling CIA. He marries badly and allows emotion to cloud his judgment at times. He fights to retain control, till one day he is forced to confront what it has all lead to, and whether it is worth fighting for any more.To its credit, the film assumes a fair degree of historical awareness and concentration on the part of its audience. The Bay of Pigs is the catalyst for Wilson's reflection on the sum of his worth. In investigating what went wrong, he recalls his strained relationship with his father, his failed marriage, his abandonment of the woman he loves. The elliptical structure can confuse at times, especially as Damon fails to physically age over the 30-odd years that the narrative spans. Ultimately, the self-containment of the character becomes a bit much to bear, and the story is plodding and pedestrian at times. Worth watching, but one feels it could have been so much more.",Null,0,1,9 August 2011
Prometheus," oh dear
","A crew of idiots who would not be allowed to cross the road unaccompanied in real life are somehow presented as the plausible elite chosen to fly on humankind's most important mission ever. The mission itself has been launched based on dodgy cave paintings that it takes a great leap of faith to believe point to the origin of our species. Our specified idiots seem to represent devolved rather than evolved humans, as they now smoke in their space suits, bait clearly dangerous alien lifeforms, and hide symptoms of illness from their colleagues in this hostile, uncharted territory. The old man financing this fiasco isn't old, just badly made-up. Relations of kinship and sexual/romantic attraction make no sense.

Win Win," life's complications
","A small-town lawyer fallen on hard times sees a way to exploit a rich client and help his family out of a financial hole. The plan works well till the client's grandson turns up, and then begins a process of unravelling and recrimination. Paul Giamatti is perfectly cast as the well-intentioned lawyer, a good man in an indifferent universe trying to keep it all together. Alex Shaffer absolutely nails the taciturn teenage Kyle. The offspring of a drug-addicted single mother, he gives off that world weariness and flinty edge that emanates from a child that has seen too much too young. The script is full of finely observed little moments, touches of pathos and humour, dotted with those little reversals that life lobs at us like hand grenades. When Kyle's mother shows up suddenly with legal representation, you can feel the knots in your stomach beginning to form. Genuine in its intentions, and stripped of sentimentality, this is a rewarding, entertaining film with no discordant notes.",8,4,5,1 February 2015
Iron Man," surprisingly likable
","The superhero fad rolls on. Many were predicting that the comic-inspired flicks would burn out with Iron Man, but the wise decision to cast Robert Downey Jr. in the lead put paid to that theory. At this juncture in history, the man can do no wrong.The story is so familiar as to be a side-issue. Arms manufacturer Tony Stark has an epiphany after being taken hostage in Afghanistan. This brings him into conflict with company bigwig Jeff Bridges, whose bald pate is strangely if crudely menacing. Yes, it is another tale of 'You were like a father to me, but you've betrayed me,' a la Minority Report, Mission Impossible, LA Confidential... But the obviousness of the plot is done in a nudge-wink style, as if to say 'Sit back and enjoy the action sequences and Downey riffing off in his own inimitable style.' And there is a lot to enjoy. Downey lights up every scene he is in. He is funny, intense, sardonic, passionate... The chemistry with Paltrow works extremely well, as does the homo-erotic undertone to Downey's relationship with Terence Davies. No doubt those two will get to scratch each other's eyes out in a sequel.I'm not sure the franchise has the legs of a Spiderman or Batman, but the initial outing is a fun ride if you are in the mood for light fare.",7,0,2,24 November 2008
Before Sunrise," opposites attract
","Jesse and Ceiline are brought together on a train when an old married couple have a very public fight in that way that only old married couples can manage. Two things become clear very quickly to the young couple - they have chemistry, and the time they can spend together is extremely limited. They set about making the most of mystical. magical, slightly unreal experience. They meander through Vienna, occasionally encountering some minor colourful characters, who despite being finely drawn, are always just a sideshow to the intense, fragile, painfully exposed musings of the young couple.Hawke and Delpy do a superb job of making an implausible situation seem all too natural and engrossing. Their dialogue could all too easily be self-absorbed and twee (My Blueberry Nights?), but here it is apt and at times incisive. 'I fee like I am taking notes, waiting for my real life to begin,' says Jese. Much of the success of the film is down to how the observations of the two characters resonate so closely with our own existential concerns.I made the mistake of watching Before Sunset before watching this. I wish I had encountered them chronologically. Both films are recommended, but only for those who like a slower pace, wry observation, and sheer, unadulterated romance.",8,3,4,1 February 2013
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," the death of screen writing
","In an age where film-making is ever more commercialized and insulting of people's intelligence, The Force Awakens comes along to put the final nail in the coffin of bold, imaginative screen writing. These writers were given a golden opportunity. A beloved franchise had lost its way with a trilogy of ill-conceived prequels. A hiatus ensued that allowed for critical reflection, and time enough to prepare a script that honoured the mythology of the earlier episodes, while marking a fresh departure in terms of new characters, story lines, surprises and updating for the children who are coming to the third trilogy that will be their Star Wars. That was the mission: clear and unmistakable.The response? An embarrassing rehash of Episode 4 with gaping plot-holes and a blatant disregard for any of the above concerns. How bad must the story ideas that were discarded be if a thinly-disguised re-boot is all they could manage? I suspect the ideas were not bad, but deemed too risky in our risk-averse times. The Internet is riddled with analysis of the plot-holes and so need no analysis here, but I have never felt so world-weary in a cinema as I did watching those X-wings attack a Death Star aiming for a porthole that is a fatal structural flaw. The equivalent in the real world is visiting an elderly relative who tells you a story she has forgotten she told you a hundred times before, though part of you suspects she knows she told you and doesn't care that you have to listen to it again.As for disrespect of all that has gone before, and shoddy filmmaking, the appearance of Luke takes the biscuit. Why is he just standing on a cliff (of a planet far, far away that could only be Ireland) waiting to turn round? We are told he is rumoured to be in an ancient Jedi temple, so a glimpse of some artist's idea of what an ancient Jedi temple looks like would have been greatly appreciated here. Instead, Luke is rushed on-screen in clumsy fashion, to ensure we all turn up for Episode 8.I get that they have to sell toys, and can forgive the light saber tweaks. I get that times have moved on, and applaud the gender and colour diversity in casting. I also get, depressingly, that they knew we would turn up in droves no matter what story they gave us, and so the screenplay was a less than major concern for them. This is not the only Hollywood film to desecrate the honourable craft of screen writing, but it is the most conspicuous, and possibly egregious. Disappointed is not the word for the emotion evoked by The Force Awakens - 'swindled' would be more precise.",2,68,95,1 January 2016
Munich," Spielberg at the top of his game
","ET wanted to go home, and Elliot missed having a father. In Jaws, the father wants to find his son. In Minority Report, the Dad wants to find his son, ditto the Dad in War of the Worlds, and the Mum in Close Encounters. In Terminal, Tom Hanks wants to go home. In Saving Private Ryan, they want to bring the son home to his mother. Spielberg unashamedly explores the same theme of family and belonging in the vast majority of his movies. Sometimes he gets it spectacularly right - ET; at other times it falls flat on its face - AI. In Munich, his passion for this theme reaches its crescendo as he flawlessly blends the micro and the macro: the Israelis as children looking for their lost home (mirrored by the displaced Palestinians), and Avner roaming the globe but longing to be with his wife and daughter. What makes Munich such a special cinematic experience is that Spielberg manages to hold in check the sentimentality that so damages his other work. In Minority Report, Samantha Morton gives a speech to Tom Cruise about all the possible futures his son could have had, an embarrassing gush of sentimental tripe. But in Munich, Avner breaks ranks to be with his wife when she gives birth, but his sentimental words are undercut by her teasing; the scene plays out realistically, touchingly, and devoid of sentimentality. It is almost a post-modern apology from Spielberg for the excesses of previous work. There isn't a missed beat in Munich. My God, those transitions - the attention to detail is breath-taking. I was struck watching Spielberg on The Actors' Studio when he said that he is aware of Spielberg the icon, an entity separate from himself, that people criticise or deify, but that as Spielberg the man he is removed from that and suffers over every film. That is reassuring to hear from the most successful and celebrated filmmaker of our times. Clearly Munich is a result of this process of reflection and self-doubt. The day Spielberg relaxes, film-making will suffer. Long may the rigour and self-examination that produced Munich continue.",10,5,8,20 April 2007
The Replacements," Hackkman and Reeves must be cringing
","The Replacements is the kind of movie they should be showing in film school. We can all look at Chinatown, Don't Look Now, Witness, Bringing Up Baby, Tokyo Monogatari, ET, Tootsie or Crimson Tide and see why they work well. It would be more of a challenge to take a heap of dung like The Replacements and say, 'Right, fix that.' They ticked off all the boxes; a reluctant hero steps up for one final chance at glory and redemption. Mentored by a grizzly old coach, supported by a wacky but loyal group of peers, he battles adversity, wins the game, and gets the girl. It could be Major League with more heart, or Bull Durham with more laughs.Except it doesn't work. It isn't funny (I felt for Gene Hackman trying to wring a laugh out of mis-pronouncing 'wiry', I just wanted to go up and pat him on the back, say 'never mind, mate', buy him a beer...), and there is zero drama. The prison dance routine to 'I Will Survive' probably takes the prize for worst scene of all. I think they tried for a pastiche, aiming at camp, but it is just... so bad. It is like watching one of those cabaret circuit stand-up comics dying slowly on stage, determined to make it through his routine despite the rising indifference of the audience. This is an absolute train-crash, bombed out horror of a movie, a real lesson in 'How Not To.' It does for the sports genre what Wing Commander did for sci-fi. I hope someone one day gets to record Hackman answering the question 'Why?'. The other actors can at least say, 'I wanted to work with Gene Hackman.' What on earth is his excuse?",1,6,16,10 March 2008
Moon," searching for long-range comms
","A compelling sci-fi in the cerebral mode of 2001 and Solaris (with a hint of Ishiguro thematically), Moon explores themes of loneliness, belonging and identity in an intriguing and entertaining fashion.Sam is the sole worker on a mining complex on the dark side of the moon. Approaching the end of his three-year shift, his isolation is exacerbated by technical problems hitting the link to his earthly wife and child. He is left with only GERTY to talk to, his HAL-like computer.Sam Rockwell nails all aspects of the put-upon astronaut, who swings episodically between rage, bewilderment, despair and enchantment. Jones handles pacing and plotting impeccably. Spacey voicing of GERTY is both eerie and comforting.Like most films, the less you know about the premise of this one, the better. Destined to be a classic of the genre.",9,3,5,22 November 2009
The Social Network," of life, love, loss, friendship, betrayal, greed and power
","A nerdy Harvard student and his geeky mates play a misogynistic prank on their female peers, and end up creating a multi-billion dollar company known today as Facebook. From such everyday fare Fincher conjures up a tight, keenly observed movie encompassing Shakespearean levels of farce and tragedy.Biopics are not history, and anyone wishing to know the true tale of friendships made and lost as vast fortunes arose from nothing is advised to go the the library. Sorkin's predictably verbose script from the kick-off unashamedly declares itself authentically Sorkin rather than authentically undergrad class of 2003. As a movie, Social Network details the egos and neuroses that unthread interpersonal relationships on the Harvard campus as young men find themselves ill-prepared to navigate the juggernaut they create.Jesse Eisenberg plays Mark Zuckerberg as charmless and dislikeable, but utterly compelling. His triumph is that you come away from the film pitying a character worth 26 billion dollars. Andrew Garfield proves more grounded and yet gullible as Eduardo Saverin, the partner who took a huge settlement to walk away. Very quickly accelerating to post-success Facebook and courtroom drama, the film plays mostly in flashback and tests us to figure out at what point exactly Zuckerberg sold his soul to the devil, and just who the devil is - Sean Parker? Lawyers? The saps who spend their lives on Facebook making it as huge as it is? Fincher's trademark silver and dark blue palette is used to great effect on the rain-soaked campus, as Harvard's asinine, snobby campus culture serves to pervert the minds of young men towards pettiness, elitism, and a contempt for women. When twin brothers suing Zuckerberg use their family connections to meet the President, the rot is shown to emanate from the core as he brutishly fails to see the nature of the problem before him.This is a highly enjoyable, timeless tale of greed, myopia and the corrupting influence of power, slickly executed by one of the most accomplished filmmakers around.",8,0,1,16 November 2010
The Soloist," A good film but we saw it already as Shine
","A journalist searching for a story comes across a homeless schizophrenic, Nathaniel, who, as it turns out, is also a classically-trained musician. The journalist befriends him, allowing him to play his music, while writing articles about him that force a showdown of sorts in their relationship.Based on a true story, this film pushes most of the right emotional button, but suffers from an unavoidable comparison with Shine. Bromance versus romance aside, there is too much overlap in the stories, even if they are true, robbing The Soloist of any freshness. Foxx is excellent, albeit in that actor-after-Oscar mode that seems to draw certain performers to play mentally diminished characters. Downey is as charismatic as ever, if a little more clipped than usual. The extras are in fact real homeless people with real mental infirmities - faced with that, Downey seems to have opted to play it a little more sombre than usual. At one point, he reacts to a stream of consciousness by one of the homeless people and we glimpse the man rather than the character. It is a fascinating moment - you realise that no matter how hard films try to approach realism, the real world will always prove more surprising.One small triumph for me is the moment where Nathaniel gets to hear a full orchestra for the first time. He closes his eyes, and we are treated to an abstract light show representing his emotional elation to the music. Director Wright apparently shot that sequence with a whisky glass and a household lamp. In our CGI-infested times, that is refreshing.In sum, not a bad film, and possibly more if you have not seen Shine.",6,2,3,2 March 2011
Atonement," he sleeps so deeply
","My generation grew up on the novels of Ian McEwan. As undergraduates, we ate up the illicit thrills of First Love, Last Rites and The Cement Garden. We reveled in the delicious viciousness of The Comfort of Strangers. It crescendo-ed with the cathartic joy of life, death and re-birth in The Child in Time. Nothing lasts, of course, and Black Dogs, Amsterdam, and Enduring Love all failed to scale previous heights. We smiled indulgently at the dabble with children's literature. This list isn't comprehensive, but you get the point - there was a distinct cooling off between McEwan and his public.And then along came Atonement. An incredible, startling return to form that ripped your heart out.Film adaptations of McEwan have hardly set the heather on fire. I approached Atonement the movie aware of all the plaudits, but expecting, at best, a decent-ish bastardization of the novel. Instead, the film achieves the cathartic heights of its source material. McAvoy is outstanding, the weight of injustice chiselled on his every expression. The technical aspects of the film are superb, the Dunkirk extended steadicam shot both outrageous and aesthetically appropriate. The score is playful but serious, in perfect harmony with McEwan's devastating conceit.McEwan fans will appreciate the elliptical structure, rewinding of time, flash backs and flash forwards. Having said that, my Japanese viewing partner had not read the novel but appreciated the film immensely.For some odd reason, The Child in Time, McEwan's best novel, remains unfilmed. I sincerely hope the people responsible for Atonement will one day turn their attention to that masterpiece.",10,3,4,26 April 2008
V for Vendetta," Zorro meets 1984 meets Macbeth
","Great cinematography, moving performances, a crackling script that takes you on an emotional and intellectual roller-coaster ride - rarely does a film manage to hold up a mirror to the age and entertain so magnificently at the same time. Shame on the award-givers for passing this over. England (certainly not Britain, as England here seems to have gone UDI on the rest of the UK) presented as a totalitarian state has engendered comparisons with Orwell's 1984, but this is much more akin to Animal Farm; it is a parable of the consequences of human failing and inaction on a societal scale, and the possibility of redemption for an individual. The filmmakers make brave choices - let the dialogue race ahead, don't ever show what is behind the mask. Is it churlish to point out one or two missed beats? Stephen Fry's character worked too hard to disguise his true nature, and was too canny in his dealings with the regime, to not realise the repercussions that would ensue from his satirical TV sketch. That episode served merely to propel Evey back to V. The resurrection of some characters for the mass discarding of the masks at the end was also a little bit too Brechtian for my tastes. Not perfect then, but damn close. V for Vendetta will move you to tears and make you ponder just how much England has really 'progressed' since 1605. England prevails?",9,2,5,12 April 2007
