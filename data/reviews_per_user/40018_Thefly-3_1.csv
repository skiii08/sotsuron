The Blair Witch Project," fantastic, scary
",I really liked this movie and I plan to see it again! I was actually freaked out when they showed the tent scene (I wont give it away) and I kid you not it brought tears to my eyes. The only thing that bugged me was that they sent you on a rush that you aren't brought down from like other movies so when you walk out your all pumped still.My view of walking in the woods has changed and I recommend that if your only going to see one movie this summer this should be it. I know I'll be on the waiting list at blockbuster when it comes out on video tape.,Null,0,1,6 August 1999
