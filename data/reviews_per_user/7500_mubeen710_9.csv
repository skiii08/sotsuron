The Equalizer," The Equalizer is an exciting, high-adrenaline thriller.
","Denzel Washington gives a solid performance as always, but the Equalizer is of the same quality as many other Denzel led thrillers: without him it would not be meaningful, with him it's watchable & special. There's definitely a pleasure in watching Denzel taking down tough- talking baddies, and that's what the film delivers, no more, no less. The conflicts are generally well written and ratchet pressure nicely, especially when Denzel has some chilly conversations with his soon-to-be-victims before they inevitably make their bad decisions. The tense sit-downs were equally entertaining for me just as the bloody violence. Director Antoine Fuqua goes about his business in a more than competent manner; the technical qualities are above average, though the film has moments where it seems too infatuated with its slick sense of style. The Equalizer is an exciting, high-adrenaline thriller.",8,2,4,17 August 2015
Ant-Man," Size doesn't matter for a superhero
","Having seen many kinds of superheroes on the silver screen, Ant-Man was undoubtedly one of a kind. Becoming invincible, having superhuman strength, running speeder than a bullet, flying beyond the sky limit or being a playboy with high-end gadget are some of the few super powers that had been dominating the cinematic world of comic movies. Then there comes the Ant-Man, a superhero who could shrink himself to a size of an ant or smaller & control the insects to complete his missions. Marvel should be appreciated for bringing this ultimate superhero into the screens which were more of a dream back in the years. The comedian Paul Rudd has helmed the role of Scott Lang effectively along with Michael Douglas who plays the authoritative Hank Pym, the scientist who invented the substance that can change sizes. The visual effects showcase a very detail plot making it a visual treat for the audiences throughout the movie. Ant-man is a definite watch for its entertainment, director Peyton's experience with the comedy films & imagination does the trick here.",8,4,11,12 August 2015
Baby Driver," Definitely the top action movie of the year on my list!
","From Shaun of the Dead to Scott Pilgrimage, I've always found Edgar Wright's movies entertaining. However, baby Driver was a step above that. Take Whiplash or La La Land, combine it with heist & Ronin or Fast & Furious elements to it and you have Baby Driver.There's no shortage of action movies in Hollywood, but there's definitely a shortage of good action movies and a movie like Baby Driver definitely delivers it! I must say, Edgar Wright, did a fantastic job with this film, especially when he had synced the 80's classic hits to the complete movie that gave this movie the extra coating that made it so unique.If you are a car lover, an action movie lover or a person who has a gig for 80's music or ever turned up the volume of your stereo and drove down the town super reckless, then Baby Driver is a movie for you!",9,5,10,15 August 2017
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Mission Impossible, just keeps getting better sequel by sequel
","This is how a modern action flick with High-end gadgets, future weapons, supercars, daredevil stunts & a perfect cast should be. As a die hard fan for solid action movies, by the end of the movie the satisfaction that I had gained was tremendous. Be it the storyline, performances or the jaw-dropping stunts & action sequences, every little actions scene kept the audience at the edge of their seats.Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation, is undoubtedly one of the most exciting films I've enjoyed this year so far. Overall, it's a cool modern spy espionage thriller with a decent plot to go with, banking on the broad shoulders of Tom Cruise.",8,0,2,12 August 2015
Jurassic World," T.Rex back in business, man it was an awesome ride along â€ªJurassicWorld
","Hitting the screens exactly 22 years after the original, Jurassic Park a movie still regarded as one of the most artistically inventive concepts that mankind has ever touched upon in the field of entertainment. It is so amusing to see one of the most cherished movie franchises being revoked. The visual splendor of Jurassic World presents all the whiz-bang biological appeal of dinosaurs. It highlights creative set pieces that champion the excitement of a dinosaur disaster story. Jurassic World is by far the best entry since the first. Unlike the previous installments we are finally presented a fully functional dinosaur theme park for the general public to enjoy, but how a fun trip turns into a misery because of an over-smart dinosaur makes the audience engage them right from the beginning. Leaving out the popular trio - Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum, the leads from the original film & bringing in Chris Pratt as a Velociraptor expert and trainer has not failed the director's plan in any manner. Despite his top pay, he doesn't appear until 20 minutes in & only on screen for a short period until the second hour. However soon after Pratt's stable role during the second half, he does captivate our attention and exudes the charm of a movie star. On the whole Jurassic World is the promising & deserving sequel that the loyal fans had been waiting for the past 22 years.",7,2,10,12 August 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Had it flaws, yet an exciting approach to the Marvel's 2nd phase
","Joss Whedon is too talented to keep making these thin, unremarkable Marvel movies, and this is a lazy sequel that feels like more of the same compared to the first Avengers film, especially as it has all the problems found in that one and a plot that is even more poorly developed. The movie did have some edge of the seat action sequences, especially the chaos between Hulk & Iron Man yet the poor character developments of the Marvel's speedster Hovok & Scarlet Witch is a little disappointing. The addition of Paul Bettany's 'The Vision' works flawlessly, he was a personal favorite for me. But overall Avengers Age Of Ultron is an extremely enjoyable addition to the Marvel franchise.",7,3,8,15 August 2015
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," The Stage is set for the Justice League
","Batman vs. Superman, is a three syllable word for any thought too big for little minds. This movie is undeniably a masterpiece made within the short span of time in order to ignite the DC cinematic world. If any of you are to go to this movie with an intention to see another Marvel superhero movie, sorry it's the wrong movie.Yes! it is dark, grittier, lengthier, starts with a slow pace gradually building up the momentum like a DC movie. At the mean time, it was putting all the vital elements together to sculpture the ultimate superhero team up 'Justice League'. Overall it's a dream come true watching the trinity together on a live action movie along with the cameos of the rest of the heroes. Btw, welcome to the DC cinematic universe amateurs.",8,4,8,26 March 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," 'Fury Road' A solid return
","This is by far the best action film of the year, a feast of action and drama. 'Fury Road' rips through conventional action movie norms to provide a visceral experience. Miller's choice to use practical effects pays off well, as the stuntmen and pyrotechnics deserve as much recognition as the perfect cast. Tom Hardy is a man of few words but delivering none the less and giving a strong performance showing he is more than a worthy replacement for Mel Gibson. It also provides plenty of strong female characters such as Charlize Theron, who is pure power. There's no secret here. Mad Max: Fury Road delivers what is expected of it.",9,3,10,14 August 2015
The Social Network," A tale of an achiever, driven by desire, marked by triumph, tainted by unfaithfulness.
","It did take me quite a long time since the release to enjoy this lovely piece of work by David Fincher. Knowing David for his style of storytelling was in fact the reason that made me to sit & give this movie a try. Looking into any biography movie or any other movie that is based on a true story so far, one could definitely point out the flaws on the storyline or the casting choices. Yet accepting the challenge of doing such a movie is what differentiates such directors from other. The casting of the movie does needs to be given a special appreciation as they bought all the real life characters into life, especially bringing in some of the youngest talents in the business such as Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Justin Timberlake & Armie Hammer. The movie opens with a couple in a crowded college bar and ends with a man alone in a room repeatedly hitting refresh on his laptop soon after a friend request. In between, David and Sorkin offer up a creation story for the digital age and something of a morality tale, one driven by desire, marked by triumph, tainted by unfaithfulness and inspired by the new gospel: the geek shall inherit the earth.",9,0,0,16 August 2015
