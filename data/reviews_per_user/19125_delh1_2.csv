Catch Me If You Can," Kudos for Catch Me if You Can!
","Out of the several excellent films late in 2002, Spielberg's fabulous 'Catch Me if You Can' is most certainly among the topfive, for superb direction, innovative filming, and of course, great acting by principals Tom Hanks and Leonardo DeCaprio (whom I was never particularly fond of until now).The plot twists and turns keep the viewer perpetually interested. The surprises are unexpected, but logical - not outlandish.Years ago I might have felt that the depiction of the FBI agents was exaggerated, but after the current years' revelations of their activities, I find everything not only apparently accurate but almost understated at times. The two major characters are carefully and gradually revealed to us until we understand the personal difficulties Hank and Frank haveundergone in their lives, which to some extent lay the groundwork for their behavior.I highly recommend it for the whole family.",10,2,3,1 January 2003
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," A real Greek classic (sort of)!
","I loved the film, and I must see it again to catch some of the more subtle references to Homer's Ulysses (Odysseus to us Greeks). Very clever writing, delightful dialogue.  John Goodman's 'Cyclops' was a real belly laugh! And I actually began to enjoy country music - amazing!",Null,0,0,27 June 2001
