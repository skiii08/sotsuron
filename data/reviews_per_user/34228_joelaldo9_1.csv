The King's Speech," Great Movie!
","We just went to see this movie today, and I loved it! The actors are very good in portraying their roles. I didn't know much of king George,until I saw this film. From the beginning to the end,this movie is interesting. It shows you that with the help of loved ones, self-confidence, and perseverance-you can overcome personal deficiencies. I recommend this film to all documentary and drama movie lovers. I hope this film wins the Oscar award for best picture of the year. Colin Firth is a good actor, and deserves an Oscar award as well. I have learned more about Queen Elizabeth's II dad. Informative film indeed. The director did a magnificent job.",10,0,2,13 February 2011
