Scarface," Pacino's outstanding performance
","One of Pacino's strongest roles without a doubt.  The way he projects a 'killer' image even when he is out numbered is very convincing.  Combined with a terrific screenplay, superb acting displayed with the talented cast, and genius directing, this movie still stays at the top of my list.",9,0,0,3 February 2000
The Beach," Fantastic
","This was a great movie.  To me it sort of resembled Lord of the Flies. I think this is Leonardo's best role since Romeo.  It looks like it was more of 'him' actually acting in the film.  He plays a very stubborn, ignorant, and gutsy guy named Richard who searches for paradise on earth.  Soon he realizes that no matter how perfect a situation is, human error will always corrupt it.  Danny Boyle's intense camera sequences really help to project the appropriate feeling for certain parts in the movie.  I loved it.  It really made me realize how crazy our lifestyle is.",8,1,1,13 February 2000
American Pie," You've got to love it
","Man this movie was great.  It didn't hold anything back.  All the cast members really gave great performances.  And the comedy was through the roof, there was so much unexpected dialogue.  Overall if you didn't like this movie, you were never a teenager and that's the bottom line.",9,0,0,6 June 2000
Mission: Impossible II," Exactly What I Expected!!
","This sequel was exactly what I expected from it.  All of the action was definitely unique and mind-blowing.  I mean what do you expect coming from John Woo, the action directing king.  I still cannot believe that a motorcycle is capable of doing all of those stunts.  And to top it all off it kept the plot as technical and involving as the first one.  If this is not considered a great movie, I don't know what is.",10,1,1,22 May 2000
Final Destination," Terrifying
","This movie has to be on the top of the horror genre list.  It had a great script and very original concept.  Nobody just dies in the movie, they really really die.  The death scenes were very elaborate and terrifying. This movie gets an A+ from me and I recommend everyone to see it unless you have a weak stomach, because this is just a notch down from faces of death.",9,1,2,18 March 2000
Gladiator," Wow!
","I went into the movie as a skeptical not knowing what to expect and came out with my jaw hanging down saying 'Wow!'  It was simple but very very entertaining.  Russell Crowe has proven himself an outstanding actor.  I think he has played just about everything.  If not, trust me, he is capable.",10,0,0,26 May 2000
