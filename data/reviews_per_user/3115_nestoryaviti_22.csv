Captain Marvel," Great Movie!
",It's often hard to depict an extremely powerful character but Marvel tried and it works. Not the best but great movie. The visuals are beautiful and the action is fun. Goose is phenomenal and Fury is awesome. 9/10.,9,2,14,21 March 2019
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Amazing.
",If you have never laughed before prepare to. This is the funniest animation I have ever seen which is not only rude but also offensive and will cross your allowance borders every time but you are likely going to allow them to and let them in every time because this animation explodes comedy.. 10/10,10,1,1,8 February 2020

Aquaman," Trust in James Wan
",I had my doubts and yes it is perfect but the visual eye and mastermind of director James Wan will leave you breathless. The movie may not be perfect for you. But it will definitely make you re-watch it in awe. True art of directing what may have been a mediocre film. #JamesWan,9,0,1,9 March 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," I Love It
","Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeees... Thor has made such a comeback that he has amazingly raised the bar for the entire MCU franchise Villainwise, hero-wise, story-wise and even graphic-wise. It looks amazing, it feels amazing and even sounds amazing. Thor Ragnarok has successfully redeemed the Thor franchise by paying back for what happened in Thor 2. I love it",10,1,11,5 November 2017
Ready Player One," A tribute to us, the gamers.
","I'm not saying this will appeal to everyone. I'm saying this is a great movie and a truly superb movie to the gamers out there like me. The graphics and visual effects are stunning even more stunning that the cast and story of the movie. Though the story wasn't that bad, it could've been better. The cast was great and they did their best a delivered a great performance. But a very special thank you for director Steven Spielberg for making sure this delivers cause I'm pretty sure no other director could make this story without messing it up.",9,16,33,18 May 2018
Split," A very great mind boggling experience
","Amazing sci-fi and I loved it to a point where I even started asking questions whether it is possible and I have to say great split performance act by James McAvoy (Split, I know) Great film and spectacular directing and the cast was brilliant. 9/10",9,8,15,8 June 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Beautiful!
","This isn't just an animation, it's a comic book. It's style and art design is so jaw dropping and fun you'll like you are actually reading a comic book. Miles Morales is finally home at the big screen where he belongs. This is a 10 with a super duper bad-ass seal of approval.",10,3,7,23 February 2019
Spirited Away," Hayao Miyazaki's work at its finest

The Conjuring 2," This is an excellent sequel

How to Train Your Dragon 2," YES YES YESSSS
","Wow. Now this is what I call a sequel. It sets that perfect tone then launches like a dragon and quickly sets the stage. Before you realize it, you're deeper in their world just like before. Dreamworks has done it again and done it beautifully. Loved it 10/10",10,3,5,2 February 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," #FeigeWinsAgain
",Wow wow wow. Yes. I didn't think they would meet my expectations but they did. I just came from seeing it in theaters an hour ago but I'm definitely gonna re-watch this entire week. Marvel has knocked it out of the park with not only a legendary film that honestly lives up to its legend but also as the best Avengers film yet.,10,2,4,28 April 2018
The Incredibles," This movies is incredible.
","Just as its name suggests, It strikes its themes deep into our hearts, inspires us to be heroes and shows us why we need them. Simply put, the best super hero theatrical performance of all time. Loved it.",10,3,4,2 February 2018
A Quiet Place," A Masterpiece
","Original and true horror. This is a must see for any remote horror or sci-fi fan. In fact, anyone should see this film. A suspenseful work of art that utilizes cinematic sound like no other film before. It's more than a film. It's a legend. And John Krasinski has established himself as an amazing director. #10/10",10,2,4,29 June 2018
Coco," Legendary. 10/10
","A work of art that beautifully matches Pixar's amazing artistic stories and designs with Mexico's beautiful and sacred culture. And the music... Oh the music.

Joker," Don't ignore this film, you need it.
","To put it plainly, this feels like a masterpiece but it isn't really yet still it moves like one. To have a movie about a character in a comic book world portray a message so important in the real world and almost necessary makes this somewhat A- yet masterfully directed and acted movie a masterpiece. 10 out of 10 for me and I will dare again and call it a masterpiece. Its view may scar you but more so it will make you wonder how much possible it is.",10,5,8,7 February 2020
The Conjuring," This is exactly the type of horror movie I want

Wonder Woman," Wow... This is awesome.. 10/10. I love you Patty Jenkins!
","Wow... This is awesome.. 10/10. I love you Patty Jenkins. You've saved the DC Extended Universe and that flame hopefully will be put to good use. Gal Gadot is WW personified and she wears her role proudly and amazingly and Chris Pine does such an amazing job as a supporting character that he amazingly almost stole the show but the tone was perfect, the CGI was beautiful and the story is awesome.. WWsavedtheday.",10,6,15,22 October 2017
Black Panther," A new bar has been set for the MCU especially for villains
","I can see why Kevin Feige thought this was the best MCU film yet. It got style, it got action, it got drama, it got heart and boy does it tear you up in the end. The only MCU villain I have teared up for. This movie is amazing and it portrays what a perfectly written villain and support characters look in a film. I can't wait for a sequel. And yes, Okoye may as well be the best fighter in the MCU. With those spear throwing skills, she would've easily killed doomsday without breaking a sweat. Lol.",10,3,7,26 February 2018
