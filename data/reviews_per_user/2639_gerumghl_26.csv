10 Cloverfield Lane," Stirred things very well
","This movie was a movie of themes. People expected a masterpiece of a horror story, but it was much more than that. This went on with how the woman, man with the injured arm, and dude who controls this place all felt. But especially focused on the lady, who still has decisions about what to do with all the things she went through in that bunker. Lighting was very good. Acting was tense the whole time, which is all that was needed. There was a hopelessness feeling for the girl at times things went bad. A constant mystery for the end, to know how the whole feud between them would end. And it ended with a surprising finish. This is one of the movies that proves even filming in a room can be great, only if there's different viewpoints between characters.",8,0,0,8 May 2018
The Hunger Games," A movie about a certain world
","Many people who hates on this movie are most likely people who are against the 'young adult fiction' genre. Just like how I was. But honestly, this movie's alright to what it tried to bring to this dystopian world with Katniss as the main pov. It doesn't only overly on romance all the time, which is a relief on these types of movies. Instead, we get some good battle royale footage, and an actual background and good reason for its existence. Pretty good start off in the series.",7,0,1,14 May 2018
Creed," A single great payoff
","From the Rocky series, this definitely did something with it, create another awesome boxing movie but with SYLVESTER STALLONE as a mentor. It worked perfectly scene by scene to see how it would work out.Ryan Coogler definitely did a boxing spectacle right here. Showing a theme of struggle and training to result in a good end. But nothing really super-creative about. Colors just felt like silver and black. This could've done better, but it's done enough.",7,0,0,14 May 2018
Hot Fuzz," One of the best buddy cop movies of all time
","When you want a buddy cop film, you need a clumsy dude and a serious dude. Well it cliched that, but in a clever way. This is a bomb of a movie to take in due to it's style of the genre of these types and it's cool mystery it tried to solve. Never once throughout the mystery were you bored. That's not because it was a super-clever mystery, but because it brought fun and comedy out of it. With that, delivered some badass action and near perfect dialogue to fit with what the frame had to say. And not only dialogue, but with what the camera had to say with it too. Again, another Edgar Wright masterpiece.",9,0,0,14 May 2018
Ready Player One," 'I know that reference' the Movie
","The action was brilliant at times. The cg was amazing. And the plot, not so much. There are many plotholes in the plot itself and the world. Even the worldbuilding isn't exactly there. If you want a blast in the OASIS, it's just going to be a simple story that was based on a book made for very young people with references of all kinds anyways. A lot of the references doesn't help the movie anyway. No deep weight. Just simple fun through a narrow path. You can tell that Spielberg tried with his 'Spielberg dust', but it felt a little forced at times. If you just want to see something quickly, this isn't terrible at all.",6,0,0,2 May 2018
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Honestly, one of the greatest superhero movies of all time.
","Best actions scenes in the MCU, period. So many brilliant coreographed fights that went along with the pace of what this story tried to feed. It felt tense and not tense exactly when it needed to. All of the characters were essential to what was going on, and that pushed the movie to excellence",10,1,2,2 May 2018
Baby Driver," Fine work of editing
","Honestly, editing on this was superb. One of the best I've seen. And that's what made it interesting to keep on going. The style is what brought it out. Substance honestly didn't matter in this movie, since it's meant to have a central 'musical car race' theme to it. It may be getting a bunch of terrible weight under it for it's non-substance just like I said. Average story, average crime stuff. But the editing and music. That's the thing this tried to reach as the 'emotion.'Making a great story isn't supposed to be integrated into every single movie. This brought theme and ultimate driving. The driving scenes were perfect, accompanied with the music to show the perspective of how the main protagonist deals with his criminal world. And when he rejects it, more hardcore and tough situations and music lights up to show more struggle. So in technical cinematic terms, this is basically a masterpiece. Acting was great. And the ending wasn't really good, but it's still worth a watch from the legendary Edgar Wright.",9,1,3,14 May 2018
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," THE Adventure
","Adventure movies had problems with focusing on one thing for the main plot. Just a linear thing. But this took time to explore, make friendships, and took time itself with a long runtime.Thanks gosh this was long, or else it wouldn't have that grand feeling. This had an experience to see a lot of the kingdoms and overall view of Middle Earth and it's rule to see how it'd be for future movies. And this followed a lot of the books characters and put them in this movie with great acting and performances. Many quotable lines here and many known characters for those lines only for some people. It's just extravagant to know the whole world which makes complete sense. And the ring is a puzzle piece to unlock the whole place.But there is some downside to time, as it brought boredom a little and the last half not being THAT good. The first half was not that superb too. Because a lot of the movie was exposition and a lot is like going straight to 3rd act.",8,0,0,14 May 2018
The Shining," A Basis for Horror films
","With all the horror movies I've seen, this is the one the competition has not beat. This movie has the main component for a horror film, the terrifying background. A lot of horror films nowadays have jump scares for cheap thrills. But instead, most of the time invested is the whole emotion of the movie as psychotic and terrifying.Not only the scare factor, but another thing that makes this movie have you think even more. 'The Shining.' If you've watched the movie 'I hope you have', it's something that motivates the film even more. And is a mysterious thing.The music and filming was good and simple. Not great in any means, but good enough. Another reason this was a great horror movie, is that many reference in modern pop culture still refer to this movie.",9,1,4,27 October 2018
Spider-Man," Copy and paste origin story
","If you want to know what the standard for a superhero origin movie is, this is the place. Everything about the way this movie plays is to have a basic origin about Peter. There wasn't a lot too it.It showcased his powers then, villain. The famous Uncle Ben line was not played out, so was the rest of the acting. Toby McGuire's acting is not really my favorite. His acting is as a boring and tired character. He doesn't even act like a nerd to fit Peter's character. And there was nothing visually good from a superhero who'd be swinging around a lot.",5,0,2,14 May 2018
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Badassery of all sorts
","This is a great example to make movies based on anime or games to look good. Even though it's based on a comic strip, it still has elements from games and it is perfection. The way specific fonts and the atmosphere is great to how the world revolves around Scott. Scott as a main character isn't bad, it just shows him being vulnerable to this whole adventure he's going through for the girl he likes. Of course the editing is very nice and smooth because it's Edgar Wright. And the music is outstanding with the encounters he has. But the ending is really terrible.",9,2,3,6 May 2018
Wreck-It Ralph," Great in General
","One of the greatest animation films. Yes, this most definitely holds up. The pacing fit well, all the characters were well explained and perfect for the story, animation was amazing, lessons and morals, etc.. The antagonist as the protagonist for this movie was perfect as it taught had a great and sad story on his life on a videogame. And it all payed off. The wonder and soul of Vanellope's world was fantastic. The perfect game movie. Cameos and other references didn't really need to drive this. It stood on it's own and the chemistry between all characters were shown of how everything became great at the end to beat the common enemy.",9,0,0,14 May 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Marvel fanservice
","I've been a Marvel fan ever since the Avengers came out. I watched it on the first Saturday the Firday came out. And the movie was epic. Ever since then, I've watched all of them in the theaters. And the shows. Then this movie came out and I was pleased with the overall story and all the heroes together to fight the villain we'd all been waiting for.It's true this had a lot of movie to be considered a good 'summer film', but this had some flaws in cgi and (maybe) audio i general. The cgi on Thanos was great, but sometimes the movement of characters in the movie was just stiff with a low range of movement. In the first Avengers, we had Hulk flying and flexible, here he is with stiff fighting against Thanos. There's many examples.The music has been overused plenty of times, and tracks from previous movies has been recycled. This can be both good and bad. Pro, it has an epic compilation of music. Con, the music has no creativity as it's just reused.Also another one audio. Two times in the theater, the audio of the characters talking sounded like it was from an 80s film. It sounded so scuffed and muffled. Then when I watched it at home, it was a little more clear. This was the first movie for me to have been bad in the theater, but good at home. So, this movie will get a 7. The real fanservice made this great for a marvel movie, but there was some issues scattered throughout the movie.",7,1,4,2 May 2018
Bolt," Just like the Title
",This delivers another heartpounding movie to resonate the title by the famous Disney. The story is great and makes a true honor to the dog in the adventure he goes through to make it fun throughout. And in many ways does the movie make it great to follow what happens as it goes through. But it doesn't have much more depth then that and sometimes gets slow at certain moments.,7,0,0,14 May 2018
The Incredibles," Brought a cool charm
","The greatest thing about this movie was the charm we all experienced. The interactions and real-world problems and tasks this super-powered family goes through is what made it stand. Basically, just Fantastic Four on a film screen (which is good). They each have something to deal with, while the main character has something greater to focus on. That makes all of them great together when they need to cope about it together, like family. A lot of the lines are super memorable. And the villain is simple enough to enjoy the conflict.",8,0,0,8 May 2018
Ghostbusters," Most unecessary and overrated movie in history.
","This 'masterpiece' is just clogged with many terrible things with it, and a terrible plot too. Let me explain.One of or probably the only reason this is highly praised is the fact that it gave off a cool franchise or stigma to many people. This right here makes no sense. For a movie so average, any other company could've just said, 'Hey, lets just make a movie about people getting ghosts.' But this was so terrible, I can't even begin where to start.Music. Soundtracks has been great for overhyped movies at times and it works. When they use the Ghostbusters theme, it's only at the end or the worst times.The plot. It was just a numb and dull plot hyping up this cool devastation the queen is gonna make. So the whole movie focuses only on that buildup. During the buildup of that, about one person of the Ghostbuster squad was even likeable. The pedophile's sarcastic tone became annoying (and I love sarcasm), the 'leader' I suppose had no real characteristic I saw, the smart one was actually likeable, and the black dude had no motivation or reason to even join. And they didn't even show his talents. So is he just useless?So much of the comedy was centered around the pedohile character which made comedy not even a point in this. By the way, the adventures they went on were super boring. Nothing cool was shown, just laser beams out of the guns they never explained.Then the buildup happens, but no chaos anywhere. Just one little ten to twenty minute battle between the queen and the Huffs Puffs Marshmallow. None of it was cool as everyone says. It's all average with alright special effects at the time. It's really just overrated.",4,6,17,15 May 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Did this movie try or not?
","It was very hard to know if they actually tried to make this a good movie or just a product. Ryan Johnson might have been trying to do something, and that's what ruined it. When a main story is started and you make a trilogy, you have to keep the original storyline it wanted to do, and the people that made it. The Force Awakens was alright, but this was just bad in many areasI don't get how critics praised this. Only being praised for visual effects (which any major company can do, music (it's the same Star Wars music, nothing new), and aesthetic (what?).This was a disaster for everyone. First, let me start off by saying, about everyone in the theater were either confused or neutral when the movie ended. Nobody was happy. A dude kept on saying, 'what the heck' to the stuff that made no sense, and there were a lot of it.The story isn't great, it's a copy and tried to do it's own little thing once, but it was a stupid message that nobody cares about. Many plotholes and moments were you just feel sad about what they did to specific characters.Fanservice. Big parts these movies have to offer is offer something great to the millions of patient and loyal Star Wars fans that has been waiting over the years. This can be argued to not be important, but it's something that was really made to make a fantasy that people loved. I didn't have an theories or anything, but the all the things this movie changed are trash and puzzling. Lots of the people you'd think were badass, just aren't. And there isn't one lightsaber battle.This tried to go theme by theme and felt like it didn't even know what to do at times. The whole goal of what they tried to do at the end of the movie was just ridiculous. It wasn't entertaining as much, and it doesn't even make you think about all what happened, it makes you simply disappointed.",3,12,17,6 May 2018
Brave," Simple Tale
","As a movie, this is alright. But it's just very simple and doesn't really do anything. This movie could've been summed up in about 20 minutes without all the unhilarious jokes.The animation is a big complaint, yeah. Disney has a reputation of great and clean animation. They team up with Pixar for many franchises you know (their cleanest studio for this stuff), but this is Walt Disney. And those movies are also good. This was kind of bad for a Pixar standard around the time. he movements looked choppy at times and the characters look like dolls. Not much texture was put in to it. And then, the whole color tone of the movie was just a dark gray smoky tone.The story is a retelling. A retelling of 'A girl asks a witch to cure her life, but it hurts her instead.' There's many versions of this kind of thing. So nothing special, her mother just turns into a bear, how original. So then the movie tried to make a Brother Bear theme trying to 'bond' and stuff. Just very boring. Nothing grand was explored, and it definitely didn't give justice to the Scottish culture they tried to use.Instead of making it grand like they hyped it up to be, we get a one dimensional story. The girl never showed her skills for any real fight. She's always teased throughout the movie as a skilled fighter and archer, yet at the end she doesn't show it off. The story just goes of the curse she's trying to heal. There's nothing 'brave' about this. It's just another copy and paste story.Oh, and I don't hate jokes that much, but was this terrible with it. It's the biggest disappointment i humor. The three brothers were honestly annoying and the three kingdoms coming made no sense. They added ANOTHER plot with this reverse the curse plot which made it worse. So of course they just made the three kingdoms plot to make them for humor, and focused more on the reverse curse.This wasn't good in a fresh sense, and the reverse cursing thing they tried to teach was alright. It wasn't grand with anything they tried to do (like the three kingdoms not helping with any of the plot or the souls which made the protagonist less brave). I don't think this just had a right mindset of how to handle this.",3,3,4,14 May 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy," A One Trip Ticket To an ADVENTURE
","This was the most unethical and weirdest group up adventure of all time, and that's what made it great. The insaness the movie had, just made the characters grow together in an ironic way. The villain didn't need much backup, it was just perfect to show off each skill and backstory of the characters to go against being bad people against the law, and doin a little o both. Also, jokes on this movies were the best thing this had to offer to be honest.",9,1,2,6 May 2018
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Too Simple
","I loved Pulp Fiction and other Tarantino movies. But this just wasn't that fulfilling from his other works.The action and fighting in this movie is the only thing that this movie was meant for, alright. Movies' not focusing constant guts on a story that much that can make up for clever action are movies I like to see sometimes (though, they don't always do good.) This is no different. This is a revenge story, but since the story isn't big and complicated, buildup was unnecessary with unnecessary side lore. Then the action wasn't really done good. Especially terrible scenes with a bunch of people. Long fights made it a little boring since it had no tense moments and we could see the main character's obviously a badass. Why couldn't she do cool fresh fight moves? It was simple copy and paste fight moves.To continue with that, simply shot. No cool angles while fighting or going around. Most shots are seriously her doing one simple thing. And they're about a minute each. They start going on and it doesn't add the sense of cool assassination adventure.Shouldn't have focused on lore too. This is a simple revenge story. And they start to add lore about a specific character which makes no sense considering she could just beat anyone (without even showing how she learned the fight moves.) Like a Mario game. Simple enemies then a boss. Really had nothing else going to it. No cool lines, nothing really cool.Not completely terrible, it had the attitude for the girl completely right. Just like Tarantino's good at with the main characters. Going straight to business.",5,0,0,11 May 2018
Logan," Savior of ending a franchise
","This movie simply has nothing bad to say about it. All scenes were great and fit right in with each and every one of the individual main characters in it. The heartbeat and tense moments were always felt. Surprises and sadness made this great in so many levels. Hopelessness, anger, revenge, happiness. Being seen through Xavier and Logan to fulfill the main movie's goal about the girl. Nothing short of action. Just gruesome violence that impacts even more of what Xavier and Logan are going through. Not to mention, the girl's acting was pretty nice. Really, a 100.",10,1,2,6 May 2018
The Dark Knight," Dripping two coins
","For people who says this is a great superhero, it isn't. It simply isn't a superhero movie at all. It's a crime-dramatic movie. At least from the messages this movie brought to the table. This brought a lot the table with many very famous lines and moments because of the stakes and tension between Batman and the Joker. Like two sides of a coin, which was supported by Harvey, who was extremely well performed. It has so much in one take, there's a lot of replay value to essentially make your own scripture off of this one movie. And the last quarter is simply the best to ever happen.",9,0,0,6 May 2018
Avatar," Just Cinematics
","Cinematics were great, and still to this day, about no other movie accomplished this movie's goal. Shots were expertly used to have an actual 6th sense. But to be fair with that, the world was pretty bland. It's just a huge forrest. There were more characters than necessary and even the motivations for the main protagonist were way too simple to have a 2 hour and 40 minute screening about. Plus the acting kind of resembles some acting I've seen in budget drama movies before.Even though these are negatives, the capture of the whole place made it feel more than just a forrest; a camera's fantasy playground.",7,0,1,14 May 2018
Black Panther," What kind of movie is this?
","Is this a sociopolitical movie that everyone loves about? Or is it a superhero movie? This movie tried to be both and it was bad at it. The cultural and musical part about it was the best. But really that's it. You won't be surprised about anything. And it tries to give a simple villain. Ryan Coogler made other movies feel fresh, but this felt like a list on what to do.",5,4,6,2 May 2018
The Matrix," A Wow Movie
","This movie that was shown in 1999, was a groundbreaker for all in the action genre. As we all know, it featured new elements and technically made another bible. Red pill or blue pill? Are we in the Matrix? That's what made it different. The main character through this is very stale though. But that's really one of the only problems. This staleness of a character though, would continue. But this film has influenced other movies of great fighting scenes and excellent camera work. Truly, a film to watch with those badass glasses shades.",8,0,0,2 May 2018
Deadpool," Some good wall-breaking
","This whole movie tried wall-breaking since it's the main point of the character. And it actually made laughs sincerely for us. But with that also had some bland moments. Really, just the whole aesthetic of it.It was also clever to not have this be the highest budgeted movie ever. It paved way to have gigs on this broke dude making fun of how much these heroes are and studio deals that has to go through.But with that, the origin story pushed the movie back. We could've had more Deadpool time. This is the troubling concern.The movie had too many themes as the origin story continued. It tried to have a cool revenge story and then filled the movie with a bunch of blocks about Deadpool's little past bits as himself b.d. (before Deadpool). Still, this didn't give much weight to Wade Wilson, as he kept on doin funny jokes and 4th wall-breaking to fit his superhero persona.So yeah, gigs and revenge (maybe love story too). Just a good mahem of both.",7,1,1,15 May 2018
