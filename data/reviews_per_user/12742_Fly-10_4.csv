The Blair Witch Project," Outstanding!
",Simply put the greatest horror movie ever made.  No film has ever grasped the concept of atmosphere such as Blair Witch did.  I have been disappointed time and time again when I saw a film that was supposed to create a feeling and did not quite hit the mark.  The Blair Witch Project did that and more. I recommend this movie to all.  I hope the academy does not overlook this truly great film.,Null,1,2,14 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The force is still strong
","I know what you're going to say.  You're going to say that I loved this movie because I'm a Star Wars fan.  True, true.  I think that there one must remember before going to see this film. You will love this film (most people) if you grew up watching the the young rebellion defeat its adversary.  Good vs bad, the same old story just with awesome special effects and in a three part story, which does make a difference.  I strongly encourage anyone who plans to see 'The Phantom Menace' and has yet to see the first three installments to see them and grow to understand why we are so hooked.  Then you too will be in the hunt for unanswered questions that only parts one, two, and three can understand.  This is truly a soap opera for sci-fi fans.",9,0,0,8 June 1999
American History X," Moving
","There are few movies in my life that I have given a perfect rating for but this one really deserves that honor.  American History X gives an honest portrayal of racism in the world we live in.  You see, people who follow radical actions like the crime of hate usually have something that has lead to their radical behavior.  One thing that really stuck deep within my soul is the realism that the people that are behind all these terrorist acts have in their minds reasons for their behavior.  I felt sorrow for the incredibly true to life racist inequality that is prevalent everywhere.  Edward Norton was absolutely brilliant in this film!  I believe that he will rise to the challenge of any character he portrays.  The truth is that life is not what it seems at times.  This film, done so perfectly, gives us that view.  One can not agree more after seeing American History X.",10,0,0,19 June 1999
The Wedding Singer," memories
",The 80's were the greatest decade in history for fun music.  The world jumped with the sounds of Billy Joel and Men with Hats. The Wedding Singer brought me back to my childhood and all its splendor.  Anyone who loves the greatest decade ever will just love this wonderful film!,8,1,1,15 June 1999
