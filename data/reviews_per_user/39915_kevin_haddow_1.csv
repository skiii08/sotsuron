Sucker Punch," Stylish, but overblown and makes little sense
","The trailers made this look fantastic, like a cross between Kill Bill and Dungeons & Dragons.Unfortunately it doesn't really live up to the hype. We have an (admittedly very cute) young girl marched into a mental institution/brothel and forced to dance for punters. When she dances she escapes into a fantasy world that helps her and her friends figure out how to escape. Cue one CGI battle scene after another, and they are actually pretty well done. The problem is they aren't that coherent and don't string together very well. There's no continuity between the set pieces. They are stylish, well done and overblown but, as seems to be a trait of some modern films, you once again feel like you are watching someone playing a video game.The main characters aren't even that likable, and you end up not really caring whether our sexy heroine escapes or not. Once the film has finished you tend to sit for a few second thinking 'OK, but just what the hell was that film actually about?'.",6,2,6,1 April 2011
