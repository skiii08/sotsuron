Marie Antoinette," Garbage!!!
","This is one of the most awful films of recent times. First, the good: the photography was beautiful. Now the bad: American actors playing the French? Ugh!!! Audrey Tautou would have been the obvious choice for the lead role. And since when did the French speak English with a Brit accent? Of course, the dialog was so bad, who cares? Now for the ugly: the plot was inane (Marie was NOT a sympathetic character in real life), the acting mediocre, and, really, this movie was a waste of celluloid. Please god, tell these Americans to STOP making bad period-piece films! If you want to see a GOOD American film, go rent 'Stranger Than Fiction'-- but don't waste your time and money on trash such as 'Marie Antoinette'--Pure garbage!!!",1,2,5,20 March 2007
The Evil Dead," Poorly Done, Clich√©d, Bad Acting
","Okay, so bad acting, poor plot, cheap effects and cheesy photography are what make 'the greatest horror movie of all time'? My 15 year old son said, 'Well, maybe they liked it, because it's old'. Yeah, either that, or Sam Raimi paid dozens of friends and family to vote for this clunker!!! Hey, it isn't a horrible movie: just dumb. I suppose if you're drunk, and have nothing better to do on a Saturday night, then rent this movie. Oh, in one of the 'scary' moments of the film, my son said, 'These people are dumb... they're retarded'. The same might be said for anyone who actually believes this cinematic garbage is 'essential viewing for a movie buff.' (For 'essential viewing, try 'The Maltese Falcon' or 'Amelie' or a film by Fellini or Bergman, if you want essential viewing... but NOT this sad waste of film!One final note: the fact that so many folks on IMDb rated this film '10 stars' should be a red flag (suspicious sign, for those of you who have never heard the expression)-- Evidently, the average reviewer on this site is 1. uneducated 2. unsophisticated 3. under the age of sixteen 4. never seen a truly great film or 5. is a shill for the movie industry. I mean, ten stars should be reserved for a film in the top 100 greatest movies: not this sad little excuse for a story.",1,23,46,16 December 2006
The Da Vinci Code," Wonderful!!! Brilliant!!!
","Okay, it's not the book, and it starts out slowly, but 'The Da Vinci Code' is wonderful!!! Brilliant!!! The plot moves quickly, after a slow start. There are enough twists and turns in the plot to keep one guessing. Audrey Tautou is charming and convincing in her role... Tom Hanks portrays the academic 'flat foot' with emotional clarity and wit... We truly WANT to like these characters, empathize with them, and cheer them on in their quest. The photography and scenery are magnificent. Each scene, each shot, draws us in further, carrying us into a mysterious, uncharted world. And a feeling of spirit, of grace, of mystical imagination, is what permeates this film. In total, a movie well worth seeing, and deserving a '10'. Congratulations, Ron Howard! You've done it again!!!",10,3,6,23 May 2006
