It," Everything is great but CGI
","I loved the clown acting, the kids were perfect, music was good too, I liked the photography, everything was well directed and the story was well portrayed. This movie was almost perfect, but the scary scenes were a failure due to CGI. most of the time CGI in horror films does not work to scare people, and this time was not the exception, CGI looks cheap and most of the time it is not needed at all.",7,4,7,17 September 2017
