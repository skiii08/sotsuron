The Blair Witch Project," Highly recommended, with one catch! (possible spoilers)
","I was completely impressed with this film.  When I first began to hear the hype, I was one of the many persons who didn't realize that the footage was fiction.  I am very glad I found out before going to see it, because the knowledge in the back of my mind that it was fiction was the only thing that kept me from freaking out completely. Simply stated:  If this film doesn't win an Oscar or two, the folks that hand them out had better just pack it up and forget the whole thing.  It has been a long time since any movie had done what this one has (neither financially or emotionally.) I have given it a 10 and would whole-heartedly recommend it for folks who are not normally plagued with nightmares after scary movies.  If you are, do yourself a favor and skip it.  You'll go broke paying for therapy.",10,2,3,2 August 1999
Fight Club," The 'end-all-be-all' of script and story!
","Do not rent this movie unless you have the whole weekend!  I guarantee you that it will be necessary.  Fight club it one of those films that the more you watch it, the more you want to watch it.  The intricacy of the story, combined with the hidden truth and the sarcastic humor make this in the list of my to ten films of all time.  But don't take my word for it.  See it today, just schedule accordingly!",10,2,6,4 May 2002
Eyes Wide Shut," 'They did a bad, bad thing!'
","This is one of the worst movies I have ever sat through.  It was definitely the worst Kubrick film.It's hard to imagine a film with this many beautiful women in it (especially Nicole Kidman) as being a waste of time, but it is.  The plot could be accomplished in about 30 minutes if all of the meaningless things had been left out.  You can skip the first half-hour and not be lost at all in the story.  The entire segment with the costume store clerk adds NOTHING to the plot of the movie.  What's more, all of the dialog and action feels like your watching the movie in slow motion.  (Hit your FF button and you'll notice that most characters appear to be moving at normal speed!)  Lead characters do not seem to change at all through out the film.  They react to things in one way, then, when those things change, the characters are still reacting the same way, as if the changes had not occurred.The worst part?  The story is completely anti-climactic!  Do sit waiting the ending that will make all the convoluted items come together because you're not going to get one.The most annoying part for me was this nasty habit that all the characters seemed to have:  One character would say a line, only to have it immediately repeated, as a question, by the other character.  Example: Character one says: 'You can't do that!'  Character two says: 'I can't do that?'  This little bit of abrasion occurs about 1000 times in an already exasperating film. I never tell people not to watch a film.  You need to make you're own assessment.  Just don't say that you weren't warned.",1,75,145,10 March 2000
