The Blair Witch Project," Comments to potential viewers and disappointed viewers
","'The Blair Witch Project' is one of the best movies to come along this year for many reasons. It features some of the best acting that I have seen in a long time, is shot creatively, and presents thoroughly believable characters in a story that is character driven. Plus, this film manages to truly get under the skin, providing a creepy and tense emotional experience.Now here are some things that this movie does NOT offer:<ul><li>Unnecessary state-of-the-art special effects</li></ul><ul><li>Scripted dialogues (neither the kind that are too stale and poorly written to be believable nor the kind that are too well-crafted or clever to seem real)</li></ul><ul><li>Verbal masturbation by actors (i.e. - overacting, show-off acting, or any kind of acting not necessary to successfully portray a character)</li></ul><ul><li>Cheap-thrills</li></ul><ul><li>Gratuitous sex</li></ul><ul><li>Gratuitous violence</li></ul><ul><li>Cardboard characters in a pre-packaged plot device</li></ul><ul><li>Happy endings with 'closure'</li></ul><ul><li>Spoon-fed entertainment with no thought or feeling</li></ul>
Unfortunately, the above list is what the average movie viewer wants, and when a film comes along that doesn't give them any such gratification, they tend to get lost.When one watches this movie or ANY movie for that fact, one should try to experience the film. Be there with the characters. That means no talking to your neighbor, no asking aloud what just happened (as if someone else _knows_ the answer), and no stepping outside of the film to sit safely in your chair. Concentrate on the events unfolding before you and give yourself over to what is precious about art: an emotional experience.If you let yourself go with this film, it _will_ work its magic on you.Does that mean you will jump out of your seat or get spooked?Doubtfully, though some people may. Most likely you will not have that kind of reaction - that is the fun roller-coaster kind of fear that audiences have come to expect from entertainment. This film is about real fear - the kind of disturbing emotional experience that comes from watching three individuals slowly transform into hysterical animals afraid of being trapped in a situation that is beyond their control.Why does it work? Not because of the fear of what's not on the screen, as many reviewers like to say. No, it works because - when you let yourself go with the film - the actors don't seem like actors performing for your entertainment; they seem like real individuals grappling with a horrifying situation.Anyone who gripes about why the filmmakers continue to film or why they do this or that is just actively trying to fault the film or isn't paying attention. Such a person is on some level resisting the experience of allowing himself to go with a very real and creepy film. The film explains that Heather is a film junkie who films everything compulsively. There are plenty of people who do this on trips. In addition, the film reveals that documenting everything is Heather's way of coping with a horrible situation.At several moments when it may seem silly to the third-party viewer that the cameras are still rolling, one must bare in mind that just because the camera is on doesn't mean that the cameraman is actively filming the events. The operator could have simply forgotten about the camera.Think about it: if you were filming something and were suddenly scared half-to-death, you wouldn't stop and turn the camera off; you would simply run, and that's exactly what happens in this film in many cases.At other times, the filmmakers continue filming in order to hold on to some sense of order in the chaos that has engulfed their reality. They are clinging desperately to one of the last remnants of the normal and modern world from which they have been separated by the increasingly menacing woods.'The Blair Witch Project' is an intelligent and inventive film that demonstrates what filmmaking is all about: an emotional experience. When a viewer goes in merely expecting something safe and entertaining, he will be sorely disappointed by 'The Blair Witch Project'. Such a case is sad, for the viewer who allows himself to go with this film will experience a truly disturbing and rewarding piece of art.",10,1,2,9 August 1999
The Amazing Spider-Man," THAT was Spider-Man! And he was pretty Amazing, indeed.
","I absolutely loved The Amazing Spider-Man and left the theater with a big grin of delight!I found the Raimi films fun and mostly good (except for the third film's ridiculous musical montage), but I also found them flawed. In particular, I found the romance uneven and stilted in the first set of films. That's why I was so pleased to know that the director of (500) Days of Summer was at the helm of this version - because he clearly knows how to do sweet and bittersweet romance. And he and his talented actors knocked it out of the park as far as I am concerned. Spider-Man was my favorite superhero growing up. I've been a fan since I was able to hold a comic in my tiny hands and for as long as I can remember. I enjoyed the Raimi versions and was glad to see Spidey on the screen, but Marc Webb's version absolutely nails the characters and the relationships and the overall flavor of Spider-Man, and the actors all sold it.Andrew Garfield embodies Peter Parker/Spider-Man. He is absolutely stellar. Emma Stone is great as Gwen Stacey, and these two leads deliver a thoroughly natural chemistry. All the other actors are solid in their supporting roles, and Marc Webb keeps it all feeling smooth, believable, and true to the spirit of the Spider-Man comics.The visuals are delightful and the 3D is used to enhance - not distract. It should definitely be seen in theaters!",10,4,12,4 July 2012
Transformers," Transformers fans and lovers of popcorn action rejoice!
","Transformer fans rejoice! Lovers of awesome action packed spectacle rejoice! Michael Bay has delivered us one hell of a cinematic roller coaster ride. This Transfan just had the pleasure of seeing a sneak preview of the new film that starts everywhere on July 3 (although there are some early showings on July 2 at 8PM and midnight) and I walked out of the movie theater with a great big smile on my face.Even the fact that it was pouring down rain and my car was a football field away from the entrance to the movie theater couldn't dampen my parade after this movie. This film delivers the goods on all accounts and delivers them in a big way! The action is fantastic, the special effects are perfect, and surprisingly enough (in such an action special effects driven feature) the actors all turn in great performances that add that extra special touch to the film. Also, the humor works very well and is satisfying and natural instead of silly and forced. Transformer fans will be pleased and yet people who don't have a clue who Optimus Prime or Megatron are will enjoy this ride, too judging by the enthusiastic reaction of my friend who knew nothing going into the film other than that it was a movie that featured giant transforming robots.About the only small complaint that I can offer is that they did such a great job with setting up the story and bringing the Transformers into the picture that they wind up having too little time in the epic finale to develop any of the Decepticon characters to the degree that lovers of the comic and show will remember. However, I'm sure that this will be rectified in the sequel that is hinted at by the movie's final minutes.Go see this movie as soon as you can on the big screen! You'll have a blast.So far this has been the best time at the movies all year for yours truly.What a great movie! Thank you, Michael Bay.",10,8,18,28 June 2007
The Matrix Reloaded," Excellent movie that enhances the original!
","I must confess: I never much understood all the fuss over the original Matrix from 1999, and I still do not. I left the theater after seeing that film having enjoyed myself, but by no means would I have classified the film as being worthy of having its name mentioned in the same breath as epic classics like the Star Wars trilogy. Further, it rather annoyed me when people made such a big deal over the film's shallow and unoriginal pseudo-philosophical ideas or its thinly drawn characters. In fact, although I did enjoy the first Matrix, the ridiculous mantle of greatness that people heaped upon its shoulders left a bad taste in my mouth that pushed me away from further viewings or even from looking forward to its sequels which, in my opinion, seemed unwarranted as I thought the original resolved quite nicely and left little room for sequels.	The Matrix Reloaded has changed all of that for me.	While The Matrix pieced together several unoriginal ideas in flashy and self-consciously hip ways with apparently little exciting thought beneath the surface or little effort to make them cohesive within the logic of its own framework, The Matrix Reloaded turns this analysis upon its head and reveals that the apparent inconsistencies within the first film were actually setups for a major twisting of what we thought we knew was happening. I will not spoil anything for those who have not seen the film, but I thoroughly enjoyed the genius of how the filmmakers redefine the events of the first film with this one and leave the viewer with a whole slew of possible scenarios and thought provoking questions at the film's end. What I find most impressive of all, is that I detected the hint of what might actually be a truly insightful and meaningful commentary on naturalism and miracles and the error of confusing an explanation of the facts with a proof of the relationship of said facts.  If I correctly surmised the presence of this theme, then it is one upon which I hope the third film expands. For those who have seen the film, the key story points that resulted in the one hundred and eighty degree turn in my evaluation of this film series occur during the Oracle scene, the Agent Smith(s) scenes, the Architect scene, and the finale.	I left the theater feeling extremely entertained and filled with both thought and that certain child-like sense of wonder that woefully few films ever manage to capture for me. Yes, with The Matrix Reloaded, The Matrix trilogy has catapulted itself into the realm of true film greatness in my estimation right beside the Star War trilogy and The Lord of the Rings.	Now I would not want any reader of this review going away thinking that I am unaware of the film's shortcomings. Indeed, it has many blemishes including: a few beautifully imagined and choreographed fight sequences that, while artful, were a bit too lengthy and too obvious in outcome to be fully satisfying; a dance sequence and sex scene that, while again done artfully and with nice cinematography, seem rather unnecessary and a tad too much like a music video sequence; some over-acting on the part of Lawrence Fishburne; a lack of chemistry between Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Ann Moss; and a slight tendency for some of the fight sequences to become cartoon-like in a film that wants to take itself seriously. In fact, these flaws led me to conclude half-way through watching The Matrix Reloaded that I would leave the theater disappointed because the film would not have even measured up to The Matrix Â– a film that I viewed as only being decent. Thankfully, however, the last twenty to thirty minutes of the film when combined with some details revealed in earlier scenes completely reversed my opinion of the film and even made a better movie out of the original in my eyes.	In summary, I loved The Matrix Reloaded - beauty, warts, and all. Thanks to the greatness of this film, I also have a better opinion of the first film, and I am counting the days until I can see what I hope will prove to be a very satisfying and epic conclusion in The Matrix Revolutions. In the meantime, I think I will go see this one again!",9,0,0,16 May 2003
