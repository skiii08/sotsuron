10 Cloverfield Lane," It's not a Cloverfield sequel
","I'm happy that I watched this movie before watching Cloverfield 2008, so I wasn't filled with a sequel expectations. I watched it as a standalone movie and I enjoyed it. Unfortunately most of bad reviews from people expecting a sequel, if there's no 'Cloverfield' in its title, the reviews would be totally better.",9,2,2,19 July 2018
