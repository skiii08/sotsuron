Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," FUNNY
",Sasha B-C is the king of characters. He seamlessly morphs into various hilarious characters and Borat is no exception. There are a lot of cringe-worthy moments in this film and you kind of feel sorry for Kazhakstanians but you can't help but laugh.,8,1,3,7 October 2018
Brokeback Mountain," So so sad.
",The portrayals by Ledger and Gyllenhal are so on point. The direction is on point with everyone emotional string. The music is beautiful. The ending without giving much away with shake your soul to its core! Love is love.,9,1,2,7 October 2018
Zodiac," Nice cast but slow.
",Honestly this film could have been a lot shorter and still hit the right notes. I love Jake Gyllenhaal but his presence could not save this film from being just mediocre.,6,0,2,6 October 2018
"I, Tonya"," Awesome
","Loved this film. Robbie did a fantastic job and as a skater myself, I really got into this film. It's a very quirky film and the actors bring very unique portrayals to their characters.",8,0,0,7 October 2018
Life of Pi," Touching
","You'll cry throughout! The production values and main actor were really impressive. I heard this guy had never been in anything before, so his performance was really impressive.",9,0,0,6 October 2018
Man of Steel," Snooze alert
","This film just did not revive Superman at all...despite the hype. It had all the other elements there but did not enthral me and watched it through to the end out of obligation more than anything. The pacing was off but I did enjoy the music, cinematography and the villain was compelling when he was on screen.",6,0,2,5 October 2018
American Beauty," Beautiful
","About 20 years ago a great film was made. It was American Beauty- the acting, the writing, the direction. My Gosh - I still get goosebumps throughout this film. Spacey is a great actor despite his dark unfortunate past. I still watch this film on repeat.",9,2,3,6 October 2018
Saving Private Ryan," Gore-fest with a heart-felt message about the tragedy of war
","This film is shocking and definitely paved the way for more WW2 films like this. I would say it's a very difficult watch, esp the Beach landing. Not for the faint hearted and it could trigger some. The direction and production values for its time were flawless.",9,1,1,5 October 2018
The Dark Knight," Dark and depressing
","It's a long film with very strong performances, of course Heath Ledger moreso than anyone else. Eckhart had his moments but the characterization just wasn't as strong. Christian Bale does an ok job at keeping a husky voice when Batman. Nolan's direction, the music and cinematography are all on point.",8,1,2,5 October 2018
Grindhouse," Interesting
","As usual, Rodriguez and QT bring some hard hitting violence into this two-part film. Definitely don't watch them back to back. The humor element comes up now and then and it can be refreshing as much as annoying. The acting and direction were superb.",8,0,1,7 October 2018
Con Air," Why low scores?
",This has to be one of the most TENSE siege/hostage film ever. I was hooked when I first saw this and no film has matched the level of intensity this film brings. Cage does an awesome job.,8,1,4,7 October 2018
Hancock," Weird film
",The pacing was really off. Will Smith is a great actor but I feel like he just could not carry this film.,6,0,1,6 October 2018
Thor: The Dark World," Averagre
",I have to say this does not compare to the sequel. Not as funny and the action sequences aren't nearly as good! Check out Ragnarok.,6,1,1,6 October 2018
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Nostalgia
","Watched this after so long following the flooding of new Star Wars films. Definitely the latest ones are better than episodes 1-3, but you just can't beat the original. The tone is a lot darker and thrilling. Watch this again, you won't regret!",9,0,0,5 October 2018
