Hereditary," Honestly, don't bother
","Unsettling, menacing, scary are all words you cant use about this film. Saw last night with others at Cineworld. Believed the hype. Tension isn't built and the climax (you'll have to wait till the last few mins to get this) is a huge let down. Says something when the whole audience laughed out loud at the floating woman. Toni Collette is fine but I wish someone had slapped her. We all thought it was a let fown and waste of money - it you must see it, wait till its out in DVD for a fiver.",2,7,17,20 June 2018
