The New World," an expression of pure mastery and art
","A lot of people have already commented graciously on this film so I'll make mine brief.I waited a year and a half for this to come out and saw it three times in one weekend and I can't wait to see it again. What an amazing piece of work! It well-exceeded my expectations and I'm utterly happy.The entire movie is a series of motifs and it's visually enthralling, I had a smile on my face the entire time.A little too fast in the beginning, it's good to know that the 3 hour DVD will follow suit. Definitely a must-see!! If you don't know Malick's work, prepare to be blown away.",10,2,6,28 January 2006
