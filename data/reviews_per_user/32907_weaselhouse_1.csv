10 Cloverfield Lane," Psych Thriller
","If you're looking for an action movie, you'll be sorely disappointed. The interesting aspects of the movie all revolve around the dialogue and analysing the intentions of the characters. If you're looking for something related to Cloverfield, or a high- energy high action movie you'll be (mostly) disappointed. As a psych thriller, it did really well, keeping the viewer guessing right up until the end. Is this an elaborate hoax so that an old man can live out his deranged fantasies, or this really an apocalypse? Is the hired hand really telling the truth, or is he just playing along to lend credibility to a scheme and to earn his pay?The bulk of the movie was believable as interesting as the viewer tries to analyze the motives of an unstable, delusional ex-military man. In the last 20 minutes it abruptly fails its audience, turning into a series of murders, explosions and aliens that bears no resemblance to the remainder of the film.",7,0,0,11 December 2016
