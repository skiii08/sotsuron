Requiem for a Dream," Disturbing yet true.
","This film shows how drugs will destroy your life.  The most horrifying part of the film is the old ladys story. This film was a very good one and is filmed in a way i haven't seen before. If you want some very good reasons why you shouldn't do drugs, watch the movie.",8,0,0,3 September 2001
