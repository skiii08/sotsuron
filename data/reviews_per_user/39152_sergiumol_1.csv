Blade Runner 2049," This was such a disappointment and disgust for me!
","Standard disclaimer:I have not seen the original movie,so I comment based on the feelings and disgust,this movie provoked me.SPOILERS AHEADThis is the one most boring and stupid movies I have ever seen. Forget about the visuals, there is no substance to the plot and many of the scenes are so incredibly long and boring as hell.I literally felt like watching those Turkish soap operas that take an age just for a character to walk 10 meters and turn around.Why show so many static scenes that had too much drama for the emptiness of the plot that was unfolding.And the constant synthesizer blasting noise for every scene of f***g traveling in that city was plainly awful.You would expect some explosive actions in connection with those imposing sounds ,but no.It starts with the main character who kills in cold blood an 'android' (who looks exactly like a human) that did nothing wrong and was minding his own business peacefully, just because he has to do it and I am supposed to feel for this serial killer for the rest of the movie, seriously?! In my opinion the normalization of murder,no matter the way it is disguised,present in these Hollywood movies,is one of the reasons of the mass crimes unfolding right now in USA.And you have no character development just some stupid revelations that take too long to happen and some gruesome scenes like when Wallace cuts the belly of that freshly born woman just so that she cannot procreate and leaves her bleeding on the floor.Don't even get me started on how they made Wallace look like Christ.This movie is just a satanic depiction of the director's evil imagination.Oh,and people say,'well the first movie was stellar and this is just a continuation of it' .I get it but this does not make this movie any better and to show this kind of disgusting atrocities to fresh audience just to satisfy the old 'fans' is just plainly wrong.I got out of the cinema cursing like hell.The ending is too abrupt, with the evil still being out there and the main character acting like nothing happened and that's it. There is no real revenge going on and no certain conclusion.I wish that after the self discovery of K ,he went after Wallace and reinstated order,with peace making between humans and androids,but instead he is just fine with killing Luv.I am not one of those action heads ,that dislikes everything else,but this movie is too much to bear in terms of pointless cruelty that does not go anywhere,for the whole 2.7 hours.I accentuate the fact that the visuals were amazing,even mind blowing ,but a film is more than that.There is nothing connecting you emotionally to the main character,so you would care about his faith,because he is just brainwashed evil to begin with.To sum it up, it was too much sterile gruesome violence and killings in cold blood, all shown in great landscapes and surroundings but nothing more.",1,11,23,14 October 2017
