Casablanca," Classic Americana
","Casablanca was a fantastic romance film but I feel as if people put it on a pedestal it doesn't deserve. Sure, the acting is terrific, the story relates to many people, and Michael Curtiz did a legendary job directing but what exactly made this movie the timeless classic it has become? I did enjoy the lighting in many scenes because it makes the viewer focus more on the charters facial expressions and body language, especially the scene in which Rick is alone drinking at the bar and Sam comes down to check on him it was also clever how the cigarette smoke blurs the screen and goes into Rick's flash back. The composition of the film is really what I enjoyed, everything is crafted so beautifully. The plot is great but just not for me I guess and if it wasn't for each scene being so artistically graceful I would have definitely lost concentration on the story. Definitely a master piece of 1942 that will never be forgotten but I would not agree with most that Casablanca is 'the greatest film of all time'. Give it a watch though if for some reason you were living under rock like me, guaranteed any viewer will find something they enjoy about the film.",8,3,5,23 April 2013
The Grapes of Wrath," Steinbeck's masterpiece
","This is a great movie with an epic story that is ultra realistic to issues people faced during the time period depicted. The cinematography is astonishing especially for a 1940 film and really helps set the mood of each scene. Tom Joad's journey is a captivating adventure, the struggles him and his family face throughout the film and the hardships overcome made me appreciative all the things I'm blessed with. When originally released I can imagine this film had a strong impact on American society because during the great depression many families had gone through similar situation and could relate. Strong acting done by Henry Fonda really helps to create a strong emotional bond to the characters. John Ford definitely did not disappoint in his adaptation of Steinbeck's most powerful story, truly a thought provoking perception on American life around the time of the great depression. A must see for anyone who enjoys classic masterpieces",8,0,1,6 March 2013
The Graduate," Hilarious yet awkward
",A stupendous comedy full of rich colorful acting and great cinematography. Dustin Hoffman plays the role of an awkward witty young man perfectly as does the seductive Mrs.Robinson (Anne Bancroft) in her role as the cougar. The story to this movie is a bit twisted so it is better off being viewed by a mature audience. During its era The Graduate was a very edgy film because the hays code had just been lifted and it was wonderful seeing America cinema begin to shed light on more adult subjects. The humor of this particular movie is captivating because of the realism put into it. Each awkward situation Ben becomes involved in had me chuckling just because as a viewer one really starts to sympathize with his incredibly awkward life. The ending is great and all but doesn't make very much sense rationally and the progression of Ben and Elaine's relations felt a bit rushed overall. Still a timeless classic and a must see for anyone who can get a good laugh out of a story so ridiculous.,9,0,0,22 April 2013
Singin' in the Rain," almost perfect
",After seeing this movie for the first time in life I was astonished at how good it really was and felt really stupid for never giving it a chance previously. Such a great story and an incredible cast of characters just full of charisma. Don Lockwood played by Gene Kelly is a great main character and a very likable fella throughout the film as the events of his acting career unfold before the viewer. Cosmo was my favorite charter though and I'm sure many other would agree he plays the perfect part of comic relief without overdoing it. The movie is full of good laughs and heartwarming moments that anyone with a soul could enjoy (unless you are evil) and is a very memorable film. The use of color in this film is also very impressive and artistic in many scenes I really enjoyed the creative merging of color into black and white plus the vibrant clothing and props used. An amazing film from the 1950's worth being viewed by anyone and everyone.,10,0,2,2 April 2013
Psycho," OG horror
",Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho is a god tier horror movie and I'd say its probably the best example of classic horror. The story has at this point been told and remixed 1000 different ways over the years but because of Alfred's understanding of human fear and his incredible skill as a director no other film maker can come close to creating as captivating of a psychopath as the infamous Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). I love the symbolism in the very last scene where Norman sits alone in the chair and claims he'd never hurt a fly. Very clever and unorthodox camera angles keep the viewer on the edge of their seat while watching this film especially during the scenes where Norman attacks his victims and the famous shrieking sound effect begins to play. If you have never seen this movie and enjoy horror movies it is definitely worth watching. Even though compared to current film it may seem dated because of the lack of special effects and computer animation the rawness and great use of music and sound effects by Hitchcock make this slasher flick stand the test of time.,8,1,1,2 April 2013
