The Sound of Music," THE GREATEST FILM...EVER
","I would like to say this is the greatest film I have ever seen.  I saw it 26 times in the Theatre.  Back then, before VCRs,  I never dreamed I would be able to own the film for home viewing.  It was the first video I ever purchased in 1982.  I lost count at 86 times seeing it and who knows how many hundreds of times I have seen it since. Every actor in the film was perfectly cast. I have felt as I were there with all the Von Trapp family and endured their lives as though it were my own. It is a CLASSIC and will be enjoyed by generations to come...Thanks to all the actors for bringing such joy to all who see it... !! If you haven`t seen this film..rent it immediately !!!!!",Null,0,6,3 May 2004
