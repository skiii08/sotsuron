Blade Runner 2049," Haydn Engel Reviews
","What happens when you pump millions into a film that will not make it back in theatres. The obvious answer is that you market it as something it is not. This is a standard practice in cinema, and it does nothing but exploit viewers and upend the general public's views of a particular film. Which destroys the ability of artistic directors to follow their vision, and it has always made me wonder if it would be at all possible to have two versions of a film in theatres at the same time. You could have a studio cut of the movie in those 64 screen multiplexes and in the indie theatres, where they serve spiced tea and apples behind the counter, you could have a director's cut because at the moment this ploy of marketing an arthouse flick as an action movie is doing no one any favours.DE: The directing is superb, though that has become a standard for Villeneuve. However, unlike his other films, this one draws on its shots for far too long and you could certainly feel like the editor could have stepped in a cut a good 10 minutes of this film and still leave that lingering desolation feeling. It almost feels like Villeneuve was trying to mimic Stalker in his approach, but unlike Stalker, the lingering shots feel inauthentic as in Stalker we are meant to be contemplating existence, religion, purpose, but in 2049 we are sitting at the heart of a mystery that feels like we are not trying to solve.W: The dialogue is decent, yet a little clunky and on the nose. And sadly that is the best part of it. Though I am not shocked Hampton Fancher, the man who penned the original script is back, however in the subsequent 25 years he has written nothing of note, so obviously the studio brings in the standard scriptwriter in the guise of Michael Green, who did pen Logan but also penned Alien: Covenant and the much-maligned Green Lantern. This combination leaves us with a film that barely has a plot and does not delve into anything of note. However, it does likely explain why Villeneuve structured the film the way he did and why there are so many drawn-out shots.C: This is so beautifully shot that it should be taught in schools and, sadly, this film was Deakins's first Oscar out of 13 noms, though his second would come with the gorgeous 1917. His use of the camera and understanding of a shot is fantastic, and if one sees the rest of his works, they can see a shift in style for this film, and while those long lingering shots may be a pain for the storyteller visually, they are perfect representations of what you are trying to get across. The mood and notion are there in every frame. The angles and shadows that are being cast on Gosling throughout the film speak volumes. The special effects, while excellent, do not feel genre-defining or like 25 years have passed since the original.A: Ford cannot act at a level beyond a 6, and that is fine. He is there because he has to be. Gosling's muted touch was decent enough though I worry he is going to get typecast as wooden if he keeps on the path he currently is on. Sylvia Hoeks, one would assume was hired for her visual aesthetic rather than her ability to emote, which if this was Tarrantino flick, I think she would have worked. But in this nuanced, subtle drawn-out film her character comes off cartoonish.
I was incredibly impressed with Ana de Armas and found her performance soulful yet understated. The mechanical I am saying what I suppose to yet am still a creature with almost a concept of feelings really elevates Goslings numbed performance.S: I would have scored this higher if I had not seen Arrival, whereas the industrial style sound design should have been more engaging. I could not help feeling they were reusing it. Of course, the sounds were meant to be jarring given all the silence we were fed, but ultimately it feels like that opening sequence in the remake of Funny Games, it is not shocking or grating in the sense the creator wants, but more in the sense, please turn down the TV those noises are starting to give me a headache.PD: The PD in this film was quite good, the sets feel real and lived in. Especially the opening sequence. Rebuilding on a franchise that is famous for its visual effects and the PD is not easy, but they were able to meet a standard that has been heralded for decades. Dennis Gassner did well here as is expected. He has almost always been brought in when you need a world that feels distant, yet somehow still retains elements of the one we live in. See his work in the Truman Show, Big Fish and 1917 for this.BA: Well done throughout, especially Leto's character, though I will say the only real negative was Wright's outfit. What is this 2049 and she is channelling the 50's or was she literally a copy of the police chief from Futurama? Also, Ford's entire presence was uninspired.",8,0,4,7 May 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Haydn Engel Reviews
","Real rating: 77.5/100
Critics love Tarantino because he loves cinema and they can associate with that, and they get all of his references, which can be lost on your average viewer. It is the same reason movies set in LA often get a few noms or wins during Oscar season that many would call questionable. This is not to detract from Tarantino's talent. The man is a great writer, though as of late he has become a blowhard. Scripts are long and drawn out, and then they all crash into an ending that seems tacked on rather than built to which begs the question does he even know where he is going with his films anymore. It is not visionary, it is repetitive and showing very little sign of growth. He is a craftsman who carves an excellent movie each time, but they are more or less the same.DE: Tarantino runs a decent ship, and Hollywood is no different. Everything seems to be on point. Every department is hitting its marks, and we are building a tale in his distinct (if that is the right word) style. In terms of editing, the loss of Sally Menke can be felt in every one of his films since she passed. She somehow was able to contain him and give a better structure. Though from seeing her works outside of the Tarantino verse, you can see he had an equal part in elevating her. Together they were able to take his longwinded approach and make it come off with a steady pace and allow decent investment from the audience, but now however that is slipping away at a fast pace with each subsequent film.W: Tarantino is one of the great writers, he is not on Miyazaki's or Anderson's level, but he is undoubtedly on the same level as the Coen brothers or Bong Joon-ho. Which is not a level to sniff at, but the problem with Tarantino's writing is that he may have switched genres, but he has not adapted to it. More that he has made another Tarantino movie with a new shell on it. Which is great, but if I wanted to see the same thing as before I might as well watch the classics. It is sort of like a band doing a new tour 20 years later trying to flog the new stuff that sounds far too similar to the old stuff, and the fans would much rather prefer to hear the hits.C: Have you seen a Tarantino, Scorsese or Oliver Stone movie? Then guess what you have seen Robert Richardson's work and along with it some iconic shots that have littered avatars and uni students bedrooms for decades. His outing this time is impressive, though it might not match a level that he created. That said the lens seems to tell more of a story here than Tarantino's writing, which tells you everything you need to know.A: Acting is stereotypically cartoonish, but that has become a standard for Tarantino. Though Pitt's depiction of the more sane character throughout this 2D world of actors stands out. Sadly given the cast, we are working with, and the sheer level of talent coupled with the extent in which we examine these characters lives it feels underwhelming, and each one is more an allegory than a persona in their own right.S: As strange as it seems the sound department is usually one of the reasons I watch a Tarantino film. Since Inglourious Basterds someone in the sound department is getting an Oscar nom, whether it is music, mixing or editing. Without fail Hollywood continues this trend. Just excellent.S: As strange as it seems the sound department is usually one of the reasons I watch a Tarantino film.

Just excellent.PD: This film is not pretending to be the 1960s, it is the 1960s. I know you have seen many a period piece, and they all do a decent job, but it is the subtle nuances and the dirt that make the difference. This is not a glossy veneer trying to rewrite a section of history, this is just trying to capture an era for better or worse. This may be down to the fact that Tarantino is obsessed with the period and only a slight glance at his oeuvre would back this notion up.BA: The costume design, while simple is also great, it catches the style of the era without feeling like it is overexaggerating the form or the zeitgeist of the time. The visual effects in the latter portion of the film while jarring are quite well done and stand out.EVO: It is not one of Tarantino's 'funner' films, which is odd given that it is a bright nostalgia backed film told from the perspective of mostly positive souls. If you are a Tarantino completest, you are going to want to see it, but for many, the question of why did I sit through that for 3 hours will ring true on the lips, and while the film is crafted brilliantly I cannot help but finding myself siding with them.",7,0,3,8 May 2020
Schindler's List," Haydn Engel Reviews
","Strong and persuasive without being visceral. Schindler's List touches on the lives of many without feeling too sentimental to its subjects. It wants to be objective and given what we have seen throughout the history of cinema, propaganda and jingoism. One needs an honest look at the tragedies of humanity.
BE: It is Spielberg's masterpiece, and like Coppola, he spent the first little while trying to emulate it and then decided to just shoot whatever he wanted. The film is pure vision and drive. Everyone on set put in their best performance, and as always Spielberg's sequencing is outstanding, and most should be jealous with how easily he pulls it off. The editing is high class. With only a few issues here or there. It is incredible to think in a 195-minute movie that there are not huge chunks that you could remove, but somehow the editing has kept this behemoth of a film moving along at a steady pace.
W: The dialogue is quite good, but one cannot help but feel that there is a touch of the Hollywood pen in the script, and it is Zaillian writing, so that goes without saying. Other than the faux tension ratching, it is very decent.
C: Arguably Kaminski's best film, though the argument against that is Saving Private Ryan. So you can decide for yourself. That said, other than a few stutters with the camera. Like in the shot where they are bringing the lens down from the bridge to the boat. The film is shot perfectly for how you want this story to be portrayed, and that is what cinematography is supposed to do, it is supposed to accentuate the story. And the girl in red scene shall remain one of my favourites of all time. The shower scene aside, the visual effects excellent.
A: Liam Neeson's best role, before he showed the world that much like Harrison Ford, he plays the same character in almost every film. Thankfully at this point, he is still fresh. Ralph Fiennes built a career from this role, and he would remain a constant in parts in need of snivelling yet powerful monsters for years after, but no character has matched his performance in Schindler's List and rightly so it is a convincing portrayal of a man lost in his convictions yet still has a shred of the humanity that existed in him before the war. Kingsley is excellent with a subdued performance, which is usually the best Kingsley, Sexy Beast aside. It gives Neeson's performance something to bounce off and allow for a better emotional understanding of the character.
S: The sound is excellent, and the score is terrific. So much so it does make me ponder whether Spielberg's film would be the same without it? Williams builds tension that spills morosely over tragedy and celebratory fatigue.
PD: Is excellent save for the few touches in the concentration camps and only the most anal filmgoers are going to pick up on that.
BA: Authentic and eye-catching, though does fall victim to the standard nerd mistakes and the black-white filming does prevent it from being a little higher as it could be hiding a plethora of errors, but as is seen, it is well done.
EVO: This is not a relaxing Tuesday flick, but it is a flick anyone with a love of films or humanity should see. I have not seen many people who have disliked it, Rita Kempley aside. It is a tough watch for some, but it is rewarding in its own way.
Notes: This film is one of the ones that made me realise there needs to be a standard with critics they do not need to follow mine, but they need to explain what they are ranking. The reality is their review is 90% EVO and with no thought put in. Take Rita Kempley who wrote for The Washington Post. She gave Schindler's List a 60, Pulp Fiction a 70, Supergirl the 1984 movie was given an 80, Mary Reilly was a 70, Splash a 100, so Splash is a perfect movie whereas Schindler's List is barely passable under what metric? She also ranks the Wedding Singer at 70 and Das Boot as a 60. All I learned from her reviews is that she likes crappy romantic comedies and does not appreciate long drawn out films, and if she was some person on IMDB filling out a review that would be fine. But when you are the film critic for supposedly one of the best newspapers in the USA. It looks foolish, with no sense of purpose. When you are ranking Summer School (1987) as an arguably better film than Schindler's List than maybe you should not be a film critic. Which raises the question of what are film critics judging? And do they even understand cinema?",9,0,1,8 May 2020
