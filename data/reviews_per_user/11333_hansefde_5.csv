Ford v Ferrari," I thought the story was fake because Hollywood, but it actually happened!
","What an amazing movie and stellar performance from Christian Bale. In fact the whole movie is not about LeMans or Ford, but about this wonderful character Ken Miles. After seeing the movie I guessed it was all exaggeration Ã  la Hollywood, but after doing some digging I came to the conclusion it was all historically correct. He was really that brilliant test/racing driver and engineer, mainly responsible for the development of the GT40. Disliked by the Ford management because of his attitude and outspoken opinions and robbed from his LeMans victory by these same people. Besides the story, the racing is visually stunning and the CGI crashes make you duck in your seat. A masterpiece you should watch on the big screen. Only criticism is the stupid Fast and Furious like shifting and turbo noise when the engine is pushed towards 7000rpm. Why Hollywood, why?",9,1,2,19 November 2019
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Even better than HTTYD1
","Rarely a sequel is better than the first one, but here it is. The graphics are stunning, but more importantly the story deals with difficult questions. While the first movie was about trust and friendship, How to train your dragon 2 is about dealing with the death of relatives, becoming mature and being able to take responsibilities. It's a big step for a teenager becoming mature and this movie deals with it brilliantly. Yes it's an animated movie, but adults will like it as much as children. One to watch for the whole family. An epic movie.",9,1,2,3 January 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Leia is Superwoman? What?
","The Last Jedi is an insult to the viewer. The script is horrific with unacceptable plot holes and erratic behaviour of the main characters, the average soap has a better story line. The acting is terrible, where did they find these actors? The bits that are meant to be funny are childish and out of place. The movie is stuffed with SJW stuff, child labour, weapons trade, woman rights, animal treatment, you name it, it's in there. I was surprised there was no Trump bashing. The movie has many useless scenes, it could easily been half an hour shorter. Avoid this movie at all cost.",1,4,7,3 January 2018
Arrival," The trailer does not do it justice!
","I was reluctant to watch this movie, but my son several times urged me to watch it. Why? I saw the trailer, it looked like an Independance Day rip off. How wrong I was, the movie starts slowly but the scenes are powerful and make you think and eager for what's coming next. The plot is ingenious, I didn't see it coming and made me smile. Forget the trailer, this movie is not about violence and war against aliens, it is so much more. Performances of the main actors are enjoyable and very convincing. Worth watching and belongs amidst the greatest scifi movies.",9,0,1,3 January 2018
Midway," A tribute to the real heroes of our past.
","Just came back from the cinema and am still wowed by this film. It's a nice blend of quiet scenes where we get to know the characters and intense war scenes. Try not to get a high hartbeat when you're in the seat of a dive bomber, going down fast towards a Japanese carrier while being greeted by a hailstorm of bullets and grenades. The courage these pilotes had is beyond belief. I was on the edge of my seat. This is one of the best war movies to date and it has been kept true to the real story and people. I was afraid it would go the route of Pearl Harbour but luckily they stayed away from cheesy scenes.",9,11,19,11 November 2019
