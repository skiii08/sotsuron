Saturday Night Fever," Movie that inspired a generation and more!
","When this movie came out, I was a teen and still in school. It seemed like just a simple movie about a simple guy. But it ended up inspiring me and probably millions of people to embrace the nightclub scene. Unfortunately the end result is'nt that positive, most of my friends who are serious club kids did'nt necessarily turn out all that successful.Ironically the friends of mine that have stayed out of this lifestyle are doing much better than the ones who got seriously enmeshed in it. But the question you have to ask is who is having a more exciting and fun life? If you can survive the life without turning into a raging alcoholic or drug addled dancing fool, or survive getting into the fights that sometimes erupts, or the potential for car wrecks after you leave the scene, the club scene is a very exciting and fun time. This movie still inspires and excites many people, but beware! The lifestyle can be very dangerous and the trick to surviving it is the leave a lot more earlier than everyone else and you'll miss most of the dangerous aspects of this lifestyle!",9,0,2,21 June 2011
The Departed," Very confusing plot, but somehow still somewhat entertaining...
","I have read quite a few books about the events detailed in this movie. Even with this encyclopedic information at hand, I still found the movie very very confusing and I think it was because they tried to make it an amalgam of all the Infernal Affairs movies and also incorporate the real stories into one coherent story. The one big noticeable thing that the movie does not cover is how the BPD probably had the most moles working for all the different factions. Since a lot of the BPD are drawn from all the different neighborhoods in Boston, the complexities of their various clan and ethnic loyalties probably deserve a movie of their own.The acting was pretty good, but I have definitely seen better performances from all the principals in other movies. With a plot so byzantine, their heads must have been spinning trying to keep things straight!",7,1,2,21 June 2011
Fast Five," Pretty entertaining...
","Only watching four movies a year at the theaters now, I went to see this movie out of my vestigial interest in fast cars left over after years of owning sports cars and fast cars...The plot line is pretty much just an excuse for insane chase scenes that defy the laws of physics and just all the other laws out there.The target audience will enjoy the movie, but this movie did not really bring anything new to the table as far as the cars, it brings in cast members from the previous sequels and does'nt even try to explain the connections. Besides these little quibbles, I have never seen a movie where they used so little actual real natives. They only used Rio as a backdrop and huge set, clearing the streets almost completely for all the scenes. But now that I think about it, that was the way all of the movies have been made. Tokyo drifts main Japanese protagonists were all either mixed or Korean!",7,0,1,4 June 2011
Moon," Great movie for thinkers...
","This is the best Science Fiction movie I have seen in a long time. It has bits and pieces of Alien, 2001 and a couple of other science fiction movies. The acting was superb, the plot tight and the premise very realistic. The most unrealistic part of the movie was the robot. By the time we do put a station on the moon, we would not stick a robot that looked like a mobile compactor. If it was a straight man we put on the moon, the android would be female and have all the moves and parts that the dude would need. Or to save some money they would just stick a gay dude up there and build an android with male parts. Which would be the less expensive option probably. Actually I think they would not stick just one person up there, it would just be too boring and all that isolation is a recipe for disaster.But besides that little quibble, this movie has made my top fifteen science fiction movies of all time...",8,2,4,1 July 2009
