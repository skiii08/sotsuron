Hereditary," Overestimated !
","Hereditary is considered as the new reference of horror movies. Really ?!? I've just watched the DVD and I think that Hereditary is incredibly overrated. The story is poor and lacks of originality. Everything on the screen has been showed again and again, and there is absolutely no suspens in the course of events. So the movie is just long and boring, with a completely ridiculous ending.",3,1,3,25 August 2018
The Mummy," Looks like a two hours demo of Tomb Raider mixed with Prince of Persiah
","I don't understand all those good reviews. The Mummy is nothing but a poor Indiana Jones-like movie with bad story, poor acting, and awful videogame aesthetic. There is nothing in this movie that has not alteady been seen. Re-watch old adventure movies as Jason and the Argonauts, Simbad, or The Thieve of Bagdad if you want great entertainment and fantasy, but please avoid this kind of rotten adventure movie.",5,3,7,17 December 2018
Silent Hill," Very very bad trip to Silent Hill
","Oh my God, why is this movie so high rated on IMDB ? Even while searching carefully, there is absolutely nothing interesting to say about it. Nothing good in any case...
 So you can watch this movie if you have a couple of hours to waste. Otherwise, you will definitely prefer to look for your old PS1 and play the video game again.",2,0,2,29 March 2018
