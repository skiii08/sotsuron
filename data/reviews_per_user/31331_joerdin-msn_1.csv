Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Good Enough follow up of a trilogy series,but the worst
","On strangers tides is a worthy fourth film of this saga although it could have been better,,mostly the film is terrible,but the last percents are good,,in between the film is completely boring and not even funny,very little 'excitement action' in this last film compared to the others,and the film is completely obvious,,,not too much surprises herebut have fun with it=)human mermaids wt=) Lol, =)~~Captain Teague: Don't be a fool, Jackie. The fountain will test you. Jack Sparrow: I thought I should give you warning. We're taking the ship. It's nothing personal. Barbossa: Gentlemen, the fountain is the prize. Mermaid waters, that be our path. Jack Sparrow: There'll be dangers along the way... firstly mermaids, zombies... Blackbeard. Gibbs: I hear a rumor... Jack Sparrow is in London, hellbent to find the Fountain of Youth.",7,0,0,21 May 2011
