Walk the Line," I liked the movie, but...
","The movie itself was entertaining, but I disliked how they portrayed a woman who lived with her husband sleeping around with another woman as a true witch. They REALLY made Vivian Cash out to be a nagging whiner while June was made out to be an angel/saint. Even while sleeping with another woman's husband! To some, love is an excuse to have no morals, but what June Carter-Cash did to this family is inexcusable. How could he focus on his family when he was chasing this tart around. She did not, would not remove herself from his life. And he was no better. His drug addiction played a big part in his divorce, and I am glad June was there to pick up the pieces with him, but she was wrong. Period. That's my opinion. How is his wife supposed to compete with a playtoy? She was stuck at home living REALITY, while June (while leaving her own children as well) were in a playland. Of course the realities of life seem boring when you have a plaything, drugs, limelight... How could Vivian and her children compete with that? Anyway, I'll probably get blasted from all the June Lover/Excusers here, but that's my opinion of the movie, and I guess of June and Johnny as well.",8,0,5,10 April 2006
