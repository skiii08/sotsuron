Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Get over it, it wasn't that bad
","Having read the opening review on the page, it seems once again that the over the hill Star Wars fans, the ones who have the original trilogy committed to their hearts want to spend more time bashing Phantom Menace. While it is true that this is not the classic the trilogy was, it still deserves more than the shallow whining about Jar Jar, the complaints about the repetition of the story or certain scenes and the fact that the film was not Gone with the Wind.The main problem with Phantom Menace isn't really the film, it is the viewers. That's right. Months after the film opened, all I heard was how better The Matrix was. When I finally saw it, I didn't know what the fuss was about. It has the same major flaws as Menace-lame dialogue, stilted acting, an over-reliance on visual effects and a cribbing from other films, namely Blade Runner, 2001 and yes, Star Wars. But since it had hard rock music, enough machine guns going off for 3 Arnold movies and no comic sidekicks it was a classic, while Menace was seen as a shrill repeat of earlier installments.What most fail to see is that Phantom Menace is setting up not just one trilogy but two. Of course Lucas might want to have a lightweight story for the first chapter. After all, in the next two it will be Darth Vader and some death and destruction for the Jedi. As for the charge of repeating itself, what film series doesn't. Every films series, from Star Trek to Lethal Weapon to The Godfather repeats itself. Again people didn't want to here that.While this might not change anybody's view of the film, at least give it a chance and see that there is more there than the critics and the geeks complain about.",Null,1,2,5 July 2001
The Others," Probably the best film of the summer, despite the naysayers
","Having looked at the last couple of comments, it seems that the viewers must come from the Michael Bay/Bruckheimer school of film studies-explosions, dumb characters and enough noise to deafen people. What makes The Others unique is that it is quiet. It isn't Scream or even Blair Witch, but rather a somber film that takes it's time to build up to the climax. The best horror films-Psycho, The Silence of the Lambs, The Sixth Sense, Halloween-take the same approach of building up the tension through characters and mood, not computer generated creatures. The Others also succeeds thanks to the characters not being cliched. They all have personality, unlike the nameless bimbos who populate Friday the 13th and other type of films. Sadly the naysayers seem to be winning, since such 'is this trip necessary' sequels like American Pie 2 and Rush Hour 2 are ruling the box office. Let's hope that word of mouth spreads, because it would be a shame if a fine movie like this makes less money than such brain dead travesties like Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes and the aforementioned. Go see it.",Null,0,0,22 August 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The best overhyped flick ever?
","After having sat through the first installment of The Lord of the Rings, I don't know whether it was great or a disappointment. Let me explain. Thanks to all the prerelease hype, including all those gushing reviews from the critics (who must be getting a portion of the profits for giving it glowing reviews) I sat down believing I was about to see the greatest fantasy flick ever, a film to give Star Wars a run for its money.But for some reason it never seemed to click. Having recently reread the Fellowship of the Ring, I come away with the old mantra--the book was better. Even at three hours, the film seemed to fast forward to get to the battle scenes. Frodo's evacuation from Hobbiton was really rushed, lacking the suspense of Tolkien's book. Also the film seemed to only briefly glance over some sections, like the journey over the mountain and through the mines way to quickly. In fact the film only came alive for me towards the end, after Gandalf's battle with the Balrog. The real emotion everyone is babbling about finally spurts forward and it made the last part some of the best cinema I've seen all year.In addition, if this flick wins the Oscar for best visual effects, I'll probably fall over laughing. While some of the effects work, the Orcs reminded me too much of the goblins from Ridley Scott's Legend, the cave troll looked more laughable than the bathroom troll from Harry Potter and the opening battle made the droid/gungan battle from The Phantom Menace look better. What did work? The performances for one. Ian McKellen was forceful and effective as Gandalf, Viggo Mortensen kicked butt as Aragorn and it was cool to see Christopher Lee as Saruman. (Hope he gets a lot to do in both Star Wars Episode II and The Two Towers.) And Elijah Wood got the job done as Frodo. In the end, was The Fellowship of the Ring the greatest movie ever? Not exactly. Was it the best fantasy flick ever? Maybe (then again considering Willow and Legend are the competition). Do I want to see the next chapter. You bet, if only for the hope that The Two Towers will become the fantasy film version of The Empire Strikes Back. I hope.",Null,0,0,25 December 2001
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Harry vs. Frodo vs. Anakin: The Fight Begins
","First things first, I have a tendency to look for common themes and complaints it seems. Having looked at some of the reviews here, there are two common ones split between those who love this flick and those who loathe it. Those who love it seem ready to bash other flicks, especially The Phantom Menace, as being not as good, while those who are bashing it bemoan how it rips off too many scenes from the Star Wars films. In addition it seems that the followers of Tolkien (or geeks as many of us, myself included were referred to in high school) are beating up on Harry as the Lord of the Rings movie approaches. Let's think about this first. All three series are different animals made by different filmmakers and appealing to different audiences. All three are awaited (and somewhat hindered) by legions of devoted fans who will not accept anything but the best. Thus the current complaints that Harry isn't the book, it isn't Lord of the Rings, etc seems more in line with the recent IMDB poll about which fanbase is more obsessive. (Thankfully all three lost to that overachiever of geekdom, Star Trek).Harry Potter was a decent film made from a good book. I admit I have read all four books and enjoyed them. What I think is happening, especially with the Tolkien heads is that they are irritated with the fact that Harry has gotten all the attention and that, despite how good Fellowship of the Ring turns out, it will never equal Harry at the box office due to the fact that kids won't be turning out like they did with Potter.Let's lighten up people. These are films, not matters of life and death. They are made to be enjoyed. Obviously these are not film school flicks made to be dissected like a David Lynch movie for hidden meanings. They are popcorn flicks through and through. And stop beating up on the other geeks.",Null,0,0,13 December 2001
