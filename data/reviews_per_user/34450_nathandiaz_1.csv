Hereditary," Avenues of thought
","A visually striking film. I love how the tree house was depicted against the birch wood trees, and how the mothers heater made it light up red. It was also stricking how the rooms of the home were in such likeness of the models she was constantly creating. The movie left me with two possible avenues of thought. Was there paronormal activity influenced by a cult in order to bring some lord of Hell into our worldly plain, or was everyone within the family, apart from the father, stricken with mental illness? It would be a tasteful twist if they were all just experiencing a form of schizophrenia and that it really was Hereditary.",9,20,36,22 June 2018
