Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," When will I learn to ignore the critics?
","Before seeing Episode I, the critical buzz used terms like 'humorless' and 'lack of expected foreshadowing'.  What movie did they watch?This Episode had lots of Star Wars humor.  Ok, Jar Jar took some getting used to, but that's because we were TOLD he was annoying.  I found myself really getting into his dialogue. Meesa lovin dat talky, no?Foreshadowing?  Anakin built C3PO, and we get to hear that great intro of his about Human-Cyborg relations. They make light of his lack of covering. We know how nice and shiny he'll be some day.Anakin fears he will never see his mother. 'Fear is the path to the Dark Side' Yoda says.I'm convinced the idiots who saw the movie before us didn't understand what a privilege it was, and for some reason they tried to torpedo the flick.The movie is as good as it could be.  I await Episode II with as much excitement as I did this.  I was not at all disappointed.",8,0,0,26 May 1999
