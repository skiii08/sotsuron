Hereditary," I Have Never Been More Uncomfortable
","Horror movies are supposed to be scary, right? Well this movie is very scary but that's not what makes it a horror movie. The horror in this film is the sheer uncomfortability throughout the entire experience. The majority of the film is neither satanic nor paranormal. It's a very uncomfortable drama with a lot of anticipation for something scary to happen. Things are weird and things are unsettling but that's it. Fir a while. 
The first part that made me cringe was the decapitation. It was sudden, horrifying, and absolutely scarring. Especially, as Peter simply shuts down. It happens and he doesn't go to look at her and he doesn't do anything but drive home and lay in bed, never acknowledging what happened. We don't even truly know if she was decapitated. All we see is the mother crying in several settings, including the funeral, and then finally, a sudden close-up of Charlie's bug infested head on the side of the road. What an absolute nightmare!
Not only is the film extremely uncomfortable up to that point, but then it becomes legitimately scary on top of it. Suspense, fear, an uncomfortable sensation that won't go away. This movie messed me up and made me truly disturbed. Well done. There's imagery of the mother clung to the ceiling, violently and rhythmically bashing her head into the attic door. Previous to this shot, we hear banging on the door but it doesn't seem practical as it's a door on the ceiling and she's on the ground. Then we see that imagery and it just made me sigh out loud. Then, there's naked smiling people hiding in shadows, and Peter's reflection is of himself smiling, and there's decapitaed corpses in the attic and there's the mother cutting her own head off with a wire and then other sorts of fun stuff. 
Another horrifying aspect is that of control. In school the characters were talking about if a story is more tragic is a character can control their fate. In this case I think it's more tragic that they can't control their fate. The mother was under some sort of possession and we can tell there's a true mother wanting to protect her kids vs the demon that has another agenda. The demon mother is shown sneering at her son at the table like an angry child, she screams at him about trying to abort him (then we see the true mother stop herself and immediately apologizing as she didn't know why she said that), and then entire sequence of her crawling on the ceiling trying to chase her son from bashing her head through the door to slicing through her own throat with a wire. We're rooting for the mom to save her son (like the one in The Babadook). We witness her horrible journey throughout the whole film and were skeptical of her, her true good intentions, and if she's possessed or not. Then, we see her discover the truth about everything and attempt to save everyone and defeat the bad guys. However, this immediately leads to her loss of control, her leading to her son's fate and then to her very gruesome and horrifying death. 
Likewise, the poor son is being tortured throughout this whole movie. He barely did anything wrong. His sister's death is very controversial in terms of fault. Yes, he was high while driving. Yes, he was speeding. Yes, he should've kept a closer eye on his sister. However, he didn't have to bring Charlie, that was his moms decision. Charlie wasn't careful and got into an allergic trouble. Being a great brother, he immediately reacted to the situation and tried to save her. He ran out of the house away from his crush, carrying his sister in his arms. As she's losing her ability to breathe, he speeds down the road trying to reach the hospital and tries to comfort her on the way. We're rooting for him because he's finally doing something good and we don't want Charlie to die. When Charlie puts her head out the window, it's not his fault. He was going fast but that was to save her life and he was high but there's no way he could've forseen this happening. Also, it's completely bad luck that as she had her head out the window, there'd be a dead animal in the road and a pole that would lead to her decapitation. There's a lot going on here and we can't entirely blame Peter for her death. Also, was it really just bad luck? This could easily be part of the master plan. It's no coincidence she was decapitated as the other female family members were. It would make sense to stage this because Charlie would be dead and the family, especially their target Peter, would be vulnerable. This way they could put Charlie's soul into Peter's body, as they do in the end. 
With this torture, Peter is also tortured in school and haunted constantly. He is even possessed and forced to smash his face into his desk. With this, he's constantly dead looking and even cries like a child throughout the movie. It's heartbreaking to see and crushing, because he can't do anything about it. He finally fights back in the end, but dies in his attempt to escape. He was never in control which makes it that much more tragic. This film is Rosemary's Baby meets The Babadook meets The Amityville Horror. The mix of suspense, gore, terror, and uncomfortability is absolutely perfect and horrendous for a horror film. It succeeds the cliches and jump-scare-relying films that we normally get. Hereditary is a gem, masterpiece, unconventional addition to the genre, homage to the classics, and one of the most true depictions of terror and fear I've ever seen.",10,18,35,8 July 2018
John Wick," More Interesting Than A Regular Action Film
","This is an incredible action film. I was surprised by how enjoyable it is. It has heart wrenching moments, amazing fighting, great music, incredible cinematography and editing, spectacular acting, and among most cliche action movies, this was the most realistic. Also, the element of an 'assassin society' is incredibly interesting and makes the film not only more meaningful, but makes the sequels more meaningful too. If it was a trilogy of the same revenge story with new villains, it would get boring. However, with the addition of an overarching element, things are more interesting.
Also, the film scores extra points for Willem Dafoe, David Patrick Kelly, and music by Marilyn Manson.",10,3,5,20 May 2019
Dirty Dancing," Fantastic film with great music and characterization
","I love this movie. It's cute, fun, romantic, good-hearted, funny, and overall a great film. Jennifer Grey is incredibly adorable in the weirdest way possible and her character as an endlessly motivated do-gooder is New York perfect character. Unlike Grease or other films, she doesn't change into the bag girl and get the guy by giving up her true identity. Rather, she fights for what's right, accepts tough changes, comes clean with her father, and tastes a bit of the wild side from secretly dancing, romancing, and... well taking her father's money for abortion without his knowing (and not her abortion). If anything she changes for the better as she breaks out of her shell, lives more, and stays true to herself and her character. 
Also, the dancing and music in this film are incredible. I love the time period, the atmosphere, the soundtrack, and everything about this film. I'd love to revisit it just to relive it and be part of its world again.",10,0,0,5 July 2018
Les Mis√©rables," MINDBLOWN Phenomenal movie!!!!!!
","Warning there are major spoilers: I saw this movie in theaters and I just have to say it was amazing. Just wonderful and perfect and marvelous and words unable to describe it. I was mind blown. This movie is better than Lincoln. Some movies I have seen were hard to follow and some I couldn't understand. Others had a scene or two that were unneeded or made no sense; but in the two and a half hours I saw, I understood every line and every scene perfectly without doubt. I would love to write a synopsis for this film or answer any questions (email me: jurassickid97@gmail.com). Luckily I was learning about the French Revolution the day before which gave me a little background on the movie. Not much but I knew the poor people are the Third Estate and revolted because of famine. Most of the dialog in the movie was singing which didn't really bother me and that's the only reason it can be considered a musical. There were no random moments of singing and dancing. Also, the actors were phenomenal; all of them. I've always known Hugh Jackman as the Wolverine and figured he would be sucky in a musical albeit he was the best actor in the movie and did an amazing job. Russel Crowe, however, was also a great actor and with my obsession and utter admiration for villains, his role as the antagonist, Javert, was great and showed great villainous qualities. The way he hunted Jackman's character down (for stealing bread, running away and refusing parole) and showed no mercy even after Jackman saved him, showed forgiveness and let him live after years of hunting him made him a good villain. But then, my favorite scene, was when he stood on the bridge and looked into the waterfall rapids and decided to jump off was amazing and just perfect. I loved that scene so much. I really did. Not only did he fall off a tremendous height into the crashing rapids but he plummeted into the concrete edge of the waterfall. It was cruel and violent and just so intense. Unlike Lincoln whereas the assassination of Abe was anticlimactic and kind of disappointing. This suicide was very climatic and gut-wrenching and was just perfect.All the little scenes were also amazing like the wars, love triangles (a 'Ducky' from Pretty in Pink character in the triangle) and the minor characters. They adapted the film. Such as the innkeeper and landlord with all their corrupt ways in the inn. Like the whores, pigs and drunks living there and the landlady kissing all the men but her husband and her drunk and poor mannered husband all the while where they made food made from sludge and garbage and stole from anyone they saw. These were mere scum people where they also used children for labor and pretend to love them when a man comes to generously buy one (reminded me of Annie). The movie was in a span of around thirty years which made it amazing also. The best concept of the movie was definitely the serious and intense cruelty and gruel images of it. Such as the war where they killed a young child, the streets of blood puddles, murdering of all the boys in the revolution, the suicide, deaths in general and the crazy scene in the beginning with the prostitution and bodily sacrifices. These scenes made the movie that much better and gave it the true terror and insanity. This movie was truly amazing and one of my favorites. 10/10. Thank you for reading I hope you enjoyed my review.",10,2,5,5 January 2013
Jaws," Gets Better with Time
","The last time I watched this film was as a child and watching it again made me realize that all of the 'boring' parts were really the most interesting. This film is more psychologically terrifying than seeing the jaws of the shark.
I will always tear up when I see the trombone shot of Brody, realizing that his fears have manifested right before his eyes. Hooper is such a charismatic and funny character. Lastly, the drama between Brody and the politicians is a great example of self-interest getting in the way of basic, logical problems.",8,2,2,25 June 2020
