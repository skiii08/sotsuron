Hereditary," Hated It, Hated It, Hated It
",Just wasted 2 hours of my life on this complete and utter rubbish. I am all one for a good horror but this was just plain and simple weird. I honestly don't know who sat and down thought this was a good story to write up. They must have been on crack cocain whilst writing the plot. Basically has some crappy ending which made no sense!!! Bought the dvd full price and now putting it this movie staright in the bin. Wouldn't even give it away to anyone else as its not worth watching,1,4,7,3 November 2018
