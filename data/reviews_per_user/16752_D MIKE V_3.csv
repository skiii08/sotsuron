The Blair Witch Project," Scary as hell? Not really. Different as hell? You bet!
","After having seen this movie, I don't quite agree with the Rolling Stone review that this movie was 'Scary as hell', if they had reviewed it as 'Different as hell', I would most certainly agree.Anyway, I must say that this movie can (and will!) mess with your head, & features an ending that you will never forget! If you are not paying much attention, you might start thinking that this actually happened, that is how realistic this movie really is!I have absolutely no clue why some people absolutely hated this movie! Could they have been raised on too many multi-zillion dollar budgeted, over-acted, poorly written, re-hashed (Friday The 13th anyone?), 'Hollywood' horror movies, perhaps?If you liked this movie, you might want to check out Darren Aronofsky's thriller 'Pi', it's just as different & edgy as this one.By the way, I hope nobody ever shows this movie to James Cameron, it might give him some ideas.",Null,0,1,12 January 2000
Liar Liar," Destined to be a comedy classic (If it isn't one already).
","While this movie isn't the newest movie out in the video store, it will undoubtedly one day become a comedy classic. While the plot was a little thin, at first viewing, you can't tell, because Carrey's skills on 'winging it' are so good. Basically, comedy doesn't get much better than this, unless someone at Universal puts together an R Rated Director's Cut with the complete out-take reel, then it would be better (and probably much funnier). On the scale of Buy It, Rent It, or Skip It, this movie gets a well deserved Buy It.",Null,0,0,22 July 1999

","This movie is something very different than what you are used to. For one thing, I certainly like the grainy black & white picture of this movie, I think it adds to the dark, gritty atmosphere of the film (it just wouldn't seem as edgy if it was shot in color). Sure it's an independent film, sure it was shot on almost nothing for a budget, but that also adds to the atmosphere of the film. All I can say, if you haven't seen it, you don't know what you're missing!",Null,0,0,12 July 1999
