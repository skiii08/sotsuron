Requiem for a Dream," A rare piece of powerful film making.
","There are hardly any movies that has the power to shock and paralyze me after watching it. The first time I saw it, I was literally unable to move from my place for couple of minutes, still trying to come back to reality. And this happened to me as many times I watched this movie.
If a movie has such a power to completely shake and paralyze you, then it is one hell of a movie.
While acting has been bang on, the direction and the way viewers experience the mental and physical turmoil that actors go through in movie is absolutely commendable.
It surely isnt for the light hearted and can impact you deeply.
It is a masterpiece for ages",10,0,0,11 April 2020
Joker," A poetry of darkness
","There are very few movies that leave an impact on you hours or probably even days after leaving the movie theatre. Joker is surely one of them and on the top shelf. The character portrayal is so strong and acting is so natural and deep that one cannot just let it out of one's mind. I was not sure whether to get sad or excited, depressed or ecstatic, serious or laugh. Its just a flury of emotions running through you and keep you glued to screen. Cinematography is awesome by choosing the right mix of colors and shots in a recession hit Gotham city. Music keeps you on the edge of the seat and there wont be enough words to describe the acting of Phoenix which is once in a lifetime performance.",9,3,5,10 October 2019
