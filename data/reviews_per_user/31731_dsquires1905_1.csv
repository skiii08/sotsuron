3:10 to Yuma," Good but not great!
","Since there are so few westerns made lately, I was anticipating a very enjoyable evening at the movies. Unfortunately I was disappointed. This movie has superior actors, great special effects, great western scenery but the storyline is absurd and unbelievable. The ending is ridiculous and at some points the action scenes seemed more in character with the way the World Wrestling Federation presents it's brand of entertainment. Russell Crowe's character was so mixed up I believe he should see a head doctor during his stay in the Yuma jail. Maybe that's the theme for a sequel - his next escape and returning to marry Evan's widow and look after the cattle and the boys. HoHum.",6,4,8,12 September 2007
