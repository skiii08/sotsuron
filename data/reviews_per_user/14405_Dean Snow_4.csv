The Blair Witch Project," Ehh... half hype/half real-deal
","I went into this film with the intentions that it was going to be as terrifying as Night of the Living Dead or the Shining.  Surprise, surprise. Maybe I wasn't all that scared because I had such high expectations, but... the film is more eerie than 'Scary as Hell.'  It's got a lot of scary visuals... and I have heard that when people are looking back at it, they are very scared.  The same thing happens to me.  The more I look back at it, the more I am terrified [especially the ending].  Well, see it for yourself.",4,0,1,23 July 1999
The Blair Witch Project," What a crock of B.S.
","Boy, this movie is so uneventful.  I get more chills watching my grandpa's video he made of me when I was 9 years old at the Grand Canyon.  And right when it STARTS getting even remotely scary, they cut it short.  The scariest thing about this picture is that in France, it's tagline runs something to the effect of 'Surpasses the terror of The Shining.'  Wew, now that IS scary.** out of ****.  You want REAL scary?  Rent Roman Polanski's Repulsion.",4,0,1,13 March 2000
Fight Club," Best film of 1999
","Fight Club was produced by a major Hollywood studio.  It had a budget of $60 million+.  It is not your average big-budgeted studio film.  In fact, it has very few qualities of a big-budgeted studio film.  At it's least, it is raw, provocative, original (although a lot of Tyler Durden's philosophy is very Neitzsche-esque), idiosyncratic, and entertaining.  It is commentary on consumerism, materialism, trends, addictions, office work, indentity crisis, blind faith, sheep, capitalism and everything else that makes up modern society in America (Americana). The basic outline is about a worker-bee fed up with is daily routine and doing something about it.**** out of ****.  If you can find a theater still playing it and you haven't seen it, DEFINITELY check it out.",10,0,1,17 December 1999
American Psycho," Brilliant (this may contain spoilers)
","This review contains spoilers for the following films: American Psycho (well, obviously), Fight Club, and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  I also ask you to please excuse my primitive spelling, I try to make it up by using over-exuberant vocabulary and syntax.American Psycho was incredible.  I really do not need to go into how great a satire it is because you probably already know it is.Let's get the numerical/star grading out of the way right now.  ***1/2 out of **** or 9 out of 10.What I am here to talk about is how many similarities there are to this and Fight Club.  I felt that Fight Club was one of last year's best pictures, number two on my list, only exeeded by Boys Don't Cry.  American Psycho is the tale of a man who is laughed and and not appreciated by most of his colleagues.  He is called a 'dork' or something that relates to 'dork' by many of is superiors and/or co-workers.  When he sees some one that has more than him, he creates a fantasy world where he murders these over-achivers in a very sadistic and depraved manner.  Fight Club is the tale of a man who is leading a very mundane existance, and being look at as a peon by many of the people he is surrounded, even himself.  He creates a fantasy world (that eventually merges into the real world) where he can turn his emotional aggressions into physical ones.  I don't mean to go of on a tangent and end up writing a review for Fight Club.  In a word:  American Psycho acts as a more subtle, toned down Fight Club.Also, I might add that there is one scene in which the Texas Chainsaw Massacre is being played on a television.  Later in the film a hooker runs around an apartment seeing what seems to be hundreds of dead bodies as the American Psycho chases after her with-- what else-- than a chainsaw. There appears to be a reference to the Chainsaw Massacre, the scene in which one of the brat-teenagers stumbles into a room filled with human remains, while being chased by Leatherface.  The same sort of editing is used in the scene in American Psycho that was used in the Chainsaw Massacre.",9,0,0,14 April 2000
