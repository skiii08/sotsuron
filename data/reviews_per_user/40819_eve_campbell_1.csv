Mission: Impossible III," One of the worst movies ever...
","The marketing department must have had their hands full writing positive comments about this piece of trash on IMDb. It is beyond my imagination how anyone with an IQ above roomtemp. can actually like this movie. RIDICULOUS dialogues, bad acting (except for the bad guy), no new ideas at all, a self-loving Cruise who has undoubtedly lost his mind in the last years, etc... I especially 'like' the part where Cruise 'stops' his wife from saving him when the nitro is about to explode in his head at any second to tell her 'I love you', hahaha. Even if he has good intentions (in case the e-shock would kill him), I'd have lmao if the device would've exploded one second too early because of this. How cheesy can a movie get? If you have Hollywood mainstream involved, the sky is the limit. Even a 15y old must feel brain-humiliated after seeing this movie. Absolute crap.",1,18,36,25 August 2006
