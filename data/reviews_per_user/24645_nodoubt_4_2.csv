Walk the Line," Good Job Reese!
",I just saw it on a DVD and I think it was pretty good especially due to the magnificent performance of Reese Whitherspoon. She was really amazing as she managed to prove her role more leading than Phoenix's. Reese was excellent and allow me to say that I enjoyed her acting much more than Joaquin's. Even though he is an excellent actor the film was hers. Even though I haven't seen any of the other ladies in The ''Leading Role'' nominations I dare say that Reese deserved the Oscar given to her. They both sang very good and I also liked the costumes. I didn't like much the performance of the girl playing Johnny's (bitch) wife. My favourite scene is the one when June refuses to get on stage cause she's wearing her slippers and then finally they give a fantastic show.Thank you.,7,8,14,6 September 2006
Happy Feet," H a p p y f e e t f o r e v e r
","happy feet is one of the best animated movies ever. Here's why: not only it expresses lots of, very important and sensitive messages but also it does that in a really clever,funny, hilarious, humorous, fantastic way. At long last, all children and grown-ups should be aware of how important some things are like: a healthy family, following one's heart, being proud and not embarrassed of how someone's born and raised, environmental protection, the fact that every single creature on this planet is narrowly and indissolubly connected and attached to their environment and that's why we can't survive if our place and home is being damaged, destroyed, traded on and exterminated. Humans are the smartest beings in this world, and though they have the power to do great things they always get influenced by their insatiable tendency towards bad actions. Well, that was one of the messages the movie passes. All in all, Happy Feet is definitely worth watching more than once. Great direction, great plot, technically( I'm not an expert so I can't judge fairly) amazing. I loved the voices of all these fantastic actors( Wood, Jackman, Murphy) Especially Robbin Williams. Man, he's a piece of gold! My favorite was Nicole Kidman. She has a perfect voice, ideal for the role of the caring and loving mummy. H a p p y f e e t f o r e v e r",5,3,6,18 June 2007
