Skyfall," Some will love it some will hate it. True of every film made. I liked it.
",The film is really good. IT has plenty of action and the acting superb.Packs a punch. That is my opinion.Some reviews here have the film being awful. Some here labels the film as the best Bond ever. Who are you going to believe ? The thing is having a forum for those to express their views is futile. It is really pointless.But IMDb wants those with egos to feel they have a voice. Do they have a voice? No. The film is already made and no one contacted them to direct so there.Those who want to see the film will see it no matter what.Would you trust someone you have never met or have known ? Of course not so why would anyone think anyone would trust a review here ( including mine) from someone they don't know. Everyone has different tastes. Some love sushi and some would not even consider taking a bite. Does that make sushi good or bad ? Of course not. The sushi could give a rat's butt what you think of it. The same with the film. So I am going to tell you what you already know. See the film if you want to. If not then don't. Don't listen to anyone's reviews here. It is all about ego. They feel their ego needs the attention so they come here and give a bad rap on the film and tell you how it should be while they clock in at Walmart or Burger King. Why aren't they making great films ? There is plenty of action and it has a high rating by the paid critics.I would rather read their reviews as opposed to the ones who aren't being paid a penny. Make up your own mind. So a person comes on here and wants to tell everyone how bad the movie was and so what. Who cares what you think. You are under the delusion that people care what you think. No one does but maybe your mom does. So like I said with every film you will have likes and dislikes.Funny how the one reviewer trashed the Bond film but loved The Scooby Doo movie.,9,3,16,6 November 2012
