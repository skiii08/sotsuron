The Lobster," Boring!
","I found this movie very boring failed to see why is it tagged as comedy, I had a hard time learning the characters the movie itself ends leaving you guess what happens next like they ran out of budget and they made the movie way longer than it should have been there were too many bits of the movie where they could have left them out. All in all the whole movie looked depressing it felt bland also there was scenes where they made you feel horrible and they where like some sick person wrote them. I also hated the characters acting like they are robots that were made from the early 2000s and they showed little to none emotion that made me to stop being interested in the movie half way through it.",1,8,11,12 June 2016
