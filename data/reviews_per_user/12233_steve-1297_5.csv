"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Dreadful, tedious, by-the-numbers Rom-Com
","This really could have been written by committee. The plot is ridiculous and contrived, the script is painfully predictable, the characters are two-dimensional cardboard cut-outs, and the film's pay-off is painfully obvious from the beginning. I guess I didn't expect too much more from Schwimmer (I'm sure he'll get better with experience), but Pegg really should know better. This is a pretty feeble effort by all concerned, which, at times, is so cloyingly smothered in saccharine that you almost expect an irate Richard Curtis to appear, demanding royalties and screaming about breach of copyright. 3/10",3,3,10,24 February 2008
Source Code," Could have been so much better
","This could have been a very good film. In fact, for most of its runtime it really is a very good film. It's an ingenious thriller that rattles along at a decent pace and it kept me thoroughly engaged. In addition, the love interest really works and the on-screen chemistry between the two leads is beautifully handled - kudos to all concerned. Things get even better as the film moves towards a genuinely touching conclusion and a beautiful final scene. I'll admit, I was impressed. And then...--- SPOILER ALERT ---...Sadly it's not the final scene and the film dribbles on into the inevitable crass Hollywood ending. It's a terrible coda that's as predictable as it is depressing. Did the director lose his nerve? Did the money boys demand a happy ending? I really don't know, but this film could have been so much better.",6,1,3,14 August 2011
28 Days Later...," low budget post-apocalyptic drama plays out by the numbers
","WARNING - SPOILERS! Contrived, tedious and derivative. Large parts of this film are so utterly devoid of imagination that only my faint hopes of watching the deeply irritating leading man suffer a hideous and hopefully prolonged fate kept me watching. Director Danny Boyle has a strong background in television and this film looks like a TV movie shot on low budget DV. The plot draws heavily on 'Survivors'; an old BBC post-apocalyptic drama series that routinely displayed far more imagination and invention than this rather feeble effort. The cast are adequate for the undemanding roles they are required to play and the story unfolds strictly by the numbers. It might have made the grade as a TV pilot and would make a reasonable 'Friday-night-in-with-a-pizza' movie, but as a cinematic experience this film leaves a lot to be desired. 4/10",4,1,2,7 February 2005
The Big Blue," It's certainly not Free Willy
","First, let's be clear about which version we're dealing with: if you're offered the US edition 119 minute cut with a happy ending and a Bill Conti soundtrack - walk away, quickly. If it's the 132 minute French cut with English subtitles and the original and superior Eric (I've been listening to too many Peter Gabriel albums) Sierra soundtrack. Well, that'll do nicely. However, if you like your bleu to be grand then check out the magnificent directors cut which runs to just over 160 minutes and has been well worth the wait. It's a beautifully shot film that really needs to be seen in a cinema to be fully appreciated. The sea is the star of this movie but Jean Reno, Jean-Marc Barr and Rosanna Arquette put in good supporting performances. Jean Reno's character has an adversarial relationship with the sea. He measures himself against it; he needs to prove his mastery, his superiority. Jacques' (Jean-Marc Barr's character - insert your own Cousteau joke here) relationship with the sea is far more complex: As a child his mother abandoned him to cross the sea; his father left him when he drowned in the sea. Jacques is drawn by, obsessed with and at home in the sea. Perhaps it's a surrogate womb to replace the mother that left him, or maybe it's a haven from the harsh realities of his life on land. Even as an adult Jacques is awkward and inarticulate on land but graceful and expressive in the water. Besson beautifully illustrates this relationship when Jacques realises he's falling in love with Rosanna Arquette's character. After making love he leaves her bed and spends the night in the sea, finding complete spiritual and physical satisfaction; cleansing himself of his infidelity. Part romance, part comedy, and part drama. This film takes a dark turn towards the end as the various physical and psychological relationships resolve themselves and Besson leaves us with an ending that fades into inky black ambiguity. 8.5 / 10.",7,3,6,30 April 2004
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," What moron told Guy Ritchie he had any talent?
","This is a truly dreadful film. Every tired and overused cockney clich√© is slotted firmly into place; the acting is terrible, the script is staggeringly lame and the plot is tedious; the cinematography is embarrassingly naff and the direction is wannabe ham-fisted fumbling; the characters are all two-dimensional cardboard cut-outs (Nick the Greek, fer Chrissakes - a five-year-old could be more original) and it was very hard to give a damn about any of them.It's been a long time since I've seen anything as this bad. I honestly can think of anything good to say about it. This is a truly dreadful film.",3,6,14,15 September 2012
