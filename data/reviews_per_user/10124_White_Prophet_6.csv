The Equalizer," Can't wait for the sequel! - 79% (Very Good)
","Fun, quotable, stylish, and overall a really good action flick. Denzel is the ultimate badass.",8,0,3,2 July 2018
The Death of Stalin," Not a movie for me - 50% (Unfavorable)
","I understand that this kind of humor works for many people, but unfortunately I am not one of them. I may have chuckled a few times, and I did like Jason Isaacs quite a bit when he made his appearance, but overall I didn't enjoy this movie at all. I do not think it's a bad film- I understand the political satire and the intent of the humor, it just wasn't quite my tempo. I knew that this wasn't a movie for me from the first 15 minutes, so I do applaud myself for being patient enough to actually see it through 'til the end.",5,3,5,8 July 2018
Mamma Mia!," 'Pretty fun... if not for the songs alone.' 69% - (Favorable)
","I loved the songs of course and that was definitely the best part of the movie for me. Streep and Seyfried were good and the Greek setting made for a lot of beautiful scenery. Other than that, the story was pretty basic and one that you can't take too seriously, especially towards the end. There were a lot of cheesy moments and probably too much singing (I'm not that into musicals, though i love La La Land) but if you just go with it it's pretty fun if not for the songs alone.",7,0,1,2 July 2018
Hotel Transylvania," Fresh family fun! - Pretty Good
","I did not know this movie was directed by Tartakovsky, which is probably why I liked it as much as I did. He is one of my favorite animation directors and he does a great job in directing this movie as well. The humor is a bit hit or miss, mostly kid-oriented but there were some creative jokes and I laughed out loud a couple times. The cast does a good job for the most part and the movie has some heart to it. Overall, a pretty pleasant surprise that could have benefited from some better writing.",7,3,3,2 July 2018
The Purge," Not scary, but pretty entertaining - 69% (Favorable)
","I really struggled on deciding whether I liked this movie or not, and ultimately I just can't say that it's a good movie. However, I did enjoy it quite a bit! I think the premise was really interesting and I liked the creepy vibe and imagery in the movie. I really like Lena Dunham's performance and the main villain was very entertaining to watch... I feel like he wouldn't make a bad Joker. Ethan Hawke was also pretty good, but the kids... not so much. The movie also became pretty cliche and predictable which ultimately brought it down for me. Overall, it was an enjoyable ride with some pretty good ideas and social commentary but it could have been executed better.",7,0,1,23 June 2018
Annihilation," The more you think about it, the better it gets - Awesome (89%)
","I watched this movie for the first time last night and while I definitely liked it, I wasn't quite sure what in the world I had just seen. I thought about this movie for hours and after letting it digest and making sense of the deeper meanings and themes, I really came to appreciate and love this movie. (The ATZ Show has a really good explained video on Youtube that will completely change the way you look at the movie.) I watched Annihilation again today because this is one of those movies that requires a second viewing - there was so much that I missed and I can confidently say that this is is arguably my favorite movie of 2018.First of all, there's no denying that this film is simply beautiful. The way it's shot, the scenery.. fantastic. Also, this movie is extremely original, I've never seen anything like it before and I love it when a movie offers something new. A few more adjectives that come to mind to describe this movie are immersive, intense, creepy, emotional at parts, trippy at others, there's just so much to appreciate in this movie.What really elevates the movie for me however is all of the deeper meanings, themes, and symbolism that are going on beyond the surface plot. This is a movie with many layers that really makes you think, and people can interpret it in many different ways. That being said, this movie is definitely not for everyone... if i were to judge it solely by my first immediate reaction, I would rate it much lower, maybe 3.5 stars. I needed to really think and pick apart the movie to really appreciate the great work of art Alex Garland has put together. It's films like these that remind me why I love movies so much.",9,1,6,8 July 2018
