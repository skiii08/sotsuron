Skyfall," Good action movie
","Skyfall is well worth seeing if you are up for action. Daniel Craig is still as sexy as ever. The movie moves right along taking you all around the world. As with many action movies, you are there to be entertained and not to try and read more into the movie than necessary. I don't care too much for people who are haters over a movie because they have dissected it way to much that they have forgotten the purpose of a Bond movie in the first place. We are there to be entertained, not to have to think too much. What would have really been the icing on the cake for this movie would have been to of had all prior Bond's who are still alive put in a cameo. Now that would have been a great 50th year gift.",9,1,8,9 November 2012
Sinister," Disappointed
","I heard several people tell me this was a 'scary' movie. Well, I was really disappointed. This movie is better as a mystery than a scary movie. I kept waiting for the creepy, eerie, give me nightmare scenes to begin and then the movie ended. And what was with the soundtrack? The soundtrack did more damage to the film then help it. If the music was better it would have helped this sorry movie. You want to slap the wife upside the movie when she clearly played the blonde bimbo to a 'T'. You kid gets in trouble on his first day of school and no one tole him he was living in the house where the family was killed??? HELLO!! She is so supportive of her husband that she doesn't what to know what he is writing about?(I support you honey, just don't talk to me about your job). She goes shopping and gets glares from people but no one blurts out she is living in a creepy house. And can we talk about the attic? from the outside your luck to have space enough for insulation, but once inside you can practically stand up? The movie just starts to take off during the last 15 minutes and then it ends. Sequel to this movie will be officer so and so writing a book, movie and millions. This would have been scarier if people would turn the dang lights on. Come on guys, make a scary movie that is really scary.",3,32,64,30 October 2012
Flight," Denzel does it again
","Denzel does it again. A great performance as a tormented pilot who has lost everything who at the end owns up to his life. I enjoyed this movie and was surprised by the lack of attendance for the showing. But it would be hard for most movies to contend with the famous Vampire movie that is also out. But I recommend for people to see this movie. It is entertaining and the acting is fantastic. Of course, if you are afraid of flying, you might not want to see this movie because it will only confirm you fear. John Goodman's character is great. For those of you who use recreation drugs, his character is the one you want to be your dealer. He plays a small part, but he steals the scenes he is in. You feel the frustrations of Don Cheadle and Bruce Greenwood characters as they try to save Denzel from himself and you just want their characters to smack crap out of Denzel's character a time or two. But you can't help someone who doesn't want the help.",8,1,2,20 November 2012
