The Ring," The thrill ride kept going and going...
","'The Ring' was a tragedy and a triumph in my opinion.  Although I hardly feel that it was the scariest movie of all time ('The Exorcist will always hold that record in my opinion) the story was spellbinding at the very least. Those who love a thrill ride, or simply a film that will keep them guessing and guessing to the very end will love it.  Much fresher and innovative than those of the likes of The Scream trilogy, this really is unpredictable.  Those who enjoy Hitchcock will enjoy the guessing, again and again about the ending.  High marks for this film.  Who doesn't need a decent scare once in a while?",9,1,1,22 April 2003

","Of course all of us who respect Eminem the hip-hop artist will automatically be happy with his film debut, but truthfully he went above and beyond what I expected.  His character of Jimmy surely must have paralleled his own life in some respect, adding to the fact that his fans will enjoy watching. Mekhi Phifer is obviously a rising star in Hollywood!  Phenomenal performances by not only him, but Kim Basinger as well.  Brittany Murphy was decent, but she fell victim to playing a rather boring character. Normally, dramas bore me.  However, I enjoyed this film a lot. Eminem/Marshall Mathers will surely show up on the silver screen again.",8,0,0,6 April 2003
