Walk the Line," Cash and Carter done well.
","I enjoyed this story. The acting was very well done. Witherspoon has certainly moved to a new level. No longer is she the 'blondie' or child actress in any regard. She has solidified her rising status by portraying June Carter as well as she did. As far as Phoenix was concerned, it was not so simple. I did not buy that he was Cash until a mid-film point. What turned my opinion around was how he looked at Witherspoon on stage. While performing together it was hard to ignore the long stares of admiration in addition to tortured looks of rejection he gave her. I think this was the point where his role started to be authentic and put Phoenix in the right direction. I think mechanically, Phoenix was just a bit off the mark. Not suggesting that he didn't move like Cash. But he was just so slightly shy of completely grasping Cash's moves physically. As I watched the movie 'Ray', I was astonished at the gestures and physical moves Foxx had perfected to the degree that I had to remind myself that I wasn't watching Ray Charles, himself. The second half of the movie, my doubts of Phoenix's portrayal of Cash subsided. Executed superbly was the struggle, friction and tension between Cash and his father. It was tangible. I also think the audience felt the chemistry between Witherspoon and Phoenix. There was no mistaking it. Only in Hollywood could an extramarital affair be condoned with the addition of drug and alcohol abuse. But, alas! We are all human I suppose. I enjoyed this story so much. I wish there were more films done with such excellent taste and expertise. An excellent job for Phoenix. An outstanding achievement for Witherspoon. Reese, the pace car is off....You're on your way to the top.",8,0,1,31 January 2006
Brokeback Mountain," a masterpiece
","It is my opinion that this story is truly beautiful and still so frustrating at the same time. It gets to the heart of a homophobic society we are all forced to live in. It is truly a heartbreaking tale of how intolerant society can be and most times are. With such a tiny role, Jacks mother had more of an affect on me than any other actor. Her unspoken acceptance of her sons choices in this era(1960's-1970's) of ignorance and hatred was so well done that I have a hard time getting her out of my mind. It is truly an example of a mother's unconditional love in such a redneck era. Overall, I thought this was brilliant. Never overboard, leaving the audience to think for themselves. I am blown away at other's comments stating that they were confused, bewildered. Why is it that when a person goes to a movie, it is assumed that the writer has to spell out each and every little thing for them? Think for yourselves for the love of God. If you are mature enough to be admitted to see this film, then have an open mind and for God's sake....USE IT! Again, I will state- NEVER OVERBOARD, LEAVING THE AUDIENCE TO THINK FOR THEMSELVES......... A masterpiece....A masterpiece.",9,26,31,5 January 2006
Match Point," Really nothing notable here..
","To be honest, I found this movie irritating. It wasn't because the plot was Soooooo.....predictable or that the lighting was poor. It was the leading man J. Rhys Myers. He was simply flat. He was even too polished when the scene required that he only walk down the street. There's nothing natural about his acting. He's trying too hard, to the point of annoyance in some scenes, while in others, he barely seems awake. I think he brought the quality of what 'could have been' an OK Woody Allen movie down. Mr Allen has never really impressed me too much. I know to be a producer/actor...etc..that one has to be eclectic and often times eccentric, but in Mr. Allen's case, he's just a sad demented post-middle aged man. He's not the least bit funny. I have to say that my money could have been better spent tipping a pizza boy and renting it at home, but I think 8 dollars Canadian would still a substantial waste. I try to keep my mind open and view movies done by producers/directors who I don't particularly care for. Sorry Woody-you still haven't done anything of quality to date.",2,3,7,21 January 2006
Crash," the film
","This movie was comparable to negative pressure. It had the power to draw the viewer in entirely, without a trace of doubt. Ingenious writing made it shocking again and again. Clipping pace made it so that you didn't have time to predict anything coming. Profound work. Profound movie. Profoundly effective. Outstanding in every sense of the word. There were no moments of doubt concerning casting, lines, authenticity. Each scenario was unique. Each scenario was related to in terms of frustration, apathy, ignorance. I think, more than anything else, redemption was the gleaming end result. To mention one scene over another would be unjust.",9,0,5,2 May 2007
Inside Man," Taking out the trash!
","As I sit in Abu Dhabi's Mideast's movie theater, I realize that this flick was a mistake on my part despite what appeared to be a good choice, if for no other reason than the usual casting winners, i.e. Washington, Plummer, Foster. I guess it's new fashion to label every turban, long robe or trimmed beard as an 'Arab'. It's getting old to hear Bin Laden's name thrown in for a laugh. There were so many other problems with this film, it's hard to nail it down to a few. Here's my best attempt.1. overblown grandiose overtures 2. 2nd rate trailer-trash camera work/tricks. 3. Clive Owen at his worst (more pitiful than his role in derailed) 4. token Sheik/Asian/Bronx brat/Jewish wealth/Hispanic hooches 5. a boring 2 hour extension of lee's manhood (clearly) 6. an attempt to jump on Munich's post holocaust bandwagon",1,13,24,31 March 2006
