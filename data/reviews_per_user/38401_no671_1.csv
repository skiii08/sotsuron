Mission: Impossible III," weak plot and illogical ending
","The plot is very weak; it has no depth at all. I didn't know what was going on after watching the whole movie.The beginning is not very good; there is not enough introduction to the body.The ending and conclusions are so complicated; they have confused the audience too much.There are a lot of things to improve. The first two movies in the series were better.The only good thing about the movie is the action part, but that is not enough.This movie must do better to be acceptable to the audience.",1,8,18,6 May 2006
