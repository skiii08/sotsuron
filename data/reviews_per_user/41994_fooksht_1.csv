Sucker Punch," Awesome movie loved every min of it Brilliant stuff indeed
","Superb movie loved every min of it super action fight scenes and great special effects throughout the movie , very good action acting was outstanding for me this is the best movie I've watched thus far in 2011 nothing has come close to better this as yet and i don't think it will either .It requires lots of thinking and the type of movie you could easily watch twice or more quite happily .If there comes a sequel for this i would be delighted to watch it as well because Emily Browning was simply superb as a not so innocent character and she just gets better and better as the movie progresses .Although perhaps some people may find it a little far fetched everyone is entitled to an opinion but having watched this movie fantasy and reality combine very well to make this one movie you really do not want to miss .The ending i felt really justified a quite superb movie from start to finish . Prepare to be blown away with a really genuine action/fantasy movie that really leaves you wanting more .",Null,1,3,11 August 2011
