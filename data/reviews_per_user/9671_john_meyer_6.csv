Black Swan," Well-made pretension
","This is one of the worst movies I have seen in many years. I know that it has been hailed by many as daring and original and artistic. However, in reality it is monotonous, dreary, and populated by single-dimensional caricatures who play the same part in every scene.Portman won the OscarÂ® for her performance, and much was made of her dancing, both the fact that she trained for more than a year and also that her stunt double didn't get any credit. Well, as someone who has spent forty years going to the ballet, and as someone married to a ballet dancer, I can state that this movie has some of the worst ballet dancing ever recorded in a movie.Finally, all the metaphors in this failed movie are trite, and some quite laughable. For instance, the appearance of actual feathers, at least in the mind of the crazed black swan, is one of the oldest lines in reviews of 'Swan Lake:' 'She was so convincing you could actually see the feathers' is a typical review line that I've read many times over the years.In this case, I didn't need to see the feathers, and I didn't need to see the movie.If you want to see a great ballet movie about a ballerina going mad as art and reality follow parallel paths, rent the timeless classic 'The Red Shoes.' That too won awards, but it was a great movie, and the dancing is mesmerizing.This effort is just well-made pretension.",1,12,21,24 May 2011
The Bodyguard," Without good writing, good acting means nothing
","TCM was showing this as part of their 'Oscar' month. I ended up staying up late to watch it.Wow, what a waste of time! The problem isn't KC or WH or their chemistry (or lack thereof), but the idiotic plot that just doesn't make any sense. I could fill pages with examples, but the one that made me really sorry that I had sacrificed my beauty sleep to watch this was when Costner's character dives into a freezing lake to knock a kid out of a boat, but for no apparent reason other than he just figure out that the bad guy is nearby. After safely out of the water, the boat stops in the middle of the lake and blows up. Since neither Costner or Houston's characters had been in the boat or shown any interest in the boat, the whole idea that someone would try to kill them by blowing it up made absolutely no sense at all.And what about the ridiculous attempt at romance, which is obviously the whole point of the film? There is not one credible scene that explains either character's attraction for the other. None. So, the reason for no chemistry between the two is that the idiot who wrote this didn't provide any dialog or staging to provide them with any motivation.So, my advice is to buy a Whitney Houston album so you can hear her fabulous voice without interference from all the foley noise, and then rent 'No Way Out,' which provides all sorts of motivation for the romance and sex scenes with an equally serious, but far more plausible performance from Costner.",2,11,22,25 February 2008
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Beautiful parable
","Some movies should be viewed like a painting at a museum: You sit and slowly absorb the mastery of detail, and the interpretive expression the artist labored long hours to convey. 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is such a picture. (Kubrick's 'Barry Lyndon' was another.)The main flaw in this masterpiece, and perhaps the reason it has garnered so many negative reviews in this forum, is that its opening scenes provide very little guidance to Western audiences for what follows. We are therefore unprepared for sudden breaks from 'reality' as characters begin to fly in the middle of fight scenes, and we don't understand the rules of this ancient, mythical Chinese civilization. Also, there is a certain 'language' that develops around certain film genres, and without having viewed previous movies of this type, it may be difficult to grasp the significance of many scenes. Imagine, for instance, someone from China viewing 'High Noon' without ever having watched another American Western. The heroic depth of Gary Cooper's refusal to leave town can only be fully appreciated by having viewed countless similar films, and knowing that the 'code of the West' requires certain things of its heroes. Lacking this context, it was difficult at times to truly appreciate the characters. (However, viewing the DVD supplementary material helps enormously). Despite these handicaps, this is one of the most stunningly gorgeous films ever created, with a simple, but compelling, parable at its center that can be appreciated by any viewer regardless of what movies he or she may have seen before.",10,1,1,15 August 2001
Gone Girl," Extraordinarily poor script
","I have seldom watched a movie where the script writer took as many random shortcuts as those taken in 'Gone Girl.' I've seen this before when a writer -- either because of laziness, lack of talent, or time pressure -- simply has the character do something which advances the story, but without any foundation or rationale for that action. In 'Gone Girl,' each scene failed to supply sufficient information or motivation for what each character did next. At the beginning of the movie, this was merely annoying, and I thought perhaps it was being done deliberately in order to provide a simple sketch of the characters' backgrounds and then quickly get into the meat of the movie.Unfortunately, those 'sketches' turned out to be essential to the rest of the movie, and because these scenes were not completely fleshed out, much of what followed rang hollow.It is a complete mystery to me how Gillian Flynn, the screenplay author, could have been nominated for any awards for this mess, and yet she was. This makes me very suspicious of the awards process.The script is so bad that, as the movie progressed, I kept thinking perhaps they had filmed the 'treatment' (the script outline used to sell the movie idea) rather than an actual, finished script.By the time the movie stumbled and lurched to the final, totally unsatisfactory conclusion, I found myself almost angry at all the holes in logic and motivation, and the completely inexplicable things each of the two main characters said and did.I don't mind endings that are unexpected or unusual, but I do mind endings that feel as though the writer copped out because she lacked the creativity to come up with a much more interesting, clever, and logically consistent ending.This ending was none of those things.The only reason I gave the film two stars instead of one is that the basic production values are quite good",2,8,12,30 May 2016
The Departed," How could this even be nominated for best picture?
","This is a haphazard movie, with violence substituting for acting, and profanity taking the place of real writing. The editing is slipshod, to the point of making parts of the movie incomprehensible.If you like over-the-top violent thug movies, don't waste your time on this poor excuse for movie making and instead rent 'Snatch.' You'll get your daily dose of violence and profanity there as well, but done with a much firmer hand on the controls.The corruption of the motion picture academy has been obvious for the past decade, with nominations and winners increasingly determined by factors outside the film's actual merits.",1,3,6,9 April 2007
Goodfellas," Tedious cartoon characterizations
","Many people think Scorsese is a great director because he is a skilled craftsman who produces a clear realization of his own weirdly fractured vision. Given the reverence with which some people treat his work, any criticism may be viewed as sacrilege. However, this film is filled with wooden, cartoon characterizations of real people. They do very ugly things to each other, but without any understanding of their motivations.The movie drags on far too long thanks to countless scenes that should have been shortened or cut (e.g., the endlessly long prison kitchen scene). The transitions between different phases of the movie are abrupt and without explanation. For instance, the transition to drug addiction and trafficking comes out of nowhere when the main character pulls pills out of his pocket and swallows them on his way to jail in a limousine. No drug use is shown or even hinted at prior to that scene.While the movie certainly progresses over time, and there is definitely plot development, the cardboard characters don't really change, and every scene seems like a repeat of something we just saw. Unlike 'The Godfather,' to which this film is sometimes compared because they both depict the 'inner workings' of the East Coast Mafia, there is no deeper insight into any part of the human condition, and only the shallowest revelations about why the Mafia even exists. The only thing we are given -- explained in clumsy narration at the end of the movie -- is that all the participants are drawn to each other because they enjoy a sense of belonging: of being 'good fellas.' While the irony between that explanation and the extended depiction of these beautifully bonded people eating their own is certainly acknowledged, in the end none of it really makes sense, and we are reminded of that too-frequently quoted Shakespeare line:It is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury Signifying nothingMacbeth was clearly talking about Goodfellas.",2,26,62,2 June 2013
