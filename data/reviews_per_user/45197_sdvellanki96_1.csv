Insidious: Chapter 2," Amazing Movie, Better than the first! Must Watch!
","This is my first review and I am here to encourage everybody to go see this movie. I got scared few times, and I never get scared. I never got scared during Insidious or The Conjuring. Not scared like this anyways. At one part especially I had goosebumps that lasted for over a minute and I was thinking to myself 'That has never happened to me before'.You might not love it as much as me, but there is no way you can walk out of the theater and be disappointed. At the very least you would still be like 'Worth a watch!' I had a great time throughout the whole movie. You would think that the sequel wouldn't be good as the original, especially since the original was so good. But I actually thought it was better. It was funnier and scarier.",Null,1,3,14 September 2013
