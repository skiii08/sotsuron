Whip It," Not only an 80's hit single by Devo, but apparently also a good chick flick.
","This weekend on a whim I popped in a DVD of Whip It, which is Drew Barrymore's debut as a director. I must say that it surprised me. A movie about roller derby?! Really?First and foremost, it's a movie about a girl named Bliss who's tired of living her mother's fantasies and is looking for a way out of her small town of Bodeen, Texas. Bliss's mother, Brooke Cavendar, is a US Postal Woman whose days of beauty pageants are long gone. This doesn't stop her from trying to live vicariously through Bliss. But despite doing quite well at these pageants, Bliss is actually a tomboy and indie rock fan at heart and after picking up a roller derby flyer on a shopping trip in Austin, she becomes a roller derby fan as well. After her first roller derby soiree, Bliss is intent on trying out for the Hurl Scouts, but couldn't find the courage without a short pep talk with her best friend Pash:Pash: But you don't have the balls.Bliss: I can grow the ballsAnd she does grow the balls. Bliss takes a bus back into Austin to try out and with her sheer speed she makes the team and an enemy, Iron Maven. Iron Maven is the poster-child of roller derby and is the leader of the Holy Rollers, a gang of bad ass chicks clad in Catholic schoolgirl uniforms. The bouts are tough. The Hurl Scouts fight their way to the top with frequent usage of 'The Whip' and a slew of 'plays', which actually means 'beat the crap out of the other team'. The different plays and special moves keep the movie entertaining.One of my favorite things about this movie is all the creative skater names: Maggie Mayhem, Smashley Simpson, Rosa Sparks, Eva Destruction, Bloody Holly, Iron Maven, and of course Babe Ruthless are fantastic names. I browsed a list of actual roller derby names online, and these are pretty good in comparison. Under these fancy skater names are interesting characters also. Ellen Page fits the role of Bliss Cavendar perfectly. Beneath her shy and quirky exterior lies a great reservoir of spunk, which she unleashes on the skating rink. I also liked Drew Barrymore's character, Smashley Simpson. She's really rowdy. She throws punches first and asks questions later. Maybe my favorite is Maggie Mayhem (Kristen Wiig), a skater and single mother who threatens to break her son's legs if he ever lies to her – jokingly of course.It has a bit of girl-power and a bit of the can-do spirit. If you've ever felt a little bored of your daily life and crave a dose of excitement, then give Whip It a try. It might just inspire you to get off your butt and do something about it. Whip it good.Bro-ApprovedMore chick flick reviews for men @ RatedChick.com",7,1,5,5 May 2010
500 Days of Summer," Bro-Approved thanks for a GOOD chick flick
","As a movie reviewer I'm very biased in the romantic comedy genre. I give most of them an eye-roll at best. Maybe a light chuckle. But instead of invalidating my reviews of romantic comedies, I'd like to propose that it makes a positive review that much more genuine. It also makes it many times more satisfying to find a truly good one, and that's what 500 Days of Summer is. It is an excellent romantic comedy because it balances all aspects of the genre beautifully. There's romance. That's a given. It's comedic, but not the 'somehow they're both naked and for reason don't realize it but they're about to collide and land on one another and for some reason they're all wet' kind of comedy. No. Take that corny stuff away and keep the cheesiness. The comedy is offbeat and witty and never goes astray.Best of all is the story. It's completely relatable. Who hasn't had a case of the butterflies when a new love enters your life and you are hopelessly hypnotized by your own infatuation? You are on the highest of highs only to to fall to the lowest of lows when the definitions of 'couple', 'dating', and 'love' complicate things. The relationship isn't perfect. 'Is this really how 'love' should be?' you ask yourself. I've gone through all this myself, so 500 Days of Summer really resonated with me. The movie's tagline says it all:This is not a love story. This is a story about love.This is a story about a boy named Tom who falls in love with Summer, a girl who doesn't believe in love. He's the hopeless romantic who writes greeting cards and she's the new girl at work. Summer is aloof and uninterested in Tom at first, but when she learns about his feelings for her through their coworker, McKenzie, she kisses Tom. Not exactly out of reciprocation, but out of whimsical curiosity.What followed was bliss. The highest of highs. They fall in love, or so Tom thinks, and it culminates in sex and a subsequent dance number as Tom walks to work the next morning. All the pedestrians jump in as back-up. Even a cartoon bird comes in the mix. This dance number was a nice touch since it's comedic value contrasted with the rest of the movie.But not even 'love' can violate the laws of the universe. What goes up, must come down. Tom falls to the lowest of lows when he questions where he and Summer are in their relationship. She's not one to be tied down, so she takes off like the free bird she is. Then there was despair. Tom has lost the girl destined for him. He falls in a downward spiral of alcohol and cynicism.However, seasons change. Autumn. Winter. Spring. Eventually, Summer returns, but now she's engaged and Tom is confused. How can Summer out of all people get married? And so suddenly? She just happened to meet a guy who was right for her, and she saw all the wonderful things about love that Tom has always believed. She explains:Summer: Well, you know, I guess it's 'cause I was sitting in a deli and reading Dorian Gray and a guy comes up to me and asks me about it and now he's my husband.Tom: Yeah. And so?Summer: So, what if I'd gone to the movies? What if I had gone somewhere else for lunch? What if I'd gotten there 10 minutes later? It was – it was meant to be. And I just kept thinking Tom was right.Tom: *in slight disbelief* No.Summer: Yeah, I did. *laughs* I did. It just wasn't me that you were right about.Movies, TV, and music has all brainwashed us into thinking that love is perfect, pure, and simple. And if that wasn't bad enough, they even suggest it is somehow easy to obtain. No. That's bull. It's a lot more complicated than that and it requires a lot more work than we are led to think. Enter 500 Days of Summer. This is a romantic comedy that is telling us just that. It is doing a public service to the love-struck youth by striking them upside the head with some reality.Tom writes Hallmark style cards for a living. They all contain those cookie-cutter, idealistic 'I love you' messages that are so fake. He eventually breaks free to pursue his true passion, architecture. This is also about the time when he breaks free from his false preconceptions about love and finally gets over Summer. Love is complicated, and for a romantic comedy to convey this message so poetically is commendable. Bravo and a big thanks.PENIS!Follow my reviews at RatedChick.com",10,2,4,16 April 2010
The Last Song," Bro-Approved
","When I saw the preview to this movie I thought, 'Great. Another movie starring a singer. Troubled and Juilliard-worthy. She's trying to push those CDs out them doors eh?' I was pleasantly surprised that that wasn't the case at all. Though the soundtrack is good, the movie isn't all about music. In fact, Ronnie (Miley Cyrus) hardly played the piano or sang. There weren't awkwardly contrived reasons for her to sing either. Well, maybe one. But it was done in good taste, and I applaud the screenplay and direction for going that route. I suspect that because the story had much more to it than a pop star lead.As a grown man (or so I like to think), I'm a bit ashamed to say that Hannah Montana nearly made me cry in public. I had to take a breath. I held it in. Like a man should! :) Don't get me wrong. The acting wasn't mind-blowing, but it wasn't bad either. However, the story invoked feelings of wanting to be great at something and to passionate about it. Specifically, it made me want to be a great father.Touche Hannah Montana Touche.

The Duchess," Total Chick Flick - Not for Men!
","As with most period pieces of this nature, the lavish lifestyle of the rich and powerful is portrayed with great accuracy and grandeur. Although The Duchess is a beautiful film to the eye it is dreadfully dull in the minds of men. Just so you know I'm not completely biased against such films, I'd like to mention that I thought The Other Boleyn Girl and Atonement were both very good.Well then, let me summarize.Georgiana Spencer is a naive 17 year old girl who is ecstatic about marrying the Duke of Devonshire, who has fallen in 'love' with her after only a few brief encounters. Unfortunately, the Duke desperately wanted an heir and was only in 'love' with the Spencer women's supposed reputation for bearing male children. Georgiana found herself going from 'knowing love' to a loveless marriage. Even on their wedding night, he shows no passion and no tenderness in his love making. He only has a single objective set in his mind. He sleeps with other women without discretion and has an illegitimate daughter with one of his servants.Alas, her hand is bound by the ring on her finger and her mouth is bound by 18th century social conventions. She is trapped. Georgiana provides the Duke with 2 daughters, but that is insufficient to please him. She finds refuge in fashion and becomes the 'it' girl among socialites and commoners alike. And in an age before suffrage, Georgiana is able to wield her influence in fashion into leverage in politics. Her wit and charm is able to dictate modern fashion and sway the allegiance of voters. In particular, she uses her influence to forward the political career of a young member of the Whig Party, Charles Grey. Georgiana and Charles fall madly in love, but are unable to act on their feelings.Charles isn't the only intimate relationship that keeps Georgiana from drowning. She befriends Bess, a woman who has fled from an abusive husband. After inviting Bess to live with her with the Duke, tensions rise. The Duke and Bess begin sleeping together. Bess begs Georgiana to understand that she is only in this affair to have the Duke force her husband to release their children to her. When her children finally arrive at the Duke's home, the Duke finally shows some humanity while he instructs Bess's son how to shoot a rifle properly. Georgiana tries to bargain a deal where Bess and the Duke can have their affair only if she can have an affair with Charles. Outraged, the Duke chases her down and rapes her. No one is able to do anything.Finally, Georgiana provides the Duke with a male heir. With the hand of a skilled swordsman, the Duke signs a check to Lady Spencer for Georgiana's completed 'duty'. Georgiana decides that this is her chance to escape in a love affair of her own. Against her mother's advice, she flees to Bath to meet Charles for a prolonged 'vacation'. Her affair results in gossip, so the Duke threatens to take her children away and to strip her and Charles of their social status. Georgiana has no other choice than to obey and return to her beautiful prison. She gives birth to another girl, but this one is Charles's illegitimate child and is consequently raised by the Grey family.The rest is uneventful and is summarized in a few paragraphs at the end of the film, which I lack the enthusiasm to repeat here.Besides the fact that she is unusually thin, I find Keira Knightley quite beautiful - ravishing even. Perhaps that's the reason I agreed to watch this with little objection. Little did I know I had signed myself up for 220 minutes of torture. Right. The Duchess is only 110 minutes, but I assure you I was watching a much lengthier version of he most inhumane nature. The end is a bit hazy. I must have blacked out from repeatedly banging my head against the empty seat in front of me. Sorry if I come off as a simple-minded brute, but I can also see that the story is enlightening of the times. This film illustrates the great societal pressures on both men and women. Especially women. However, when it comes down to entertainment value, The Duchess is lackluster.So where did the movie go wrong? I couldn't sympathize or relate to any of the characters. The Duke is a complete ass, Bess is a total bitch, and Georgiana is pitiful. It was too difficult to detach myself from my 21st century values to understand the psyche of upper class Englishmen of from the 18th century. To me, period pieces tend to overplay the suppression of women to get sympathy points that can be cashed out for public catharsis. This just doesn't work well on male viewers. It can be done, but it's rare. Also, the story is completely predictable. Yes, I understand this is based on history, but I hated history in school. Let's face it. Movies aren't the best sources for education, so why not stretch the truth a bit in favor of entertainment? Get the viewer to want to know more. I left wanting to know nothing. The story is objectively compelling, but subjectively mundane. In my mind, The Duchess would play a fantastic role in a Bud Light commercial where the men sneak beer into the theater, high-five, and drink to stave off boredom.This is truly a Chick Flick. If your boyfriend or husband paid good money to watched this with you, he's a keeper. Especially if that boyfriend is me. ;) Follow my chick flick reviews for men at RatedChick.com",2,9,23,29 April 2010
Kick-Ass," Perfect. A Must-See
","My top movies include Dark Knight, V for Vendetta and now Kick-Ass. I'm not a huge comic book fan, but they do tell great stories and their graphical nature translates beautifully on screen. They make excellent screenplays, and Kick-Ass is exemplary.Kick-Ass differentiates itself from all the other graphic-novels and the movies thereafter. It's funny and it's action-packed, but the great thing is that this isn't a story about superheros. It's a story about someone who says, 'Enough is enough.' Kick-Ass is tired of people standing by and watching others become victims. Instead of helping, people whip out their phones to make a YouTube video. Fear. It consumes us. For Kick-Ass, his fear takes a back seat to naivety and wishful thinking. Thus a 'superhero' is born.The other great thing is this isn't a kid's movie. It's rated R. Rightfully so. Even though there's GREAT comedic content - this movie is hilarious - it also has serious, gritty, adult content. The only reason to take the kids is to show them that being a superhero is no picnic. It's definitely not for everyone. I was surprised by the amount of violence, but it's nothing today's kids can't handle I suppose...It takes every fiber of my body to not dish out the fantastic detail, but I want to keep this spoiler-free and let you enjoy this great film - the first must-see movie of the year and one of my new personal favorites.I also review chick flicks @ RatedChick.com",10,2,11,18 April 2010
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," best so far
","You unlock this door with the key of imagination. Beyond it is another  dimension - a dimension of vampires, a dimension of wolves, a dimension  of interspecies love . You're moving into a land of both awe and  awfulness, of fantasy and romance. You've just crossed over into the  Twilight Zone! In New Moon, the story left off with Bella and Edward  having averted danger. Eclipse continues the saga with a completely new  and fresh idea. Bella is still in danger! I know right? It blew my  mind. This time around the danger comes from an unknown source. It  could be Victoria, who seeks revenge on Edward for killing her love,  James, in the first movie. Or it could be the Volturi, who have a  distinct interest in Edward, Alice, and Bella. Their enemy is stronger  than the Cullen clan can handle on their own, but luckily they have an  ace in the hole - an unlikely alliance with the wolves. The result is  the most beautifully filmed fight sequence so far in The Twilight Saga.  But what really makes this movie better than the previous two  (especially for those who aren't already fans of the books) is the  dialogue and the high school drama. Not because they're good, but  because they're entertaining. My compliments to Stephenie Meyer. She  has the uncanny ability to create the most epic of awkward situations  whose silence is broken only by the most ludicrous dialogue. My  favorite scene in the movie is when Bella, Edward and Jacob are in a  tent in a snowstorm. Awkward - check. Bella is freezing cold and  Edward's lifeless body can't do a thing. The shirtless Jacob steps in  saying,  Face it, I'm hotter than you.  and gets under the covers and Bella snuggles up against his warm chest.  Edward can only watch. Epic - check. Good only gets better when Jacob  then suggests,  It'd be faster if you took your clothes off... survival 101 Ludicrous -  check. I stood up, applauded, and walked out.  With the relationships between Bella, Edward and Jacob established by  the first two movies, Eclipse is chock-full of one-liners that are  entertaining. And watching the 3 interact and bump heads can be quite  funny because as an adult you are reminded of how 'love' is so  simplistic and idealistic in the minds of teenagers. What consumes more  of my mental energy than deserved is how Bella is so irrationally  attracted to Edward and Jacob, and the two to her. From her  perspective, she could probably do better than an undead boyfriend  whose instinct is to drink her blood and a wolf boy who's so angry all  the time. And what happen to women's equality? Does she really need two  unnatural male protectors? From Edward's and Jacob's perspectives,  they're fighting over a girl who can't seem to make up her mind about  who she wants more. It might even appear that she's playing them both  for fools. Guys do wait - but not forever. But I'm letting the my  rational side prevent me from enjoying the movie. So if you're headed  out to watch Eclipse with your girlfriend or little sister, lighten up  and you might enjoy the movie.  Thus ends review #3. Bella loves Edward. Edward loves Bella. Jacob  loves Bella. Bella loves Edward. Perhaps Breaking Dawn will take it  from epic to classic when Edward and Jacob love each other. Til next  time.",5,16,30,2 July 2010
