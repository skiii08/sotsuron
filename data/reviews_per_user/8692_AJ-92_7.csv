Gremlins," Twisted and Demented
","'Gremlins' is a strange, disgusting, twisted, demented, bizarre, funny, and violence-packed comedy. See what they can fit into an hour and a half? 'Gremlins' is a down-right genuine classic. It's all about an inventor dad who buys a fuzzy-wuzzy creature for his son that will make you say, 'Can I have one?'. But after the first half-hour, you say, 'I never want one of those things!' Why? (WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILER!) Because the three rules that were supposed to be followed are accidentally broken, and more fuzzy creatures pop up and then later turn into despicable and gruesome monsters.You'll get more laughs than you expected were in such a violent movie. I hope that you love this movie as much as I did and still do. 10/10",10,0,1,14 November 2000
X-Men," X-citement on the big screen!
","Finally! The long awaited X-Men movie is here! I saw the movie on Monday, and it was a lot better than I expected. I was expecting it to be great, but it was even greater. With dazzling special effects and a great storyline, this movie is the best of 2000! Hugh Jackman did a great job as playing Wolverine, and Anna Paquin did a pretty good job playing Rouge. Patrick Stewart was great as Professor Charles Xavier, and Halle Berry was unexpectedly (to me, anyways) great as Storm. I have been waiting for this movie for a while. Maybe even over a year. But for the last couple of months, I've been reading magazines with info on the movie, and just sinking my teeth into them. This movie is a must see for all X-Men fans, and even for people who have never read the comic books.",10,0,0,19 July 2000
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," The Sequel That Didn't Have to Be
","This movie just DIDN'T have to be made! The first Jurassic Park movie was great, and this sequel tried as best as sequels can (which isn't very much) to be better than the original, but failed. There is no better dinosaur movie than Jurassic Park, and the movie makers shouldn't have even tried to top such a wonderful masterpiece. The effects were somewhat better than the original (the T-Rex looks more realistic). I don't know why they had to change the Raptors' colors! I myself think that green suited the Velociraptors better than orange and white. I know that I've gone on and on about how this movie isn't better, it didn't have to be made, and more, but this movie was decent. I hope that Jurassic Park III lives up to the original, unlike this sequel. 7/10",7,0,0,15 October 2000
Ghostbusters," The Best Movie Ever Made
","This movie is definitely the best movie of all-time, better than any other to ever be released. The song 'Ghostbusters' is the greatest song to ever hit the movies (or anything else)! When I finally got my hands on the DVD, I was so happy to see the cut scenes, the story boards, and the old cast talking about the movie all these years later. If you've never seen this movie, then you've never seen the best movie of all-time. You've got to see it right now. BUSTIN' MAKES ME FEEL GOOD!!!",10,0,0,17 August 2000
Men in Black," One of My Favorite Movies of All-Time
","'Men in Black' is one of those movies that we're thankful it was made. It definitely wouldn't get made based on the popularity of the comic books, there were only 6 comics in total that were made (except for the 3 comics that either were based on the movie or were one-shots).I never even knew that it was originally a comic book series until after I saw the movie. This movie is funny and, at some points, action-packed. This is the best Will Smith movie out there, this a great movie to see if you like Tommy Lee Jones or Will Smith. This is a great movie even if you don't like the two. I give this movie a 10 out of 10. You may disagree, but I thought that this movie was fabulous.",10,1,2,16 August 2000
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Come on
","Come on, movies can get better than this! Is this all the stuff that Hollywood can come up with? I don't know why everybody says that this is a really great movie. I used to like it, but now I think of it as BORING. I enjoy the special effects, but I just don't care for this movie. The story line is okay, I suppose, but could get better. The music is good, but not enough action and adventure. When you go see a movie like this, you expect to see a LOT of action. The great action scenes that this movie had were dumb, I think. See the last two movies for some REALLY GOOD ENTERTAINMENT. As for this, skip it. 4/10",5,1,10,17 October 2000
Jurassic Park," One of the Best Movie Ever Made
","WARNING: SPOILERS!!!!!!! 'Jurassic Park' is about a man who re-creates dinosaurs on an island in Costa Rica, and invites a paleontologist, paleobotanist, and a mathematician to test the park out before it opens. During the tour, the power goes out because a worker at the park shuts off most of the power to steal dinosaur embryos to bring back to his boss so that they can make dinosaurs. Chaos ensues from that point on. The T-Rex breaks loose from his fencing and almost kills the mathematician (whose name in the movie is Ian Malcolm), eats a lawyer (whose name is Donald Gennaro), almost eats the paleontoligist (Alan Grant) and the two children (Alexis or Lex Murphy and Timothy or Tim Murphy), and almost eats the paleobotanist (Ellie Satler), the game warden (Robert Muldoon), and Ian Malcolm (again!). And a lot more happens.The special effects look almost exactly what dinosaurs would look like today, which is mostly the reason why I went to go see it originally. The action is breath-taking, and the suspense will just KILL you! This movie is incredibly well-made, and in my book, the third best movie ever made. A must-see! 10/10",10,1,3,16 October 2000
