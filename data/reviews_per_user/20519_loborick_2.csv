National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Suspend reality for awhile and have a good time...
","Is this an historically accurate movie? No. Is it a socially relevant movie? Is it plausible? No. Is if fun? Yes! Those on this site who feel every movie has to be historically accurate or socially relevant don't know what it's like to just suspend belief for a couple of hours and just have some fun. I love well acted, well written and well photographed movies. But I also just like to escape once in a while. I had seen some excellent movies lately, No Country for Old Men, There Will Be Blood, The Orphanage...all excellent movies, but very dark. This was just fun. So, if you want to be critical of a movie and don't want to escape for a couple of hours, go see something else.",7,1,4,3 February 2008
Happy Feet," Great message for youngsters
","For those that have commented that they were offended that the bad guys in the film are humans, guess what? They are! Humans are depleting many species' food stuffs and are threatening their livelihood. So it is important that kids see this. They can be the ones to reverse this. Talk to your kids about it after the movie.On the movie, it was awesome! The graphics were magnificent. Especially the underwater and 'sliding' scenes! This is a masterful movie, and the soundtrack will blow you away. I did find myself tapping my foot often during the movie. And Robin Williams just topped it off, especially his 'Ramon'. The Hispanic group of penguins absolutely killed me. They were great.This is a movie that shouldn't be missed, by either parents or their kids.",8,1,3,26 November 2006
