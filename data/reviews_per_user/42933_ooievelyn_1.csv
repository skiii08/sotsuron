The Longest Yard," Absolutely astonishing film!
","caught The Longest Yard at a MERE SGD$6.50.. and honestly, the film is so gooooooooood that i feel i'm shortchanging the producers and cast by paying so little for the movie.BRIMMING with laughter; and all my heartstrings tugged like never tugged before.i have never cried so (very) hard ever since The Notebook.i rate it on the TOP of my most favourite movies.and i love Chris Rock!!! (Caretaker in the movie) he is nice, wacky, hilarious and a natural born comedian!Ahhhhhhh....never been SO wow-ed by a movie before.i love everything single bit of it. nothing, at all, to complain about.Adam Sandler is one of the leads too. he is good, as usual.but. i still like Chris more. hoho.i give it 10 STARS out of the maximum 5. it is THAT good.",10,1,4,19 September 2005
