The Mask," Still funny
","It's years later, and it's still funny. Stupid but funny. Entertaining and stupid, but still funny. This isn't concidered a musical, but it has great musical numbers.",7,8,11,14 September 2018
Moneyball," Great movie even if you hate baseball
","It's a great movie. If it were fiction it would be a good movie. But since it's real, that makes it so much better. A few liberties were taken with certain players here and there, but the whole point of the movie is unchanged. As good as it is, the best two parts are when Kerri's Dorsey sings. It's not a musical, but she's the best.",9,1,1,21 October 2018
Ghost," I yelled at my nephew
","My nephew went to see Ghost when it came out. Afterwards I asked him how it was. He said it was good. Later, I saw it and I thought it was great. When I saw him after that, I had to yell, 'Why didn't you tell me it was so good!?'
Every actor was great. Whoopi's goofy character was just right. It's one of those rare movies that I really have no complaints about, was entertained every minute, and never get tired of watching it.",9,4,5,21 October 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Basically Flawless
","Even my favorite movies have flaws. I wouldn't call this my favorite but it was excellent. Cinematically speaking, I did not see any flaws. There was not one scene that I considered boring. There were no scenes that made me think 'Why on earth did they do that stupid thing?!' All the acting was great and so was the singing. There was some very creative camera work. Although there were some factual errors, particularly involving Live Aid, they were not enough to make me upset. Mike Myers scene was memorable. And to give it another compliment, I did not fall asleep at any point either! My only real question is this...in the closing credits there were 19 names listed under 'stunts'. What stunts???",8,3,4,5 November 2018
Singin' in the Rain," Great movie
","Great movie, great songs, great plot. Everything was great although I could do without the 'modern number' and the Cyd Charisse scene. Way too long and pointless. Otherwise perfect.",10,0,0,12 May 2020
The Disaster Artist," Really Something
","This would be a good movie all by itself, but the fact that it's based on this other movie, The Room, adds so much more depth. Until you see the ending credits, or The Room, you cannot imagine how bad/good it is. Excellent acting as far as imitating the terrible acting.",7,0,0,31 December 2019
Am√©lie," So Creative
","If I were a director, this is exactly the movie I'd wish to make. Amelie is so creative. All the little impish goofy things she does, the multiple plots, unusual photography, all well done. Personally I thought the first half was better than the second half, but it's still great. Audrey Tautou is excellent, as is everyone else in the movie.",9,0,1,8 January 2019
The Great Escape," A perfect movie
","It's nearly three hours long, but not one boring minute. Being a true story added another dimension. There a number of campy parts but not enough to harm the movie. Stalag 17 was good too but a little too campy. Elmer Bernstein wrote an excellent score.
This is one of those movies that I can't see too often.",10,1,1,21 June 2019
