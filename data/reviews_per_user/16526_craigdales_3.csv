First Man," It as OK and missed some of the truth from his life.
","I thought before they landed on the moon they did a trip around the moon and back again but ever saw this in this film. When they did land on the moon it was sad, most of the film was depressing I understand his daughter died very young but they could of put more energy into the film. I was expecting a more exciting Sci-fi but it felt like it was all about his daughter and it was very sad I did get abit emotional only because I have a young kid and we do what parents do think I hope it doesn't happen to my son and I didn't want to think about that I was hoping for a energetic sci-fi because they was going to land on the moon how exciting but it felt like it wasn't I'm abit disappointed really. Thanks for movie though.",7,1,2,27 November 2018

","Brilliant film well written and directed, really good acting. Well worth the watch I was quite hesitant to watch this film because it's not really the kind of film I like to see but I'm glad I did. It doesn't matter if where black or white we are all equal and that clearly portrayed that between the two characters especially towards the end. Lovely film it's definitely a must watch.",10,2,3,20 February 2019
