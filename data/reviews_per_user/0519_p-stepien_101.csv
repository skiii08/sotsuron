Men in Black 3," The Men Are Back
","When an interstellar evil mastermind Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement) escapes from LunaMax, a moon-based maximum security prison, he returns to Earth to seek both revenge on his captor Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) as well as a means to bring about a Boglodyte invasion. In order to do so Boris steals an illegal time jump machine and travels back in time to eliminate the younger version of Agent K (Josh Brolin). In succeeding in doing so the future alternates with only Agent J (Will Smith) remaining aware that the time-line has been modified. Thus Agent J retreads the path of Boris and goes back in time to avert the death of his friend and the inevitability of Armageddon.Lacking the novelty of the first episodes of the series, 'Men in Black' remains one of the few buddy movies with true effortless charm between the main protagonists. The opposites of Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith collide with sparkling results, thus making them a pure joy to behold, even more so when the comedy keeps in tow with the quality of their interaction. The risk of replacing Tommy Lee Jones with Josh Brolin as Smith's partner was therefore significant. But Brolin was truly remarkable delivering Agent K with aplomb (nailing each mannerism to perfection), to the extent that I actually checked whether Lee Jones and Brolin were maybe in fact related. Personal traits of Agent K are replicated with ease, whilst the appeal of the K and J pairing remained intact.Nonetheless, despite high levels of enjoyment, 'Men in Black 3' came off a bit stale in the post-Archive X era, reusing certain motives making the movie feel somewhat outdated, as if an attempt to revive a bygone era. This naturally has nothing to do with creature design or special effects, which are first-rate throughout. Barry Sonnenfeld delivers a movie, which is exactly as promised, and herein lies the main issue: the lack of adventure and freshness, which made the first two parts such memorable popcorn flicks. That said 'Men in Black 3' delivers an unexpected emotional wallop with its story, which comes as a surprise, but nicely brings the movie to a well-deserved close.",6,1,3,8 June 2013
Mission: Impossible III," Impossibly contrived to sell tickets
","Ethan Hunt (obviously Tom Cruise) attempting to live a more low-key life opposite his love Julia (an unconvincing and forgettable Michelle Monaghan), now has turned from special op to super-trainer. Inadvertently he returns to active service in order to save one of his trainees. Despite a full-fledged operation the mission is a failure and the agent loses her life. Vengefully Hunt's group decides to bring down the man responsible Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman) regardless of being aware of a mole within the agency...Contrived and forced this plan is obnoxiously bad and features some needless melodrama to 'build' Hunt's character. Obviously the worst of the MI movies, especially given the bounce back to quality in the fourth instalment, 'MI:3' serves only as a explanatory filler to certain themes touched upon in the follow-up. Almost self-farcical with little zest, punch or laughs, it collapses quicker then the story. Attempts to flesh out a background life with wife and dog end up counter-productive and are probably the least believable scenes in the movie. Despite several pretty well done scenes (if outlandish) delivery of the whole package is extremely hollow, superficial and not meant for a thinking audience. Something that even skyscraper jumping won't be able to compensate...Surprisingly poor from J. J. Abrams, this much forced episode of the franchise is obviously his worst work to date (unless you count the overlong fall into the abyss during 'Lost'). Rife with shaky cam, quick editing and tiresome repetitive displays Abrams manages to outdo even John Woo's MI:2 in terms of mindless emotionless entertainment.",3,2,4,24 September 2012
Captain Phillips," Greengrass Struggles Aboard the MSV Maersk Alabama
","Paul Greengrass of Bourne fame ventures into the semi-true story of Captain Richard Phillips and his encounter with the not-so-bloody not-so-terrifying pirates of the Somalian coast. When the MSV Maersk Alabama, loaded with food for the poor, starving children of Africa (rolleyes), embarks onto its course to the port of Mombasa from the Oman coastline, they are full aware of the dangers posed by pirate activity in the area. With Somalian kidnapping on the rise, the loaded cargo ship is but another prey for the rag-tag band of yellow-toothed AK47-wielding outlaws. Normally a crew would back down and hand over the ship peacefully, but not this yippee ki yay band of die hards (with glass traps to boot). Led by the scrawny Muse (Barkhad Abdi) this band of hijackers has met their match!!! Achingly overwrought 'Captain Phillips' intends to thrill, together with manipulative background music attempting to heighten the tension, where there is none to behold. Somehow, most people seem to have fallen into the trap set up by Tom Hanks and Greengrass' shaky cam, but when the foursome of motley pirates are set to collide with the navy and seals the attempt to keep tension high is as ludicrous as the outcome is inevitable. The fearless Somalian fishermen-turned outlaws versus the entire might of US military excellence - never has an action thriller been so lopsided in favour of the so-called 'good guys'. This is one movie where I actually found myself rooting for the 'bad guys', despite Greengrass's best intentions to have Phillips and the overbearing force of the US Navy being perceived positively.Riddled with unnecessary focus on detail the movie irritates with its trite dialogue, often inserted to add some skin-deep expansion on the plight of Somalia, but never offering any attempt to flesh out any of the characters. Lacking any meaty commentary Greengrass basically offers a straight up action film, which however lacks the ingredients to make it interesting. The conclusion is foregone from the outset and the lack of depth fails to really emotionally involve with anyone. With the story basically devoid of tension from mid-way (when the terrorist kidnap Captain Phillips and use an escape pod to head for the mainland), the last hour is overbearing to the point of excruciating cries for the story to just end. The realistic fly-on-the-wall never really helps, as it struggles to imbue a sense of purpose of proceedings, making you almost wish for the crew to just dump Captain Phillips in the water, so the movie will finally end.With an overwhelming sense of patronisation of the plight of Somalians, 'Captain Phillips' also barely treads on the right side of the moral landscape. Not to say that Somali pirates are justified or noble, but the story has been literally whitewashed with the fearless 'whites' saving the day and outsmarting their opposition (I believe not a single talking part from the 'good side' was offered to a coloured person). The 'Smiling Pirate' Muse has been vilified, not one mention being made of him actually being underage, with absolutely no focus being placed on 'his side of the story', apart from some banal shopworn tag-lines about his fisherman roots. The beginning was actually promising, when Muse was introduced, but soon focus shifts away from him and suddenly we become overpowered by American patriotism coupled with overblown music intended to force a sense of tension. Single lines of dialogue are afforded to wider ranging issues with Rich Phillips supplying an opening comment about the rat-race juxtaposed with the conditions of life of ordinary Somalians one of the few high points of the drama. Apart from that its an pompous mess of action overly focused on the title character and his emotional responses than to actually posing any serious questions. Tom Hanks acts his heart out, but with such a divisory persona it's hard to really connect with him. The best acting is therefore on the side of the worn Somalian naturals like Abdi, who deserves Oscar recognition much more than Hanks. Nonetheless, the secondary cast of the cargo ship crew was mostly terrible and laughable in their execution, offering a few hardy laughs with their picturesque poses and worried mimicry.Within the cascading amount of Somali pirate movies, this is by far the worst. 'A Hijacking' is hardly a great movie, but shows how deficient Greengrass's storytelling is. Just around the corner: 'Fighting without Nets' will premiere at Sundance and hopefully present a movie with more than one layer to it.",3,18,40,6 January 2014
3:10 to Yuma," Yuma derailed
","Never before has the wild west been so gunslinging, deadly and immoral. A small-time one-legged rancher Dan Evans (Christian Bale) is struggling with debt and is on the verge of his land being taken away by the railroad. Desperate to not let his family down decides to take on the task of transporting the notorious Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) to the 3:10 train to the Yuma prison facility. However his gang of cutthroats and reckless murderers have different plans...The attempted remake of the 1957 film garnered at reviving the Western genre made quite a splash at the box office in no small part thanks to terrific performances by Russell Crowe and Christian Bale. Actually the whole cast does a commendable job with selling a script somewhat short of imbecilic. Another character worth mention is Ben Foster playing the dastardly second-in-command Charlie Prince. However even their best attempts can't hide how poorly written this movie is.What is even more shocking is that the scriptwriters had a perfectly good script to base this movie on. The 1957 version - with all its flaws and low budget - had a tight, compelling and intriguing script which only needed to be brushed up and slightly expanded on. To some extent that was what was done, but somehow Welles and Brandt manage to add a cascade of ideas which derail the Yuma train from any semblance of logic.Warning signs appear from the word go. Given the movie was sold as being realistic or gritty the Gaitling-machine gun opening sequence, as if taken from the annals of 'Wild Wild West', sends out all the wrong signals. Such over-the-top action made me feel like in the middle of a Michael Bay movie set in New Mexico in the XIXth Century. And that is never a good sign. In an apparent attempt to feed considerably more high-budget action than the laid-back original the movie is unable to replicate it's unrelenting feeling of suspense.I must add that I'm not exactly an aficionado of the old Westerns, so I really expected that given the star potential plus the vastly superior movie standards, this new version would sell the idea the way the original couldn't. The final pay-off is however sacrificed for sheriffs riding horses a day after being shot in the belly, blood-hungry Apache Indians and various non-sensical sequences (full with some horrendous wink-winks to its predecessor) which riddle the road to the train station in Contention. In the end the only scenes that really manage to work in this movie are those which are copy-pasted from the 1957 original version (which wasn't really that good).The coup d'etat comes with the final resolution. WARNING - MAJOR SPOILERS. Brutally gutting the movie with ridiculous action the movie already has it rough to sell a believable ending. Unfortunately the slight gentlemanship of Glen Ford is substituted for a blood-hungry crazed and otherworldly fast-gunning Russell Crowe. The earlier movie had one gruesome murder throughout, while this revamped version has blood and guts spilling in the dozens. This makes the final resolution hard to swallow, especially given the change of heart occurs thanks to a pathetic sob story told by Dan during strangulation. From then on Crowe's character gingerly runs in leaps and bounds aboard a train set for Yuma straight towards his planned hanging. Just so the public don't feel too gutted by this turn of events Ben Wade lackadaisically mentions he's broken out of Yuma twice before.What really killed this movie for me was the pay-off, which worked in the original so well. In 1957 Glen Ford's rather silent and enigmatic character decides to help Dan Evans fulfil his mission, due to admiration he starts having towards the unrelenting honest rancher. It is done in such a way, which makes the story spin conceivable, as the help supplied by Ben Wade is lasts just several seconds and can be sold as a spur of the moment initiative. The death of Charlie Prince functions here as unfortunate collateral of this turn of events. In the 2007 blockbuster Russell Crowe actively leads the way to the Yuma train for several arduous minutes. Given he is supposedly the leader of this gang of misfits wouldn't it be easier for him to just tell them to just stop with all this shooting, chasing and killing? On arriving on board the Yuma train Dan Evans is killed by the unknowing Charlie Prince. This ends with Ben Wade singlehandedly gunning down his whole posse of gunslingers. Need I remind you that the only reason those poor dimwits were there in the first place is to save their leader from prison? Absolutely appalling plot resolution.Given such stupidity not even the best intentions of the cast, make-up department or cinematography can change this movie from being a veritable train-wreck that never made it to Yuma.",2,13,22,1 October 2011
The Expendables 2," Going for the Guinness record?
","Sly Stallone returns with the biceps-chiselled super soldiers for hire 'The Expendables' for another adrenaline rush of masculine overdrive. Taking off from where they left has the who-is-who is action movies past and present turning on the ruckus and bringing the bloody noise. The mercenary grouping consists of Sylvester Stallone (as Barney Ross), Jason Statham (as Lee Christmas), Dolph Lundgren (as Gunnar Jensen), Terry Crews (as Hale Caesar), Randy Couture (Toll Road), Liam Hemsworth (as Bill the Kid) and also has a short cameo by Asian kungfu outbreak star Jet Li (Yin Yang). Meanwhile the opposing forces bring fury in the form of the Muscles from Brussels Jean Claude van Damme (as the villain Villain) and Scott Adkins (as Hector). To add to the testosterone we also get treated to extended cameos by Bruce Willis (Church), everyone's favourite governor Arnold Schwarzenegger (Trench) and the invincible Chuck Norris (as Booker). The plot connecting all these personas is entirely secondary, but for those still interested entails some wicked plan of obtaining five tonnes of weapons grade plutonium in order to sell to the highest bidder. Whereas Villain is in the picture for cosmic profit, the Expendables have a more personal plan regarding vengeance after one of their own gets killed.After a stellar box office entry with the original the follow-up seemed inevitable. Giving back some glory back to the great action icons of the 1980s and 1990s the venture proved a welcome self-referential joyride for all involved - viewers, actors and producers alike. Nonetheless, for me personally the original pretence grew old, out-dated, as the ridiculously brash script leaves little room for character development, instead spending most time in an attempt to break the world record for most on-screen deaths (counting in at what seemed like half a century of corpses) and throwing in references to iconic movies of the past. The action itself grew tiresome as endless droves of minions get wiped out without as much as a scratch on our super-squad, while the jabs at public images of stars involved grow increasingly repetitive (as if just retreading paths already ventured) lacking therefore the witty charm of the first instalment.Although somewhat entertaining the humour lacks the same novelty, which made the original work so well, whilst not enough focus was offered to a more brainier, less clichéd story, which would allow for the characters to flesh out and become their own. Conversely the endless carnage offered throughout starts to drag and guest appearances by Arnie or Chuck proved futile in reigniting interest in the movie.Although Stallone no longer stands at the helm the overall control seems not to have shifted. Nonetheless the more chaotic original seemed to offer a stronger outlet for action than the somewhat cumbersome focus on CGI gore, tank sized plot holes and absolute lack of interest in character development. Further instalments are certain to follow as the franchise seems to gather steam, but the series can only go so far on self-referential sarcasm.",3,2,5,20 December 2012
Skyfall," Tying in the past
","After half a century of secret servicing, James Bond (the awkward, but unequivocally manly Daniel Craig) and MI6 comes against their greatest threat: one of their own with a personal vendetta against M (Judi Dench), the mother hen of the British undercover network. During a Turkish mission a disk with all data regarding Arab world based secret agents gets stolen by a specialist hired hand. During the ensuing chase M makes a gut call, which ends with Bond being shot and presumed dead. With the data lost and the best agent gone, M now has to confront public tirades questioning her competence and suggesting her resignation from office. The full extent of the threat caused by the data loss only becomes apparent, when a cyberterrorist hacks into the MI6 HQ causing a gas explosion, killing many and having M watch the debris. This occurrence however brings back James Bond, an undying patriot, who holed up in a seaside resort, syphoning whiskey, while daring scorpions, was enjoying his post mortem retirement. Meanwhile former agent Silva (Javier Bardem) construes his bloody vengeance with little regard to lives lost...Honouring the 50 years of James Bond cinema frenzy comes an honest attempt at arguably the most cranially enjoying outing, which also does its utmost to homage the past Bond movies through witty commentary about the passing of time, introducing a modern era Q (Ben Whishaw) ridiculing shooting pens or simply knocking us back to memory lane by borrowing shots, scenes and gimmicks from past outings of the series. Within this happen questions about time, its relevance and a world best suited for the young, but not abandoned by the old, who search their own place in the new reality. Not entirely subtle in its approach, this 'No Country for Old Men' counterargument falls rather flat, even at times bordering on hammy. Much further the enjoyment caused by the riveting attempt to close an era, complete a circle, which brings the first Bond instalments back into the frame and thus hitting home how great a legacy this series has left.Led by a stellar cast with Dench and Bardem especially excelling, the latter delivering another memorable bad guy persona, but one so strikingly different than Anton Chigurh, one enticingly menacing, but simultaneously infantile.Comparisons have been rife with the Nolan Batman series. And whereas 'Skyfall' is vastly superior to the misguided gibberish of 'The Dark Knight Rises', it fails to reach the level 'The Dark Knight', but at the same time has a worrying tendency to follow too closely the latter's plot line. Just as the Joker allows himself to be captured to forward his grand plan, similarly such is the situation with Silva. The characters of Silva and Joker differ markedly, but unfortunately they overall actions, accompanying goons and certain plot solutions waste away ingenuity implanted elsewhere the Skyfall movie, making it overly repetitive. The plot itself makes little sense, becoming more crude glue interconnecting story lines, dramatic interaction (much more pronounced than in any other Bond movie), chase sequences and big blasts. As the underlying motive behind Silva becomes unhinged with the wanton destruction caused by his actions, the sensibility of his character dissipates, leaving viewers to focus on the drama and the action.Hence despite enjoying the experience the excitement is short-lived, when grey cells reboot and start decoding the senseless story, filled with admittedly riveting sequences and drama.",6,3,10,29 October 2012
Iron Man 3," Funny man
","Rash, egocentric and devoid of lack of self-esteem Tony Stark (his usual briskly ironic Robert Downey Jr) is the ultimate playboy superhero donning the super-powered armour, which makes him Iron Man. Picking up from where 'The Avengers' left off, Stark suffers from abrupt anxiety attacks resulting from his near death fall from the trans-dimensional void with the increasingly self-assured Pepper Potts his main comfort, source of solace and - to an extent - his fixation. When a series of terrorist explosions start occurring through-out the globe, coordinated by the mysterious Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), Tony Stark fails however to take a less front-row seat and actively engages with his newest foe - inviting him to attack him at his seaside mansion (if he dares)...Giving over the helm to the comedic talents of Shane Black has in many ways invigorated Iron Man after the forgettable and drab sequel, which misused all the charm of the original movie. Downey Jr is therefore utilised to his fullest with a tidy sarcastic performance the highlight of proceedings and reaffirming his undoubted position as the best comic superhero performance by a mile. However the jokey side of the new Iron Man seems to overwhelm proceedings, making the action or super-side of the story seem somewhat secondary to Downey delivering a wicked punch-line. The iconic Marvel super-villain Mandarin and key foe of Tony Stark is effectively reduced to a short-legged gag, which may have seemed great during script formation, but effectively dissolves any sense of epic, despite an onslaught of Iron Men Mark 1-26 in the grand finale (including a classical tidbit appearance by Igor), as the replacement villain lacks the credible kapow to enhance the kaboom.The replacement baddie Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) is by no means poor, but once the automated army of super-armours enter the fray, the spectacle just lacks sparkle. The scope of destruction is pretty nice, but the impact level just isn't enough to resonate given the misplaced power level of his foe (compared, for example, to the Avengers). Despite the ongoing phase of comic book movies aspiring to be darker, complex and more realistic, the essential strength behind the whole phenomenon is the want of superheroes battling super-foes. Twists and turns can be welcome, but without a foe worthy of a movie the overall effort just ends up bland. All in all this submarine fails to really surface, instead serving as a vessel for Downey Jr.'s charm and remarkable timing. Actually Downey Jr. rarely even gets to don the Iron Man armour, mostly relying on his whimsical self to liven proceedings. Satisfactory popcorn treat, just somewhat self-defeating by shunning away from the heroesque qualities that should have dominated proceedings.",6,0,1,15 June 2013
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Patchwork filmmaking
","Alice (the eternal Mila Jovovich) is back and in multiple copies. Her prime target is the Umbrella Corporation and the now T-virus enhanced Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts). After a full frontal attack the Umbrella base is left destroyed, but the whole batch of Alice clones get blown sky-high, when Wesker manages to fly away unscathed and detonate the plant. Conveniently for the movie the original Alice survives unscathed as a castaway on-board the plane. During a skirmish with Wesker Alice gets injected with a antidote, that turns her back to being human (but somehow she still manages to survive a terrible plane crash unharmed and keeps her over-the-top fighting abilities largely intact). With Wesker dead and Umbrella disposed of Alice returns to the States to search of her friends, who left for sanctuary in Alaska, only to disappear in mysterious circumstances.In general a much improved instalment of the series and if anything the whole series remains enjoyable, if uninventive. In this part Anderson actually outdoes himself and instead of thinking up something original he starts borrowing scenes from other movies. Wesker looks and fights like Neo's twin brother, the new zombies bring to mind 'Blade 2', whilst The Executioner has a disturbing familiarity to Pyramid Head of the Silent Hill franchise. Nonetheless some of the scenes are very memorable with the combat with The Executioner a real highlight for the movie (especially given the abrupt ending of the final fight).There may be a bit too many generic elements with this movie, but that has never stopped the franchise from being mindless slash-em-up fun. Even if a somewhat weakly scripted one. Also Alice remains a very likable heroine, so no matter how bad the script if she gets proper screen time and a couple of intriguing fights, than the movie just never seems to feel like a waste of time.",6,25,41,6 January 2011
United 93," Hard to 'dislike'
","An morbidly exact reenactment of the famed United 93 flight, which crash-landed in a field on September 11th and thus failing to reach the target point. By way of story memories of proceedings are still strongly etched in the minds of most of humanity, even though specific details are unknown. Paul Greengrass attempts to bring forth these details presenting a real time movie of occurrences which took place that day.With great focus on detail and language, the story shifts between control centres across the country and passengers of the doomed plane. Dialogues are painstakingly realistic, even professional lingo is used during conversations between air control personnel. Deeply essential to this realism is the all-engulfing feeling of utter chaos (enhanced by a shaky lens), giving an evocative understanding of how surprised and unprepared officials were to the attacks reacting in confusion and emotions to a situation outside their guidebooks. 'United 93' goes to great length to present a matter-of-fact portrayal showing the fright, hopelessness, acceptance of inevitability and then the fatal moment of bravery. Characters aren't really presented or portrayed, their actions in response to the situation they were in are more important, while the rest is fittingly ignored (out of reverence to the victims).With such a picture brought about so soon after the attacks the movie holds a large amount of reverence to (most) victims, one can help but question the necessity of making such a movie. Ultimately a documentary style re-enactment in true cinema verite style brings no commentary to the disaster and while it causes several moments of gut-wrenching honesty, can anything ever really overshadow the feelings that everyone had on that fateful day? Do we really need to film it and see it in-depth to accept the tragedy? Even though mostly tasteful, reverential and with a required subtlety I couldn't help but question necessity. Essentially a movie that in honour of victims is hard to be disliked, but I couldn't help but question how exploitive a movie like this is...One asinine no-no by the filmmakers is the much talked about presentation of a German passenger in negative light, even though there are no suggestions that he ever went against the remainder of the passengers giving it a despicable anti-European touch, which shockingly and inappropriately disgusts.",6,1,3,12 September 2012
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," The other Lincoln
","Based on the same-titled quasi-biographical horror novel by Seth Grahame-Smith retells the story of Abraham Lincoln (Benjamin Walker), portraying him as much more than a statesman responsible for toppling slavery, instead delving into his hidden identity as a vampire slayer. During his youth he witnessed his mother taken away by vampire Joshua Speed (Jimmi Simpson), thus the festering anger evolves into an unrelenting desire for revenge. Reckless in his craze Lincoln is confronted by reluctant vampire Henry Sturges (Dominic Cooper), who promises to teach him how to channel the hatred and become the ultimate scourge of vampires. Despite great success Lincoln ultimately stabilises his life in the arms of Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and thus forfeits one craft focusing on his political career. However the path he started cannot be left so easily and simply...Unlike the Steven Spielberg directed biography this Abraham Lincoln portrayal won't be getting any love at the Oscars or Golden Globes. Directed by Timur Bekmambetov of 'Night Watch' fame offers more of the same in terms of style: bombastic expressive flair with an utter disrespect for substantial script backdrop. Despite an absolutely ridiculous concept, apt for much ridicule, the story premise isn't as cringe-worthy as expected. Various tidbits of Lincoln history fit in nicely to the concept of his career as a vampire hunter, whilst the involvement of vampires into the civil war is pretty sensible, if contemptuously disregarding for historical recounts.All in all groups of audiences will cringe at the audacity of the idea, whilst others are certain to find an appeal. More inclined to the later, I was however put off by the somewhat turgid style of Bekmambetov, who does manage to put together luscious action sequences, but fails to instill enough heart into proceedings to make it anything more than eye candy. At times a peculiarly fun, if bloody, pastiche, else a somewhat nonsensical venture into triviality. Unfortunately not playful enough or conversely dark and dreary, instead has a cartoonish feel collaged with dramatic sequences from Lincoln's life. That said it seems necessary to underline that somehow the absurdity of Lincoln being a vampire slayer is scrumptiously fleshed into his biography, making it somewhat passable and not a sheer ridiculous running joke. Some of the CGI is somewhat plastic and strikingly obvious, especially regarding a sheer terrible vampire chase on top of stampeding horses. Not entirely a failure, but still not entertaining and engaging enough to be anything more than a pass-time: a fun idea devoid of enough fun to make it fulfill its promise.",5,1,2,23 December 2012
Gravity," Space Thriller
","Alfonso Cuaron's gripping 3D extravaganza finally delivers a movie well-worth its 3D special effects, which puts to shame the simplistic idiocy of 'Avatar'. Around the Earth's orbit a team of American astronauts are repairing communication lines on a space shuttle. While scientist-engineer Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) focuses on the technical issues, experienced, slightly cowboyish Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) frivolously space-walks engaging into boyish banter of 'did I ever tell you of the time...' When a Russian destruction of a obsolete satellite results in the a cascading domino effect of catastrophic scale, the shuttle is destroyed with Kowalski and Stone drifting in space with oxygen slowly running out.Not exactly a sci-fi, as basically the only element that hints at anything remotely other-worldly is a short dream sequence near the end of the movie. Apart from that, save for some small script liberties, this is a factual riveting thriller, basically as down-to-earth as cosmic space stories goes as possible. Sandra Bullock returns to form with her great portrayal, grasping all the moments from despair and panic to resignation and the will to live. She is also expertly paired up with the whimsical, but stoic, Kowalski, together with some superb visuals and perfect building of tension, bringing a whole new meaning to the phrase: In space no one will hear you scream...The dramatic/philosophical edge to the movie may not work as well, with the whole backdrop of Stone's dead child somewhat struggling to add relevance to the story, nonetheless this is in no way written or delivered in a substandard way, thus not of any detriment to overall enjoyment.Required watching. Just for the thrill of it! If nothing else.",8,7,15,23 December 2013
World War Z," Brad Pitt vs the World War Z
","Based on the acclaimed horror novel by Max Brooks, this version of the zombie apocalypse takes on a markedly different route than the original source material. Whereas Brooks presented the story as a series of detached stories, which help form the bigger picture, the pretty large cast of scriptwriters opted for a more cinematic approach, mostly owed to the preference of having one on-screen hero, instead of a multitude of short-lived appearances. Given the fact that Brad Pitt is the main star, it was pretty apparent that the super-powered actor would feature full-length and not be underutilised to one of many small segments.Therefore Brad Pitt as UN operative Gerry Lane functions as the heart and soul, saviour and protector, lock, stock and barrel, taking on a one man army stance against the zombie onslaught, flying across the globe from New York to Korea, Israel or Wales. Naturally this is somewhat of an over-reach on my behalf, as Lane is much more frail a figure, requiring SEALs to protect his behind, nonetheless to an exaggerated extent Lane becomes the soul of almost everything positive in this movie, as all the events and actions of the novel are appropriated to Pitt. The movie starts off inconspicuously with Gerry Lane joyously preparing pancakes for his family of four - his wife Karin (a welcome appearance by Mireille Enos) and two daughters Constance (Sterling Jerins) and Rachel (Abigail Hargrove). Slowly news of the appearance of zombies start filtering through the media, but nothing has the world prepared for what is about to take place, when a sudden appearance of the zombie virus has New York quickly fall into chaos, panic and a tidal wave of destruction. Having successfully escaped with his family onto an aircraft carrier off the coast of America, Gerry Lane is quickly employed (as a specialist on survival danger areas) to assist the UN in finding out the source of the sickness, which turns people into undead within a matter of seconds or minutes (depending on the strain). Meanwhile the outbreak goes global...At times immaculately intense, bubbling with relentless tension, at others moments frightening to the core, while not bypassing the potential for pure unadulterated spectacle, 'World War Z' is a surprisingly effective movie, which deservedly soared towards box-office glory. Despite its rabid pacing, the story almost never unravels aimlessly, instead affording much time for the situations to intensify, just before the explode with a vengeance. Ignoring the pure simple shock factors, director Marc Forster inspirationally forms scenes overladen with both horror and emotion.Probably the best all-out zombie feature since '28 Day Later', 'World War Z' does feature several innate common characteristics, mostly so by redefining the threat as something more akin to rabbis, than to decomposing bodies lazily sulking around. Zombies here are fast, furious and unrelenting, giving them a more frightening presence, which lacks in most such movies (and well ridiculed by features such as 'Shaun of the Dead'). The threat suddenly becomes more visceral, as the attacks are reminiscent of an army of insects covering their prey within a matter of minutes. Other changes were introduced into the zombie characteristics, much like in the Danny Boyle English apocalypse, which help redefine the foe into intriguing new directions and thus allowing for new dramatic developments as far the genre is concerned. The relatively enormous budget also affords Marc Forster space for some spectacular scenes with swarms of zombies roaming countrysides, cities and bringing utter havoc on never before seen scales. Forster however also gives time and space for more low-key encounters with zombies, mixing it up so as to avoid repetition. At times the movie is rampant and furious, but also has the capacity to feel confined, slowly building tension and heightened expectations, especially towards the more toned down final act of the movie.Despite the accolades for the overall movie itself, several thorns do stick out, gauchely pricking the wrong nerves. This includes several plot holes, whereas the most apparent is the suggestion that the plague was dispersed across the world via air-planes. However given that the sickness incubates for mere minutes, this just isn't feasible. Instead a scenario more akin to that of Ebola is likely - the virus spreads with such deadly intensity and at such a rate, that the sickness has no time to spread vastly. Another troublesome issue regards the whitewashing of the racist apartheid state of Israel, which is presented as a welcoming, open country with the walls being constructed solely for the purpose of preventing such a zombie onslaught. And not for the purpose of ethnic cleansing as is the reality (scenes of Palestinians and Jews idyllically singing in joy of reunification were uncomfortably out-of-order). Brings into question how much cash the Israeli government flung at the movie to present them as doves of peace...Nonetheless, despite these flaws 'World War Z' presents itself as another strong zombie movie of the year (after 'Warm Bodies') and a must-watch summer flick.",8,1,4,7 September 2013
The Impossible," Tragically empty
","Boxing Day. 2004. After an underwater earthquake a tsunami hits the shores of East Asia. A family of five Maria (Naomi Watts), Henry (Ewan McGregor) and their three kids: Lucas (Tom Holland), Thomas (Samuel Joslin) and Simon (Oaklee Pendergast) are blissfully spending time on the shores of a Thai luxury hotel. Unexpectedly the wave hits them unawares while having fun in the pool. Soon the family is torn apart with Maria and Lucas swept away and Henry holding the two youngest sons disappearing in the undertow.Juan Antonio Bayona delivers a spectacular recreation of the tsunami with its destructive currents leaving a destitute landscape in its wake. Given this ordeal and its scale it seems obvious that when the water settles the ensuing drama of dealing with the aftermath will take over. At first we follow Maria and Lucas, who stick together even with the risk of life, thankfully manage to come out alive, holding each other in embrace. Grateful at least to have each other, and as they fully realise the miracle of surviving the incident the obvious dawns on them - the inevitability that the remainder of the family is most probably dead. Naturally anyone privy to seeing a trailer or even knowledgeable that killing the only recognisable star (apart from Watts) five minutes into the movie is highly unlikely knows that Henry is bound to reappear. Couple that together with the all-telling title 'Impossible' and soon the obviousness is obvious: The whole family will impossibly survive. Thus making the whole rabbit run around the devastation in search of family members a prolonged path to the inevitable conclusion, which makes the tidal wave seem nothing more than a minor time-consuming inconvenience. Unfortunately this search for family constitutes the remainder of the story, albeit it also offers sights of all-engulfing chaos and scenes or glimpses of families not as lucky. The whole plodding certainty as to the finale is finally put to ridicule during a comedic runaround at a Thai hospital with family members 'just missing each other' for five or so minutes, which - despite the sombre music - invoked some badly placed laughter.'Impossible' proved somewhat of a conundrum. The whole event itself is so dramatic, that it is hard to denigrate a heart-warming story connected to it. But the shock factor and then layered sentimentality on offer by Bayona is just so overwhelming, that I never really felt for any of the main characters, even more so that the conclusion was apparent once the waves rescinded. Given how emotional the premise, I found myself astounded that I just didn't empathise despite Bayona's obvious attempt to milk the audience (and I am easy person to jerk a few tears out of). But maybe that was the problem? The manipulation of tear glands is just too forced. All in all a bloated cutesy waste of a spectacularly well made catastrophe with an overbearing message: that in such a deadly calamity it's good to be rich and white... As soon as the family reunites they are whisked off in an empty private jet to the safety of first class hospital care. Shame the movie didn't end immediately after the tsunami...",3,7,16,10 February 2013
Argo," Countering the Dark Forces
","Rediscovering himself in the guise of a brilliant director, Ben Affleck ('The Town', 'Gone Baby Gone') changes tune and returns with a political historical drama much in the mold of Steven Soderbergh's or fellow actor/director George Clooney. Obviously a future talent to be reckoned with, Affleck again comes up with a skillfully focused, well scripted and deceptively subversive movie about a true CIA operation placed somewhere on the verge of absurd and ingenious. When six American embassy workers escape being taken hostage by Iranian revolutionist forces during the 1979 upheaval, the find refuge in the home of the Canadian ambassador. With the situation quickly deteriorating and no hope of legally extracting them from Iran, special operative exfiltration expert Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) conceives an idea to create a fake Star Wars rip-off film production called 'Argo' and thus smuggle them out of the country as part of the movie crew. In order to bring this to fruition he employs Oscar-winning make-up artist John Chambers (John Goodman) and Hollywood producer Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin), who states with intent that 'If I'm going to make a fake movie, I'm going to make a fake hit.' Equally thrilling as it it absurd Ben Affleck shows an surprisingly mature capability to mix up humour with the dramatic backdrop, thus creating arguably one of the most entertaining political features in history. Despite strong thematic ties to Barry Levinson's 'Wag the Dog', partly due to the fact that it is closely based on a real story and its pulsating authenticity, 'Argo' is a vastly superior movie (but I still find 'The Town' to be Affleck's best movie, 'Argo' however proves that Affleck is not limited in talent to certain subject matters). Given the subject matter the urge to drop into a less serious tone for a satire on the entertainment industry was reigned in, nicely balancing the '%^&* You Argo' idiocy with the stark deadly reality of the situation at hand. Even scenes of utter dread, for instance during the final check just before allowed to board the plane, has its moments of gleeful subversive humour (as revolutionaries admire the storyboard of the sci-fi fantasy pseudo-movie). Conversely Affleck shows level-handed humility in portraying events, while somehow managing to bring a pulsating touch of reality to Iran - you can almost feel the dusts of revolution floating in the air.Ben Affleck also shows some respectful awareness as to the bigger picture, basically starting the whole movie with a short introduction into history, including the fact that Iran and the revolution were self-made CIA-inspired events dating back to morally doubtful interventions into the young Iranian democracy and their direct impact on reinstating a bloody dictator. Some doubts can be raised towards the patriotic ending, where an overly gloating ending relishes in the fact, that an American special operative success will be claimed by the Canadians. Not to mention somewhat 'Lord of the Rings' serial endings. Otherwise however a truly brilliant movie by the new prodigy of American cinema.",8,0,0,19 January 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Boldly falling flat on its nose
","Star Wars is back - force abundant - parading around in Trekkie uniforms and supplanting Wookies with a miniature sidekick Keenser. Any semblance of a cohesive and immersing story has been supplanted by an onslaught of special effects and epic battles, which fail to hit the mark (both logically as well as visually). The flimsy hatchet job script supplied by a trio of vastly overrated scriptwriters Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof, flings the Enterprise into a story much bigger than its bite.With the opening sequence the intent is clear: the spectacle itself trumps all. Despite the action being totally illogical the script has the Enterprise resting underwater as part of a reconnaissance mission to a pre-warp civilisation. The idea of the Enterprise emerging from the ocean was just too mouth-watering for Abrams and his crew, but honestly: what happened to waiting quietly off planet and teleporting when necessary? And don't get me started with teleporting... The 'new and improved' Star Trek can teleport people light years away onto vessels moving at warp speed, but can't teleport people off a volcano? Ke? But enough of that for now, as there will be enough banter following regarding the ineptitude of the story. Spock (Zachary Quinto), having almost perished in lava, and Kirk (Chris Pine) return back to Earth, where both are demoted for breaking the cardinal rule of non-intervening into the development of pre-warp species (remember that thing with the Enterprise resting underwater and having to emerge from the ocean? Connect the dots.). The situation however soon changes when the deviously enigmatic terrorist and exceptionally British gentleman Commander John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch), bombs an underground facility and then attacks Star Trek command central. This new opponent may yet prove Spock and Kirk biggest foe... and his real name is... da da dam! Guess!Within the framework of script-working gaffes and borrowing of concepts or even entire scenes from previous Star Trek movies, 'Into Darkness' is a less than enjoyable piece of commercialised Star Trek hogwash. As much as I understand the need for Star Trek to update itself to the modern crowd, dummifying it and amplifying the volume towards a less cerebral Star Wars direction, is clearly a misstep and possibly a damaging hit to the franchise.That said the one thing that works immaculately and offers hope that with a less superficial team of director and scriptwriters the franchise may yet hit warp speed, is the immense cast. Both Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto have immersed into the characters flawlessly, now almost forming their own new legend. The standout character however is Karl Urban as doctor Bones, nailing everything about the character to perfection, with one of the performances of the year. Nonetheless - with detriment to the dynamics of the crew - Bones is underutilised, rarely functioning as the contemplative voice of emotive reason, which made him arguably the best character in all Star Trek history.And naturally there is the baffling revelation: After years of promising that the sequel won't feature Khan Noonien Singh, Benedict Cumberbatch ultimately reveals himself to be the famed Sikh via Mexico (as previously portrayed as Ricardo MontalbÃ¡n). Naturally true Star Trek fans - to which I do not belong - had cognitive clicks the moment 72 missiles were mentioned, but this big reveal was evident pretty early on. Given the distinctly English features and traits, Cumberbatch must be widely held as a weird actor choice and awkward retcon of the origins of Star Trek's most famous villain, possibly in a vain attempt to deflect suspicions away from Khan as to the true identity of Commander John Harrison. Additionally Khan's more complex motivations, as presented in the original series and film, were supplanted by hints of genocidal warfare, making him a paper-thin villain dedicated solely to mindless destruction and death. What's worse Khan's preference of brain over brawn, as a preferred weapon of choice, gets hijacked.It would have however served a better purpose to just stick with the original Khan or just forgo the notion of using this character at all. Especially if you don't intent to retcon the famous genetic wars of the 1990s (remember those times?). With this superficial usurping of Khan, J.J. Abrams further damages his own reboot, underlined by a ridiculous 'Khaaaannnn!!!' moment during the final act. Furthermore after the idiotic re-imagination of Star Trek science and the introduction of trans-warp teleportation (which unfortunately was not buried away into oblivion, but actually utilised by Khan to escape from Earth into Klingon territory), Abrams throws in the kitchen sink by giving Khan's blood the power of guaranteeing immortality and resurrecting the dead. Naturally the implications of both 'discoveries' are devastating: What's the point in trekking, if you can teleport yourself across the galaxy within seconds? And where's the drama, if all sickness, death and so forth have been rendered null and void? Whether or not future instalments will somehow manage to avoid falling into the grave dug out by Abrams is questionable, given the only surefire ways of surpassing these problems are either rebooting the reboot or just magnanimously intentionally avoiding any mention of their existence.",3,0,3,5 September 2013
Public Enemies," Headache city
","Any movie with Johnny Depp is a must see as far as I'm concerned. The greatest actor of his generation by far, so add to that the raging 30s, John Dillinger and some tommy-guns and I'm there.John Dillinger to some extent represented the end of an era. Glorification of crime under the smile of slippery bank-robber John Dillinger as the modern Robin Hood was a product of a certain era of American prosperity and then its downfall. Roosevelt and the end of the Great Depression brought about a new reality and Dillinger fell as quickly as he rose to fame.To some extent this is a movie about the changes coming about. Unfortunately this momentous occasion to delve into the unbelievable mindset of the era was wasted and we got more cat-and-mouse with just a couple of flashes of analysis. Johnny Depp is brilliant as always, but his character was led into a corner with lacking character development.The movie hints and suggests but doesn't actually have the courage to delve into the era. Add to that the shaky cam and semi-professional look of the picture and we are in for a disappointment. Michael Mann seems to think that a jumping picture is 'innovative' and 'adds a modern look'. As far as I'm concerned all it adds is viewer headaches. Minus 2 stars for the appalling picture that almost makes the movie unwatchable on the big screen.",5,0,2,28 July 2009
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Above average video game extravaganza
","The swashbuckling medieval parkour running Prince of Persia, Dastan, hits the big screen in the form of Jake Gyllenhaal, fully equipped with manly stubble, bulging biceps and an intriguing women-killing smirk. Female audiences will be pleased - no matter how bad the movie. Men won't be all that disappointed with Gemma Arteton as Princess Tamina, Dastan's love-hate affair. Add to that some outworldly action sequences, a big-ass Nubian dagger-thrower (Steve Toussaint), Ben Kingsley and horde of snake-charming dart-shooting hassassins. Oh... and there is a time dagger, sands of time and a decent script to boot.Basically your typical summer blockbuster. But done right. With a great mix of nice acting, a pinch of humour, impressive fights and some superb acrobatics by Gyllenhaal's character this movie did not go wrong. It may be ultimately purely popcorn, but if you need a mind relaxing break this is a superb choice. Yes, it may be generic, essentially uninventive, maybe even redundant and very typical storywise, but at least the story more or less makes sense and the action is unrelenting, but never tiresome.The only main issue I have is the overly forced character of Sheik Amar (Alfred Molina) brought in purely as comic relief. Given however the adequate chemistry between Dastan and Tamina filled with comedic moments the character of Amar seemed unnecessary. He also grew tiresome very fast (something in the vein of Jar Jar Binks irritating) and felt more like something taken out of a 'Hercules' episode (yes, the Kevin Sorbo one).",6,0,1,30 August 2010
Ted," What if Alf...
","Starting as any ordinary Christmas story: When John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg), an isolated friendless kid, wishes for his teddy bear to become real a simultaneously falling star transforms the cuddly toy into a living being, thus becoming best buds ever. However life goes on after childhood, as time goes by, age catches on and the child becomes a man. Ted (Seth Macfarlane) was something of a celebrity back in the days, as a walking-talking-thinking teddy with no place in our scientific-based reality. Now foul-mouthed and wise-cracking his body has remained unchanged, but inside has grown up. Still living with John they form an inseparable duo, much to the chagrin of the latter's girlfriend Lori Collins (Mila Kunis). Perpetually attached to his childhood teddy bear, John fails to grow up and take on responsibility, instead working at a dead-end job and lacking any sensibility or push to alternate his existence.Admitedly a fan of Seth Macfarlane 'Ted' seemed like a match in heaven - an intriguing premise, a stellar cast and the great comedic artistry of Macfarlane. Alas the sense of humour is a drop below his high standards, somewhat more crude and less whimsically well-placed than normal. Typically non-politically correct the overall concept works well, but lacks the substance and content for the long run, making the screen time enjoyment peter out. Most of the humour focuses on the cute teddy being lewd, heavy on drug use and apt to sexual endeavours with prostitutes or various pop stars. Inasmuch as it works for the character it doesn't make up enough backdrop for creating the holistic script. Wahlberg and Kunis do add some presence, but there just isn't enough meat on this comedic bone to make it work throughout - the silliness starts off as being charming, but just ends up tiresome.",6,2,2,23 December 2012
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Origins and Weapon X condensed
","X-Men Origins: Wolverine is over 100 minutes of hit and miss. At times you are really at awe with the movie and how well acted it is. At other times it is cringe-worthy. End verdict definitely a lot more of the good than the bad.I would have wanted something that is based a lot more on the either Origins or Barry Windsor-Smith's Weapon X. This movie however takes a bit of both, mixes it up and some random flavours. We get to know the life of James Howlett aka Logan aka Wolverine and his relationship with William Stryker and Victor Creed aka Sabretooth.As far as acting is concerned Liev Schrieber is a different class of actor and steals the role, making all accusations of him not being big enough or not blonde enough seem stupid. Fortunately they connected everything that was wrong with Sabretooth in X-Men 1. This is the sadistic, murderous and immoral Creed we know from the comics. And lack of goldielocks won't change that.Hugh Jackman is Wolverine apart from the fact, that the famous one-liner 'I'm the best at what I do...' fell really flat. Apart from that he did a bang up job at getting in touch with the animal as well as the human within Logan.I must also commend Danny Huston as William Stryker and I actually preferred this version of the character, than the one in X-Men 2.Other characters are done OK, apart from surprisingly flat selling of jokes by Ryan Reynolds and Taylor Kitsch's accent being all over the place.My major irks concern: a) The totally useless introduction of Gambit. Yes, the fight was cool. Yes, the character was cool. But you could feel how forced the inclusion of the character was. b) The whole boxing scene with the Blob was badly done and the comic relief just felt corny. c) Some of the plot points, like Silverfox faking her death just weren't dealt with right.I would have also liked more 'bonding' between the team at the beginning of the movie.In the end a great movie, much better than X1 and X3, but you leave the cinema knowing that if they had basically copied i.e. Weapon X the movie could have been so much more.",7,1,2,5 June 2009
500 Days of Summer," Love in a nutshell
","Tom Hansen (played by the phenomenal Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a mild-mannered card-writing architect. You know - the guy who thinks up lines in birthday cards and such, but in truth wants to mold the city-line. A romantic at heart he deftly falls in love with his new co-worker Summer (Zooey Deschanel). Jumping from across 500 days (to and fro) the movie presents us the high and lows of their relationship and break-up, as well as with the hardships with letting go of the love that keeps him bound to Summer. Everything pulsating with intelligent dialogue, subtle and funny humour, as well as with some really thoughtful input on sex, love and the other relationship stuff.Slightly experimental quirky romantic comedy with an intriguing scattered structure, which does not draw much comparisons to anything I've ever seen. And that's despite the fact that the movie is populated with pop-cultural references and borrowed scenes from other movies on an almost Tarantino-like level. Frontlining Joseph Gordon-Levitt, in my opinion the best actor of his generation (including i.e. Leonardo di Caprio) to such a strong script also does a multitude of favours for the movie, as he manages to sell the full range of emotions from love and passion to hate and despair seemingly without an effort. I do however find Zooey Deschanel unable to cope with the character and script she is offered (a feeling I see is not popular among viewers). The character she plays is irritating, self-centered and essentially unlikeable. I understand that relationships mean that opposites attract, but Summer is sold at the beginning of the movie through voice-over as the heart and soul of the universe, but ultimately she is scripted as a heartless, unbelievably selfish and egoistical vixen, which seems to conflict with earlier information on her person. That said Zooey's chemistry with Tom is spot on and albeit she never has the same screen presence as Gordon-Levitt she does an admirable back-up job, which helps the story flow and entrench us into the high-and-lows for their relationship. All in all the misgivings of her character have to be put on the shoulders of the script, but Zooey never seems to have the strength of character to convince me that she is worth the despair.Thankfully however Summer is a supporting character and despite relatively good screen-time she fades into the background of the emotions and feelings of Tom Hansen, who dominates the screen throughout the movie, even when singing 'The Pixies' during drunken karaoke. The question essentially isn't whether Summer deserves Tom's admiration and love, but on the process he goes through and where it leads him to in life.Apart from Summer the remaining cast on the movie is extremely intriguing and likable, especially highlighted by a very influential minor role by 'Kick Ass''s Chloe Moretz.I have minor issues with a couple of scenes, albeit one concerns the climax of the movie, when Tom quits his job. Tom basically starts throwing out nonsensical 'deep thoughts' in front off his work comrades, which seem forced and are a bit lacking in any substantial afterthought. Given this is a key scene it slightly hit the overall grading of this almost perfect movie. I always wasn't too keen on the solution of the movie and the way Tom passed on to Autumn. The whole sequence felt a bit stale - as if the scriptwriter got hit by a deadline and quickly pasted on the first ending that came to mind.In the end minus one for the character of Summer and another minus one for a couple of badly written scenes.",8,0,0,15 January 2011
Don Jon," Debutant jitters by the Don
","Joseph Gordon-Levitt writes, directs and stars in the whimsical tale about a pornographic addiction. Eons away in style, tone and gravity as compared to the similarly themed 'Shame', 'Don Jon' is a comedy drama set in New Jersey about Jon, a narcissistic young man, whose life is focused on his bulging biceps, one night stands and his addiction to porn. Dedicated to a simple few things, Jon isn't the type who looks for long term relationships. Until he meets the blonde bombshell Barbara Sugarman (Scarlett Johansson in her most charismatic role in years), who captures Jon's undying attention and slowly wraps him around her finger - making him take up a business course, fighting his small idiosyncrasies and - worst of all - obliging him to resign from pornhub...The star of the movie excels as the straight-forward Jersey Italian, unaware of his weakness, living in denial, yet too simplistic to remold himself. The denouement, when it comes, seems however largely out of character, as Jon gains depth, complexity and self-awareness far beyond anything suggested earlier in the movie. Such a revelatory change happens plot-wise, but seems overly forced, lacking a structural backbone which can not be explained by the impact of his affair with classmate Esther (Julianne Moore).Nonetheless, 'Don Jon' is an extremely enjoyable affair, especially for its target group - men at large - uncovering some unspoken truths about masculinity. At times Joseph Gordon-Levitt's script reveals some true wit and foresight, with the last scene of Jon in a confessional a true mantelpiece of the movie, delivering a wickedly accurate commentary on the institution of confession. Slightly uneven, 'Don Jon' does also mostly capture the man's point of view on the subject matter, albeit (possibly purposefully) omitting the female perspective so widely approached in rom-coms. Thankfully the comedy does so, while omitting crude sexual humour in a porn-focused movie. Joseph Gordon-Levitt delivers an admirable debut, especially with some of the manly banter and in the construction of several scenes. With time and experience (and a more subtly developed script) he may yet become competition for Ben Affleck as the most talented next-generation actor-director in America.",7,0,0,23 December 2013
The Prestige," Below par movie from 'Memento' creator
","I came to see this movie with very high hopes, but came away severely disappointed. In an age where it seems every movie has to have a 'surprise ending' this is no different from many other movies out there at the moment. I guess the bulk of my criticism comes from the fact that I guessed the plot of the film, together with its two theorethically surprise twists at the end about 20 minutes (Tesla exhibition + multiple top-hats in the first scenes of the movie) and 40-45 minutes into the movies (Borden gravediggin'). From then on it was just waiting and saying to myself 'That was so obvious'. At fault is the director and scriptwriter who seemed to throw to much apparent clues too soon in the movie.Chris Bale does I must say a spectacular job as Borden, with Hugh Jackman supplying a satisfying if indifferent performance. The biggest flop was the babe meaning Scarlett Johannson, who seems to think the only thing necessary to act is to show some skin and to pucker up her seductive lips.I especially find flaw with the whole premise of the story... if you do a magic film you take one of three routes to make it coherent and with some cohesive background.A) You include real magic making the story more mystical; B) You put into the movie unexplainable events and leave it to the audience to decide if the magic is real or false; C) You show that everything is a trick, although the tricks are so ingenious that they add a certain punch to the movie.YOU DON'T DO SOMETHING WHICH IS A BIT OF THIS OR A BIT OF THAT making it in a muddled incoherent mess. Unfortunately all solutions to the movie were basically the easiest solutions, meaning that the scriptwriters (novelist?) really didn't try to hard to think of more surprising alternatives to the story.The end solutions were apparent from a mile away, the Scarlett role was dismal and all in all the story very much unimpressive. Giving these factors even though I absolutely love 'Memento' and congratulate Nolan on 'Batman Begins' I have to give my thumbs down and a 3/10 (with one point added for Christian Bale's portrayal).",3,7,16,13 November 2006
The Adventures of Tintin," Drunken master and the Tintin the Kid
","The first motion-capture adventure into the world of blond-haired blue-eyed reporter Tintin (voiced by Jamie Bell), Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis) and fox terrier Snowy throws us into the remarkable secret of the Unicorn. Engulfed by the fantastic imagination of Belgian artist Georges Remi we travel the world by sea, by plane or by foot, traversing through vast waters, deadly deserts or the mysteries of the streets of London. All in search of a treasure map leading to the gold from the Unicorn, the sunken ship of Sir Francis Haddock. Along the way evildoer Sakharine (Daniel Craig) attempts to foil the youngster's plan and claim glory for himself.A spectacular and engaging experience in computer enhanced animation based on tremendous motion capture trumps 'Avatar' given its vastly superior story and likable characters. Pinned down to perfection every scene is a feast for the eye, unremittingly fast-paced and entertaining. Be it following the exploits of a wrist-happy kleptomaniac in a London market or a duel between 20 metre high cranes Tintin never drops a beat delivering on a promise of high-octane adventure.Steven Spielberg manages to keep Tintin as fresh as cuisine sushi, destined for the household of every movie-lover irrespective of age, race or back-ground. Nonetheless Tintin fails to grasp the animal magnetism of his soul-mate Indiana Jones, while the boyish charm does wear thin with time, albeit this is thankfully counterpointed with the drunkard crass character of Captain Haddock, who ignites immediate engagement. Nonetheless the love affair with perfection does have its downsides, as the story delivers an overdose of action, leaving a sense of fulfilment of expectations about half-way through the movie and a lingering hope for final credits soon after. The story itself is essential fun, but wanton of unexpected thrills given the limited charm of the title character. A clash with destiny on the future of filmmaking is nonetheless an unabashed success, albeit one fraught with the stigma of pure unabated enjoyment bereft of deeper content. Nonetheless Spielberg rides his storm with pizazz delivering us into an ultimately charming world of adventure and fun straight from the drawings of Remi.",7,0,0,5 July 2012
Megamind," Megamoot
","What makes a hero? Upbringing, genetics or some cosmic mix of fate? As two pods with infants near Earth they collide. One carrying Megamind (Will Ferrell) ends up in a prison facility, where he is consequently raised by the inmates and their perverse sense of right and wrong. The other one, carrying Metro Man (Brad Pitt), lands where Megamind was destined to be before the ill-fated collision: straight into luxury and the loving care of a high-class family. Thus their fates seem to be set from the start with the privileged and indestructible Metro Man destined to be a hero, while Megamind always pigeonholed as the offender, the bad guy, the villain. During another of their countless confrontations, Megamind seemingly destined for an n-teenth defeat, the inexplicable happens, as Metro Man suddenly meets his demise. Thus Megamind has managed the ultimate victory and is left to control Mega City unchallenged. But no challenge, means no fun, so Megamind soon ventures to create himself a new super-foe (while simultaneously falling in love with journalist Roxanne Ritchie (Tina Fey))...The animation genre has a knack for extremely well-written narratives, possibly due to the immense budgets for creativity, which are necessary for their development. 'Megamind' feels well-polished as a nicely wrought satire on the superhero genre with some hearty commentary on the human nature (although lets not get overly philosophical on the impact the movie aims to make). Nonetheless 'Megamind' falls foul to high expectations of the genre, lacking a strong backbone of likable characters, instead featuring an extremely irritating and plain unfunny Jonah Hill as Tighten as the ultimate foe. Megamind, Metro Man and Roxanne each have limited appeal with none of the secondary cast captivating interest. Limitedly humorous 'Megamind' fails to be truly entice, and as it is above all entertainment, deserves low grades in this regard. Despite some admirable underlying themes, which should be applauded by parents for their significance, the frontal narrative lacks enough inspirational impact to truly linger on the mind.",4,2,7,6 January 2013
Malcolm X," A travesty - no Oscar for Denzel
","Spike Lee newly acquired position as the top dog amongst Afroamerican directors with extremely high art-house appeal was put to good use with initiating the production of 'Malcolm X'. Based on his autobiography with slight parts edited in, updated or filled Spike Lee dares not to venture far from the source material giving this key figure in black activism an extremely accurate, albeit lengthy movie portrayal. Not backing down on a critique of the small-minded 'Nation of Islam' Spike Lee also unabashedly takes on Malcolm X's point of view in the key breakaway from the movement by its biggest spokesperson.A huge figure for black America is gifted a great cinematographic autobiography, which only flaw is being too short while running over 3 hours. Certain key aspects of Malcolm X's life are glossed over (like his prison term or the fate of his mother), as is a glaring under-focusing on post-Hajj era of Malcolm's career, the one which in all essence has the most profound and lasting impact, also is most cited and revered. The road from rags to moral riches is a passionate and convincing one, especially in the gifted hands of Denzel Washington, the only person worthy of an Oscar in 1993 for Best Actor. Starting of from a low-life cat with sticky fingers and a jail-bird through a period of religious fanaticism, until finally discovering his own voice is a spectacular journey through his career, one that could well last 2-3 more hours and still not bore. Flashes into childhood are overwhelmingly brilliant in building context, focus and vividly present the remarkable life of a true American hero.",8,3,8,9 October 2012
Underworld Awakening," Slashing the scheme
","After a bout of time-travel into the early days of Vampire-Lycan eternal war, we return to the slick black leather-clad present day of Selene (Kate Beckinsale), fanged Death Dealer, who happened to fall for half-vampire, half-werewolf Michael. Modernity, however, doesn't suit peace, as human kind discover the existence of both dark alley races, thus swiftly embarking on a genocidal judgement day. With Lycans all but extinct, the few remaining vampire covens retreat into darkness. Selene and Michael are among the few captured and tested upon in a private laboratory, where they spend most of twelve years. This ends when Selene is mysteriously unthawed from her cryosleep by an unknown force and soon escapes the laboratory, only to find herself in a brave new world...The idea is pretty easily defined: transform Selene into a Resident Evil-type franchise, where the luscious gut-whipping heroine defines the series, with the base premise a welcome, but secondary pretext for gore, action and prolonged adoration for the main protagonist. Kate Beckinsale fits the mold pretty well, dominating with her ruthless twirling blood-letting personality. However, where Resident Evil seems to keep the story flowing, slowly extrapolating zombie Armageddon, Underworld seems afraid to limit itself to the underground war between vampire covens and werewolf packs, instead constantly changing the back-story. After a well-rounded initial premise, confidently wielded by the slim shoulders of Beckinsale, scriptwriters decided first on a cross-European wild goose chase, than transporting us to the beginnings for whatever pointless (if satisfiable) purpose. Lost in a way to further the concept story gods Len Wiseman and co decide to do a total makeover, disposing of the set storyline and bringing in a post-genocidal world, where poor vampires and werewolves are victimised by the nasty humans (yes, the question WTH? comes immediately to mind).Barring how stupefying the storyline is, 'Underworld: Awakening' does surprisingly manage to work quite well. At least as long as you utterly discard you acting senses (some of the performance err on the wrong side of atrocious) and limit your attention to the all-out action, ignoring the dumbfounded dialogue and connect-the-dots that make absolutely no sense. Throw in some overgrown werewolves and Beckinsale pirouetting in drastically tight clothing, somehow makes the whole affair less inept than it should be with the final battle one of the highlights of action movies of the past few years. The bulky brute Lycan that is the ultimate foe make the whole story more epic and memorable, than the intrigue deserves... I guess there is nothing that is so idiotic that a voluptuous chick massacring blood-hungry foes can't fix...",5,1,2,2 July 2013
Pacific Rim," Bombastic spectacular spectacle
","'Pacific Rim' is hardly innovative. Actually quite the opposite it is an epic exercise in post-modernist Tarantinesque mash-ups, where Mexican director Guillermo del Toro takes Japanese kaiju inspirations and their love for big mechabots, molds it with some quasi-Lovecraft mythology to create a bombastic blockbuster feature with little other intent that to entertain. And del Toro clearly has absolutely no other higher pretence. Popcorn at its finest (at the same time setting a high bar for Gareth Edwards 'Godzilla').When a mysterious rupture appears somewhere on the Pacific rim, giant monsters start emerging from the ocean, creating havoc and destruction on coastline areas. Confronted with this deadly gargantuan opponent a new method of defence must be formed, thus initiating the Jaeger programme of giant human-controlled robots. Due to the mental burden of controlling a monstrous Jaeger two pilots are necessary, both having to share their minds through a neural bridge. After a temporary turning of the tide in favour of humanity, the kaiju threat increases and soon all but four towering Jaegers are left to defend our planet. Amongst the remaining pilot is previously retired ace Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) and an untrained cadet Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi). Led by the legendary pilot Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) they are all that stands between the inevitable apocalypse.Focusing on the spectacle, del Toro does his best to distract attention from human casualties, so instead of single humans being treaded upon we see a visual treat of epic proportions. Forced on by cardboard cutouts the story can never be held as anything other than generic fodder, even if the masterful presence of Idris Elba spurting out gibberish, as if he was delivering Shakespearesque brilliance, does its best to hide the thinly plotted story. That said del Toro has enough sensibility and rationality to deliver a story without gaping plot holes and illogical contrivances, thus making it a thankful respite from cascades of movies spurting out nonsense with almost religious zeal.Within this behemoth of a movie lurk the age-old trusted interior mechanisms of blockbuster action movies, introduced however with a certain finesse of which directors like Michael Bay are incapable of. Pure enjoyment is what is on offer - expect anything else and you will be sorely disappointed. Lay back mind-meld to the blockbuster of the season.",8,5,8,11 October 2013
21 Jump Street," Somewhat of a spoof
","Somewhat of a half-hearted fan of the original TV series, '21 Jump Street' was a mildly entertaining pop-cultural entry to the 2012 film season. Changing in both character and tone the feature is a comedic outtake from the series, borrowing the basic ideas, but essentially formed around a goofy buddy cop flick. When two cop rejects Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) make a mess of an arrest by forgetting the wording of the Miranda rights. As a last chance the duo are reassigned to a revived speciality division on 21 Jump Street, which sends undercover units to infiltrate high schools. When the first mission sends both back to their high school, they aim to seamlessly integrate by recapturing their former school standings: Jenko as the popular jock type and Schmidt as the school geek. A screw-up in school papers has their roles reversed...Mostly a spoof with little sensibility '21 Jump Street' is rarely fun, mostly feeling like a semi-redundant Van Wilder rethink. Nothing of the original franchise is truly kept, apart from a brief and ultimately unfunny cameo by DEA Agents Tom Hanson (Johnny Depp) and Doug Penhall (Peter DeLuise). Due to this any attempt to compare it to its series namesake is pretty pointless, instead leaving the necessity to vote on the movie on its own merits. As such the plot feels extremely lacking invention with slap-sticky mistaken identity comedy supplanting procedural drama. Mildly funny, mostly juvenile, as a comedy the concept fails to redeem itself in the slightest, thus making it a forgettable viewing comparable to a multitude of teenage-aimed comedies littering the market. Albeit the attempt at self-mockery wasn't necessarily a bad idea, the overall effort was not inventive enough, and although several jokes do catch you unalert with their subversiveness, it fails to reach any heights of note.For me the main issue has to do with the main gripe with many modern comedy movies. They seem to gimmicky and ultimately contrived to bring about real laughs, as if trying to hard to hit home with a laugh (jokes almost punctuated as if to highlight where you are supposed to laugh). People like Seth Rogen or Diablo Cody manage to somehow avoid these pitfalls, but writer-actor Jonah Hill hits them head on.",4,2,4,29 December 2012
The Bourne Ultimatum," A admirable if vastly imperfect finale
","After what transpires in 'The Bourne Supremacy' Jason Bourne is a wanted man by the C.I.A., even more so that a British journalist for 'The Guardian' is starting to dig into his history and also seems to have gained access to highly confidential data concerning the Blackfriar operation, the second phase of Treadstone, which created our title hero. Jason Bourne soon traverses to London to contact the journalist, where he is forced to do his best to save the unsuspecting man's life...A much better outing than 'The Bourne Supremacy' the final act at least succeeds where the second part failed: the action. The long Tangers fight sequence or the Waterloo train station escape, where Bourne tries to lead the journalist out of danger, are extremely well done and very well worth the watch, as suspenseful and intriguingly executed scenes.Nonetheless the last part suffers from the same weaknesses as its predecessor - the script is nowhere as tight as would be required for this movie to be called a success. In the most part it is nowhere as poorly scripted as 'The Bounce Supremacy', but several scenes stick out like a sore thumb. For example when Bourne breaks into the C.I.A. to steal Blackfriar documents only to inform the department director that he is now in his office, even though this had no sense and meant Bourne lost valuable minutes to escape. Suicidal on Bourne's part? An attack of cockiness? Or just the scriptwriter thinking that this would be a cool idea? I'm quite certain it is the latter. I'm not sure if the end effect is cool, but it certainly shows Bourne as being irresponsible and prone to stupidity. Which totally misses the gist of the character...Also some of the direction is off and several subplots are never properly dealt with. I am unaware whether this happened in the editing room or whether this is just an inherent flaw of the script. Nonetheless there are several pieces of the puzzle which are left hanging in a very hack-job fashion. For instance suggestions of a deeper relationship between Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles, the only character apart from Bourne to be in all three parts) and our hero are never expanded on. Or we have countless suggestions that Bourne was recruited partly against his will to the Treadstone project, but in the end it turns out he did everything of his own free will. But than why did he have contradictory flashbacks? Or what's with the notes in the Treadstone report, which also seem to negate this option?All in all I very much applaud the action in the final outing, but really the more you think about the movie the more imperfect and flawed it becomes. In the end it is a shame that only the first part managed to keep a relatively coherent and sensible script...",6,2,3,2 January 2011
Burn After Reading," Comedy almost at its best
","Outdoes your average movie and definitely Coen brothers best comedy since The Big Lebowski. Generally a great comedy that breaks a few clichés and will surprise outside the box. I loved most o the actors with Frances McDormand and George Clooney being exceptionally exceptional.Brad Pitt has a been there, done that feel to him, but well... he is likable. John Malkovich is the man you love to hate and I love that about the guy.Could probably with all honesty give the film a higher mark, but in the end I wasn't all that inspired with the movie, as the Coens have made better comedies and films in general. Also I think they overdid it a bit with all the swearing and the movie could have toned that down a notch. The end sequences with the 'cl&sterf^ck' would have been much more intense and memorable.Definitely a suggested watch for anyone that's fed up with comedies that seem to be cardboard copies of each other and that are fully expendable. If you don't want comedies to treat you like a complete idiot than this is a movie for you.",7,1,4,22 March 2009
The Bourne Identity," Rebourne!
","A floating body is found at sea off the coast of France with two bullets stuck in his back. By freak chance it turns out that this is not a corpse, but a severely wounded man, who can not seem to remember anything from his past. Armed with only a Swiss bank account the delinquent goes out to reclaim his identity - that of the highly skilled assassin Jason Bourne! It was this welcome return of Ludlum's Jason Bourne that had most to do with a resurgence of spy movies, but it also served as a guidebook for future (and much superior movies) in the genre such as 'The International' or 'Casino Royale'. With the unlikely hero carrying the face of Matt Damon it was a break out hit, which I decided to recollect in full during the festive season.As such 'The Bourne Identity' is a relatively crisp and refreshing action movie, which hardly ever gets a tune wrong. The thriller ride is gripping and to the most part attempts to be as realistic as possible in the slightly over-the-top secret agent world he inhabits. Despite most fights or chase sequences being extremely flashy, spectacular and even innovative (at least eight years ago) most of them seem to be as solidly stuck in real physics and physiology as possible - with a couple of relatively irrelevant exceptions. Also the scripting was extremely tight for a spy movie and hardly misses a beat with suggesting possible scenarios for our hero.One or two action sequences stand out in the movie, even if not necessarily the ones with are the most spectacular. Nothing as memorable as the shoot-out in 'The International', but the relatively straight-forward showdown between Jason Bourne and Clive Owen's character The Professor is especially noteworthy.On the minus side the stereotypical African overlord is a real downer and the movie really gets a slight overdose of stereotyping, which take away from the general pleasure of watching the movie.Nonetheless by far the best of the Bourne Trilogy and despite the jumps in standards it has aged very well.",7,0,1,2 January 2011
The Color of Money," Return of the hustler
","25 years after throwing in the cue Fast Eddie Nelson (invariably played by Paul Newman) he now owns a pool hall and spends his time with some minor hustling. Until he comes across a guileless, but prodigally talented youngster with incessant bad hair days called Vincent Lauria (Tom Cruise), who with ease and mirth dispatches the best pool player in his establishment. Enticed by the hapless youth Eddie soon ventures to take him and his girlfriend-manager Carmen (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) on the road to throw them into the world of pool hustling and then to finally bring them to the Atlantic City to compete on the big stage...Paul Newman easily dominates proceedings with his restrained gentlemen charm residing somewhere on the verge of skewed morality - a place of pool cons made hard-earned money and just reward (fuly deserved Oscar winning role). Opposing him Cruise delivers a rather bland outing, in part due to attention subconsciously shifted north of his forehead to his 'dead beaver' hair-do. Thankfully however Cruise's character is essentially a counterpoint to Eddie - initially an uncouth naive jester under tutelage evolves into a self-conscience and money-orientated player, much in the mold of the hustler himself. Roles however change when Eddie rediscovers the joys of simply playing pool undercut by being hustled himself by a random Joe. As Vincent immerses further into the life, Eddie rediscover the pure joy of playing and enters the Atlantic City competition, thus basically completing a full circle (Vincent now the king of the world Eddie once was, whilst Eddie mature has now grown to appreciate the little things).The story itself tries to indulge the viewer, but watching balls being struck rarely builds enthusiasm, whilst the moral ambiguity of proceedings shadows the film in both greyness as well as dullness. Though Eddie especially is vividly evoked, 'The Colour of Money' drags along with an unflinching incapability to make thunderbolting racks into a thrilling watching experience, instead drenched in smoke, lethargy and morose build-up (not helped by dim grainy cinematography). As stated in the movie the 9-shot is essentially nonstrategic, based on luck, noisy, quick and essentially crass, making the whole experience feel like nonsubstantial style.Coupled with bumbling chemistry between the two leads and some drunkenly built dramaturgy pieces fail to emotionally fall into place (in some part owed to the self-evident premise, which makes proceedings overly predictable. Despite Newman's best efforts overall the limping dramatic side and marginally interesting subject matter cause Scorsese to fail to lift off the ground.",5,5,9,13 October 2012
Salt," Sugar and salt, but missed some pepper
","CIA operative Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) hopes to retreat from active field duty to a more laid back office position after spending time in North Korean prison, only to be saved by German scientist Michael Krause (August Diehl). However when former Russian spy Vasily Orlov (Daniel Olbrychski) turns himself in to uncover a conspiracy spanning several decades - special underground units are raised from youth to infiltrate American soil from deep within and soon they will be called upon to assassinate the Russian president. When Vasily names Salt as one of these supposed agents she is soon on the run, followed closely by CIA agent Ted Winter (Liev Schreiber) and home security operative Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor).With this action packed spy thriller Phillip Noyce attempts to create a female counterpart for Matt Damon's brilliant Jason Bourne. Evading capture via simple ingenuity, touch-on creativity as well as the occasional fighting dominance, Salt wriggles out of seemingly hopeless situations. Done with a spark for action, the script by Kurt Wimmer ('Equilibrium', 'Total Recall') doesn't afford as much believability, instead being culpable of what could be deemed deus ex machina. The dosage of suspension of belief far outdoes any of the Bourne trilogy, fronted by what unravels to be an unassailable plot spurned into action by a pretty rag-tag master-plan. Angelina Jolie does manage to instill some level of coherence to her spy persona, making Salt a pretty credible character with due promise for further sequels. Noyce as well manages to follow through with resolve, especially during a tension filled first half of the movie, where Salt's identity is yet to be truly revealed. Overall however 'Salt' is watchable and enjoyable, but lacks the charm and character consistency to make it as memorable as the Bourne trilogy.",6,3,5,6 January 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," The most expensive English dubbing ever!
","When Michael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) editor of the Millennium investigative journal becomes successfully sued for libel after reporting a story delivered by unchecked sources, his career and beloved paper seem to be in free-fall. Thus when offered lucrative employ by billionaire and family patriarch Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) to solve a decades old mystery about the disappearance of his niece, he decides to take up the opportunity. As the clues start appearing the mystery starts to get bogged down and soon Michael decides to seek assistance with a reclusive computer hacker Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), a rebellious youth, who has become a ward of the state due to her destructive behaviour.Based on the book by crime novelist Stieg Larsson, 'The Girl with a Dragon Tattoo' is a second movie take on the story, after its Swedish predecessor, directed by Niels Arden Oplev was released just two years prior. Hence the issues stemming for inevitable comparisons, reinforced by both movies strongly following the source material. Mostly a scene for scene replica, but with differing directorial sensibilities, Fincher delivers a more cold and murky atmospheric version, with superior framing but one which failed to entice with its protagonists as strongly as Oplev's version. Whereas Rooney Mara does perfectly fine as Lisbeth Salander, somewhat more reclusive, detached and condescending, she lacks the same animalistic bite that Noomi Rapace provided, in my opinion evidently losing the battle to claim the character as her own. Daniel Craig imbues an increased sense of presence to Michael Blomkvist, although the absurdity of having the movie set in Sweden played by English speaking characters is never more evident, when the current James Bond attempts to add a weird twang to his accent to miraculously 'change' into a Swede.Admitedly a huge David Fincher fan, 'The Girl with a Dragon Tattoo' seems like an immense waste of time and money for viewers of the Swedish version. Even more so, that the American version actually feels inferior with character exposure dealt with less sensitivity and finesse, making it feel more forced and lacking the same flow. While focusing on creating a shadowy backdrop Fincher also fails to create a sense of familiarity with the key Vanger family and their decade-old mysteries, affording much less attention to Henrik, Martin or Cecilia. Oplev may have lacked the same opulence in shots, but manages to add more meat to the mystery, in part because he creates a sense that the island on which the Vanger's live is in itself one of the key characters to the story. In general Fincher seemed partly disinterested with conveying the story and character interaction, introducing small changes which actually hurt the gist of the Blomkvist-Salander relationship and failing to offer anything, which I wouldn't prefer to watch in the Swedish version. That said all three Stieg Larsson 'Millenium' novels were filmed in Sweden, while only the first was artistically successful, the other two poor conceived follow-ups which afford Fincher vast space for delivering his improved version.",5,3,6,10 February 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Comic enjoyment intertwines with top notch acting and excellent human drama
","In the convoluted time-travelling plot of X-Men: Days of Future Past, Fox molds two X-Men franchises into one, by colliding the future mutants, now living in the post-Sentinel cleansing wastelands of Earth with the past versions of themselves from Nixon-era 1970s. With mutant genocide bringing about the collapse of civilisation, the remnants of the mutants, including core X-Men members: Professor X (Patrick Stewart), Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Storm (Halle Berry), Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page), Iceman (Shawn Ashmore), Bishop (Omar Sy), Blink (Bingbing Fan), Colossus (Daniel Cudmore), Warpath (Booboo Stewart) and the once infamous Magneto (Ian McKellen) attempt one last daring ploy to avert the imminent disaster. This means Wolverine must be sent into the past with the use of Kitty Pryde's powers to stop the murder of Sentinel mastermind Dr Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage) by mutant rights activist turned rogue Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence). The future's hope lays in averting the past - thus Wolverine must force the downtrodden and resigned drunkard Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and the imprisoned Eric Lensherr (Michael Fassbender) to stop the occurrences of days to come from ever coming into being. Only Beast (Nicholas Hoult) and a fickle youth Quicksilver (Evan Peters) are willing to aide the best at what he does...Amongst the many faucets of success of Bryan Singer in he reclaiming of the franchise, one seems to be strongly undervalued by most viewers. Despite an onslaught of characters the X-Men are rejuvenated thanks to one simple truth: not all character need to be character studies and albeit each of the cast receives their moment in the limelight, the X-Men resonate all so much more strongly that the super-powered mutants need no introduction. To a varying extent introduced in previous episodes of the series, most of the characters function as direct imprints from the comics, cartoon series or previous movies with the entire mythology appropriated to them. They need not be presented, delved in, they just function as part of a well-oiled team of superheroes. Much like in the comics the movie finally understands that focus can only be placed on a select number of characters, the rest operate within action sequences to wow the audience into submission, while the drama evolves around just a few in their midst.Thankfully also focus shifts away from Wolverine, the franchises most important and recognisable character, towards the trio of Professor X, Eric Lensherr and Mystique. Wolverine still features heavily in the plot, but is mostly a backup cast member with limited impact on proceedings, but with charm and character attributes helping to liven up the story throughout. Nonetheless McAvoy, Fassbender and Lawrence shine with a well-thought out plot centred around the morality of Mystique and the dark path she has chosen to follow. Support cast is unanimously superb within their characters, even if they receive but a few minutes of screen time they each memorably capture their moments: Storm is godlike and enchanting, Colossus is almighty, Blink has a lingering presence, Iceman is all-powerful, while Magneto of the past and future display their otherworldly power. Quicksilver naturally steals the show, but Singer has improved in leaps and bounds in his presentation of fight sequences. Only Bishop cries out for more screen time and focus, which hopefully he will receive come X-Men: Apocalypse.Also thoroughly enjoyed the teamwork, so key to the comic book, that is on show throughout all the future sequences of battles with Sentinels.It says a lot that the two mayor flaws of the movie are its short runtime of 130 minutes (it honestly feels like the movie could easily go on for another 60 or so minutes and never lose traction on the audience) and the fact that we have to wait for the next episode of the series for another 2 years (how I wish this was a mega-budget several episode series...). Minor faults of the feature are some laboured story, which at times struggles to piece together the plot holes of past episodes, and the somewhat funny, but ultimately jarring, jokes centred around Magneto's supposed involvement in the assassination of J.F.Kennedy.By far the best comic-book movie of the year and arguably only inferior to 'The Dark Knight'. The mouthwatering prospect of X-Men: Apocalypse is just too far away to bear...",9,7,13,2 June 2014
Flashdance," Influential beyond quality
","An 18-year old female welder (what the...?) Alex Owens (Jennifer Beals), who doubles up as a flashdancer at a night club, reluctantly falls in love with her employer, the always well-groomed jaunty Nick Hurley (Michael Nouri). Self-taught she dreams of entering a ballet school, something seemingly impossible given lack of any recognised dance schooling. In true fairy tale fashion we glide through specious drama involving an elder ballerina, a piteous stand-up comedian slash cook, a waitress turned stripper and the inevitably beguiling rags-to-riches princess meets her prince.Whishing through a tirade of dance sequences (including two ice-skating routine) about 30% of the movie consists of musical numbers, whilst the remaining runtime is rudimentary adhesive pretending to tell a story, with the dramatic excuse burdening the lead actress Beals, who has endless enamour and childishly vampiric sex appeal. The dances themselves are undeniably the highlight, most dimly-lit and featuring fast-editing montage, aimed predominantly at hiding the fact, that all sequences were performed by doubles. Inadvertently this gives 'Flashdance' a surprising allurement, which came to be deeply influential to future cinema and video-clips, making the movie carry much more weight in filmmaking history then the banality of its story would even deem possible.",3,1,3,29 September 2012
Dirty Dancing," Whirling Sex
","The ultimate dance flick is still a timeless gem from the 1980s. It may lack polish or even sensibility, but the charm is unrelenting. Fronted by the heavenly pairing of Jennifer Grey as the timid town girl Frances 'Baby' Houseman with a need to exhale and the unforgettable Patrick Swayze as booty shaking dance instructor Johnny Castle. Sets in 1953, it centres around a simple case of mésalliance, when up-town teenager on holiday in Catskills resort falls for the crass, but empathic dancer. Aptly named Baby she is the apple of her father's eye, perfect and untainted. But growing up brings about urges and changes - idyllic family relationships are bound to either adapt or fall apart.'Dirty Dancing' delivers a deeply felt promise of naive youthful romance with unbelievable chemistry between the two main protagonists. The story may be simple (albeit brings in a pretty touchy issue of abortion), but filled with magic which inexplicably refuses to die away with age or repeated watching. Even now, as an adult I seem still somewhat embarrassingly enticed by the simplistic allure, albeit notice the inherent flaws, stereotypical characters or shortcomings of the entire story. What is probably still the most successful in this movie is its terrific score with what could possibly be the best pop musical score in movie history.Probably the highlight of Patrick Swayze's career (although 'Ghost' probably would give it some competition), 'Dirty Dancing' turned out to be just 15 minutes of fame for Jennifer Grey, who self-mutilated her career by plastic surgery, which dispossessed her of a peculiarly enticing Roman nose, replacing it with something more generic and changing her beyond recognition.",7,2,4,11 January 2013
Quantum of Solace," Paul Anderson on steroids... but I like
","Not all is right with this new Bond film. It has some very severe flaws and some great pluses. Fortunately the latter outdo the former. So maybe I'll list them as pros and cons:PROS: This Bond has the right feel to him. Very much inspired by the Casino Royale restart Craig David is the best Bond since the early days of the unforgettable Sean Connery. He feels right and acts accordingly. Part gentlemen, part ruthless killer, part idealist, part cynic... Big applause for Craig. The scripts are much better than most Bond movies, including the early ones, which one must admit were a bit fairy-tale'ish with over the top conspiracies. This time the script got it right with a believable villain and intriguing organisation, that can pull the Bond franchise into a new era (I'm actually interested in seeing the downfall of Quantum). The intriguing storyline is definitely part of the reason that Bond has once again become fashionable.I also liked that the story doesn't insult our intelligence. Not everything is said straight up and force-fed to you like to a little baby. You have to connect the threads and use your imagination at times. There are a lot of unanswered questions, but this makes it so much more believable. Its not like in real life everything is like in most Hollywood movies with villains meticulously setting out their motives and their goals...Worth mentioning is the great villain played by the 'despicable' Mathieu Amalric (I just loved hating his character). Best film villain I've seen for years (with the exception of the Joker).Other pros are the great supporting cast, capable storytelling and some interesting ideas. Also losing the Bond gadgets really hits the spot. Worth mentioning is the memorable Bond song opening credits which almost put us back in time and was strongly influenced by the first Bond movies - not only the music but also the background graphics. Great.CONS: The action... The action sequences are just terrible. It almost feels as if Paul Anderson is back after his 'Alien vs Predator' debacle and on steroids. The car scene as well as i.e. the first chase sequence is terribly shot and editing is even worse (red cards for Matt Chesse and Richard Pearson - be ashamed... be very ashamed). I guess some people think that shaky camera-work and quick shots cause an adrenaline rush. Me and my girl almost fell to sleep. After the first chase scene I starting thinking of leaving the cinema. I stuck in the seat only because the sequence was followed by the great opening credits scene. Then unfortunately straight away we get another snooze attack chase. If you live past this the film gets better, so hold on and wait.Thankfully action sequences were quite often, but most were short and some were even very innovative and memorable (i.e. Bond attacking the black guy on the bike).Also there were a couple of over the top scenes, that forced us to suspend belief and almost provoked laughter. The worst was the whole airplane sequence with the most stupid parachute jump in living cinema memory. No wait... An even more idiotic sequence was filmed during the tenure of the poor Pierce Brosnan.The action is a big step back in comparison with Casino Royale. TERRIBLE! ABSOLUTELY DISASTROUS!Thankfully there is a lot more than action in the new Bond movie, hence a well deserved 7/10.",7,1,3,4 December 2008
Twilight," Entertainingly underwhelming
","Teen romance with a touch of vampirism definitely has potential and at times in this movie it actually worked nicely. Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) is a self-indulgent self-flagellating closed teenager, who moves to her father Charlie Swan (Billy Burke) mid-term, while her mother indulges into her second youth with her second husband. Bella might be dull, negative and basically no fun whatsoever, but school kids for some totally unknown reason flock to her.Bella, the epicentre of teen-boy fantasies for reasons incomprehensible to the ordinary viewer, falls for the school weirdo and outsider Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). Who of course is a 'veggie' vampire. Romance with corny scenes to boot commence with a not too suspenseful finale, where Edward tries to save Bella from one of his own.I must admit the chemistry between Bella and Edward seems to work and for the most part the movie does entertain and actually does a good job at building up the love relationship with one quite enticing kissing scene, even though we have some really over-the-top corny scenes like hair being blown by the wind or the two teen lovers lying in a field looking at each other.The place where the movie really loses it is in the final third, when man-sucking vampires appear. It is a welcome addition to keep the story flowing, but it is handled so awkwardly and felt so rushed, that by the end credits I was vastly underwhelmed.",6,0,3,9 June 2009
Wreck-It Ralph," Fun at the arcade
","With some unabashed nostalgic throwback into the glory days of arcades, writer-director brings Rich Moore brings one of the most charming, if somewhat generic, animated movies in a while. The movie focuses on video game villain Wreck-It-Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly) - referencing the Donkey Kong barrel throwing gorilla - is tired of being the odd man out in his world, constantly thrown off the top of the building by the hero Fix It Felix (Jack McBrayer) and the apartment house inhabitants. Forced into solitude, living in a dump on the outskirts of the video-game, Ralph hopes for a change in fortunes, aspiring to become a liked and cherished character. In search of glory he decides to jump game into a first player shooter 'Hero's Duty'. A sequence of events however has him crash land in the kart racing world of 'Sugar Rush', where he meets Vannellope (Sarah Silverman), an apparent glitch computer character, whose sarcastic wisecracks seem at odds with the sugar-coated wonderland in which she lives. Here Ralph finds a close affinity to the outcast girl and attempts his best to aide her in winning the go-kart race. Here however they must first overcome the flamboyant mad-hatter King Candy (Alan Tudyk), the kooky leader of this game world. Meanwhile the goodie-two-shoes Felix ventures out of his game in order to bring back their sole villain, soon finding aide in 'Hero's Duty' commander Calhoun (Jane Lynch).Albeit not a classic, 'Wreck-It-Ralph' has enough wit, humour and magic to make it a fun re-watchable dash into the past of arcade games glory days, together with guest appearances by Pac-Man, Sonic the Hedgehog, Q*Bert or Dowser. The overall concept of computer characters lounging out of their computer game worlds after the arcade closes, much like toys coming to life when the child is outside of its room, brings about some novel ideas, like a support group for villains struggling to accept their endless role as a baddie. Possibly the most intriguing is the use of animation, where each game has its own specificity with rigid, jumpy animation in the outdated Fix-It-Felix to the ultra-realistic realm of the 'Call of Duty' rip-off. Most of the movie takes place in the ultra-colourful candy-land realm of the go-kart racing, gloriously over-the-top, ultra-sweetened, but with characters contradicting the external niceness of the game (instead full of vindictive, insensitive racers and its conniving king).Through this internally contradictory exposition come most of the enjoyment the movie has to offer, even though the general plot heads into strikingly predictable territories once the initial premise becomes clear. Therefore, 'Wreck It Ralph' becomes a bit of a hostage to the clichés it incorporates (story-wise as well as character-wise, as referencing is the name of this game), placing its strengths strongly on the shoulders of the dedicated worlds, computer game homages and several well drafted subversive characters (with Vannellope the stand-out). The satire brought about by endless clichés and references does wear thin making the inside jokes tiresome and entirely predictable at length, but thankfully that is not the only thing going for the movie and the nostalgic qualities will definitely hit home with most seasoned gamers.Of note, there are several moments of on-screen brutality, which may make parents uncomfortably squirm, while corner-checking out the reaction of their kids, as well as a few cumbersome inadequate jokes not suited for the target audience.",6,0,2,22 June 2013
Bridesmaids," Good thing cops like pastry
","Annie's (Kristen Wiig) life spirals into chaos through a cascade of events spurred by the announcement that her best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph) is to get married and she is to be her maid of honour. After failed business investments and a love-life in self-inflicted permanent hell (punctuated by masochistic nights spent with her egocentric prick sex buddy) she seems to have already hit bottom. Only to be proved entirely wrong, when Lillian's work associate, the sumptuous Whitney (Jessica St. Clair), collides head on with Annie in trying to fulfil the bridesmaids honours. The remainder of Lillian's ragtag team of the Brides little helpers is made up of foul-mouthing mom of three rascals Rita (Wendi McLendon-Covey), goodie-two-shoes Becca (Ellie Kemper) and tomboy Megan (Melissa Mccarthy), the movies very successful response to Alan from 'Hangover'. The entourage is however secondary, as the movie really and truly focuses on Annie and her debacles with only limited time offered to the supporting cast.As chaos reigns laughter ensues. Sometimes in droves, but more often with a little smirk of enjoyment. The movie in the end does turn out to be a bundle of fun, but it does have a very weird mix of conversation based humour, subtle absurdities and situational comedy with immature fart and anal jokes coupled with people thinking that swearing equals being funny (both these points punctuated by the appearance of Matt Lucas of Little England ignominy). In the end not everything works in this slightly chaotic comedy unsure of which direction to best take. Add to that some some of the key jokes in the movie just dragged on beyond their expiry date replacing a good laugh with an internal suggestion for the editor to recut the movie. But after an uneven start our girls in pink really get going and break inhibitions to force out a tirade of laughter. The dramatic side of the story is also very well written, so you feel strongly drawn to sympathise with Annie, whilst simultaneously screaming at the screen for her being such an emotional moron. However irritating she is as a person, you somehow end up gunning for her and happy she found a pastry munching Irish cop to get romantically involver with.. The ending left me slightly disappointed. Rushed and lacking the warmth of the build-up it really would have done better with some more minutes to prepare for the big resolution.Definitely up there with recent comedies such as 'Role Models' or 'Hangover', but for brief issues with pacing and bad jokes. The movie also feels way too engineered and sincere for its own good. Being the response to 'Hangover' doesn't help it one bit in this regard.",7,0,2,7 October 2011
Non-Stop," Disappointing
","The last true action hero, the towering elderly Liam Neeson returns to his recently found career path of on-screen macho in this hi-flying adrenaline rush. Neeson plays Bill Marks, an alcoholic ex-cop with family issues (doesn't he always?), who now works as one of the thousands of air marshals, hired in the aftermath of post-9/11 frenzy. Often unverified and with little to no background checks, various non- suitable personnel is let on-board aeroplanes (at least such is the premise of the movie) with an armed gun. Soon after start off Marks starts receiving enigmatic text messages claiming that sooner than later people will start dying on the aeroplane, unless funds are transferred to a given account. As Marks attempts to hunt down the perpetrator the body count starts to increase and soon doubts arise as to who the real culprit is...Initially promising, especially given Neeson makes for the ideal off- beat antihero, the story shifts into a whodunit scenario, with paranoia rife as to the people responsible. As such the movie however lacks originality and seems like a laboured rip-off of 'The Flight Plan', which at least managed to keep tension high and had the audience guessing as to the insanity of the main character. Here the tension is much less palpable, albeit the payoff is way less ridiculous, although still with a significant dosage of ludicrousness. Action sequences are nonetheless top-notch and watching Neeson (once again) combat in closed quarters never gets old. Looking past that the story never really seems mysterious, the identity of the culprits is never really feasible and its pretty easy to identify non-guilty parties, even if at one point in time the finger gets pointed at them. By the end the movie swerves into the realm of laughable resolution, not only with the appalling motivation of the baddies (so bad the actors had trouble with even phoning it in). On top of that we find layered mad-hatter plotting of the evil dudes and all sort of air flight procedures being thrown about in gibberish rants, but the characters seem all to happy to omit the real options at their disposal (such as armed fighters not allowing a plane to lower altitude despite the real threat of a bomb on board).As good as Liam Neeson is, the story does syphon your intellect, leaving me ultimately disinterested. Obviously not as far fetched in idiocy as 'The Flight Plan' or the cult favorite 'Snakes on a Plane', but just enough on the wrong side of logic to derail an otherwise well paced high-altitude thriller.",5,0,2,12 June 2014
Behind The Candelabra," Kitsch extraordinaire plonks onto the small screen
","This years Cannes Film Festival main competition nominee is somewhat of a rarity, as the Steven Soderbergh biopic was an HBO sponsored television movie. To some extent this shows a growing trend for top directors to opt out of the Hollywood model and experiment with TV, often with great results.Based on the autobiographical book by Scott Thorson (portrayed in the movie by Matt Damon), the movie treads crystal, glitter and champagne-deep into the wild and wonderful world of kitsch extraordinaire Liberace (gleefully played out by Michael Douglas). Presented from the perspective of Liberace's most recognisable lover, Soderbergh delves into the extravagantly absurdly luscious lifestyle of Liberace together with his crazed mindset and restrictive destructive influence. Despite serving somewhat as to ridicule the famed artiste, Soderbergh does also present the more fragile, unfulfilled side of the spectacularly wealthy Las Vegas piano player, who attempted to live his life as if it was one of his on-stage spectacles. Thorson himself becomes intoxicated with the lifestyle, slowly supplanting his self-worth for a drug-like dependency on Liberace to the extent that he agrees for a plastic surgery, that would make the pair look related.'Behind the Candelabra' was aptly heralded for the flawless portrayal of the flamboyant Liberace in what could well be Michael Douglas's best role and undoubtedly his most adventurous, posting him way outside his comfort zone. Coupled with a deliciously androgen Matt Damon and some superb bit part roles (especially by Rob Lowe as the otherworldly Dr. Jack Startz), Soderbergh excels in one department: character creation. Nonetheless once the characters waver on their initial freshness, even the sublime acting on hand fails to gloss over the lagging storytelling, which lacks both in emotion as well as in laughter, making it neither dramatic nor comedic, instead an amalgamate of unfulfilled potential. Much to my chagrin this TV docudrama (unfortunately it always possesses the characteristic TV feel to it) on the delightful life and times of Liberace and his consorts, dangles a big fish in front of the audience, but soon tasks patience falling into a monotone rhythm, which directs us towards the inevitable conclusion.The mundanity of everyday life does serve to push the point, that despite all the effort Liberace places on lavish and opulent surroundings, human life tends to fold back into the ordinary, where in turn the joys of life truly lie. Here however the focus on the exterior causes the inside to ring hollow, as Thorsten receives no true fulfilment in his decision to live with Liberace, his de facto sugar daddy, while Liberace gets so lost in the self-creation myth, that he fails to attach true meaning to those closest to him.'Behind the Candelabra' does shine at times, much like the artist in question, but the overwhelming banality that drags the plot and lingers throughout the movie, coupled with the luscious extravagant performances, just might not fit the bill for many viewers, even if the initial delight of seeing Douglas's restrained mimicry and grins makes it a movie truly worth at least the effort of watching.",5,0,3,11 September 2013
Mr. Nobody," Repeated watching
","Nemo Nobody is the last mortal in a world of immortals. At the age of 118 he is on his deathbed and his memory has faded. Nonetheless journalists and academics are interested in his story. But this story is muddled mess of reality, wrong choices, corrected choices, tragedy and dreams. With three loves which one of them did he marry? When their parents divorced did he stay with his father or leave with his mother? Did he die in a car crash? But if yes than how is he still alive? Maybe he is in a coma and everything is but an illusion? Did I give away too much? Not really, since the reality of what really transpired is muddled, confusing and necessitates repetitive rewatches. Even the above storyline does not seem to fit what really transpiring in this thought invoking philosophical movie.'Mr Nobody' is a cinematographic feat that overtakes any other sci-fi/fantasy outing that 2010 had to offer. In many ways the dreamlike story of Jaco van Dormael is very similar to the breakthrough 'Inception', but unlike the more renowned blockbuster it succeeded in every department Nolan failed, while kept up the bar with his American counterpart. This is the absolute cinematographic triumph of film that so many people believe 'Inception' was, but just can not help but feel Nolan's movie was inferior on so many levels. In the two that matter the most: 1. 'Mr. Nobody' conveys a multi-layered complex message about human existence, something that 'Inception' in reality doesn't even attempt. 2. 'Mr. Nobody' has a depth of human emotion that was nonexistent in Nolan's work.At the same time 'Mr. Nobody' conveys it's complex story in a way that is enjoyable to watch and surprisingly understandable. As with life it changes from laughter to tragedy from the ordinary to the extraordinary. And everything exposed with such clarity, that confusion is non-existent about the proceedings. That is until the film unfolds in the final act and you are left bewildered as to what actually happened. I must however stress, that this is not a fault, as the complexity, unpredictability and faith in human intelligence that the ending conveyed where a highlight of the movie, as before that I was expecting to be severely disappointed by the straightforward ending, that seemed to be suggested. Nonetheless I fully understanding if the final 5 minutes turn out to be severely disappointing to most and also make the movie not suitable for the wider audience.The only fault I could find in this movie, which flirts successfully with greatness, concerns the overly romantic, almost childlike love stories concerning Mr. Nobody's life. That said if you accept the most likely version of events (in my opinion) it actually makes a lot of sense...Any movie auteur will also probably appreciate the clear hommages made in this movie and will recognize scenes from 'Harold and Maude', 'Space Odyssey 2001' or 'The Double Life of Veronica', just to name a few.A real treat that rekindles my love for cinema and instills admiration for Jaco Van Dormael. Quite possibly the best and most intellectual movie I have seen in 2010 (and I have seen over 500).",9,5,9,31 December 2010
Django Unchained," A mediocre plate of spaghetti
","Deep in the South, several years prior to the Civil War, one professedly fought for the abolition of slavery, life as a black man is never easy. Thankfully for Django (Jamie Foxx), a suave German bounty hunter named Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) with an innate hatred towards slavery, requires his assistance to track down three outlaws 'dead or alive', thus liberating him from the hands of traders. Django soon discovers an close affinity towards the bloody craft of killing (as well as an indisputable knack for it), especially since he is being paid for whacking off white people. Schultz and Django inadvertently join forces, soon heaping a small fortune in dead bodies. Nonetheless Django's heart and mind is still focused on rescuing his beloved Brunhilda (Kerry Washington) from her employ at Candyland, run by the ruthless Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), who has a fascination and interest in Mandingo fighting.Another movie, another genre for Tarantino to pillage for inspiration and homaging. Functioning now as Hollywood's class clown, who admittedly has wide film knowledge, but whose interest is focused mainly on playing the funny-bone (and satisfying its blood craze in cartoonish violence) of his like-minded audience. 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction' were great pictures in their own right, but somehow it felt like there is something more to the artist than just constant in-jokes and barrages of references. However ever since Tarantino has jumped from genre to genre, crossing off blaxploitation, Asian vengeance flicks, horrors and war movies from his 'to do' list. Now adding spaghetti westerns (with a solid helping of Frew Williamson inspired blaxploitation with a touch of Shaft references). Once truly awaiting for each new Tarantino movie, I must confess that my patience has seemingly wearied out, no longer intaking Tarantinesque prolonged banter and games at referencing. The class clown act seemingly works well for some time, but once you stay in this guise for too long without ever reinventing your jokes, just changing their context, the stop seeming as intellectually substantial.'Django Unchained' still is a throughly entertaining movie in its own right with the long runtime thankfully bearable without any exacerbation. This is owed mainly to three wickedly spectacular performances by Leonardo di Caprio, Samuel L. Jackson and the crowd favourite Christpher Walttz (plus a host of cameos which will be like candy for film buffs). However various aspects in the narrative are faulty, such as the somewhat needless drawing out of the story midway, the thinly justified plot surrounding the need to purchase a Mandingo fighter for an obscene amount of money in order to retrieve Brunhilda or the dimwitted 'opportunity' afforded to Django to escape capture from Candyland. Meanwhile Tarantino seems less interested in character coherency, than bringing about mindless bloodshed, hence when the collected and restrained Dr. Schultz decides to go against prior behaviour and consequently risk the death of both Django and Brunhilda, the best he has to say is: 'Sorry, I just couldn't help myself.' Just so Tarantino, who seems less interested with the story, more in the spectacle: producing a glee moment, an obscure reference, witty dialogue.Nonetheless even in terms of spectacle 'Django Unchained' falls pretty flat with regards to the genre Tarantino is obviously pastiching. No scene stands out as memorable (apart from maybe a Mandingo fight due to its wanton violence), despite some inspired performances. Nothing even comes close to the Sergio Leone's classic train station show-down or the shoot-out at the end of 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'. And these are just some of the timeless scenes in classic Leone, Corbucci (or even Peckinpah - at least in terms of gratuitous violence) westerns. The best Tarantino could do was replicate screen titles from the Italian golden era and imitate the long runtime, but none of the tentative magic was carried. Spaghetti westerns may not have carried profound sub-textual messages, but they carry the standard of quintessential movie magic, which makes Tarantino trademark homage even more trivial to watch (albeit given the widespread admiration of his new movie I am obviously delivering a minority report). Profusely violent 'Django Unchained' adds to Tarantino's egocentric homage collection, but despite his strong following and widespread critical appeal, it still seems like the amount of people just not finding his one-track creativity entertaining anymore is steadily expanding.",6,5,10,21 January 2013
Frozen," Disney back to the roots
","A very liberal take on the Hans Christian Andersen 'Snow Queen', has Walt Disney animation forcefully returning back to its roots, whilst learning heaps from their fruitful cooperation with Pixar. With top-notch animation directors Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee instill heart into proceedings, but reimplanting the musical magic of the pre-1960s classic cartoons. Princess Else (Idina Menzel) was born with a tremendous gift, able to create beautiful icy structures out of nothing. However her power is so immense, creating a risk to her loved ones. Despite the loving care of her parents she becomes afraid of her rampaging powers, especially after she accidentally injures her sister Anna (Kristen Bell). Else locks herself away, becoming a recluse detached from her beloved Anna, who slowly grows up full of joy of life and explosive happiness, untouched even by the death of her parents.When Else turns 18 she is to become queen of the kingdom, but fear causes her to cast a spell of eternal winter to encapsulate the land. As Else runs away into the high-rise mountains, Anna goes after her in an attempt to save the kingdom. She is soon joined by the ice seller Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and his trusted reindeer dog Sven, as well as by the magical snowman Olaf (Josh Gad) in a touching adventure fraught with trials and tribulations...'Frozen' possesses a musical zest, which hasn't featured in Pixar movies, but once was a hallmark of Disney animations. These traditions are effortlessly immersed into the beautifully told epic journey of friendship and timeless love. The amount of singing and dancing, especially in the opening half of the movie, comes somewhat as a surprise, but even more unexpectedly it never seems out-of-place as if coming from a bygone era of filmmaking. Seamlessly capturing the inner child, 'Frozen' adds some spectacular imagery in ice, making it a magical journey for both kids and adults. Rife with some witty humour as well as the odd bout of slapstick, this is almost the perfect mix. Even the ending is sung in the perfect note, despite my misgivings of a trite well-worn route. That said Disney's newest feature is hardly adventurous, rather treading a easily anticipated dramatic path, which settles to deliver the expected in a fabulously enticing manner with beautiful surrounding, exquisite costumes or endearing characters (with the heat-loving snowman and the dog-deer Sven a special treat).Of special note is the lack of a defined villain, as the story is built around the concepts of human frailty, lack of internal confidence and mistakes that lead to terrible consequences. The antagonist is a tragic character of old, not by definition or nature, but by fate.Some quibbles should be made about script logic, especially the character and contradictory actions of Hans (Santino Fontana) raising an eyebrow or two.",8,4,9,6 January 2014
Good Will Hunting," A touching venture
","A youthful, but unhinged genius Will Hunting (Matt Damon) works as a janitor at the MIT, where he conspicuously solves higher level mathematical conundrum handed out to students by Fields Medal-winning combinatorialist Professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgård). Shocked by the ingenuity of the troubled orphan Lambeau ventures to have him enrol as his student. The South Boston bred man-child however prefers to spend time and money on booze by the gallons with his friends Chuckie Sullivan (Ben Affleck), Billy McBride (Cole Hauser) and Morgan O'Mally (Casey Affleck). Following a aggressive assault by Hunting on a man who bullied him as a child, Will agrees to attend therapeutic sessions and become Lambeau's protégé. After several therapist resign from taking on the troublesome genius, Lambeau finally asks his former roommate Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) to take on the formidable task. Despite a soul-breaking first encounter, Maguire decides on the challenge, despite the necessity of overcoming Hunting's intellectually layered self-defence mechanisms...Back in the days 'Good Will Hunting' offered a novelty perspective, one heavily layered in witty dialogue, well versed psychoanalysis and somehow avoiding pointless on-screen blabbering. A brain-child of youthful Affeck and Damon came a brilliant piece of drama, strongly carried on the shoulders of the central theme of the therapeutic sessions. Probably Gus van Sant's most mainstream effort is arguably also his most honest and best. Unskewed by pretence the story sells as a traditionally structured drama, but with such an intensely successful script, which makes it an undying classic. Although several scenes do seem rough, especially those centred around Skarsgård and the wasting away of Will's talent, almost misguided in intent and somewhat hollow, nowhere close to as forceful as the key sessions between Maguire and Hunting. Exposition is pretty low key and apart from lone scenes like Hunting's love interest, Skylar (Minnie Driver) flying away to California shuns away from artistic endeavours, keeping a simple and focused outlook on the key issues at hand - the question of fulfilment as defined by intellectual achievements as opposed to that of bliss happiness caused by human interaction.",8,2,5,2 November 2012
The Bourne Legacy," Bourne with pain
","In the midst of the turmoil caused by rogue agent Jason Bourne the whole secret intelligence community in the United States is thrown into turmoil. In an attempt to minimise blow-back various shady CIA directors (or whatever other secretive entities they represent) attempt to clean house. Including the updated version of the Blackbriar and Treadstone programmes - Opration Outcome. Enhanced by a mix of drugs and training, which creates super-soldier black ops Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) and his like are the next generation, one however that has been signed off for disposal due to the Bourne misgivings. Managing to survive the initial attack Cross is now on course for vengeance, but simultaneously must access the drug mix, else he is destined to change back into the semi-imbecilic farm-boy he was prior to the programme. He therefore seeks the aid of geneticist Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz), who administered him the drugs in an earlier phase of Outcome.'Bourne Legacy' took a shot at replicating the appeal of the original trilogy, arguably the best spy action movie franchise ever. Losing Matt Damon was sure to hit hard, but sincerest attempts were made to reinstate vigour with a new front man with a strikingly similar visage: Jeremy Renner. Nonetheless Renner lacks the same magnetic and boyish charm of Damon, making him a more distant hero, thus less instantaneously accessible. Despite best attempts to pump up the support cast with Edward Norton, Albert Finney or Rachel Weisz (all gifted with clichéd one-dimensional characters), the protagonist typecast is key. And Jeremy Renner feels like a sub-par clone of the original. Unfortunately script is additionally at fault, as one of the key appeals of the franchise was Jason Bourne's ability to stoically wriggle out of the most complex oppression.The intricate real-time getaways fronted by Matt Damon made any plot holes or substandard dialogue secondary, thus making the Bourne trilogy classic irrespective of script frailties. Alex Cross lacks the same sort of calm presence under fire, while the escapes lack the same ingenious collected complexity. Stitching it all together 'Bourne Legacy' turns out to be a substandard action flick without the unrelenting charm it supposes to re-imagine. Bourne fans basically expect more of the same, but the Gilroy brothers seem incapable of delivering anything outside of standard explosive fare, despite obvious attempts to rehash everything the Paul Greengrass managed so perfectly.",3,0,3,23 December 2012
K-19: The Widowmaker," The Anti-Imperialist Dudmarine
","Back in the heat of cold war, the Soviet Union entered into an ill-advised technological advancement war. Despite initial much publicised success the effort strained the country, when funds and ingenuity were diverted from more pressing needs. Nonetheless the K-19 nuclear submarine was another great achievement of Russian thought, not to undermine the ultimate failure of internal machinery. Too proud for reason the Soviet Union decides to float the boat, despite an onslaught of minor faults still troubling the technical crew. The more familial Captain Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson) tries to delay deployment, but ultimately his superior and first-in-command Captain Alexei Vostrikov (Harrison Ford) holds the decision. Dedicated to the Soviet Union and instructions from above, despite misgivings Vostrikov orders the K-19 to be floated and the crew soon journeys into the international waters. Unfortunately, the unthinkable and inevitable occurs...Unabashedly dedicated to war history Kathryn Bigelow warps the standard and delves into a story without American warships and submarine, instead omitting the ideological backdrop and capturing the human ordeal behind the ill-fated K-19. And this is her main point of valour, as unfortunately the story itself fails to really hit, sometimes forced to advance through standardised Hollywood gimmicks. Nonetheless the attempts to avert a nuclear catastrophe by the crew, who haphazardly try to weld a radioactive leak, is as gut-wrenching as it is mesmerising. Pretty damning liberties with the facts in order to guarantee 'narrative flow' are one point of contention, the other a somewhat 'ghost in the machine' resolution of the tentative relationship between Polenin and Vostrikov (not to mention that the whole worn-down theme of conflict between the ship captain and his second in charge seemed derivative to the more dreaded occurrences on the ship). The trite resolution of the conflict unmistakeably comes with buoyant music and some artless angelic comeuppance. Harrison Ford is of no help with his shifting accent and lack of conviction.Making the movie feel somewhat like the submarine itself: a bloated chaotic mess released into the cinematic waters despite its apparent flaws. Not entirely successful in its endeavour, Bigelow does manage to show some of her directorial creds, but the overall product is watchable in its excess, but hardly memorable in retrospect.",6,0,1,10 February 2013
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," A Forrest Gump remake with a fresh ending
","One cold New Year's Eve in 1918 Benjamin Button is born. His mother dies at childbirth, whilst he himself a wrinkled deformed baby is left at the doorstep of an old people's home by his panicking father. After seeing this gift from god and a doctor stating that he has not much time to live a black maid Dorothy Baker (Faune A. Chambers) decides to look after the infant. Years pass but instead of dying each passing year sees Benjamin's health improving with age. A young boy in the body of an old man he is set to live his life in reverse.His soul-mate is Daisy (Cate Blanchett), several years younger than him and an aspiring dancer. Life however forces them apart when Benjamin becomes a sailor and Daisy leaves for New York to pursue her dancing career.This won't be much of a discovery and as some people have noticed in a cute youtube spoof Benjamin Button is so similar to Forrest Gump that it is impossible not to notice. This does not only concern story similarities (with differences ranging from Gump partaking in the Vietnam War and Button in the II World War), but also the way the story is structure and told. This feeling of deja vu really makes you focus to much attention on the wrong things. Add to that the not-too-deep story and you have no option but to come to the conclusion that the first 90 minutes of the movie is a waste.Now I must say that after being extremely disappointed by the first 90 minutes I really must applaud the director for the rest. Once Benjamin and Daisy finally come together the movie takes on totally new subject matters, becomes deeper and more thought through. During this part of the movie I must say we have possibly two of the most heart-warming sequences in XXI-century cinema. The first shows Benjamin and his daughter playing outside with a balloon, while Daisy watches them from inside the house. The second shows Benjamin's last moments of life. During these two scenes you really feel like you are watching a masterpiece.I wasn't really convinced by the motivations of Button and Daisy break-up at the end of the movie. It seemed forced and unnecessary. On the other hand the storyline really makes you contemplate what occurred long after the movie finished. Heartwarming and masterful movie, even if too much repetitiveness for 60% of it...",6,0,2,24 January 2010
Brave," Pixar's version of a 'bad movie'
","Set in the mythical past of Scottish highlands comes a tale of bravery and the limits of family love. Fire-haired Princess Merida (Kelly Macdonald) is destined by tradition to become a promised wife. Nurtured and educated by her mother Elinor (Emma Thompson) she must always stay distinguished, even as her three young brothers let all hell loose on a daily basis. Her father, King Fergus (Billy Connolly) is more lenient, but also more interested in hunting down Mor'du, the great demon bear, than truly standing up for his daughter's independent spirit. Only once a year is Merida allowed to let loose - during her birthday. One year during such an escapade Merida comes across a witch (Julie Walters), who is attempting to enter a new career path as a wood carver. Nonetheless Merida convinces her to cast one last spell, which will allow her freedom to make her own decisions in life. As every such fairy tale spell the wish has dire repercussions...When Pixar makes a 'bad movie' it is still probably the best animated feature of the year. Naturally animation is perfected year after year, but this time around the story department falters delivering what seems like a substandard fairy tale. Characters are generally very affable, but somewhere along the rushed exposition the movie falls to real lift off when the end credits appear. Despite a few hilarious chuckles, especially centred around creative uses of Scottish kilts, the overall quality on every level is a few steps below what has become expected from the famed stable of animatrix, not to mention the uncomfortable mimicry of the 'My Brother Bear' movie. It's a shame that the daughter-mother plot didn't receive a much better impact treatment, given the general characters populating the movie are actually pretty good base material for building a great story.",6,2,5,11 January 2013
Clash of the Titans," Epitome of dumb fun
","In this very loose retelling of the myth of Perseus and his quests which lead him to kill Kraken, Medusa and and host of other beasts everything is big. Except for the storytelling. Cutting bits and pieces of real myths they mold it into a pretentious story about a demigod Perseus, who loves man more than god and will do anything to destroy the gods, including his own father. Well... later on Zeus is a good pal with whom our hero chit chats... but initially he's 'ble'.I understand the gods like playing with humans, but the whole storyline keeps running into hurdles and instead of jumping them it hits them head-on. This is epitomised by Zeus first saying 'Release the Kraken', but simultaneously assisting Perseus in killing Medusa and giving him a couple of playthings to boot (a sword and even a Pegasus).Than you also have key elements of mythology unrecognisably changed. Most of it doesn't bother me, but why the scriptwriter introduced a character called Io to be Perseus's fling instead of sticking with Andromeda, sacrificed to the Kraken and rescued by our hero, is a retcon worthy of a head check.What worries more is the amount of corny lines coupled with bad scripting and less than enthralling characters and you can understand why this movies stumbles to achieve an improvement on the original, albeit the special effects are way more impressive. The last scene of the movie with Zeus and Perseus talking is a telling example, but such sub-par corny scenes litter this movies constantly. The further we enter the movie the more obvious they become, when the clichés and poor character writing (exemplified by the pair of hunters introduced solely for the occasional comedic relief) drag this movie to the ground.On the plus side the Kraken is really impressive as were the giant scorpions. But even there the action sequences seemed to lack something. All in all it would have probably been better if the movie had copied the route suggested by Zack Snyder's '300' and basically overdid the action, pathos and performances on purpose to make the movie out of this earth.",4,1,2,25 August 2010
Paranormal Activity," Had trouble sleeping...
","Yes. I had trouble sleeping after this movie. And that says it all. Although we had almost no real scares in this movie and more of what was happening was in you imagination than anywhere else the film itself creeps you out with noises, situations and the fact that it basically delves into the primordial fear of the dark, which almost every child has. And the memory of this persists making well made ghost or demon movies much more frightening than any gorno movies.Shot entirely on a HD semiprofessional camera, which is either wielded by one of the two main characters of the movie or is shooting whilst on a tripod set in the bedroom. The plot is sinisterly simple - a couple haunted at night by weird noises and small unexplainable occurrences decide to purchase a camera to film what is going on at night...I must say that in terms of general impact I haven't had my childhood fears so well triggered since watching 'The Exorcist'. Which is saying a lot. I must also congratulate the two main actors who always feel sincere and real to the bone. That adds an additional punch of reality, which helps you forget you are watching a movie.The end scene apparently sticked on by Paramount Pictures after they purchased the movie and as such it seems too clichéd and banal in comparison with the rest of the movie. The two alternate original endings are much better.",8,1,3,24 August 2010
Black Snake Moan," Antithesis of the poster...
","Based on the badly construed poster, inadvertently countering the whole essence of the movie, 'Black Snake Moan' comes off as a misogynistic throwback tribute to sexploitational / blaxploitational movies of the 70s, much owed to the Tarantino school of film. Surprisingly however scriptwriter and director Craig Brewer wistfully decapitates expectations, albeit dangles uncertainty through some stylishly promiscuous scenes featuring the nymphomaniac excesses of Rae (Christina Ricci), before entering into the actual gist of the story. One that is painstakingly similar to the plot summary of the up-and-coming Lars von Trier movie 'Nymphomaniac'.When compulsively oversexed Rae is left by her one love Ronnie (Justin Timberlake), who joins the army in search of educational prospects, she enters a frenzied bout of loose activities, as if possessed by a slithering demon of wanton. After one such escapade Rae ends up beaten and left for dead on the side of the road, where she is consequently picked up by an old farmer Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson), recently abandoned by his wife in search of fulfilment of wild pleasure, that he himself was unwilling to offer. As a deeply religious man Lazarus decides to take care of the young soul and after experiencing firsthand Rae's sexual bouts decided to chain her up to a heater and exorcise her inner incubus. After initial attempts to escape Rae comes to accept her situation and recapture reasons behind her behaviour...Albeit certain hints of inner contradictions are present with sexuality use as story tool for preaching restraint in an almost religious manner, 'Black Snake Moan' manages to overcome bad marketing, which diverted attention from the movie to wrong crowds. After the opening sequence concentrated on sexual frenzies of Rae and several scenes verging on exploitive (with Lazarus taking Rae for 'a walk'), which essentially complement the misinforming poster (inadequately suggesting a sexual type of relationship between Rae and Lazarus), the movie dramatically shifts gear to take a step back and catch the blues. Literally.Lazarus, an old blues musician, punctuates key moments in the story with songs, that give the music a creative power to change people and their behaviour. The song 'Black Snake Moan' coupled with a thunderstorms and failing lights, as if taken from a horror movie, serves as a tool to discover and fight inner demons, while a blues concert gives Rae a channel to dispose of sexual tension through dance. Rae herself ventures into song to portray a soothing of her anxieties, a subtle change in character and development of inner strength, one that she later on will want to pass on to Ronnie. Meanwhile blues legend Son House features through archival footage at several junctures of the movie to offer insight and meaning, as well as present the essence of blues. Music and sound (most prominently snake hisses announcing Rae's attacks), skillfully intertwined with picture, creates the backbone of the movie, capturing the ear first to then pull into the story.After being captivated little space is left for attentively following the story, which despite several admirable qualities, does come as pretty straight-forward, somewhat hurried and featuring several dramatically incompetent sequences, lost due to both acting as well as directorial flaws. Cristina Ricci comes off best as the lost soul with bulging tension and relentless sexual drive, while Jackson admirably performs several blues songs to rapturous applause of viewers, but simultaneously hits several false notes in the acting department, most evidently when supposedly losing control during a tirade about his wife to the chained Rae. Despite its trashy side and a lack in character depth the end product is pretty admirable. All in all the music makes this movie, with the blues both thematically and rhythmically offering it a distinct and worthwhile vibe.",7,3,6,14 September 2012
Friends with Benefits," Overly cliché and laboured
","After another failed relationship high-rolling blog entrepreneur Dylan Harper (Justin Timberlake) and head-hunter Jamie Rellis (Mila Kunis) decide to forfeit on love and commitments. Per chance Jamie headhunts the LA settled Dylan to become the chief editor of GQ monthly, the New York. On his arrival to the Big Apple the two hitch onto their instant connection, chatting through the days and wise-cracking on the same wave-length. Not wanting to dissolve the friendship, but at the same time in the midst of an ongoing sex-drought, the two decide to enter an understanding: Just sex. No strings attached. What happens from then on is... pretty anticipatable. At first things are perfectly fine, but then an epiphany or two changes the state of affairs into something less raunchy and more heartwarming.Romantic comedies are essentially my guilty pleasure (psst... don't pass the word around), often intaking a few to lessen the intensity levels following more ambitious cinema. Despite being able to fill in the dots several scenes ahead, they do offer a certain respite and touch the less cynical side of a human being. However cliché and stereotypical the two leads or predictable the outcome, the key issue is proper chemistry and some honest laughs. Unfortunately 'Friends with Benefits' offers two mildly intriguing characters with pet peeves and supposedly cute idiosyncrasies, who are provided with well-meant, but laboured, dialogue. They end up attempting to talk there way into the viewer's sympathy with mildly entertaining punchlines, forced deliveries reeking of pretentiousness or mistimed comedic flow. Even worse some of the ideas spun into the move are outdated (like the whole flash mob concept) and just don't help to build the character's credibility.The best thing in the movie is Dylan's father (played by Richard Jenkins), an Alzheimer afflicted heart-warming character, which single-handedly manages to instill a sense of honesty to the end resolution, despite all the dismembered emotionality of preceding events. Unfortunately for the lead cast the show is basically stolen by supporting actors with Jamie Clarkson as Jamie's hippie sex crazed mom and Woody Harrelson as a gay sports editor stealing all of the thunder whenever on screen.",4,4,8,30 June 2012
Elysium," Striving for relevance
","Neill Blomkamp's sophomore feature serves more as a statement of intent, than a calling card for future reference. Within the confines of parochial script owing too much to Hollywood epic conclusiveness and too little to the restraint shown with the phenomenal debut of 'District 9', Blomkampp struggles to imbue a sense of relevance to a heavily socially-aware storyline.In the year 2154 with resources strained and class warfare restrained by corporational dictatorship, the rich of the world have shipped themselves off-planet to an idyllic resort called Elysium. Detached from earthly woes and equipped with state-of-the-art equipment, seemingly extrapolating Wolverine's rapid healing gene, the wealthy live in a cocoon of self-glee, whilst still gaining dividends from Earth profits. With the accumulation of fortunes brought to an extreme, the rest of humanity is brought to a state of sustainable poverty in a fascist state policed by mechanised droids and system institutions running like clock-work through the use of robot figureheads. In a run-down Los Angeles ex-criminal Max (Matt Damon) tries to straighten out his life. Unfortunately for him a work accident leaves him radiated with but five days of life, needing powerful drugs to keep him functional. Left with few options Max attempts to break through to Elysium to use the almost magical medical capabilities available there. However en route he comes across valuable secrets, which make him the most wanted man in the Solar System....On several levels 'Elysium' is a riveting piece of sci-fi with what - in my opinion - is the best CGI effects ever to be registered on film. Unlike most generic computerised special effects Blomkampp brings some much needed refreshing fingerprint to his animated CGI with trademark Halo-inspired drones, robot, exo-skeletons all moving with such specific swagger, that Blomkampp has cemented his unique style and usurps the right to say that despite the onslaught of special effects this is a rare example of a movie, where the CGI actually functions for the story, not the other way around. Blomkampp's specificity is further underlined by the mixing of the decrepit atrophy of humanity (in the form of squalid slums) seamlessly intersecting with technology of the future, creating a captivatingly hideous world, which lingers in memory far longer than any other modern CGI-bursting picture. Aided with some memorable performances by the wickedly devious Jodie Foster (as Elysium's secretary of defence Delacourt) and the efficient madness of Sharlto Copley as the ruthless South African mercenary-spy Kruger, 'Elysium' has multitudes of ingredients for the creation of a sci-fi classic, even to outdo 'District 9'.This time however the script turns out to be the biggest let-down for writer-director Blomkampp, who fuses the world around a story, which lacks in creativity, instead making that up with blasts and a needless attempt to 'change the world'. With cumbersome, if morally sound, social messages heavy-handedly bringing attention to the plight of the poor, the increasingly widening wealth gap, the overreach of corporate power as well as to health systems geared towards money, the movie topples into familiar traps, overly relying on Hollywood sci-fi standards to push the message through (unlike for example 'Children of Men'). Nonetheless 'Elysium' is visually powerful, even stunning, providing belief that a new profound voice for high-octane cinema has emerged. Now all he requires is some aid in delivering a story suitable for his virtuosic use of CGI magic.",6,1,3,21 August 2013
Taken," Licensed to thrill
","Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson), is a divorced former special ops with a beautiful young daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace). His career caused him to become detached from his family, but now retired he seeks to at least reconcile himself with his next of kin. This plan hits upon a snag, when Kim begs him to allow her to go to Europe all by herself to rediscover the old continent. Bryan, being an old paranoid secret service freak, projects a bleak and dire vision of the dangers awaiting young pretty girls abroad. Unfortunately for common sense and realism Bryan turns out to be right as Kim gets kidnapped by the Albanian female slave trade upon arrival. Bryan quickly decides to revert to what he does best: killing and causing havoc.The whole movie is spectacularly awesome. But only if you do your best to ignore the lame and rather ridiculous intro and outro of the thrilling roller-coaster (Americans being kidnapped for slave trade with the knowledge and acceptance of French secret service? Of all the cinematography bull I have been ever sold...). But than again the plot always seemed just to serve as an excuse to the action and the intriguing character of Bryan Mills. Liam Neeson is absolutely brilliant as a tough ex-secret service plus he does the best acting job in action-movie living memory. With a face full of emotion and anger you never doubt in his unwaning bloody conviction.An additional bonus was the idea behind the lead character himself - a ruthless cold-blooded extremely goal-orientated killing-machine. Unlike many other heroes portrayed in cinema this one has one sole goal - save his daughter. Everything else is either collateral damage or - in the best case scenario - an opportune bonus (saving another girl, killing bad guys and so on). Even when saving a drugged out girl forced into prostitution his ulterior motive was not being a good guy, but extracting information from the victim that may aide his cause. Bryan Mills is basically ruthless and essentially devoid of higher morality, albeit with a code of honour that puts him head and heels above the perpetrators.Not to mention the absolutely scintillating adrenaline channelling chases, fights and shootouts, which have a brutal in-your-face sense of realism to them. The movie does wander into the unbelievable zone quite often, but even then in manages to punch you in the gut, unlike all the modern CGI fight sequences.All in all a welcome addition to the action genre and probably one of the most entertaining movies I have seen in a while. I dare you to try and fall asleep to this one.",7,0,0,17 January 2011
Alice in Wonderland," Alice in Hollywoodland. The Sequel
","Alice returns to Wonderland following the clock-ticking nicely attired rabbit. However all that she remembers from her previous encounter is in the form of vivid dreams. This time around Alice is brought back as a saviour of the realm corrupted by the madness of the Red Queen. The land has fallen into ruin and the blood-hungry rule has blocked out the joy. Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) has been patiently waiting at his tea party for the return of Alice. However Alice has grown and forgotten, which throws doubt among the other dwellers of Wonderland as to her true identity... Only the Mad Hatter casts away any doubt...The moment I heard that this movie was being crafted by no other than Tim Burton one thought instinctively came to mind: Here is the person born to make Alice come to the big screen. Coupled with the tremendous talent of his two muses: Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham-Carter I held the distinct feeling that this may yet be Burton's masterpiece. Sadly after an inspiring start to the movie it all goes downhill with the aid of dumb-downed comedy punches, thickly spread saviour plot and conventional Hollywood type story-build. This movie is a far cry from what Coraline managed to achieve - a relatively wacky story delivered in a new murky-dark package accessible for kids and adults alike.After the initial awe of the world into which Alice has been thrown you slowly settle in to the story itself. Similarly as with Avatar the plot just does not do itself justice. Instead of crafty and wacky we have a sub-par Sunday movie plot. The two stars of the picture - Helena Bonham-Carter and Johnny Depp do their best to make the movie different and refreshing, but Mad Hatter is severely overused and well... not mad enough (I actually had the impression that Mad Hatter was faking his madness).The ending of the movie is rushed and bordering on insulting. I agree we don't need a Return of the King ending, but plot solution was handled extremely poorly. It could have been excused in a movie from a lesser director, but I feel Burton probably got trampled over by his producers with the ending to make it sweet, pretentious and dumb.What didn't help me in the slightest is the Polish dubbing of the movie I watched. Especially the local Polish comedy actor (Czarek Pazura) dubbing Depp is appalling.",6,2,4,15 March 2010
Avatar," In a galaxy far away Pocahontas was blue...
","REEDITED AFTER A SECOND WATCH:Visually stunning. Full stop. No one in their right mind would disprove this statement. And I must say that it actually keeps you in your seat in awe for about 80 minutes. The problem is finding something to do with the remaining 80 minutes...After a second watch (due to my wife not seeing the movie yet) I felt the necessity to re-edit my review. Basically I felt I exaggerated some of my claims, albeit I stay with the general grade. Nonetheless a lot remains true, as i.e. how extremely shocking it is that after all the love devoted to the graphics and hitec (absurdly used for a tree-hugging 'technology sucks' extravaganza) he was unable to give even 10% of the same amount of care to the script.As far as acting is concerned it wasn't as bad as initially thought, albeit James Cameron's tie with actors is progressively getting worse with each movie - basically he has become too focused on the technical side and lets too much subpar acting enter his movie with a drive for perfection. 'Avatar' is tragically miss-directed and it seems Cameron spent not enough time with actors as he was too immersed in the 3D. The acting in general was passable, albeit Sam Worthington was well below par, while his voice-over vlogging was cringeworthy and initited a couple of unwanted laughs of ridicule. Of all the characters only Stephen Land as Colonel Miles Quaritch made a good impression, while the less said about the rest the better. However there is no character in the whole movie, who isn't basically nothing more than an archetype. It is as though Cameron decided to totally ignore character-building so he could focus on the gimmicks and therefore decided to copy-paste multiple paper-thin stereotypical characters that populate the planet of Pandora. Even the two main characters of crippled ex-marine Ben (Sam Worthington) and his Na'vi female companion Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) have no emotion in them. The above also says a lot about the special effects, as the facial expression of the Na'vi lack a lot of emotion. Surprising given graphically inferior pictures like 'Up' manage to touch the heart. On a graphical level the movie may be breathtaking, but it is not flawless. The Na'vi characters look quite ridiculous with the dumb-looking ears sticking out especially awfully. Also the movement of Na'vi tries to be realistic, but plainly isn't and I have seen character animations done much better in films with 1/10 the budget. It also says a lot that the Mechrobot in 'District 9' looks way better than in 'Avatar'. The most influential imprint of the movie is the wildlife, forests and general settings, albeit a couple of animals in the movie are rather pathetically done (i.e. the Pandora lemurre).That brings us to the script itself, which is immensely flawed. Instead of intelligent conversations and complex storyline we are served a Pocahontas remake in space populated with one-liners and some very lax plotting. Plot holes galore most of them can be forgiven or even missed altogether. It is a shame, because some of the ideas in the movie are quite intriguing, even if wasted by the terribly uninspiring storytelling. The biggest flaw to the storytelling comes with the final fight sequence, which is plain moronic from a tactical point of view and punctuates the fact that the scriptwriter/director was really subpar/underdeveloped/weak. James Cameron really should have given the script to someone for consultations. Even without a military background it is quite apparent to any one with a brain that you do not coordinate a full frontal attack on superior forces, if all you are armed with are arrows. How the hell did an ex-marine tactics come down to attacking machine-wielding Mechrobots with indians on horses? And they are surprised that this ended in a massacre? Guerilla tactics ring a bell, Cameron?But in the end this is eye-candy and for that alone it deserves accolades. But this really brings us to answer the question: What is art in film? This film is a piece of graphic art on so many levels and as such should be screened in art galleries all around the world. But film is not solely about full-frontal sensory-rape.I can see people loving to immerse into this beautiful world and delving into escapism. It is a symptom of the era in which we live in, where what surrounds us does not bring enough joy or hope. Hence we fall into fantasy worlds be it through games (like World of Warcraft), books or movies. On this level I would be capable of giving Avatar a much higher score. But then I remember what Peter Jackson did with 'Lord of the Rings' and how well crafted the movie was on every level and I know it would not be just to place this terribly subpar but beautiful movie anywhere close to Jackson's convincing portrayal of Middleearth. There were reasons why Ian McKellen was taken into account by the Academy for his role in The Fellowship... 'Avatar' will be forever remembered solely for its technological achievement, as there is nothing else of consequence going for this movie...After re-watching 'Up' (a far superior movie on every level) it just came to me that in the future Pixar and others will be making movies in the same technology. And their stories and direction will blow Cameron out of the water. This movie may be a hall-mark but with each passing year it will become even more out-dated and the faults of the script will stick out like a dozen sore thumbs...To sum it up: A breakthrough - yes. A masterpiece - far from it. Take away the awesome bling and you have a Razzie award winner.",6,3,10,4 January 2010
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Decent watch, but essentially hollow
","A group of fascist and nihilistic libertines - the Duke (Paolo Bonacelli), the Bishop (Giorgio Cataldi), the Magistrate (Umberto Paolo Quintavalle) and the President (Aldo Valletti) - wield their power for perverse means. Namely selecting 9 boys and 9 girls to forcefully participate in an extreme 120 day orgy. Helped out by four elderly prostitutes (Caterina Boratto, Elsa De Giorgi, Hélène Surgère, Sonia Saviange) they manipulate, degrade and indulge into obscene acts of denigration, stimulation, mutilation capping it off with some well earned torture.Now... first off people say this movie is sick. Yes, it is out there and it is extreme. Especially with the feces dinner right smack in the middle of Pasolini's explotapiece and the mass torture scene that is the big finale of this movie. But all in all I was expecting something way more disgusting and appalling. Maybe all the torture porn of the modern era has made me desensitised, but I really can't see what all the fuss is about. It probably was out there back in the days, but nowadays you have movies doing the same but better and more realistically (albeit eating poop is rarely viewed and these scenes remain quite strong).Second off the movie feels like a very shallow attack on fascism and fascists and less as a comment on the human condition. You never really felt that any of main characters were real and anything other than caricatures. On the other hand the victims of the movie are so underdeveloped that they have no dramatic influence on the movie - they serve just one purpose and that is sexual cannon fodder. They may be victimised, but apart from a couple of scenes you aren't really given a chance to experience their emotions and reactions to the situation. I'm not expecting in your face crying, but maybe fleshing out one or two victims may have given the movie a better edge in the context of commenting on the human condition.Third off I must agree with what many people say. It did seem pointless and without substance. Essentially there are many movies nowadays that give an equally extreme recollection of torture and rape, but deal with the underlying issues of morality with much more credibility and depth. All in all Pasolini seemed only intent to shock with his last movie, but did not put enough focus on actually having something to say with this picture, instead riddling it with artsy shots, quirky scenes and poetic pointless dialogue.Unfortunately in the end an unnecessary movie by a great director.",5,2,4,26 August 2010
Inside Man," Tarantino - look and learn
","I've never been a Spike Lee fan and have always found him too self-indulgent. But this movie really made me reassess what I have thought about this director.The movie starts of with a surprise musical choice: Panjabi music. I still have no idea why Spike Lee decided on such a selection, but it almost conveys the fact that this movie is unpredictable and works outside the box.Really quite a brilliant piece of work with the script really setting new standards for 'bank job' movies. The suspense is constant. The idea behind the heist sound and slick. The execution is inventive if simple. The actors do a great to excellent job. And that includes everyone from the main actors (Denzel Washington, Clive Owen) and the supporting cast (Jodie Foster, Christopher Plummer, Chiwetel Ojiofor, Willem Dafoe) to the smallest of characters... Immense work from the director and kudos to being able to keep his whole vision intact.An additional bonus to the whole intrigue and primary action are short social and racial commentaries, which are darn brilliant, even if superfluous. Spike Lee however nails it every time, with the Sikh incident being the highlight of the movie. These elements were to an extent reminiscent of Quentin Tarantino's earlier work. But this is a whole new level of what Tarantino has been striving to achieve. Respect to Tarantino for showing the way, but this movie shows just how comparatively lacking he is as a director.This movie almost makes me think that Spike Lee may not only be one of the greatest African-American directors of his generation. He may actually be one of the greatest directors of his generation. Period. (Although I guess a great script helps).Don't have any real squabbles about the movie. Fresh, intriguing, thoughtful and I am really close to giving it a ten.",9,1,3,24 March 2009
Jack Reacher," Idolisation of an antihero
","Chicago. A sniper (Jai Courtney) enters a downtown high-rise and randomly kills of five people walking in a stadium park across the river. Afterwards the seeds of deception are planted, having ex-marine sniper Barr (Joseph Sikora) framed for the killing. Aware of the situation Barr has but one request: find Jack Reacher (played by Tom Cruise), after which he is brutally knocked into a coma by fellow inmates. Nonetheless Reacher, a seemingly elusive ghostly Reacher, an ex-military investigator reappears after two years of escaping the grid. Despite being an sworn enemy of Barr due to previous wrongs of the ex-marine, Reacher slowly unravels the truth behind the sniper attack. His only aide is Barr's attorney Helen (Rosamund Pike), as even within police ranks the conspiracy has dug in its claws...Produced by Tom Cruise and directed by a relative newbie Christopher McQuarrie, Jack Reacher filters through as a reboot of sorts of the Jason Bourne franchise, albeit in this version Reacher does the chasing, and not the escaping. Equipped with unrivalled intelligence, photographic memory and apt to most military skills, such as hand to-hand combat or gun use, Jack is akin to godly. Here however the unsurpassed skill-set aren't owed to any covert human-enhancement programme, but due to a mix of genes and training. Now living a hobo lifestyle, Jack Reacher is a self-proclaimed wanderer, hiding from society at large, unless something or someone necessitates his reappearance.Most of the time Jack Reacher works, even though the almost super-heroic traits of our protagonist does seem to become slightly tired and overused. The issue that probably works least is Jack Reacher's uncanny sex appeal, which brings a unwanted sense of ridicule - with the pheromones at work the movie would have worked well as an overlong Axe commercial. Not sure, if this was Tom Cruise working his ego, but it definitely brought out some misplaced highbrows...Nonetheless, despite the expectations of a mindless action movie, placing its focus on brawns over brains, 'Jack Reacher' offers several narrative surprises, weaving a well-thought out intrigue coupled with some witty investigative work by the contemporary Sherlock Holmes. It is undoubtedly a great pleasure to be able to engage into a movie and not have to question the logical connections made by the story. The actions of Jack Reacher never seem aimless and forced, but a meticulous pre-planned wholesome conceptualisation, much like with Jason Bourne's immaculate gift to slither through the tightest noose.Soundly crafted some fault can be however placed on the underdevelopment of the enigmatic Zec (a chic appearance by director Werner Herzog), albeit maybe this was a purposeful attempt to not unravel too much details for planned sequels. Due to this however the final act does feel a bit stale, leading to a feeble emotionless climax, which lacks the intensity of a good 'Die Hard' or 'Lethal Weapon' showdown, as you never really care what happens to any of the enemies Reacher has to face (instead they are drawn like somewhat blank pages). Keep one eye open for a colourful, somewhat special small role of Robert Duvall, who truly makes his screen time a gleeful presence to behold.",6,0,2,12 September 2013
In Time," Concept outlives the script
","In a futuristic dystopia money has been replaced with life - the moment your credit runs out you end up dead. Life as a commodity to trade had changed society into those who can afford eternity and those forced to work at dead-end, quasi-slavery, jobs only to survive the day. This order remains unquestioned until time-stricken Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) is gifted over 100 years by a rich outsider fed up with the reality in which he lives. This allows Will to venture into the most expensive living zones, where he soon unravels the corrupt system created for the egotistical few. Followed by authorities led by Raymond Leon (Cillian Murphy), who fail to believe that someone would have gifted 100 years of life to a complete stranger, Will meets up with heir to Weis Time Bank corporation, Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried). Hungry for adventure and a life not dictated by fright of death Sylvia and Will create a gungho Robin Hoodesque / Bonnie and Clyde team who steal time from the rich and offer it to the poor.With a strong concept rife with capitalist and philosophical undertones, director Andrew Niccol takes the bare minimum exterior, filling it with action fluff, instead of some well-crafted idea-expansion. Tragically empty with some uninspired performances by the surprisingly wooden Seyfriend and Timberlake, the whole movie rings hollow, echoing of wasting opportunities. After some initial promise the whole story spirals downwards, playing with gimmicks resulting from the base idea, instead of exploring the possibilities it offers. Lacking any clever observations and fronted by two leads with absolutely no emotional pull, 'In Time' dissolves any initial interest, making it forgettable drivel not worth the time credits spent on it.",3,2,3,8 June 2013
The Untouchables," Source material untouched
","In prohibition-era Chicago crime lord extraordinaire Al Capone (Robert De Niro) builds a sizable fortune and powerful empire through the sale of illegally imported booze and moonshine. As portrayed in the movie even the law enforcement officials are either corrupt, deeply saddled in Capone's pocket, or basically blindsided towards alcohol given the stupidity and infeasibility of the prohibition. In the midst of these affairs Elliot Ness (Kevin Costner) assembles together a group of incorruptible individuals to turn the tide on the faltering war. Amongst his crew is Jim Malone (Oscar-winner Sean Connery), a dated Irish cop, who patrols the streets in an attempt to detach himself from the lawlessness rife in the police force.A meticulously delivered feature focused on details, sets, designs and captivating scenes, it does however have to cope with a less than stellar script, which skews the historical facts, rushes through to get to the end act and disdainfully disrupts the legend. For one thing Ness and his Untouchables count at a measly four people, a head-count introduced to be able to better flesh out characters, but ultimately causes the force to feel vulnerable, rag-tag and random. What's more the story-building jumps in leaps and bounds - one scene the merry band has just been formed, the next Capone is on the verge of being imprisoned. There is no sense of committed long-term police work on the boundaries of the law, only a rushed conclusion detached from history as well as proper dramatic pull. Ultimately the short-cuts introduced manage to lessen the impact of the story, despite the true sequence of events being such a strong source of material. An example of how tampering with history to deliver a reduxed movie version of events was extremely detrimental to the end product.Time has not been all that gracious for 'The Untouchables' as character interaction feels outdated, mainly due to excess amount of corny corn on the cob, rushed developed and solutions unacceptable by todays standards making one question the reason behind Sean Connery's Oscar award.Nonetheless several tense scenes (the train station stake-out, the house attack on Jim Malone or the border crossing) cause the movie to stand out and remain a memorable experience, despite the countless other flaws inherent to the story. The moral ambiguity, however glossed over and underdeveloped, of the story, with Elliot Ness showing a disdain for the prohibition law itself, but a unwaning support for its enforceability, while Jim Malone drinks alcohol from his hidden stash, gives a powerful insight into the absurdity of the times. The fact that almost no one stood behind the law, indeed allowed for the creation of crime syndicates, where the whole society basically showed its fingers to the lawmakers and their ineptitude to see the bigger picture.",5,2,5,17 June 2012
Psycho," Hitchcock Kickback
","In true Hitchcockian 'shades of grey' office worker Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) rashly decides to take a stash of cash from her employer and ditch Los Angeles to join up with her boyfriend Sam Loomis (John Gavin). With her internal moral regret mounting, even conspiring against her to the verge of paranoia, she ultimately ends up in a dilapidated off-road motel run by the reclusive, but amiable Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), who literally has skeletons hiding out in his closet. When Marion Crane famously gets gutted in the shower by Bates' mother, her sister Lila (Vera Miles) and boyfriend Sam become aware of her disappearance and initiate a hunt. Similarly, her employer sends out detective Milton Arbogast (Martin Balsam) to track down Marion and the stolen money.With a movie so awash with interpretations and reviews, not much noteworthy can be added, except from personal input, especially from the future-past perspective, as in: How does 'Psycho' hold up against its contemporaries? And as such 'Psycho', one of Hitchcock's best works, has aged pretty darn well, outdoing a vast majority of by-the-numbers rip-offs, due to the the ambiguous societal commentary lingering in between the killer rampage. Norman Bates, despite his awkward presence and facial tics, is by no measure a crazed psychopath, who deals in excess, instead Hitchcock affords his main antagonist a very thoughtful character structure, which also helps to build tension. Hitchcock, masterfully, builds context and content, especially with regards to the interaction between Marion and Norman, each running away from their own demons, suggesting that the difference between the two is much less pronounced, than we would like to believe. This gruesome take hits best during a genuinely fresh conversation between the two in the hotel office.Once the initial murder takes place, Hitchcock never lets go of a sense of tension, but the story focuses more on the thriller/horror essence, no longer affording space for such thoughtful commentary. Anthony Perkins carries the movie with his impish, offbeat, charm, delivering a still crisp and tense conversation with the nosey PI Arbogast. For the most part 'Psycho' remains a gripping experience, even though age has caused many false notes to supplant true fright with corny music and overused shock gimmicks. As such the most famous scenes, including the bathroom murder and the big reveal, have lost their impact, referenced to death and outdone by the coming slew of slasher films. Possibly this even works for the better, as the much ridiculed sequences no longer define the movie, instead letting it breath by its own.",8,0,1,21 December 2013
Burlesque," Couldn't be more generic if they tried
","In a name that cliché style a small-town orphaned Iowa girl Ali (Christina Aguilera) decides to skip her aimless diner existence and hop onto the fast lane of opportunities awaiting in Los Angeles (where else?). Once there she searches for job opportunities matching her dreams and abilities. After becoming obsessively inspired with becoming a girl at the Burlesque Lounge, led by the eternally optimistic and passionate Tess (Cher), a joint way past its glory days and awaiting imminent bank foreclosure, Ali forces herself into a job position as a waitress. Ali with her directness and never-say-die attitude quickly steps up the roster from waitress to dancer to star of the whole show. Meanwhile, until a betterment of fortunes comes around, she bunks together with bartender Jack (Cam Gigandet), an aspiring song-writer engaged to a Broadway actress.Amongst other familiar caricatures we have the trusted gay sidekick Sean (Stanley Tucci), the spiteful competitor Nikki (Kristen Bell), the business-minded realtor Marcus (Eric Dane), intent on buying out the club and replacing it with high-rise, and the club partner, ex-husband, Vince (Peter Gallagher) hoping to sell the joint at a profit. Together they form an amalgamate of well-worn characters set into the most generic story possible, rife with every lack of surprise bound to happen around the next corner.Thankfully the lead of Christina Aguilera, who delivers a surprisingly astute performance (albeit not one suggesting a glorious film career), carries the weight of triviality with her charm, pizazz and sexual appeal. Together with a host of scarcely clad beauties on high-heels, in cabarets and a lot of wiggle, the dance sequences are irrefutably engaging and well-done, even if they tend to be a bit repetitive by the fifth on-stage dance. Nonetheless wouldn't mind spending a night out on town in such a sparkling, luscious, if a tad outdated, establishment. On the downside Cher proves again why incessant plastic surgery is the death of a film career, as her face mimicry suffers from abuse and instead of focusing on the actress-singer, I subconsciously found myself attempting to pinpoint and name all operations Cher may have had in a vain attempt to prolong her youthful looks.The movie also features a small, but absolutely brilliant role as a ticketeer by Alan Cumming, who manages to steal all the thunder away from the much weightier accompanying cast. All in all enjoyable, but so generic (with some dialogue so heavily laden with repetition it hurts), that they couldn't have made it more tired and trusted, if they tried.",4,2,5,17 June 2013
Edge of Tomorrow," Best Flop EVER!
","It what seems to be the most spectacular big budget flop of the season, comes 'Edge of Tomorrow', a sci-fi action extravaganza that is one of the best genre movies of the decade. With home sales losing out to teen bromance, overseas return seems to be doing very well, which brings all sorts of questions as to why the Cruise-led alien invasion flick got pummelled so hard in the United States. Word of mouth must be immensely positive, as this is obviously the must see movie for all true sci-fi lovers, and critic's feedback has been verging on unanimous praise, so obviously something else is awry.Two films immediately come to mind when watching 'Edge of Tomorrow', a correlation so obvious that probably every other review pinpoints the influences, namely comedy classic 'Groundhog Day' and Verhoeven's vastly underrated 'Starship Troopers'. Stuck between these two concept movies evolves a surprisingly original and fresh story, which manages to successfully warp expectations.All out war with an alien invasion brings together humanity, when an asteroid crash-lands into central Europe, carrying with it a scourge of otherworldly twirling dervishes called the mimics. As they quickly conquer most of Europe, the counterattack is initiated by a victory under Verdun, where the Full Metal B... Rita (Emily Blunt) singlehandedly kills over a hundred mimics with the newly designed exoskeletons.Cage (Tom Cruise) is the head of PR for the army, a whimpering coward so terrified of the front-line he attempt to blackmail his superior to avoid participating in the fight. With an imminent Normandy type assault planned the following day, Cage finds himself stripped of rank and thrown into a unit heading for the front-lines. The mass landing ends in slaughter with Cage killed in action... only for himself to be inexplicably captured within a time loop.Within a mix of exceptional features and poor contrivances, this summer has been one of the most successful. Following 'Captain America 2' and 'X-Men: Days of Future Past', the blockbuster season seemed to have peaked. And apparently so did the audience, leaving out 'Edge of Tomorrow' from their 'to-watch' list. Nonetheless as far as movies goes Liman (a hit-and-miss director of 'Jumper', 'The Bourne Identity' and 'Mr and Mrs Smith') blows his predecessors out of contention in terms of a stunning mix of style and substance. Whereas other features had their flaws and 'Godzilla' was an outright disappointment, 'Edge of Tomorrow' comes good from the get-go, the only jagged moment coming late on with a jarring out-of-tone ending. Successfully mixing drama, comedy, bleak atmosphere with moments of emotional tension functioning hand-by-hand with ice-breakers and comedic jumps, the scriptwriters truly nailed it. And who would have thought given how uninspired some of Christpher McQuarrie's and the Butterworth brother's previous endeavors were: ranging from 'Jack Reacher' and 'The Tourist' to 'The Last Legion' (although it must be said McQuarrie also has 'The Usual Suspects' credited to him).Unlike many features of its kind, 'Edge of Tomorrow' manage to avoid being solely testosterone driven, albeit the movie does feature a rag-tag squad of misfit soldiers in the Aliens mode, together with Bill Paxton. Albeit action-packed there is a lot of heart flowing, especially with the notion of death being such a frivolous thing and the concept of constantly reliving your beloved one die. Naturally a lot is taken tongue-in-cheek, even these intruguing issues are primarily utilised for their dramatic effect, not for their philosophical options. Issues are skin-deep, tooled and geared so that the video-game premise of immortality isn't the sole pull of the story. Thus the movie is nowhere near 'Groundhog Day' in terms of underlying contextual commentaries. In essence this is a popcorn movie. Just one of the damn finest there is.",9,3,6,12 June 2014
Ice Age: Continental Drift," Patchy series
","'Ice Age' out of all the 3D animation franchises boasts the least intriguing characters. Where Madagascar is saved by the militant penguins and King Julien, or Shrek by a certain talking donkeys and a host of fairy tales freakoids, 'Ice Age' has to fall back on Scrat, who unfortunately has grown stale and repetitive with every new outing. 'Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs' manages to recapture some spirit through Scrat's love affair and the introduction of the swash-buckling weasel Buck. Manny, Diego and co offer limited appeal, mostly functioning as dramatic outlets for plot development, leaving only Sid to be a somewhat colourful, if goofy character.This time around Scrat is back to his quest for the ever-elusive and ultra-destructive acorn, while Buck makes a blink-of-an-eye appearance. As Manny (Ray Romano) tries to control her hormonally challenged daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer), the earth starts another epic change when continents split. As a consequence Peaches and Ellie (Queen Latifah) are split from Manny, who finds himself adrift in full ocean with the sabretooth Diego (Denis Leary), Sid (John Leguizamo) and the latter's granny (Wanda Sykes). Manny will do anything to return to his family, but in order to do so he must first confront the first sea pirate on Earth: prehistoric ape Captain Gutt (Peter Dinklage) and his crew of sea-worn misfits.Despite some new quacky characters like Granny and the inclusion of extremely talented Dinklage, unfortunately the story didn't work for me and the excess of characters meant none were really focused on, as each of them compete for stage time. Overly contrived and lacking pace or charm this lazy instalment of 'Ice Age' drifts along waiting for end credits, cold in delivery, despite best attempts to warm up the audience (mostly through pretty standard Laurel and Hardy type jokes). Ultimately a sequel too much for what was already a strained idea. By far the least successful of the series, showing that this franchise should be heading for meltdown. Hopefully no more global events await the 'Ice Age', thus no further stories to be painfully churned out.",3,1,2,29 December 2012
Dark Shadows," Burton spirals into shadows
","A featurised reimagining of a TV soap opera, Tim Burton returns with a gruesome dark comedy about a XIXth Century vampire Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp), the entrepreneurial creator of a fishing empire in the town of Collinwood, who is unwittingly released from his eternal coffin prison. His bloody urges must be quenched, hence blood splatters, but still Barnabas is an eternal with honour and a strong attachment to family ties. Hence he decides to live with his descendants in his family mansion, populated by Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Michelle Pfeiffer), her daughter Carolyn (Chloë Grace Moretz), her brother-in-law Roger (Jonny Lee Miller), nephew David (Gulliver McGrath) as well as an assorted crowd of alcoholic psychiatrist Dr. Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter), caretaker Willie Loomis (Jackie Earle Haley) and babysitter Victoria Wnters (Bella Heathcote). The latter bearing a remarkable resemblance to Barnabas's long departed beloved and ultimate cause of his accursed state. To his surprise the Collins fortune has largely fallen into disregard, whilst the town's fishing business is currently overrun by Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green), the witch responsible for turning him into a vampire.Admittedly an immense Tim Burton fan 'Dark Shadows' is sadly his worst picture apart from 'Planet of the Apes'. Possibly revisiting the same actors has strained his ingenuity a bit, as well as caused the actors in force to go through familiar motions. As such Johnny Depp seems like a mold of other Depp-Burton characters, which is further not helped by the Depp and co's dry delivery of dry humour, which makes this dark tale thoroughly humourless. Knowing everyone in the cast is brimming with talent makes the overall dourness of proceedings even more striking. Depp seems emotionless beyond interest, Carter struggles to imbue any presence, Green is an empty if pretty shell, Haley barely registers, while Moretz comes off whiny and pretentious. The story wiggles around trying to bring together a coherent plot, but instead seems like a poorly glued together sequence of scenes of varying quality, which fail to either construct a story or instill any sense of affinity towards any on-screen character.Conversely Burton's sense of glorious Gothic atmosphere is at its best with set designs and rummaging shots quintessential stuff and possibly some of the best in his career. However thrown into such a detached and pointless story it just seems like an immense waste of possibilities.",4,15,26,11 January 2013
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Everybody has gone hoopla
","I gave the first two parts a 1 and a 3, placing them amongst one of the worst in film history. This new episode actually surprised and relatively impressed, hence the respectable 5. One more episode and I might just give Lucas a 7... :) This is undoubtedly the only of the 'new' Staw Wars episodes worth mentioning. But is it just me or has the taste of the majority of our populous hit the bottom? I guess in comparison with part I and II this film is 'a masterpiece', but how does it rank with any one of the original movies? Let me put it this way. Part I is Britney Spears. Part II Jennifer Lopez. Part III Madonna. Part IV-VI would then probably be Debussy, Tchaikovsky and Beethoven (in that order).The script is relatively sound, but the storyline has been forced into a two hour movie making it incoherent and seemingly forced. This film has probably the 'biggest holes' in its script in movie history, i.e. Anakin is asked to spy on Palpatine, but further in the movie Obi Van without any effort watched the cameras from inside Palpatines apartment to see 'what's up'.Hayden Christensen deserves a Raspberry for his impressive woodenness and lack of talent. Fortunately he does a bit better than in Episode II and at times when he doesn't open his mouth you can almost imagine that he is acting. On the other hand Evan McGregor does a fair job in his role, but I guess it is hard to act if R2-D2 does a better job acting than the main character of the film. Even so watching New Hope you can see that actually McGregor did a fine job trying to 'feel' the original Obi Van Kenobi. An almost memorable performances was given by McDiarmid, whilst absolutely forgettable were shoved in your face by a tragic Natalie Portman, a curiously unconvincing Christopher Lee (guess he got fed up of being killed at the beginning of the third part of a trilogy two years running) and a lacklustre Samuel L. Jackson.All in all the best actor is - yes, you've guessed it - Yoda! Frank Oz totally rulez in this movie. Apart from that he seems to have the best lines. It seems that all you need to do with a Lucas script to make it sound 'intelligent' is forget about grammar rules.CGI is mostly boring and fails to impress. The 'bad guys' ultimately suck and I believe the only fight worth watching is between Anakin and Obi Van. The rest is too fast, too 'ordinary' and ultimately unconvincing.All in all a fun watch somewhat redeeming George Lucas. But still he has once again proved that in fact he is one of the worst directors in Hollywood, earning himself a place alongside such names as Ed Wood and John Waters.",5,1,3,23 May 2005
Inception," Awesome storytelling, but bland underneath all the glitter
","Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is the best at what he does. And that's dream extraction. In a new form of commercial espionage Cobb is hired to steal out memories and secrets from within the dreamworld of hapless victims. There to assist him is Arthur (the brilliant and highly underrated Joseph Gordon-Levitt). Unfortunately one of the jobs goes awry and after unsuccessfully trying to steal blueprints from the mind of Saito (Ken Watanabe) they are forced to hide away from a backlash of their employers. Saito offers a way out - help him plant an inception (an idea) into the mind of Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy), the inheritor of a vast commercial empire. In return he offers a dream come true - a chance for Cobb to return to the States and rejoin his children.Since inception is much harder (deemed impossible by some) than extraction Cobb and Arthur have to mold together a new team: Ariadne (a very ordinary and forgettable Ellen Page) as an architect, builder of dreamworlds, Eames (Tom Hardy) as a thief, master of dream disguise and Yusuf (Dileep Rao) as the chemist, narcotics expert responsible for forcing people into a dream-state.I am quite amazed at the ranking of this movie making it one of the top films in movie history. Just goes to show how easy people torpedo a movie right to the top of rankings, if it offers something more than a normal blockbuster Michael Bay roller-coaster. Not to say that this movie isn't brilliant on many levels and it is exceptionally well told. In this aspiration to being a perfect movie things go wrong for Christopher Nolan - it loses it's human soul and feels like a noirish action movie devoid of emotion.First of all the world itself is too perfect. Unlike the visions in Ubiq by Phillip K. Dick (surprisingly similar storyline and I believe Nolan really should have made a shout out to Dick for the inspiration) the dreamworld is too pristine and controlled. It could be understood that the dreamworld is put in order by the architect, but apart from one sequence near the end when we are in Cobb's dream it never really feels unreal, surreal or ueberreal. Ergo it never really feels like a dream. The main culprit is Nolan himself who puts too many rules into the game, whilst it is quite obvious that dreams have no rules. In such a clear and collected environment the magic that rules in your subconscious dissipates. The story surmises that you can even calculate the flow of time in a dream, which is absurd given how messed up everything is in a real dream. I especially found it awkward, when Cobb states that when weird stuff happens in a dream your subconscious becomes aware of this and reacts by fighting off the source of 'weirdness' (like white cells). In my dreams it is entirely the opposite - weird and illogical are what define dreams and only after you awake do you actually start grasping that what you dreamt was wacky and out of place.I couldn't help but feel that Christopher Nolan set up all the rules of the game and made it very logical, even organised, just so he could have a catchy story and some cool action sequences (mainly including Arthur). The problem was that the whole movie tried too hard at organising the dreamworld, but put almost no focus at all to make it actually feel like a dream (for examples of how it is done I suggest 'The Beyond' by Lucio Fulci).What's worse is that Nolan fails to follow his own overly meticulous logic. We are told at one point that Arthur has two minutes left in his level of the dream. Within these two minutes he manages to have a fight, go downstairs, take explosives off the ceiling, go upstairs, tie 5 people together and push them about 100 metres to a lift, set explosives beneath the lift and than settle down to blow them up in two sequences. Oh! And he does this in a no gravity environment which makes running impossible. I absolutely despise it when someone sets up a motion of time only to ignore it when push comes to shove.Acting is top-notch, but the movie seemed to lack true emotion. Apart from one or two scenes 'Inception' packed no emotional wallop whatsoever, which given the story is quite a feat in itself. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a grownup tough-guy well, but I never really felt his emotional involvement with other characters and in truth he seemed disinterested with actually seeing his kids or his wife. I never really believed that he is the type of person, that would risk everything to be back home with his kids. The movie is also too cool for its own good and almost plays out like a 'Matrix' wannabee movie.I must also point out the absolutely appalling characterisation of Saito. In several scenes he was made up to be an old guy, but looked just ridiculous - like a flashback from bad 80s horror movies. Surprising that with such a budget and good overall look of the movie something as bad as this managed to creep through.All in all a very good roller-coaster ride with terrific dialogue and some nice performances (I loved Kan Watanabe and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who both stole DiCaprio's thunder). Nonetheless once you scrape of the surface not much left to behold and you can be left deeply wanting. A good summer blockbuster action movie, who tries to pretend to be more intelligent than it actually is.By the way: All the best sequences 'Inception' has to offer were shown in the trailer.",7,4,9,18 August 2010
Defiance," The Bielski Brothers
","During the II World War the Germans invaded the Belarussian soils, initiated there ultimate genocide, partly with the help of local civil servants. Jews are first to be stigmatised, thrown in throes into ghettos from which there is no return. The Bielski family of three peasant Jewish brothers: Tuvia (Daniel Craig), Zus (Liev Schreiber) and Asael (Jamie Bell) are amongst the very few to withstand oppression forming their own brigade in the local forests - aimed at protecting and defending what is left of their kin. Soon become almost folkloric heroes - Jews who fight, not just let themselves be slaughtered by the Nazi forces.Based on historical figures the story is far from meticulous, instead taking vast creative liberties, which - knowing the true history - seems almost a waste of a good story. Some aspects are 'Hollywoodized', but thankfully the backbone remains strong and never backs away from confronting morality during total war with that during peace. The most striking moment in the movie involves Tuvia having to assert his commanding position in the brigade, else all he constructed would be at risk. Reaction must be brutal and relentless, but the reality justifies even cold-blooded murder of one of his own. Such aspects are touched throughout, when severe choices must be made, and the Bielski brothers are sure to make them, a far cry from the more clear-cut actions of Arthur Schindler.In Poland the movie received some criticism for omitting the darker side of Bielski actions, inclusive of fighting Polish freedom militia, but honestly I had no issue with this (the 'russicized' English accents of characters and poor grammar of the tidbits of Russian were much more detrimental), as the brigade was portrayed perfectly as a self-serving and brutal unit devoted to saving those whom they protect, irrespective of external pain they bring. 'Defiance' ventures into grey areas of heroism, where the saviours are dabbled in blood and far from respectable, instead hateful, vengeful, but at the same time necessary. As the small group expands to a self-sustaining society living in the Belarussian woods, the stance of the brothers grows increasingly and justifiably uncompromising. Although the script attempts to whitewash the Bielskis by offering them lines such as 'We will only take from those who can afford it', making them into Robin Hood's seemed to trivialise them, instead it would have been better served to follow the logic of survival needs. The feature could have also probably done better without the trivial inclusions of forced dramaturgy or a big getaway with Bielskis figthing tanks, instead staying with the bare basics...Nonetheless 'Defiance' works best as a fiction, not as a recount of history. Here reading one of the monographes dedicated to the Bielski brothers would be better served.",6,3,4,30 December 2012
Sherlock Holmes," Holmes without mystery
","Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr) and his trusted swashbuckling limp-legged sidekick Dr Watson (Jude Law) are two peas of a criminological pod-unit in the XIX Century. Lightyears ahead in knowledge of the London bobbies (not to mention the outdated methods of CSI) they are an unstoppable detective force, that breaks down any mystery within a matter of minutes. They are essentially Batman and Robin of the XIX Century... just without the masks.One of their cases forces them to solve a mysterious series of murders committed on young women. The culprit is Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong), a member of a hidden sect and an learned adept of the black arts. Sherlock Holmes manages to foil Lord Blackwood just before he attempts to sacrifice another girl on his black altar of power. This sees Blackwood thrown into prison and prepping up for the noose.After ending this supposedly last big mission Sherlock Holmes locks himself away frustrated with his awesomeness and the boredom on the outside (he simplicity of cases to be offered is very frustrating). Hence he indulges into wacky experiments on animals (poor pouch), gets wasted regularly and throws himself into illegal back-alley brawls to waste the time. In the meantime Dr Watson finds himself a beautiful woman with whom he aims to spend the rest of his life with, thus creating a new sphere of everyday existence that no longer entails Holmes or solving crimes. Meanwhile Lord Blackwood is to be hanged...This is a movie I really wanted to like, but in the end I found it very wanting in most areas. Robert Downey Jr and surprisingly Jude Law both do a fine job in the respective parts and since they are key to the story you deftly find yourself asking why the movie constantly falls short of its promise.For one thing Sherlock Holmes has been transformed from a great detective into a supernatural superhero. The crimes are basically unsolvable with pure logic and only due to Holmes having superhuman cognizance and total awareness is he able to solve them. This leaves viewers to being basically receptacles of Holmes brilliance, but in no way are we capable of actually trying to solve the puzzle. We just quietly have to accept the solution presented on a silver platter. All in all this leads the movie about Sherlock Holmes focused on action, because it is devoid of any real mystery. In the end you just wait until Sherlock Holmes explains the plot point. No inner voice says 'Oh yeah! That's was so obvious!' or 'Wow! I never thought of that!'. After Holmes explains the non-mystery in this detective story its back to the no hold barred action.Secondly and surprisingly Guy Ritchie really fell short in the one place he used to excel in - the comedy department. Despite having such an excellent comedic actor in Robert Downey Jr all the jokes in this movie fall well short. Some of the gags are really quite brilliant, but even those don't even get a smirk out of you. The scenes are too rushed and have no real comedic feeling. Instead of building the joke and then letting it burst at the right moment all the jokes are basically leaking out of a punctured balloon. Adding to that most jokes are extremely clichéd and have a 'done that' feel to them. Its almost like rewatching 'Maverick'.Thirdly the movie has a comic-book feel to it, but not in the Christopher Nolan manner (good), but more in the direction of Batman and Robin. This movie really needs less punchlines and more dark dramatic scenes that bring a bit of seriousness to the movie.There are some very strong points to the movie. One of these is the beautiful presentation of old London, which really is jaw-dropping and the best such achievement of presenting a XIX century town in cinema history. I was also very impressed by three scenes, which really showed how talented a storyteller Guy Ritchie can be. One of these concerned Sherlock Holmes thinking out step by step what he would do to his opponent in a boxing match and then doing it in real time. The second was a sequence of blasts which really were very intense and gave the movie a dramatic punch. The third was a retrospective in which we find out what Sherlock Holmes did just minutes earlier. All three scenes are brilliantly shot and really added two stars to my general vote for this movie. Another 2 stars I give due to the fine duo performance by Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law. Unfortunately the director was not up to par to the acting.Just to end on a positive note: The movie definitely deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Cinematography.",6,3,5,16 January 2010
The Good Shepherd," Good story, good director, good actor - good shepherding
","A fictionalised retelling of the chaotic creative forces behind the emergence of the CIA told from the perspective of Edward Wilson alias Mother (Matt Damon) beginning from before the II World War and ending at the Bay of Pigs fiasco. Although all characters are fictional, they are all heavily inspired by actual people, while the attention to detail is striking. That said the main character, a poetry student turned into a secret agent, is mostly presented through a personal tale about dreams, love and life wasted in a tireless, but vivid pursuit of victory for his country and the ideals it carries with it. Or as Wilson states - in attempts to prevent big wars by engaging in small ones. Collateral damage is the loss of personal happiness: friends, family, morality, peace of mind. When Wilson's life closes a full circle the revelation comes that his biggest foe - the Soviet super-spy Ulysses - is actually his truest friend due to a mutual understanding of losses carried due to the line of work they have chosen.Miles away from Bourne territory, 'The Good Shepherd' takes a realistic turn, much in the manner of 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy', recounting a sombre, but bleak version of secret service. One deeply entrenched in paranoia of enemies hiding behind shadows and ever-growing distrust. This grim reality so strikingly portrayed in Robert de Niro's film never falters, Matt Damon playing a detached and emotionally reclusive person, rarely sharing warmth with anyone (apart from his lost love and only son), who increasingly falls into himself losing the last vestiges of humanity slowly dropping into self-loathing - by the end utterly despising himself for his deeds and life.Nonetheless 'The Good Shepherd' is a movie of epic scale and ambition, but one that fails to reach the heights, occasionally plodding, but despite almost never having a scene worth cutting (each movement, shot meaningful and expanding the world portrayed). Deposing of conventional gimmicks the movie is strongly character based with strong entries by Robert de Niro, Alec Baldwin, Tammy Blanchard, Billy Crudup, William Hurt, Angelina Jolie and John Turturro. However at almost three hours the somewhat melodramatic undertow coupled with the almost total lack of action or suspense does tend to drag, making it a tough watch in one take. All in all 'The Good Shephered' requires a good amount of focus, as a thought-provoking period piece worthy of wider acclaim.",8,1,2,19 September 2012
Centurion," Tedious and predictable affair
","Neil Marshall's attempted portrayal of the popular legend of the disappearance of the roman Ninth Legion is a tedious and predictable affair, which seems all too focused on splurting out CGI blood, than on captivating the thrill of the hunt and the adrenaline of the chase. In this version of the myth the entire Legion gets massacred by the Picts, whilst trying to capture their leader Gorlacon (Ulrish Thomsen). Ambushed they are swiftly cut down with only a handful of men surviving. Led by Centurion Quintus Dias they aim to escape from Pict territory in an attempt to return home. Unfortunately for them the Pict's vengeance knows no bound and they are followed by the beautiful and deadly mute Etain (Olga Kurylenko).The spectacular fail of this movie largely lies in the general misdirection. And this despite the actors, who are almost unanimously spot on and without any fault. Michael Fassbender especially has an unbelievable screen presence, which seems to make him destined for international film glory. Nonetheless the characters lack background and focus making the whole affair of their deaths rather disengaging.Warning signs can be caught very early on in the movie, as the historical drama starts off with eagle-eye landscapes of Northern Scotland with humongous corny credits overshadowing the pictures. Than we are treated with a mindgulfingly useless opening scene, where we see a lone man escaping through the mountains coupled with an appallingly daft voice-over (which gets even worse as the movie plods on). After this the movie moves back in time two weeks to 'where this all started', only to be back in the mountains scene within 10 minutes of the film (making the whole opening sequence superfluous). In the meantime we get a bloody visceral fight, where Picts slaughter a Roman stronghold with extremely red CGI blood splattering left and right.Naturally the above is just nitpicking, but the movie is a chaotic mess of some inspired scenes overshadowed by overall crappiness and very bad scripting. Something that not even the brilliance of Fassbender or the beauty of Kurylenko can overshadow. Not exactly knowing if this is a survival thriller, a historical drama or basically a glorious opportunity to hand out some in-your-face carnage the movie is all over the place. My standout scene of badness would have to be finding out that this is no ordinary band of survivors, but a band of unwilling supermen with a Greek cook with remarkable killing skills taking the cake. A close second would have to be a tribute to 'Return of the King' with the group of legionnaires running on foot for several days straight with almost no food or rest putting to shame all the modern day marathon runners...Surprisingly the movie is also unable to instill any sense of urgency or dread, although we have a group of people on foot escaping horsemen. Theorethically we know they are being chased, but Marshall can never seem to suggest scenes that start the blood pumping and keep you on the edge of your seat. Its quite a terrible achievement to shoot a movie about survival, but never being able to create an atmosphere of impeding death. Surprising given this is the same man who made the gripping 'Descent'.Just to be brutally frank I was also taken aback with Hadrian's Wall showing up in the final minutes of the movie, whilst the film is supposedly set in 117 AD.After the absolute (albeit enjoyable) muddle that was 'Doomsday' Neil Marshall craps out a real turd and seems to be on a downhill spiral, which hopefully will force him to get back to the basics.",4,2,6,22 January 2011
Prometheus," Ending beginnings
","After three decades of hit-and-miss Ridley Scott returns to what he did best - science fiction. With 'Alien' an undying classic and 'Bladerunner' arguably the best genre movie ever, high hopes were abundant and understandable for the Englishman's return to the source.'Prometheus' retcons the appalling two 'Alien vs Predator' movies, albeit the basic premise does throw us into recognisable Eric von Daniken territory of aliens creating life on Earth. Near the turn of the XXIst Century, after a couple of scientists, Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green), discover that murals from across the world present the same star system configuration, the almighty Weyland Corporation embarks on a cross-planetary mission to discover the truth behind the ancient scribblings boarding a ship adequately named Prometheus. During the long voyage they are overseen by David (absolute perfection by Michael Fassbender), an android with his own game plan, one programmed into him by his 'father' Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce). The ship itself is commanded by a brash, but enticing, Janek (portrayed favourably by Idris Elba), whilst the interests of the Weyland Corp. are looked after by Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron), a detached, rigid personae, but without the power craze of most corporate stools inhabiting the Alien universe.Fronted by the brilliance of Fassbender, Theron and Elba with a competent, if slightly underwhelming, performance of Noomi Rapace, 'Prometheus' manages to divert attention for a lot of its apparent shortcomings for much of the movie. Nonetheless when the character count drops at an increasingly rash pace with a feeling of widespread underdevelopment of said corpses, the multitude of flaws overpower even the most rabid Alien fan with a lazy, rushed story, that promises and drastically fails to deliver. Despite some initial promise, especially after a superb opening sequence of David passing time in the depths of space, whilst the rest of the crew stays in cryosleep, characters are thrown in by the bunch-load, rushed through the motions and by the end viewers fail to connect with any members of the crew, basically making them disposable and their subsequent deaths a meaningless chore.Part of the problem stems from the inherent attempt at detaching the story from the Alien itself and refocusing on the lore of the universe with the Engineers at the forefront (known more commonly to movie addicts as the 'disc jockey'). The severing off of ties seems too forcible, to an extent that implausibility is chosen as a path and even when 'an Alien' finally appears it isn't even 'the Alien', but some malformed re-imagining. Thrown into a movie reality, which likes to overcomplicate matters, Ridley Scott forgoes the more sensible simple route in connecting Prometheus with the 'Alien' universe, instead delving into a mutating cacophony of monsters, which lack semblance or reason. Ultimately he ventures into the absurdity of trying to avoid connect the dots between 'Prometheus' and 'Alien'.The script itself similarly seems to have undertaken some alien tampering, which piles on the mystery, mostly unresolved by the end credits, with several layers of plot holes and threadbare logical connections stinking up the conclusions. Scientists convinced that life on Earth was engineered, because they found a sequence of stars? And why would this sequence point to a military facility in the first place? A trillion dollar expedition jumping gung-ho into an alien compound without any protocol or line of command? Worms transported via sperm impregnating women, than fully growing like a foetus in the span of 15 hours? An alien facility covered with goo with nothing similar to living habitats? First flaming an infected individual to avoid him entering the ship, afterwards supplying entrance to a second such individual without any precautions? An Engineer hell-bent on murder after waking from 2,000 years of cryosleep (not to mention his psychotic attack after crashing the alien ship). The list endlessly goes on, as we are told to suspend belief in the script, which in many cases can be too much too bear.Nonetheless the set design, cinematography and special effects do help to gloss over many of the faults, suggesting that 'Prometheus' can be enjoyed purely as another decent popcorn flick. Given however expectations the disappointment is much larger, than that of watching another James Bond action packed thriller. As if to compensate for script shortcomings Ridley Scott does his best to deliver an eerie scenery coupled with some frightening, grisly moments, which verge on disgusting, but manage to instill an honest reaction from viewers.The movie ends rapturously with mayhem and destruction, but with promise of a further, hopefully better, instalment. Nonetheless with such a disinterested outing it begs to ask whether further parts will not further devour the magic of the Alien universe. It is punishment enough that Scott ventured into the origins of his classic with such a dramatically underwritten flawed script.Another big let-down is the promise of a otherworldly haunting legendary score fronted by the motif used in the 'Prometheus' trailer. Unfortunately the said music features only briefly, what's more in such a way that my girlfriend actually missed it. Instead the movie offers a pretty standard forgettable score, which highlights what could have been. The concept itself wasn't a bad one, but the terrible connections made by the script cry out for a more well-rounded, less flamboyant, Engineer holding the reigns.",5,6,8,27 July 2012
Taken 2," More of the same
","As the bodies of killed Albanian mafioso return home, the crime lord and father of one of the deceased Murad Krasniqi (Rade Serbedzija) is set on vengeance. When ex-special op Bryan Wills (Liam Neeson) brings his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) and daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) with him to a job in Istanbul, the family turn to be a perfect target for Krasniqi. Lenore and Bryan consequently find themselves captured / taken by the Albanian mafia, while Kim - with some help from her father - manages to escape and is soon on her way to rescue her parents. Despite his situation Bryan is in eternal self-control and nothing will come between him and his family's safety.'Taken' was a spectacularly successful action movie. And rightfully so, despite its flimsy sub-textual message about how unsafe the world is. Mainly due to the innovative Macchiavellan main character, who sets his goals and tanks his way to reach them. Despite not necessarily typecast Liam Neeson excels in this role, strong and ruthless, thus surprisingly becoming an action star at old age. 'Taken 2' basically rehashes the original, albeit basing it on an even more ridiculous plot, essentially set in typical Luc Besson style 'better not ask' realm of the illogical. Nonetheless Besson never fails at one thing: in supplying over-the-top intense action scenarios. Despite the second part too closely replicating the original and some flimsy directing the overall action is basically just as appealing, thus thrusting us to relive the experience in a new location and some alternate scenarios. Basically delivered more of the same as an obvious attempt to milk the cow, its sure to satisfy 'Taken' crazies, but won't go much further then there, as the story fails to build on the characters and expand into new directions. Once again the villains take a back seat (somewhat a shame as Serbedzija is severely underused as a potential great baddie), whilst Neeson dispatches and delivers his two damsels from distress.",5,0,0,18 January 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Only gets worse after a re-watch
","After taking the fall for Harvey Dent's tragic demise multi-millionaire Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale returns) turns into a semi-crippled recluse hiding out in his mansion, reducing his companionship to the faithful butler Alfred (Michael Caine). Gotham is now a city governed by the rigid Dent Act, which has cleared the streets of crime, but overfilled the prisons. With Batman now both obsolete and wanted the war on crime is seemingly won and even the hero Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) contemplates a hard earned rest, while still troubled by the Batman's sacrifice. That is until the up-and-commance of the masked mercenary Bane (Tom Hardy voiced by Sean Connery) topples the facade and awakes Wayne's past demons. Batman reemerges - together with Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) karate high-heeling and street-cop Blake (Joseph Gordon-Lewitt) as the moral fibre of the city.The masterful 'The Dark Knight' together with a relatively spectacular career spanning from 'Memento', 'Batman Begins' and 'Inception' the Nolanite army has become a powerful force (as proved by the ridiculously high IMDb ranking of this movie). Despite apparent flaws, idiosyncrasies and an inexplicable flush of 'Batman and Robin' reminiscent cheesy one-liners, the ending to the trilogy has garnered an astounding 8,8 rating. Much is owed to the brilliance of the previous two outings of Nolan's Batman, especially to the mind-warping villainous and already legendary Heath Ledger Joker (not toppled by the slightly bombastic and naive ending of the boat conundrum). With the whole film world in awe everyone wanted and expected the Batman trilogy to end as a masterpiece.Alas - it was not to be. Naturally the final part lacked the same captivating evil-doer as Joker and no one expected anything of the same magnitude to be possible. Although Hardy as Bane does a great job making himself a credible and deadly opponent to Batman, he lacks the same story impact (unable to carry the movie as Ledger did in his outing), which is even more diminished as he is inexcusably downgraded and lazily disposed of before the denouement. Therefore it was quite apparent that the weight of the final part of Nolan's Batman will lay strongly on the shoulders of the plot and story, which would have to outdo the already sturdy scripts in the first two outings. Unfortunately for the Nolan brothers their creative genius is vastly overrated, as they embark onto their final Batman adventure with a nonsensical script ridden with holes as vast as an exploding stadium and several iffy performances (featuring the most laughable death scene in living memory). These flaws are glossed over by the technical and narrative brilliance of Christopher Nolan, who manages to bring together a pretty looking picture with framing to die for. However instead of coherence Nolan goes for the effect factor, regardless of logical bearing (like the visually engulfing, but literally dumbfounded police squad fist fight).After giving the movie a second chance, the incessant problems instead of receding, start overflowing and expanding (instead of one sore thumb down your other thumb starts feeling numb). Essentially 'The Dark Knight Rises' does best as a pure action flick, even though sequences are rather sparse and interlope with many dramatic sequences of varying valour. Nolan's picture is mostly dissatisfying on a cerebral level - various moral questions appear, but function mostly as superficial and purely instrumental plot points. Given Nolan's capabilities a more focused look into the morality of the Dent Act or the underpinnings of the nod to the Occupy Wall Street movement would have been very welcome. Instead Nolan offers us outtakes of cheesy superhero one-liners like 'This isn't a car' and ventures in soapy melodrama with a side order of overcooked pathos. Not quite Michael Bay's 'Transformers' or 'Batman and Robin', but much closer in class to those productions than to the previous Nolan Batman movies or Tim Burtons comiccy gems.",4,5,11,26 November 2012
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," Surprisingly almost as good as the original
","After the bore fest that was Ice Age 2: The Meltdown I went to the cinema with very low expectations, a lot of popcorn and an intention to bad-mouth the movie throughout the screening. At the same time I was dreading the laughter of young kids and hoping that it would be at least mildly entertaining.I must admit the movie came by surprise. Sure. It has it faults. Indiana Jones action scenes are overcooked and uninspiring. The new character addition of Buck is just irritating even though he helps move the plot along (the character concept is just poor). The premise of dinosaurs is idiotic (but then again this is a cartoon...). The love affair of our lovable little Scrat is just tiresome and a lot less of the munchkin actually means more.But all in all the characters suddenly began to click again. To some extent this is thanks to exploring new areas of their relationship, instead of just rehashing the first part, as The Meltdown did. Manny is about to expand his family and is expecting a child with the mammoth/opus Ellie. This disrupts the status quo in the weird little family that has been created. Diego the sabre-tooth has been getting weary of the vegetarian settled down life and is ready to move to new hunting grounds. In the meantime it occurs to Sid that the changes about to come will make Manny more focused on his new baby, whilst with Diego about to leave he will be left to fend for his lone self.This leads to Sid wanting to create a family of his own... An opportunity occurs when he finds three eggs buried deep in the snow.Funny, smart, if at times repetitive. Overall the characters are once again lovable and energetic, something sorely missed in the second outing of the team. If this is where Ice Age is heading I can sure handle another serving.",7,1,3,16 July 2009
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Like a dumbed-down Almodovar movie
","This is quintesensial Almodovar. I've always noticed how much in common the Woody Allen and Pedro Almodovar have in common and no picture conveys it as well as when Allen goes into his Spanish counterparts territory filming a movie in Barcelona of all places.Unfortunately for Allen the comparison between the two doesn't speak too well of the New Yorker as the plot, the dialogue and the script in general seems to be taken from a forgotten Almodovar drawer full of his artistic failures.Two best friends - the proper Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and the adventurous Christina (Scarlett Johannson) go on the ultimate holiday to Barcelona, Spain. This is to be their last adventure before Vicky gets married to the ultimate catch - rich and well bred Doug (Chris Messina). Touring Barcelona the two come upon a seemingly narcissistic famous painter Juan Antonio Gonzalo (Javier Bardem), who offers them a proposal only a fiery Spaniard could make - fly with me to Oviedo, where the three of us will have luscious sex. Christina is quick to agree, but Vicky just comes for the company. One thing leads to another and...At times funny the movie watches more like a light comedy. But there is no real flair to the movie or sense of purpose with a pathetic performance from constantly lip-playing Scarlett Johannson. A stand-out performance is made by the Almodovar actress Penelope Cruz, but this is far from one of her better roles, especially in Spanish cinema.All in all a movie I would only recommend to die-hard Woody Allen fans, but apart from that it is essentially forgettable.",4,2,6,7 July 2009
Saving Mr. Banks," A spoonful of sugar too much
","Another 'inspired by a true story' movie surefiring its way to this years Academy Awards, tells the story of the odd cat-fight between P. L. Travers (Emma Thompson), author of the famed Mary Poppins books, and Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) en route to the production of the live action feature. After 20 years of constantly pressuring the author on selling her book to Disney, Travers finally reluctantly agrees given her financial plight. However, she stipulates the need for her to have control over the end product with script authority and veto power. This creates tension with the scriptwriter and the musicians (especially given Travers is reluctant to agree to any music at all). With this uneasy relationship slowly boiling over it seems like the picture is destined for failure. However, the experiences of the writer bring back painful memories of her youth, which give insight as to the origins of her beloved flying nanny.The movie juxtaposes the prickly P.L. Travers with the overbearing optimism of Disney and the Californian sunshine. Watching Disney especially, presented as a jovial and considerate person, as opposed to the troubled Travers, managed to arouse my inner grumpiness, cheering on the Australian-born children author in her endeavour of being an full-fledged pain in the buttocks to the animation studio and her employees. Ultimately somewhat let down that Travers lets herself be corrupted by the twinkle toes of Hollywood, especially with the externally honest, internally two-faced Disney in mind. Thus, I must admit I failed to catch on to the rampaging mirthfulness of the movie, instead finding myself irritated by the positive light being shone on the American way of being, as contrasted to the straight-faced jabbing sardonicism of the foreigner.Emma Thompson remains a shining light throughout, in thick or thin, in drama or comedy, delivering arguably the best and most complete performance of the year (regardless of sex). Beautifully layered thanks to her starkly English attitude as well as some very well intertwined flashbacks, much can be forgiven and forgotten. Nonetheless, when Disney slowly seems to be winning the fight for the heart, I found myself pulling back emotionally at the insincere American entirety of the movie. Especially given the presentation of Walt Disney in this movie is a far cry from reality, sugar-coating a man who deserves no such accolades. The internal conflict that drives the movie slowly irritates, with the only emotional impact owing to the sidelined back-story of P. L. Travers and exceptional acting by Thompson.",5,23,37,6 January 2014
Fantastic Mr. Fox," The Erractic Mr. Fox
","The base for 'The Fantastic Mr. Fox' is the beloved children's book by British iconic author Roald Dahl. As in the original the film focuses on life ordeals of Mr. Fox and his family. The premise for the story is Mr. Fox's stealing spree of chickens, ducks, turkeys and cider, which make him top of the most wanted list of despicable farmers Boggis, Bunce and Bean. Unlike in the original instead of a fox basically trying to cater and feed his family in this outing we have a typical dysfunctional Wes Anderson family, whose papa is addicted to stealing. Not to mention that his son is an irritating little bugger, whilst you also get a key new addition of kick-boxing super-athlete cousin Kristofferson . Oh! And did I mention that all the animals in the forest are Americans (which really makes the movie jar throughout, as the characters are cool hipster forest animals). Meanwhile the farmers remaining outstandingly British.I can and will forgive the scriptwriter (Wes Anderson) for basically taking a dump on the whole sense, premise and feeling of the story. I will in this case treat 'Fantastic Mr. Fox' as something totally unrelated to the book (which remains outside of Anderson's capabilities to ever achieve as long as he resolves to sticking to his gameplan).I will not however gloss over the fact, that the animation has neither the humour and wit of Nick Park, the intelligence and unforgettable charm of Hayao Miyazaki or the heart of Pixar. The only thing that Anderson has is... quirkiness. I have never seemed to be able to understand the almost unanimous critic appeal of Wes Anderson (albeit his cult adoration thankfully does not seem to extend too far outside American borders). I never found his movies profound, if anything to me they reeked of pretentious artsy drivel (including the underwhelming 'Rushmore'). Additionally Wes Anderson seems to be incapable of directing movies with likable leads - even in 'The Fantastic Mr. Fox' the charmless title character played by George Clooney sounds like a George Clooney with a persistent headache on Valium impression. The only actor that manages to ring true is Meryl Streep as Ms. Fox, but her role is relatively insignificant and secondary. As usual I also found the lines nowhere as deep, meaningful and brilliant as Anderson believes them to be. Actually they mostly felt flat and written by an adolescent during Sunday school. Whats worse the add-on quirky jokes are tragically unfunny and I found myself battling to even produce a single smirk during this ordeal.The worst thing is however that I have no idea who the target audience is. The plot plods along at snails pace and the characters are whiny, cajoling, boring and unlikeable with a unrelenting need to spit out inappropriate inside jokes (not to mention they are constantly 'cussing' with standout lines like: ''This is going to be a total cluster-cuss for everyone'. What the cuss?). Additionally they are hard to understand due to seemingly inherent articulation flaws. Not to mention that some of the animation (one of the few brilliant things in the movie) is eerie, creepy and frightful in a very inappropriate manner. That basically means the whole base audience of kids is not suited for this visualisation of the children's book making it an obscure attempt at mainstream by Wes Anderson, which easily explains the poor sales of the movie.If we are to believe that this is an animation for adults, than well... I will never jump onto the Wes Anderson band waggon, even though I'm quite sure all the negative feedback I will get for my above review. I find Anderson's films unmemorable, unimaginative and tiresome dragging on like a snail with rheumatism. Basically a animation soap-opera.I would really love to catch the drift and hop on-board the Anderson love-boat, but with this dreadfully boring animation of a brilliant children's book this revelation will have to be put on hold. Until than count me out of this adoration.",3,31,66,17 January 2011
Moonrise Kingdom," An Anderson movie for his fervent enemies
","To start off with an honest admission. I loathe Anderson's movies. Absolutely despise and have an innate repulsion to his ditsy kooky worlds. But despite this and in spite of my judgemental approach I found myself oddly enticed by 'The Moonrise Kingdom', Anderson's finest work and most non-condescending, broad vision of filmaking.Anderson's sensibilities seem best attached to childhood sensibilities and world-view (although by no way am I implying this is a children's film, more like a redux of sorts into our perception of life when we were young), the island setting off the coast of New England seamlessly conspires to create a fantastic outlet for a wacky love story. Set in the 1960s it tells a story of an orphaned boy scout Sam (Jared Gilman), who finds a soul-mate in the local outcast Suzy (Kara Hayward). Together they plot an adventure and escape deep into the island to find freedom and themselves in the process. Hot on their heels are pedantic scout master Ward (Edward Norton), the local police officer captain Sharp (Bruce Willis) and Suzy's parents, the Bishops (Bill Murray and Frances McDormand).'The Moonrise Kingdom' is bogged down knee-deep in references to movies (and general culture) of the era, thus a cinephile goldmine for those interested. Anderson gives his respectful nod not only at classic features like 'Badlands', 'The Shining' or the obvious 'Shawshank Redemption', but also is incessantly self-referential (my biggest issue with the movie). Of superb appeal is the widely fantastic soundtrack based on obscure titles from back in the day, adding to the fantastical setting of nonsensical and magical. For once (and only once) I found myself unprovoked to discard the inherent quirkiness, instead to grasp the fleeting playfulness of the story and its characters. Not yet an Anderson convert, but now at least bound to give him the benefit of the doubt. A charming and re-watchable piece of escapist glee. Honestly - never though I would ever say something like that about an Anderson film...",7,0,0,11 October 2013
Flight," Must watch for opening flight
","After a traditional drinking binge aeroplane pilot Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington) and Katerina Marquez (Nadine Velazquez), enter on board their morning flight. When defective machinery causes the malfunctioning plane to go into a tailspin, Whip heroically and miraculously averts a catastrophe saving almost the all passengers and crew. Nonetheless this event causes inevitable blow-back, when it becomes apparent that Whip was flying under influence, thus complicating the entire issue, when all persons potentially responsible attempt to avoid responsibility...'Flight' is a movie to be watched for two reasons. The one is the spectacular opening crash ordeal, which is arguably the best action sequence of the year, an enticing, dreadfully thrilling occurrence, bound to have everyone on the edge of the seat. This is further underlined by the standout performance by Denzel Washington, a pilot drunkard with skewed perceptions of responsibility and self-control. Nonetheless the plot attempting to hold the proceedings together falls apart all too easily, tacked together with a spit of contrition and lack of conceptual cohesiveness.Nonetheless 'Flight' remains a hard-hitting drama and engulfing character study of a flawed hero, a coke sniffing drunkard, but with the sense and skill to become a man of the hour. Does the drinking somehow undermine her moment of heroism? Even if it does, how far can it whitewash his drinking issues? Masterfully cast down into a conflicted grey area by Denzel Washington (every movement and tick conveys emotion, showing just why he is one of today's top actors), the story manages to show how contradictory a person can be, when the public hero has inner demons which he is unable to cast away. Nonetheless the ending seems to suggest that while saving the plane was pure instinct and skill (courage under fire), true courage comes from owning up to your faults, taking responsibility for all that transpired, both the good and the bad. The path to this isn't easy, as he has to dispose of the cover of lies, which has clouded his own reason, just like in any alcoholic who must first accept that - despite his claims - he doesn't control his addiction. The layered and well presented acceptance of guilt (even if somewhat overly long presentation) often times fails to mesh smoothly with the plot of the ongoing investigation, at times bringing in characters and situations seemingly imported from other movies (such as the stylistically incompatible appearance of John Goodman), thus creating a conflicting tension, which does however nicely bring about comeuppance (even if a bit garrulous). With the power of the story strongly imbued on Washington's face, but with lacking conviction surrounding this astounding performance the overall payoff fails to be as hard-hitting as it should be.",7,2,3,10 February 2013
Rear Window," My favourite Hitchcock movie
","A mild-mannered wartime photographer finds himself immobile, stuck in a wheelchair, due to a broken leg. Overawed by the lack of adventure, L.B. 'Jeff' Jefferies (James Stewart) opts for the only available form of entertainment - peeping on his neighbours and watching the ongoings from his rear window. Soon he finds himself fascinated with the quirky people, who surround him. He witnesses an odd couple sleeping on a balcony, who send their dog on walks by lowering him in a basket, wryly smiles seeing the closed curtains of a newly-wed couple or spies on a beautiful ballet dancer just opposite him.His fiancée Lisa Carol Fremont (Grace Kelly) remains critical of Jeff's behaviour, but decides to remain silent, as the relationship has seemingly become strained with Jeff unsure of whether the fashion-obsessed women is a right fit for an adventure-crazed photographer. Thus Lisa takes an interest in her boyfriend's newly found hobby. When the bed-bound wife of one of Jeff's neighbours suddenly 'moves away', a new whole area of obsession starts to form, as he suddenly suspects foul play - murder! A timely classic and a must watch for anyone who needs to know the basics of crafting a thriller. The action itself is confined mostly to one room, whilst the camera peers out of the window to observe the world outside. Despite this lack of dynamism, 'Rear Window' builds a superb atmosphere, slowly straying from the hilarious off-the-wall neighbours and focusing onto a mystery, which for the majority of the movie we are unsure as to whether or not the whole crime is purely in the mind's eye. Even the acting of an bygone era, works perfectly creating a sense of both confinement and suspense, where J.B.'s darkly comedic character is as immaculate as ever. Add to this the lovable duplicity of Liza, who stands by her man, never doubting him outright and only in the last scene do we receive a true sense of the brilliance of her character - the initially simplistic and limited woman, who gains depth throughout, but the true coup de grace of Hitchcock's brilliant movie derives from this scene, which forces us to rethink the whole movie from the point of view of Liza, arguably the truly key protagonist of the movie.",9,0,1,23 December 2013
The Purge," Purging Rationality
","The new founding fathers of a dystopian Unites States of America have reconstructed the country into a controlled society, which lets out all its rage, frustration and mischief on one deadly night. For 12 hours each year the Purge takes place: a free-for-all no-rules-apply vent for the angry masses, where they can rape, pillage and even murder with no remorse, while the police, firemen and emergency rescue facilities are closed. This is supposed to cleanse the society and thus guarantee a harmonious continuity of the system.James Sandin (Ethan Hawke) reaps the profit from the Purge installing security systems for the rich and well-off, while the poor, helpless and homeless bear the full wrath of societal scorn, letting their blood to fertilise this renewed America. Together with his wife Mary (Lena Headey), son Charlie (Max Burkholder) and daughter Zooey (Adelaide Kane) they prepare for the Purge readying for house lock-down. However inadvertently the compassionate young Charlie decides to save a homeless stranger (Edwin Hodge) from being bloodied out by murderous mobs. This in turn brings the whole family at risk as a gang of youthful snobs led by Polite Leader (Rhys Wakefield) intend to discard of the waste by any means necessary.'The Purge' is ruled by the gimmick, and much like with movies such as the cult 'Battle Royale' the rationality of the whole concept is glossed over. Once the stage is set you shouldn't really enquire into the likelihood of the whole premise, accept it and try to venture into the places it takes. Nonetheless James DeManaco's surprise hit stumbles into the story with such a heavy-handed low-brow approach to social commentary, that you find yourself observing the punctured holes leaking drudge onto the story.For one thing as much as humans are prone to vent up frustration, but the concept that once every year people would en masse turn into mindless psychopaths is a bit far-fetched (although feasible given the state condones this as a necessity). Nonetheless above all humans are motivated by greed, not spite and pointless violence, so truth to the matter would be that mobs first and foremost would utilise the Purge not to cover the streets with blood, but to advance their monetary standing - hence robberies, arson and various other crimes would dominate above all. Glaringly contradictory to human nature it comes somewhat of a laugh, when the motivation behind the introduction of the Purge is the supposed unstoppable rampant crime on American streets, which - lets face facts - isn't anywhere near the boiling point of the 1970s. But enough premise bashing...And enter plot-hole bickering. The hugest issue with story lays in the irregularities to logic that litter the script, the main issue lying with the forms of protection utilised by the fabulously wealthy residing in Sandin's cut-off community. When the houses enter into lock-down the immediate question hits with glaring obviousness: I understand that turning your house into a impenetrable steel-enforced fortress may be a decent first line of defence, but honestly - whatever happened to the age-old panic room? Other faults are less striking, mostly minuscule issues, but this one just immediately throws you out a viewer of the presented reality into the guise of the cynic critic.Overly meticulous? Should just let it go? Possibly, but still the ultimate tension and narrative fail to entice, as what starts of as an intriguing concept quickly steers away from an attempt to present and evaluate the dichotomous society and flings us straight into another generic home invasion movie with some laboriously attached social critique taped on. When the story fails to evolve away from the baseline obvious and the tension never builds up to anything worth anything other than a snore, a few twists are introduced to liven up proceedings with the subtlety of an ox (with some atrocious acting to self-destruct the pay-off all the more successfully). Surprisingly, despite the family being locked up in the house for most of the runtime of the movie we fail even to get a feel of the Sandins, almost faceless protagonists despite the presence of Ethan Hawke (who unfortunately delivers a plastic performance).Not recommended. But still a workable premise to work off of could garner a much better sequel.",4,0,0,12 October 2013
Godzilla," Garguatuan delivery of monsters, lax drama
","Gareth Edwards reinvigorates Godzilla on the American soil with his gargantuan portrayal of the famed post-nuclear monster, which retreads the origins of its fame and imprints them within this big-budget modern-day extravaganza. Even Godzilla itself diverts form the T-Rex blunder of the 1998 movie and captures the big-footed original monster of the Japanese series in CGI perfection. However Godzilla is not the sole malevolent creature to appear in this movie, as the famed mega-predator enters into a all-destructive chase for another humongous kaiju (or MUTO as it is defined in this movie) with a devastating EMP blast. In the midst of this epic battle humanity and the army struggle to contain the destruction, while Edwards, like in 'Monsters', struggles to imprint human drama as a backdrop to events. Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston), a scientist at a nuclear power plant, loses his wife (a brief cameo by Juliette Binoche) to one early attack by the MUTO, thus becoming obsessed with the monster and the encompassing government cover-up brought in effect to hide the truth. As a character and as an actor Cranston is a short-lived emotional highlight in the story, which unfortunately soon loses traction with what feels like his premature death. This loss leaves us battling for interest in the lax son of Joe, demolitions expert soldier Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), who is a bland shell of a character, generic to the extreme, effectively keeping us disinterested in the story and leaving us hoping for a fast-forward to more massive destruction of metropolis. MUTO expert Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) and the wife-nurse Elle Brody (Elizabeth Olsen) are equally unengaging, dull as a dishwater and forgettable. The overall lack of character imprint into the story coupled with audacious coincidences littering the movie, make the drama inert and feel like an important position on Edwards' checklist of blockbuster movies components.I did however immensely like as Edwards slowly builds tension, initially only showing massive bones of the leviathan creatures or just the aftereffects of their presence, then only sifting through bits and pieces of destruction through news reports, whilst avoiding showing the battles between Godzilla and the MUTOs, leaving space for total San Francisco annihilation for the final act. Nonetheless with the lack of emotional engagement 'Godzilla' feels like but a mild success, a poor dramatic relative to the much more successful giant-bashing 'Pacific Rim' feature of 2013, who has a superb mix of absurdity, pathos and general character formation that is vastly superior to Edwards effort.",5,4,7,2 June 2014
Looper," Time loops
","In the distant future time travel will have been invented, but its implication were catastrophic in scale. Thus quickly banned by governments they only function underground, especially as part of crime syndicates utilising the invention to commit murders: people are sent back in time to be then disposed off by special killers called loopers. Controlled by Abe (Jeff Daniels), these renegade contract killers have agreed to their profession with the awareness that in an uncertain future they will have to cap off their future selves for the last golden paycheck. When Joe (a disfigured Joseph Gordon-Levitt) fails to kill off Old Joe (Bruce Willis) he becomes marked by Abe's foot soldiers. Meanwhile Old Joe aims to avert the rise of the murderous Rainmaker by killing him as a child, thus saving his beloved wife from death.The whole premise is pretty far-fetched, while the implications of time travel are best summarised by Abe: 'This time travel crap, just fries your brain like a egg...' Best not ask, best not try to logically tie yourself around it and furthermore just avoid searching for plot holes, because you will sure as hell not be disappointed. Internal logic of time travel mechanics or narrative are shady at best, while occasionally falling over itself. A simple example: At the start of the movie we are told that victims are sent back in time, because future technology makes it impossible to hide murders. But this does not stop mafia from killing off Old Joe's wife...Putting those idiosyncrasies away, best stick with the story itself, which... honestly isn't as captivating and innovative as has been claimed. Whereas the movie itself is pretty engrossing, the narrative well strewn, the overall concept fails to juggle the ideas included. When the plot starts becoming somewhat obvious, 'Looper' lacks enough emotional tension to make it a true classic, and the general lapses make it a vastly inferior movie to 'Brick', Rian Johnson's breakthrough debut. Action sequences are nicely limited in scale and thus avoid becoming tiresome main events, instead allowing focus on the story (another point for special effects, which compliment the feature without overawing). Internal demons and conflicts with one self take on a whole new meaning, as perspectives of the young and old Joe vary, thus making life priorities diverge. The face-to-face encounter and conflict it causes offered such prolific possiilities to explore, but sadly young and old Joe rarely interact with each other. The potential for contemplative sci-fi was there, but somewhere along the way the possibility of venturing in depth was lost, when the somewhat intriguing, but also distracting, side plot of whether or not killing the child Hitler is justified takes center stage and the concept of self-conflict ends up unrealised. Thus the movie lacks emotional coherency, with dramatic aspects flustering all around and failing to pinpoint the internal turmoil, which is taking place. Some original ideas are floating around, but I personally wasn't in awe, partly due to the awkward focus of attention on Gordon-Lewitt's makeup.The facial characterisation of Joseph Gordon Lewitt was a extreme put-off, so that he would like more like 'a young Bruce Willis', but the end result was irksome and distracting, making him somewhat disfeatured and severely inhibiting his acting capabilities. At best the whole move was pointless, proving a flustering influence on viewing. Nonetheless 'Looper' was undeniably a joyous adventure with an overall enticing story.",7,1,4,30 December 2012
The Hangover Part III," Half-Full Circle
","Events of the past two parts of the franchise come around to a close in what is (hopefully) the final movie of 'The Hangover' series, when misfit criminal Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) escapes Bangkok prison (with a reference to 'Shawshank Redemption') bringing a dramatic blow-back from events past. After the death of his father Alan (Zach Galifianakis) is to be sent to an intervention camp to deal with his latent adulthood issues (worsening after being 6 months off of medication). Accompanied by Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms) and Doug (Justin Bartha), the Wolf Pack is out for one last ride. Unfortunately for them drug-lord Marshall (John Goodman) holds them personally responsible for the misgivings of Mr. Chow, who several years ago in Vegas stole 20-odd million worth of gold from him. Marshall takes Doug hostage and tasks the remaining threesome with recovering the gold. Or else...Thankfully the screenwriters decided to ditch the concept of retreading worn down paths of the original story (as was the key issue with the Bangkok excursion), instead tying together the knots of previous parts to deliver a new take on the matter. Unfortunately however the comedy is totally lost on the way and save for a few forced laughs, this is the most unfunny and laboured effort of a sequel I can remember. Most of the cast just seem feed up with the characters, playing them to minimal effect, only Jeong and Galifikalis milking it out the best they can. Cooper especially seems to have moved on and sleepwalks through the movements of a story lacking invention and punchlines. At times a couple of ideas and jokes manage to work, but overall it lacks freshness and even Bangkok outdoes it in terms of humour. Which unfortunately speaks volume as to how poor this final part of the series is. Hopefully this means good riddance for further follow-ups, as evidently the joke has run its term.Funnily enough the only truly spot-on part of the movie comes with the end credits, when a wedding ends in another bout of debauchery and memory loss with some hysterical consequences. A suitable ending to the series, which probably should have never transgressed past the original in the first place.",3,1,2,24 September 2013
The Thin Red Line," Every Man Fights His Own War
","Released at about the same time of the patriotic flag-waving 'Saving Private Ryan' Terence Mallick delivers a perfect opposite - the ultimate anti-war movie. Set in the II World War during the Pacific Campaign, particularly the Guadalcanal battles, 'The Thin Red Line' (of Heroes) tells a story of courage and bravery of single people, soldiers, but still manages to deliver a poignant message on the pointless savagery of war.The battles themselves, blood and death, is juxtaposed to the beauty of nature, its godly emanation. Nature's tranquillity is all-engulfing peace saturating the senses - dominant over the trivial faults of human kind and their pointless wars. The soldiers are invariably overpowered by its force, its dreamy tranquillity, speechless towards the captivating power, as if imbued by the touch of God. Conversely the bloody carnage seems trivial, detrimental and almost like a rot on the earth, which destroys the harmony, introduced a scourge. When the gunfire and blasts blast through the area god's creation is not left untouched and you can almost feel the jungle and wildlife bleeding due to the ongoing war, watching on as the devastation occurs leaving the surrounding innocence tainted.This does not mean that heroism and valour is non-existent, but each man fights and wins by his own strengths. Honour is not found in victory - highlighted brilliantly when the American forces capture Japanese fortifications only to come across an undernourished and sickly opposing army, which surrenders without much quarrel. The enormous strategic victory rings hollow to the individual as Americans observe the protruding bones of captured enemy soldiers, finding little glory or honour in conquer. The decedents themselves - generals, politicians - come about in the form of Lt. Col. Gordon Tall (Nick Nolte), who is ruthless and goal-oriented, with little interest in the well-being of his pawns (American soldiers), instead focused on tactical and strategic aims. This is a brutal campaign, where both sides of the divide were lacking in supplies, thus giving way to dehumanisation.War is exposed here as something truly banal. Heroism is present, irregardless of whether it is misconceived or pointless, glory is only found in actions of single men, when they conquer there own frailties and are capable to sacrifice their lives for fellow soldiers. Naturally the big picture of the II World War is that American were fighting for a just cause. But that still does not change the matter-of-fact reality for simple soldiers. Hence Terence Mallick walks away from exposition of the battle of Guadalcanal, instead introvertly pointing his camera towards the thin red line of heroes (the soldiers). Amongst the blood-shed we hear them speak of their fear, longings, doubts and perceptions. Thankfully avoiding over-narrating as in the abysmally prolonged 'The New World', typical Terence Mallick touches are easily distinguished, such as spacious encapsulating shots by John Toll and whispered voice-overs. His typical whispering narrative is also present, but during fights a more sombre brutal reality overpowers the dreamy focus. The voice-over is aptly more suitable and thus more purposeful than in most Malick movies, functioning as something of a diary for soldiers who spill their emotions through the camera lens. This leads to diverting attention from the battle itself and focusing on the war which occurs within each human being, when they try to make sense of it all, combat the encapsulating insanity, fight their own fears and ultimately decide their fate.Featuring a star-studded cast of James Cavaziel, Sean Penn, Adrien Brody, John Cusack, Elias Koteas, Nick Nolte, John C. Reilly, Woody Harrelson, Jared Leto, John Travolta, George Clooney, Nick Stahl, Thomas Jane... and a host of other big name actors, which role in the movie was cut during editing. Despite the latter the movie still clocks in at over three hours. With almost every minute of the experience worth the time and effort.A brilliant movie by the beloved American director, which is in no way trivialised by the pretentious and oblivious ending.",9,2,4,11 January 2013
Pineapple Express," Immature bundle of fun
","Dale Denton (Seth Rogen) is your mild mannered process deliverer - handing over subpoenas, when you least expect it. Being so efficient at what he does he has lots of time to do stuff he really likes... making out with his 8 years younger high-school girlfriend or getting high. Constantly getting high. Fortunately for him Saul Silver (James Franco), a well serviced drug dealer with access to the bestest dope on the market, has a lopsided idea of them being best mates. Being such good buds Saul allows him to purchase the the bestest of the bestest - Pineapple Express... only Saul and Dale in the whole of the city have access to this dopest dope.Unfortunately for Dale, whilst trying to service a subpoena to Ted Jones (Gary Cole), a local drug king, he witnesses a murder with a police officer (Rosie Perez) as an accomplice. Running from the scene he leaves some Pineapple Express behind... and Ted Jones is the dealer...Seth Rogen is really on a high and scripting costarring 'Pineapple Express' is another building block to being an all-time great comedian. Each of his movies is fresh and different. To some extent a pastiche of used motifs Rogen moves around various types of comedic subgenres. Each time he adds something specific to each of them molding out an almost groundbreaking comedy.This movie is no exception. Yes, it is immature, at times dumb and hardly ever stays consistent moving from one mode to another... but it is just freakishly funny. Surprisingly James Franco steals the show from Rogen, but the chemistry between them is great. In the end we end up with a movie somewhere between Cheech/Marin and Tarantino territory (going very close to the almost perfect Hot Fuzz). Recommended watch if you don't mind a mix of stupidity, abrasiveness and genius...",8,4,9,19 March 2010
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," Running the circuit
","The penguins and monkeys construct a flying machine only to venture out to Europe, where they indulge into a Monaco grifting binge at casinos. Alex (Ben Stiller), Marty (Chris Rock), Melman (David Schwimmer) and Gloria (Jada Pinkett Smith) left behind still dream about returning to the Big Apple, hence inexplicably plan to catch up with their friends going ape on European soil. After swimming across the Mediterranean in true cartoonish fashion, the quartet plus King Julien and his entourage, happen upon the ingenious penguin / monkey brigade, but cause havoc in the meantime. This causes sinister French animal catcher Captain Chantel DuBois (Frances McDormand), dreaming of capturing the head of the ultimate prize: a lion, to be called into action. After a courageous escape the expanded group of animals catch a ride with a decrepit circus full of various high-flying, hoop-jumping animals.A much improved outing than the somewhat contrived first sequel, does a pretty decent balancing act on a high sky tightrope, where dramatic elements hold together the whole act comprising of new characters and the exposition of the best from the old animal crew. Naturally penguins, distinguished chimps and ego-maniacal lemurs get they fair share of screen time, but they are enhanced by a selection of great circus mammals, starting from a Russian tiger capable of the impossible (literally) and ending with belligerent little pooches, each with their nice character quirks. Meanwhile the supposed foursome which make up the heroes of the franchise take a back seat in proceedings. Thankfully, as Alex lacks any true impression, while Chris Rock's frantic exuberance as Marty is mostly just achingly irritating. Melman and Gloria as generally likable, but almost invisible with no true impact on the story, apart from them working out a circus act together.Nonetheless this crazy and chaotic sequel is a far cry from its tired predecessor, inflaming life into characters and highlighting its strongest traits with a no-holds-barred approach. All in all the film is a wacky pleasure to behold, despite the apparently flimsy narrative to follow, more working out like random goofs and gags, which fit together to create a grand picture heading to a big final prank. Thankfully the script manages to never overwork the premise or overuse their most intriguing characters. Managing to avoid a simple rehash (as in 'Madagascar 2') this part invigorated interest in the franchise with a host of new animals sure to endear themselves to the public and probably increasing the shelf life by at least one more movie venture into the universe and more Penguins series to boot. The story itself, despite being somewhat basic and predictable (dealing with recognisable issues of friendship and trust), holds the proceedings together, despite the rampant wildness of infectious humour, which is sure to imbue an honest chuckle more often than not. Definitely a movie which is sure to entertain both young and old, albeit moments of laughter are sure to differ depending on age groups.Surprisingly must say I enjoyed the movie much more than the original and is a rare example of a movie, which manages to focus on what works and remolding what doesn't to deliver an improvement on both the original and its sequel.",8,0,1,29 December 2012
The Ugly Truth," Crass chemistry
","Romantic comedies sometimes need so little to be somewhat successful. Here the key to success comes from the abundant chemistry between Katherine Heigl and Sam Butler, with an especially hardy performance by the latter. Uptight and rigid Abby (Katherine Heigl) works as a producer for a flailing TV morning show in Sacramento. On the verge of being cancelled it is time to experiment with extreme: the uncouth hard-hitting Mike (Gerard Butler), former host of cable programme 'The Ugly Truth', the ultimate in-your-face reveal on relationships (churning out advice about men preferring their women to roll around half-naked in jello). Despite obvious distaste for Mike's cynical methods and views, Abby is forced to accept his brash on-screen attitude. Nevertheless, she soon finds herself taking love advice from the burly news host in a ploy to entice the 'perfect man'.Despite its somewhat misogynistic pretence, fortunately introduced purely for laughs sakes, not to preach about the banality of love, 'The Ugly Truth' works surprisingly well. Mostly due to the well-strung pairing with great comedic timing and a underlying tension bringing about colours to the story. Heigl naturally fails straight into her comfort zone of being a stringent obsessing female, but her charm is relentless. Together they form a duo that makes any shortcomings of the mannered and formulaic script fade into the background. Fortunately also several jokes are extremely well handled, even if not particularly ingenious results of brainstorming sessions. Clichés may be especially annoying, but somehow with Heigl and Butler taking centre-stage, it becomes something of an enjoyable guilty pleasure. Not an entirely memorable one, but still above average TV fodder for comedic release.",6,2,4,27 May 2013
The Cabin in the Woods," Carnage Inc.
","In the cliché of horror clichés a group of five friends decide to take a vacation in a forest hideout supposedly belonging to the cousin of sociology major / burly athlete Curt (Chris Hemsworth). The foursome features a newly blond Jules (Anna Hutchison), her single 'reborn virgin' friend Dana (Kristen Connolly), the setup boyfriend Holden (Jesse Williams) and the bong-smoking jester Marty (Fran Kranz). On path to the isolated cabin they meet the awkwardly crazed hill-billy, but still embark to their fate: one full of flinging cellar doors, blood-hungry zombies and all that is dark / dreadful. Meanwhile a group of technicians follow our group en route to their demise, supplying them with hypnotic drugs and pheromones in order for the murderous mayhem complete an ancient ritual aimed at keeping the Ancient Ones at bay...Flung into the crossroads of horror scripts comes a truly original movie-joke, albeit one not as cerebrally engaging as many want to believe. Taking 'Scream' a step beyond from laughing at horror movies oversimplifications to re-imagining a limbo for horror scripts. Many viewers will be engaged enough by the sheer glee of playing the 'name-that-horror' game, started off from the obvious 'Evil Dead' nudge to some less apparent homages like 'Hellraiser' to those absolutely marginal like the 'Angel'-inspired tentacle scene. Throughout a vast array at knocks towards horror idiosyncrasies, including inspirationally over-the-top famous last-lines, a character changing his sane opinion into an insane one via technician-induced stupidity or the intelligent Jules going blond and dumb just to fit the 'tech script'. Insanely funny with a nudging smartness, whilst not receding on gore, 'Cabin in the Woods' offers a true relapse from the typical horror fanfare. The main loss is in regards to atmosphere, as there is none - whenever the tension starts building we are always swept away into 'horror technician' land, where a couple of goofy lines and comments eat away the suspense.Featuring a very self-aware script and great performances across the board (especially from the duo technobabble of Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford), is a vastly improved metaspoof (when compared to the 'Scream' franchise) aimed directly at true aficionados of the horror genre.",8,0,1,5 November 2012
Moon," A sci-fi triumph
","Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) is on a 3 year contract on a moon base overseeing the extraction of Hel3, a primary energy source on Earth. Accompanied only by GERTY (voice of Kevin Spacey), a robot-assistant, he has just two weeks to the end of the contract. Missing his wife and 3-year old child Eve he is counting the days. The stay has taken its toll on Sam - he has hallucinations and he physical form has deteriorated. And thats as far as I'll go with the plot - it is best to experience the rest yourself.This classical in feel sci-fi movie is a pure gem amongst the overflow of trash like Star Trek: The Beginning, Terminator 4 or Transformers. Going back to the roots it focuses on the human condition without unnecessary action, chases and ridiculous plot twists. It may not be very cerebral, but it is definitely thoughtful and intelligent. It may not be breakthrough in any sense, but this movie will be remembered in years to come. An instant classic.Sam Rockwell has the opportunity to play the defining role of his career. If he never manages to get a second such good role this movie will always be evidence of just how great an actor he actually is. He caught me be surprise, but his screen presence was one of the prime moments of cinema this year.Kudos to the director. I had small issues with the ending and some minor plot solutions, but otherwise a deserved standing ovation.",8,0,3,3 November 2009
The Breakfast Club," Being honest
","A group of teenagers, each from a different school social strata, end up on Saturday at detention for various shenanigans. Fitting seamlessly into certain stereotypes the five misfits consist of meek geek Brian (Anthony Michael Hall), the jock-type wrestler Andrew (Emilio Estevez), the rebellious nihilist Bender (Judd Nelson), the popular in-girl Claire (Molly Ringwald) and the reclusive loner Allison (Ally Sheedy). Captivated by their societal roles the separate individuals initially feed off everyday school structures copying the relations and attitudes carried around classrooms. However through conflict and subsequent revelations the group starts taking on a different dynamic, revealing that the roles attached to each person does not exclude mutual understanding.Arguably John Hughes most artistically accomplished film, 'The Breakfast Club' ventures through well-tread territory to bring a still omnipresent feeling of purpose. Although the frisky dialogues don't achieve boundless heights, they carry enough wit and substance to make for a cognitive piece, still however troubled by oversimplification. What however comes off worst in the movie is the forced humour, which blends sourly with the more cerebral plotting and interaction of characters. So hopelessly out of sync the impact is severely deflated leaving several confrontational scenes still relevant, while the rest fails to be as brisk and influential, as back when the movie was first released.",6,0,1,21 September 2012
In the Land of Blood and Honey," Bloodily dull
","NOTE: Viewed the English language version, where actors stumbled to sell their lines with conviction, visibly struggling to preserve their acting chops in the unfamiliar English-language environment.Set in the brutal Bosnian civil war, directorial débutant Angeline Jolie, delivers a devastating account of the atrocities that occurred during the war, mainly pointing fingers at the Serbian side, while ostensibly siding with the women, the oft forgotten, but most harshly brutalised victims of war. Subject to imprisonment, where they are treated as slave labour, play toys and subject to everyday rape (together with the subsequent pregnancies), knives of fury open up during viewing. Somehow however within this onslaught of injustice Jolie attempts to introduce a romantic backdrop to the story...Bosniak painter Ajla (Zana Marjanovic) is captured and sent into a strict prisoner camp, where she encounters her former love, Yugoslav People's Army commander Danijel (Goran Kostic). Still enticed by Ajla, Danijel manages to save her from rape victimisation and announces her to be his private woman. Rigid and at times ostensibly cold Danijel does not however force himself on Ajla, instead attempting to rekindle the lost affections of the past despite the murderous genocidal occurrences in abundance. Within this brutal war convictions and feelings must struggle to survive...In what has been aptly described as war porn, Jolie best succeeds in presenting war atrocity with some impressive and well-designed sets to compliment the story and the despicable ongoings where civilians are worst affected by the insanity. Rape, denigration, brutalisation are everyday life for encaptured women, while not even a screaming baby is safe from the illogical brutality of civil war. For some death is the better alternative...Nonetheless, Angelina Jolie struggles to find any rhythm in the movie, instead acting out as a disjointed mess lacking dramatic punch. Attempting a more artistic feel, inspired by movies such as 'Behind Enemy Lines', first time helmer fails to instill any life into the drab, murky proceedings, leaving a lifeless exterior, which struggling to bring about any emotions apart from the apparent shock factors. Scenes with Ajla and Danijel are always awkward, somewhat detached, making the whole affair a cumbersome attempt at romance, but without conviction. It could be argued that this is purposeful, as given the war implication anything other than this disjointed, half-hearted romance is impossible. However this encapsulating dreariness within an over-reaching two hour run-time makes for an excruciating watch into hopelessness and despair, as viewer attention aimlessly wanders in between atrocities (during which in turn eyes tend to not want to be open to see).",2,12,21,22 June 2013
The Bourne Supremacy," Not supreme
","Jason Bourne has escaped the world of Treadwater to Goa, India, where he lives a peaceful and happy life with Marie. Still not fully aware of his past he is more or less reconciled with himself and set to live his days away from who he used to be. That is until the past comes back to haunt him in the guise of the mysterious Kirill (Karl Urban), who suddenly destroys Bourne new world and with it causes the death of Marie. Meanwhile someone has killed two CIA agents in Berlin and did his best to frame Bourne for the kill. Jason Bourne is not about to back down as he is back in Europe and with one hell of a vengeance...On many levels the change of director did not seem to suit the Bourne trilogy and albeit the last part was a markable improvement this is a below par action movie, which lands a lot of punches, but lacks enough power to remain in memory. The is epitomised by the chase sequences or fights, which are rather standard unmemorable experiences. The end crash sequence and one nifty fight with another former Treadwater assassin are the highlight of an otherwise slowly unfolding experience. Even though it is the shortest of the Trilogy it felt much longer than the supreme 'Bourne Identity'.A lot of this has to do with the script itself, which is severely poorer, than its predecessor and unable to fall from plot-hole into plot-hole and cruises unknowingly in the seas of ridiculous scriptwriting. Some of the flaws are forgivable, but essentially it does cause Bourne to look a little bit like a twit, while the C.I.A. are a bunch of morons without little to no observational powers. Add to that the script basically seems to retread what was already done in part one, so we have very similar fights and chases, where Bourne tries to hide from the Police, the C.I.A. and god knows who else.The key plot-hole that irked me in disgust concerned the general notion that Bourne is so well trained that he never makes a mistake (as is specifically stated by one of the C.I.A. Special Ops), but at the same time no-one in the whole department ever gave a second thought about Bourne leaving a fingerprint on the scene of a crime. Elementary, my dear Watson. From then on we get the general background of the movie, which is far-fetch and badly scripted. Even though the movie remains thoroughly enjoyable (mainly thanks to a good portrayal of the title character by Matt Damon) you just can not drop the notion that everyone in the story is acting way stupider, than what should be acceptable for super special spies...",4,1,3,2 January 2011
The Great Gatsby," Excessive extravagance hits home
","Baz Luhrmann's excessive all-out retelling of the great American novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald, where the essence of the 1920s lavish parties is juxtaposed with hip-hop and dub-step music channelling the excess, is a surprisingly satisfying feature. Equally shocking is how the outdated story fits so seamlessly with the current Wall Street culture of greed and obnoxiousness. When a youthful writer Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) decides on a stock exchange career he rents a small beach-side place, hence becoming the unknowing neighbour of Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio). Soon the duo become comrades with Carraway being pulled into the nouveau riche lifestyle of glitz and cascades of cash. However Gatsby has an ulterior motive to reclaim the love of his life: Daisy (Carey Mulligan), a high-life dame married to local class royalty Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton). For her this small town boy has amassed wealth in the hope that one day Daisy's heart will be reconquered.For once Baz Luhrmann's liking to the extravagant feels wholly at home with luscious expansive setting and mass choreography making the spectacle seem suitably epic for the story. A far cry from the autoparodic 'Australia' Luhrman's style seems to mesh perfectly with the sensibility of the story and his decision to introduce contemporary black music works brilliantly - symbolically drawing similarities as the current culture associated with the overblown excess of rappers so aptly fits to the fatuitous societal bliss of 1920s wealth. Despite the screenplay being as faithful as possible to the source material, the outlook on America as a culture of mindless wealth seems ever so timely.Leanardo DiCaprio is a tour de force in his own right, now fully formed as an adult actor drawing away from his youthful appearance, which made him once seem like the eternal boy-actor. Tobey Maguire seems the weakest point of the movie, as he fails to serve any sense of credibility to his character, overly reclusive and grey, not bringing a background impact as the narrator of Gatsby downfall. Given that this is essentially Nick's story to tell I couldn't help but feel that Maguire struggles with making himself a key figure in the proceedings, instead molding into the background of the deluxe surroundings, struggling as a first person perspective narrator. This does make the movie a bit more ineffectual in its impact, but mostly it just underpins DiCaprio's command of his role and diverts all attention to the Great Gatsby!",8,2,4,13 October 2013
Warm Bodies," Best zombie comedy since 'Shaun of the Dead'
","Obviously intent on drawing Twilight crowds, director Jonathan Levine brilliantly redefines a genre laden with history mixing the expected romantic twist to the tale with the unexpected hilarity of subverting teenage drama into a zom-com. In a not-so-distant future the world has been overcome by zombies with the last outposts of the living in heavily guarded fortresses. Meanwhile the dead walk the Earth, pointlessly and repeatedly wandering along oft-tread paths, mechanically searching for live brain. Those zombies, who have entirely detached from their humanity (given up the vestiges of hope), have turned into soulless remnants called 'bonies', entirely ravaged by the virus - now faster and consumed by an overwhelming blood lust.The rest, like R (blue-eyed Nicholas Hoult) still hang on to some past memory of being human, eating brains a way to re-immerse into the living (brain-eating causes the zombie to steal other peoples memories), whilst spending the multitude of spare time collecting vinyls and having quasi-conversations with fellow undead M (Rob Corddry). When Julie (Teresa Palmer), daughter of general Grigio (John Malkovich), falls into a zombie trap, R (after prior munching through the skull of her fiancée) creates an unusual affinity to the girl, thus causing him to spare her life. This soon brings about a spiral of events, which surprisingly causes R to slowly uncover the ability to speak or to harbour feelings.Levine obviously was inspired by the vampire craze initiated by the Twilight series, audaciously deciding to take Teresa Palmer as the female protagonist. Due to significant facial similarities coupled with a dose of mimicry Palmer could well claim to be a sister of Kristen Stewart. But 'Warm Bodies' uses these similarities to introduce a new take on the zombie genre, while bringing in new crowds in on the fun. Bound to cause some confusion amongst Meyers fan-base as to what exactly this movie is, Levine isn't however really interested in making fun of 'Twilight' (although certain nods can be easily distinguished). Instead he quickly finds his own pace and style within this illogical romantic scenario of a dilapidated corpse falling madly in love with a live girl. Masterfully balancing the more sincere, dramatic moments with an onslaught of well timed, brilliantly thought out comedy, the movie succeeds in throes, delivering one of the freshest pictures of the season. Much praise must be given to the obviously restrained Nicholas Hoult, who mostly communicates with 'ughs' and 'ers', throwing the occasional crooked smile, while delivering the comedic underpinning with a wry narration of his thoughts.",8,1,2,16 June 2013
Up in the Air," Loyalty is never cheap
","Corporate America is verging on collapse with the housing market in turmoil, automotive industry in free-fall and no veritable option for recovery in sight. Life couldn't be better for high flying Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), who spends some 320 days per year traversing the country being paid heavy cash for firing people. Living out of a suitcase the ultimate goal for Ryan is collecting 10,000,000 frequent flier points at American Airlines (already being a Concierge member) to receive the vaunted privilege of being only the seventh person ever to reach this total. Loyalty is never cheap, and Ryan offers his to various programmes, never to people, only ever entering into casual on-road relationships, like with Alex (Vera Farmiga). When confronted with the niggling possibility that his line of business will become stationery due to tele-conference technology forwarded by young, but brash new recruit Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), Ryan must confront his lifestyle with the reality of whether having an empty backpack truly brings him satisfaction.Since 'Thank You For Smoking' and 'Juno' Jason Reitman's witty, if sometimes dry humour has brought him to the forefront of comedic-drama directors. However his first features, however blessed with undeniable charm, lacked a conscious moral backbone, which brought together the story and incorporated a clear message. 'Up in the Air', filmed on the basis of the same-titled novel by Walter Kirn, borrows the premise and is contextualised by the author's work. The Reitman brothers script helps focus the attention and introduces wry wit to create a cohesive story attacking key aspects of human life, aspiring to answer questions of what is important, what is true happiness. Maybe somewhat of an overreach and the philosophical credentials of both source material and Reitman aren't notable enough to attack these issues with intellectual gusto. Nonetheless the movie takes on meaning of life questions with true emotional intent, never relenting and rarely dropping focus.Clooney gives a powerful performance, as the cool self-centred man in the clouds, detached from possessions and stability, instead dedicated to ever soaring: living requires movement. Opposite her are offered two stances. One of a middle-aged female, for which travel is a mere escape, not a way of life - no strings attached, frivolous and meaningless. The other of the youthful Natalie, who lacks experience, but never fervour to change. Her person is key as she indicates a starting point (of Alex and Ryan 15-20 years in the past) - full of hope, exuberance and lack of perception in regards to the bigger picture. Despite her career push Natalie is burdened by her emotionality and lack of control or understanding of human needs. Meanwhile the wiser Ryan, despite reneging on leading a life 'hampered' by objects and persons, has a wider outlook, in someway deciding to live a vagabond life in order to never having to be the 'person on the other side of the table'. He escapes a so-called stable life, understanding how all-engulfing commitment is and how painful it can be. Both Natalie and Ryan have there points - the movie offering a meeting point somewhere mid-way, far from a fairy-tale and easy options. The outro of real-life interviews with people losing their jobs offers a substantial culmination - life may not be a bed of roses, but all in all when memories of happy times are brought about a second person is always involved, not frequent flier miles or computer screens.",8,1,2,21 December 2012
