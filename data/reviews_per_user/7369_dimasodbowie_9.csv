The New World," The New World is a Visual Masterpiece
","Amazing story of Pocahontas , sad and opus to her life. The English seem like savages , not the other way around. The world blames The Great Colombus for the demise of The American Indian and the slave trade? Where the English, Dutch, Spainish and many Anglo Saxons where the True Enemies. The history books don't lie .",8,1,1,15 November 2019
Inglourious Basterds," Omg Another Overhyped Tarrantino Film
","This is a remake of a Italian Movie , not orginal and endless subtitles . If it was trimmed down a hour it would of worked. You have characters speaking in German and French with unnecessary dialogue. To top it of the only true actor in this movie is Christopher Watlz who is outstanding. Brad Pitt is a horrible actor.",3,3,5,9 November 2019
