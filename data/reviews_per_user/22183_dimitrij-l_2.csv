Captain Phillips," Was bored until last 30 minutes
",This will be quite a short review.This movie was utterly boring until the last 30 minutes where Tom Hanks did (in my opinion) a performance of his career.The story is plain and simple without any twist. Such a predictable movie isn't fun to watch unless you have great visual effects or engaging dialog coupled with dramatic music or other engaging mechanisms.Also the actors playing Somali pirates did a convincing job. It was hard not to hate them. They even might make someone hate the whole Somalia throughout the whole movie (but hopefully not afterward).,4,1,4,15 January 2014
Bird Box," Not a horror and fiercly overhyped movie
","No horror at all and not even any cool visuals Movie would be really bad if not for Sandra Bullock. Starts out great and really captures the audience but it never shows, explains or really ends with anything satisfactory.",6,1,2,3 January 2019
