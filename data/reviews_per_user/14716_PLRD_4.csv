The Finest Hours," IMAX 3D was made for 'The Finest Hours' -- Excellent film
","IMAX 3D was made for 'The Finest Hours.' The technology is fully exploited and realized as it takes you in to the immediacy of the fact-based story. I didn't expect much. So many films made for 3D and/or IMAX are strong on FX and weak on story. At my age, story is paramount, and if the FX can be enlisted to that end, we could get a good film. 'The Finest Hours' is an excellent film.So many of the films for IMAX 3D are fantasies which probably would have engaged me in my younger days, but as I've aged I have increasingly related more to 'true' or 'real' stories like 'The Finest Hours.' I'll also mention that it was a relief to everyone in our party to not be subjected to a barrage of what is euphemistically called 'language.' That has become the movie norm in an effort to dial up realism or tension or whatever. None of the people in my life ever talk that way and 'The Finest Hours' demonstrates that realism and tension are both well off without it.IMHO, 'The Finest Hours' was excellently cast and excellently performed. The two male leads both give subtly nuanced performances as just plain guys trying to do their jobs and not seeking recognition or leadership positions, who find themselves in situations forcing them to take charge, and portraying their gradual personal progression as they have 'greatness thrust upon them.' In IMAX 3D, the effects are jaw-dropping. One review, an outlier, complains that the price of 3D is reduced brightness. I thought it was worth every penny. Another review complains that the film lacks human drama. The writers' adaptation from fact to film story and script relies on some well-worn devices, but everyone in my party thought it succeeded beautifully in limning consistent and plausible back stories, portraying women of implacable strength in what might have been strictly a male story, and wrapping the whole tale in a tender romance.I'm interested now in reading the book. In case you are too, note that there are two versions, one for Young Adults.",9,3,13,30 January 2016
Memento," A cerebral puzzle without passion
","Fragmented, disjointed, unsequential story and screenplay, is innovative and certainly attention-getting, but ultimately mutes the emotional impact of film.  Too few moments when the viewers here could connect, possibly because you have to work so hard continuously to figure out what is going on.  An intricate cerebral puzzle but without passion.",4,3,4,4 August 2002
Silver Linings Playbook," Little Romance, Little Comedy, Lots of Bad Behavior
","First off, I'm 75 years old. Second, I know zero about the two leading performers, so they get no points from me for being 'stars.' Their performances were accomplished and subtle, but IMHO they were playing ugly characters: rude, vulgar, lots of foul language and bad behavior, mistreating and abusing each other. Maybe they were depicting a clinical condition accurately or brilliantly, but that ain't entertainment to me. I just feel offended and roughed up. Incidentally, I am an NFL fan and I think the characterizations in that department were surely intended as parody or farce, but if that's the case then that whole plot mechanism is out of sync with the rest of the film.",1,10,21,6 February 2013
The Longest Day," Good but not Great
","A sweeping spectacle with compelling moments, but some amateurish dialogue and clumsy direction detract.  Worth watching, lots of stars, often not put to their best use.  For example, compare John Wayne's awkward performance here with his superior work in the Pearl Harbor Naval film 'In Harm's Way.' I give this a 5 out of 10.",5,7,12,16 June 2002
