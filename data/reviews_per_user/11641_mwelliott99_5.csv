Ford v Ferrari," Great film.
","Saw this with some of my family but not expecting too much as the reviews from the upmarket press weren't too good. But they were wrong, really enjoyed it. Good drama/story and people you cared about. Great driving scenes and witty lines too.
I guess the reason The Guardian didn't like it was that it was about western white men driving planet killing (!) cars. And not an LGBT person in sight!So it seemed real. And because it was a true story there were no silly dramas/twists to try and make it more exciting. The truth, we'll presented, was exciting enough.",9,1,2,18 November 2019
Blade Runner 2049," Utterly brilliant
","I enjoyed the first Blade Runner but it has never been a favourite - not much character development, flawed plot and some slow sequences but it was a product of the early 80's.But I think this film is possibly a masterpiece. The acting is very good, the story interesting, understandable and satisfying and with good effects etc. The joy of this film is the pace and length - the length gives time to really develop the characters. You care what happens to them in a way that you really don't in the original. It is more like a box set in giving time to really get into the story which is gripping. The cinematography, sets and direction seem almost flawless. The effects are excellent but they don't overwhelm the story, unlike most of the junky superhero (& other!) movies the studios churn out with endless ridiculous and boring (odd combination that) set pieces and plot holes to drive a spaceship through.I went with my son & daughter and wife. My 20 yr old daughter said she was gripped by the story though she is not a fan of sci-fi. My wife stayed awake which is unheard of.I was not expecting much from this film but to my surprise it is in my top few sci-fi films (others are probably Ex-machina, Terminator 2, Aliens and, perhaps, Moon). It is really amazing and I hope it gets an Oscar nod.Inevitably I don't understand the negative comments - perhaps from those who prefer the slam, bang superhero gang....",10,3,14,21 October 2017
The Death of Stalin," A brilliant and genuinely funny film
","Brilliantly acted and wonderfully funny yet played straight. A black comedy with clout. And an amazing true story. Not a title you might rush to but watch it, you'll love it. My 18 year old son also loved it - genuinely funny lines which he's now quoting back.",10,5,9,7 April 2018
Salt," Not a patch on Bourne - a very pale imitation!
",That's all I need to say. Pretty poor but has value as a popcorn movie and Jolie is quite watchable.,5,1,4,9 April 2020
Sicario," Very good film
","Tension, great acting, convincing story. No stupid superheroes, no unnecessary CGI, believable action and no cheesy music.Someone has just reviewed this with a '1' and I'm starting to realise that film/movie reviews are valueless as half of them are wrong - the challenge is working out which half.I think the answer is that 50% of the reviews are 7-8 or above then you can safely ignore all the negative reviews as they are inept.",8,1,2,16 March 2019
