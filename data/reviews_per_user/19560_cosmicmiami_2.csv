10 Cloverfield Lane," Awful, Boring SPOILER
","I watched this movie TWICE on a flight figuring I might have missed something while I dozed off. NOPE.They call it a sci-fi thriller. Besides the implied idea that there is some kind of threat to the area (it's never revealed), there is no sci-fi to the plot at all, no alien invasion or asteroid strike or zombie apocalypse.One would think that a film involving three characters and a single location would have a more interesting script. There are pretty much no memorable lines or scenes. The suspenseful scenes are resolved predictably without anything unexpected.The final scene where she drives off while listening to the radio is not really compelling and reveals nothing. A better ending would have been that she hears normal, everyday radio and realizes that her captor was merely faking the entire thing.Confusing and not entertaining.",1,2,6,20 August 2016
War Machine," Started Great...Belabored in the middle
","I had to watch this in two parts. Started out great. Some hilarious parody and some not so obvious shots at US military and foreign policy.Then it just became repetitive. Okay, we get it. Move on. There are only so many things you can ridicule without sounding like a skipping record.Some decent acting. At times I thought Pitt was just mailing it in and at others I thought he was brilliant.",6,1,1,20 May 2018
