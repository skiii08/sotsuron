Black Swan," Really Intense depressive and truly astonishing movie!
","From the first few seconds of the movie you can tell that the story is twisted and deep in many ways... From the mother to the teacher to the former lead dancer, they all fall into the same dark loop that seems to embrace the lead character of this film and slowly drift her to madness... My eyes were stuck to the screen during the whole movie and the ending is so high that it kept me craving for more... Natalie Portman is surely Oscar worthy and should most definitely win! The entire cast gives a really impressive performance, but she is just amazing! This is one of those rare movies you should keep in your DVD library and watch many times again and again and again!",10,0,2,16 February 2011
Spice World," Funny and light! A Good feel movie about Pop stars lives...
","This movie has everything related to the pop life in it, a comedic thrilling ride in the lives of a pop star band! The paparazzi, the fame, the fans, the back clash, the media, the managers, the shows and of course the greatest girl band the world has and will ever see: The Spice Girls! The Spice girls in a way gathered all the pop life elements in their movie, mocking even themselves, they tried to show the world that this is all a fun ride and you must enjoy every minute of it while it lasts, and this is what they did in their 2 years world domination rally! You can't watch this movie though if you're a pop music or Spice Girls hater, if you are into pop and into light comedy and cheesy jokes then this movie is for your eyes only (a little wink to Roger Moore's cameo). Relax, get your best friend with whom you spent most of the 90's hearing ace of base and Take that on your CD player and enjoy this movie for old times sake! Now the acting, the plot, the script etc... They all fade into the background when you've got the Spice girls up front doing their thing! So stop complaining about this movie, it is not just another Oscar Submission, its supposed to be a funny ride and a silly joke for God's sake, lighten up and enjoy it for what it is!",9,1,2,29 April 2010
