50 First Dates," Better than I expected, by far....
","This movie made me get all teary-eyed...of course, I'd had four margaritas in a row immediately before it began, but nonetheless, you know something has that 'je ne sais quoi' if it manages to include both Adam Sandler AND a touching storyline.  Definitely a worthy date movie; very smart to release it on Feb. 13th.",7,0,0,17 February 2004
