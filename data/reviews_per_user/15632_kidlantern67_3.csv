Sucker Punch," Well done flick that is deeper than you think. Give it a go.
","Saw SUCKER PUNCH last night. In my internet travels I have found: YOU WILL EITHER LOVE THE MOVIE OR HATE IT. I completely loved the movie while my wife hated it, we totally fit in with this trend. I categorically don't believe it deserves the low ratings most professional critics are giving it. Yes, it is visually stunning, has action that blows the mind, a superb soundtrack, is acted adequately (folks are blasting the acting, it was fine) and a simple plot (folks are calling the plot thin and its sort of true but it didn't need a complex plot ala INCEPTION.) Go see this film on the big screen. Zack Snyder delivers what was promised. If you like Zack Snyder, this film is right up your alley. If you don't like Snyder's previous work then you're going to hate this. I don't get the folks complaining about the acting and dialog. Will these actors win Oscars; not at all. Were they horrible; not in the slightest. Serviceable acting with a simple plot. That's all and that's fine. It's not Inception so let it go. It's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest meets Inception though. Hahaha.Zack Snyder is a visionary not a writer. Think of George Lucas, a great world-builder, outliner and character creator/designer but no Shakespeare. Snyder does what HE does and he does it well.",8,5,14,26 March 2011
The Hangover Part II," Still funny but just more of the same...
","I liked Hangover II. The gags still hit you in that disturbing way we have come to love. Fine performances once again by Zach, Ed, Bradley and Ken Jeong as Mr. Chou is given more screen time. The director uses Bangkok to good effect.If you saw the first movie and liked it, go ahead and see the second. You won't be too disappointed. If you didn't see the first I can't recommend seeing this one until you do. Many of the jokes refer back to gags in the first film.And there in lies the problem, Hangover 2 isn't fresh. It's just more of the same. Now the SAME is still pretty damn funny. Some big laughs save it from being a so-so movie.One big problem I had with the film is that nothing was done with the character Doug again. Not to spoil anything but it's not Doug who goes missing this time. I felt this was the perfect opportunity to see Doug in action. He could have roamed Bangkok with the 'three BFFs' or it would have been cool to see how he runs interference for the guys at the luxury resort they're staying at. Alas more potential comedy was missed. Will this be rectified in a HANGOVER III? Will anyone care?",7,0,1,10 June 2011
X-Men: First Class," First Class all around!!!
","I went to see X-Men: First Class on Saturday afternoon with my lovely wife. As the end credits rolled a sense of real satisfaction from watching an incredibly solid film washed over me. I liked the movie a ton but would my wife feel the same? She hasn't read many comics and doesn't follow the exploits of most superheroes. In other words, she represents the general audience when it comes to superhero fare. The film was able to garner high praise from her with the epic statement, 'If you see the guy in our building who sells bootleg DVDs and if he's got X-Men: First Class, buy it. I want to see it again.' Now kiddies, I by no means condone or comply with the purchasing of pirated videos. I categorically do not! But if that is your cup of tea who am I to judge. But the fact that my wife a non-comic book fan was totally enthralled and entertained by this film is no small feat. I know I annoy the hell out of her with my fan boy rants and ravings, but she tolerates it because she loves me. Aw! But I digress. X-Men: First Class hit so many nails on the head it should apply for a carpentry license. The casting of James McAvoy as Professor X and Michael Fassbender as Magneto originally drew some skepticism from this humble reviewer. Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian MacKellen seemed to be born to play the roles they made even more famous in the previous three X-Men films. How could McAvoy and Fassbender top these fine thespians? They didn't top them but they definitely matched them. McAvoy, who was told not to do a Stewart impersonation, gave the role of young Professor X a sense of joy, wonderment and hope that Stewart's portrayal lacked; which isn't knocking Stewart, by no means. X-men: First Class portrays a Charles Xavier before he became wheelchair-bound, so of course his world would seem a little brighter and rose-colored. McAvoy pulls off this Pollyanna portrayal with perfect aplomb. McAvoy is one of the best young actors of our time. He is solid in everything he does. See Wanted, Atonement and The Last King of Scotland to see how good he is.Michael Fassbender's portrayal as Magneto, Master of Magnetism, is spot on. While Sir Ian played Magneto as a man full of pi$$ and vinegar that has seen it all, Fassbender meanwhile plays the future villain exactly the same but with a little bit more gravitas and pathos. Fassbender's portrayal is so human you can't help but like his Erik. Even as Magneto's quest for revenge begins to take permanent root, gut- wrenchingly you begin to actually root for the man even though you know he will become the murderously human-hating purveyor of Superiority. Director Matthew Vaughn masterfully weaves a tapestry of swinging 1960's James Bond-like intrigue, Munich-style man-hunting and Marvel Comics mayhem with pitch perfect plot and pacing. Together, this becomes a crazy quilt of must-see appeal. Vaughn shows us three dimensional characters that we want to know even more about. Because of his direction and assist with the script, Vaughn gives us a Mystique we never saw in the first three films. She goes from partially- clad set piece to full-fledged character as portrayed by Oscar-nominee Jennifer Lawrence. When I first heard about Kevin Bacon playing Sebastian Shaw, I must admit it gave me pause. I was like, 'Mr. Footloose himself playing one of the nastiest X-Men villains of all time? No way'! But after seeing X- Men: First Class, my world view was a little shaken. Now Bacon is a great actor, we all know this, but sometimes folks are miscast; Jessica Alba's Invisible Woman anyone? After seeing Bacon do his version of a Bond villain I had to admit it; he did his thing! That's a term used in around the neighborhood. With his mutant ability to absorb energy, Bacon's Shaw absorbed our attention with his slick oiliness every time he was on screen. Honorable mentions go out to Rose Byrne as Moira MacTaggert, Nicholas Hoult as Beast and January Jones (wooden acting didn't bother me here) as Emma Frost for their performances. It was cool to see Moira finally fleshed out by a capable actress in Byrne. And Hoult was nerdy-fun as hairy Hank McCoy. Hopefully we'll see more of this actor in the future. Other X-Men, Banshee (Caleb Landry Jones) and Havok (Lucas Till) are given appropriate screen time and give the film much needed comedy relief. Make sure you see the mutant gathering montage in the middle of the movie. There are some mutant cameos not to be missed; one in particular is laugh out loud funny.X-Men: First Class is definitely on the level of X2 and easily surpasses the miss that was X-3. Although X-Men: First Class, plays fast and loose with not only the comics' continuity but the previous movies as well, I suggest checking that simple fact at the door when seeing this film. I know there will be Hardcore fans who won't be able to get past that but please get over yourself otherwise you will be missing one of the better superhero films ever made.",9,6,10,10 June 2011
