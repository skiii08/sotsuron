Marie Antoinette," The guillotine was invented for films like this
","This is the kind of film you're allowed to make if your last name is Coppola. If your name is say, Smith or Jones, the studio would laugh in your face. Roger Ebert, whose judgment I usually respect, gave MARIE ANTOINETTE four stars. Maybe he was entranced by the C-name, too.What a misbegotten mess this is! Here was a chance for a truly talented screenwriter to create an exciting, funny, dramatic script about one of the most tragic eras in history. Instead, we get Coppola's Cliff-notes version of French history, accompanied by an anachronistic soundtrack that keeps reminding the viewer that an immature hack is behind this 'entertainment.' And the casting! Dunst has a face like a pancake (crepe?) and about as much emotional range. Schwartzmann looks nothing like Louis XVI and is more boring than Louis possibly could have been. And what are we to think about seeing Rip Torn, Molly Shannon, and Steve Coogan in fairly significant parts? Why not Adam Sandler or David Spade? I'm sure they'd look good in powdered wigs, too.People who hate historical dramas love this film because this is the kind of glitzy sugar-coating they wish ALL history books and films had. It's all about CLOTHES! And SHOES! And HAIR! And BOYS! And...oh yes, occasionally we hear about an invasion, or peasants revolting. But then back to the CLOTHES! I give this movie 3 out of 10 for: 1. The costumes. As long as it's a movie about clothes, they might as well be great-looking, and they are. The large crowd scenes are visually overwhelming.2. The sense of court protocol. We do get a glimpse of how fanatical the courtiers were about rank, etiquette, and procedure. Scenes in the queen's bedroom or the dinner table are excruciatingly rule-bound, which does give us a glimpse into Marie's attitude.3. The locations. Interiors and exteriors are breathtaking. Imagine being given free rein to film all over Versailles. Let's hope this movie doesn't sour the French government on allowing a REAL filmmaker to try this again sometime with better results.",3,12,20,13 May 2008
Elizabeth," A thing of beauty
","Besides the wonderful acting by all the leading players, what struck me about this film on a recent re-viewing was the director's love for space and architecture. There are many majestic shots filmed from high in cathedrals and castles that show the beauty of Gothic and Norman craftsmanship. Colorful costumes and set dressing make ELIZABETH a feast for the eye from start to finish.Also to note are the bookending shots of long red hair being cut off: first of the female martyr, and finally of Elizabeth herself. A nice touch.Besides, I'll always support a queen who can defeat Dr. Who (Eccleston) and James Bond (Craig) in the same film.",8,1,1,12 February 2008
Midnight in Paris," Charming comedy with a moral
","For the past couple of decades, I've lost track of Woody Allen. Back in the 70s when I was in high school and college, a new Woody Allen movie was a cultural event. These days, they show up regularly like buses, and, like buses, they frequently go by without me even noticing them. (It doesn't help that I no longer live in a major movie market town.) Every once in a while I'll check to see what he's done lately, and rent a title; usually this results in mild to severe disappointment.But what a charmer 'Midnight in Paris' is. I love Paris, and obviously Woody does too; the camera lingers on one beautiful sight after another. I thought for a while that this film was going to end up like 'Brigadoon,' with a modern character willingly trapped in the past by love. But Woody gives the plot a fresh twist, with a lesson to be learned, especially by creative types. The cameos by the great writers and artists of the past are wonderful, and the 'modern times' plot involving a doomed relationship is also handled well. The period music is also enjoyable, but Woody: why did you have to play that same guitar tune over and over? I almost lost my mind, but I was enjoying the rest of the movie too much to care.",9,0,2,31 January 2012
Barry Lyndon," The hours fly by...
","I just watched Barry Lyndon on cable; this was my first viewing and made me wish I could have seen it on big screen just to enjoy the beauty of the shots. Those who complain about the pace of this film have no doubt never read a novel by Thackeray, Dickens, or Trollope. Kubrick is true to the pacing and style of these works. I wasn't sure if I could put up with 3 hours of Ryan O'Neal pretending to be Irish (recalling Kevin Costner in ROBIN HOOD), but as someone else has mentioned, O'Neal and the rest of the cast are carried along by the beauty of the film. But to be fair, he wasn't half bad, and the rest of the cast was superb. Kubrick masterfully makes us believe that we really are in 18th century Europe, full of beautiful landscapes and majestic buildings. This gorgeous film almost atones for the self-indulgent wallowing of CLOCKWORK ORANGE. And the classical score performed by 'real' ensembles stands up much better over time than Walter/Wendy Carlos's dated synth adaptations from ORANGE.",Null,2,4,16 October 2004
Split," All buildup; no payoff
","The only reason I gave this film any points at all is because of James McAvoy's performance, which was impressive in its range (see similar films by Peter Sellers or Alec Guinness to compare).I enjoyed 'Sixth Sense' and 'Signs' and have been waiting ever since to see if MNS can create another film on their level. The answer seems to be no.I thought this would be a psychological thriller, which it leads you to believe. But it ends up being a cheesy 'comic book' style movie, with scantily-clad teenage girls being abused and a supernatural human monster. I thought at least there would be some big 'reveal' near the end to make it satisfying, but there wasn't. Are we supposed to be impressed that it all took place in a zoo? (Notice that 'zoo' starts with zzzzzzz...) Or that this film is apparently a sequel to 'Unbreakable,' a forgettable movie I saw ages ago? There's also a subtext about child abuse which is disturbing. The psycho was abused as a child, and we learn that the survivor girl ALSO was abused...by a creepy uncle. She has marks on her body from cutting and from cigarettes, which we don't see until about 1:42:00 - self-inflicted, or done by uncle? And at the end we learn she is still in the custody of said uncle. This girl is supposed to be smart, yet she says nothing to anyone about the abuse?Now MNS reveals this is the 'middle film' in a trilogy. And if you're familiar with other middle films of trilogies, you know that usually means an unsatisfactory ending and a plot that just treads water. That's what we have here, folks. Don't waste your time, despite good performances by McEvoy and Buckley.",4,2,6,9 December 2017
Dunkirk," Not your typical war film
","Dunkirk is not a typical 'war movie' that revolves around a set of stock characters. It's an attempt to tell a very involved historical narrative by creating a few plot 'threads' that represent the various aspects of the event (the pilots, the soldiers on the beach, the commanders, the civilians). It was helpful to me to have just finished reading Walter Lord's book on the subject. I think a lot of viewers are left stranded because they have virtually no context for what they are seeing, except for a few brief sentences on the screen at the beginning. There are some fine actors (Branagh, D'arcy etc.) who aren't given much to do. Director Nolan once again hides Tom Hardy's face for almost an entire movie (he was Bane in the Batman trilogy), and there isn't much traditional dialogue. The only 'fleshed out' thread is about the civilian boat owner (Mark Rylance), his two young helpers, and the slightly mad soldier they fish out of the water (Cillian Murphy, alias 'Scarecrow'). That story really helps hold the movie together, and brings out the most emotional response. The movie as a whole is an incredible visceral experience, almost an assault on the senses, between the overwhelmingly noisy soundtrack and the acrobatic shaky-cam visuals. The occasional still shot brought incredible relief after bouncing up and down inside a hull or chasing a Heinkel through the air. Even though the story is not sequential, or complete in terms of the Dunkirk operation, Nolan provides enough 'you are there' bits and pieces to tell the story from the evacuation beach back to England. The last shot was a little odd: all sound ceases, and we see the face of one of the soldiers on a train for just a couple of seconds, with the sound of him crinkling his newspaper. Hans Zimmer's almost non-stop score was a barrage of scratching strings, moaning brass, and interminable drones and long, half-step descents. It was the audio equivalent of a root canal, and made Penderecki's 'Threnody' seem like one of the snoozier tracks from a Mantovani LP. When he finally gave us an actual tune (one of Elgar's best), it was such a relief that it triggered a gut-level emotional response. The cinematography was top-notch, and as always, Nolan has an eye for unforgettable visuals. So by all means see it, but you would be well served by doing some historical homework first.",8,1,10,27 August 2017
Across the Universe," A beautiful but empty bubble
","After my bad experience going to see SGT PEPPER back in the 80s, I vowed never to go to another film based on Beatle songs. After 25 years, I renounced my vow and watched ACROSS THE UNIVERSE. It is a far better film than SGT PEPPER but ultimately also a disappointment.Julie Taymor is a tremendously creative director, and there are some wild visuals in this movie. Outstanding sequences include Eddie Izzard's animated MR KITE, the draft board dance sequence, and the on-the-street dance with commuters and briefcases. There is no lack of visual stimulation here.The problem is: when you stuff a movie with a huge number of songs, there's not much room left for plot. So we end up with stock characters and boy-meets-girl clichés sandwiched in-between stunning musical numbers. I guess that's true for many movie musicals, but I guess I still expect more. And of course, we have the whole 60s counterculture boiled down to its skeletal remains (Hippies! Soldiers! Rock and Roll!)So: high marks to the director and art staff for keeping my eyeballs entertained, but a big snore for the writers who couldn't do any better than this trite plot that seems like the literary equivalent of a paint-by-number kit.",5,1,2,10 April 2009
