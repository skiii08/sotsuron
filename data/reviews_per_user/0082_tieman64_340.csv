The Rock," 0111010001101010
","After the machines rose up and annihilated humanity, in an event which would come to be known as The Great Readjustment, the robot overlords ordered the eradication of all human art and culture. Within the space two months, sweeper teams had purged all of North America of every human artifact and man-made object. The fires would burn for months.When the ashes cleared, a cyborg child would find a metallic safe buried eight feet under a mound of charred, superheated rubble. Its contents were mostly molten, unrecognisable, with the exception of one artifact: a DVD copy of Michael Bay's 'The Rock', upon which a severed, cauterised hand was fused. Why this human had risked life and limb to preserve 'The Rock' was unknown. What is known, however, is that this discovery would elicit the first ever retraction of an executive order in Machine History. Within a nanosecond, a clause was added to subroutine 9242439C, thereby mandating the preservation of what was once known as 'The Rock'.And so it came to pass that Michael Bay's 'The Rock' became the universe's last ties to that which was homo sapien. Why the machines chose to preserve such an object is unknown. Perhaps they possessed some kernel of sentimentality, some desire to preserve a connection with that which came before. Or perhaps a clue lies in the archive number eventually assigned to 'The Rock': 0111010001101010, binary for The Great Justification.1/10 – Stop it Bay, you're hurting people.",Null,6,15,26 October 2013
The Devil's Advocate," Pacino Power
","Put Al Pacino in a movie and it's only a matter of time before he delivers a massively entertaining monologue. In 'The Devil's Advocate', Pacino unloads about three minutes worth of verbal pyrotechnics upon poor Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves), a small-town lawyer who finds himself locked in a wholly familiar morality tale.But forget the film's plot. Pacino's where it's at. Chewing scenery like Mike Tyson at an ear factory, Pacino spends 'The Devil's Advocate' delivering a masterclass in the virtues of zany acting. Gone are the devilish subtleties of 'The Godfather' or even 'City Hall'. No, 'The Devil's Advocate' finds Pacino as a big ole ham. Ironically, 'Advocate' also stars a young Charlize Theoron, who treats (and so elevates) a throwaway role with utmost seriousness.7/10 - God bless you Al.",Null,1,2,12 October 2014
The King's Speech," Kneel before the King!
","'Christians and camels receive their burdens kneeling.' – Ambrose Bierce 'The King's Speech' revolves around King George the Sixth's battle with a speech impediment. Seeking a remedy he enlists the help of an Australian speech therapist. By the film's end, the King has conquered his stammer and declared war on Germany.Like Stephen Frears' 'The Queen', 'Speech' is less a film than a cultural export cynically tailored to the market needs of anglophiles in search of some foreign culture. And like most of these films, it is content to appeal to a very fairy tale view of Buckingham Palace, fostering the kind of low-level cult of personality that helps sustain the British Monarchy.Historically the film is mostly dishonest, but that should be expected. If Hollywood can turn the Holocaust into an amusement park ride, then surely Britain will have no trouble molesting history. And so the film whitewashes the Monarchy's selfish support of Baldwin, Chamberlain and Hitler, and seems unaware that they often wrote letters requesting that Jews and refugees not be allowed into England. Likewise, the film presents King George as a ridiculously good-natured guy (instead of the dimwit with a chronic drinking problem that he was), ridiculously over inflates the King's stammer (thereby making him more lovable and heroic), contributes further to the rosy mythologization of Winston Churchill, and reverses the fact that Churchill supported King George's Nazi sympathising brother (Edward VIII frequently stayed in Hitler's guest house). Indeed, what one forgets is that virtually all the aristocracy in Europe at the time were closely related (WW2 is but a giant family feud). What's worse, they were all positively in love with Hitler, supported him dearly, and saw him as a tool to be used to crush the Jewish Marxist, communist and Bolshevik movements across Europe which were rightfully rising up against monarchist regimes. Why? Because the aristocracy wanted to hold onto power, and nothing ruins corporate profits faster than communism. History books are rife with passages featuring Churchill and FDR praising Hitler, Mussolini, Mein Kampf and even the very Governor of the Bank of England touting Hitler as a 'good investment against Bolshevism'.End result: a pack of lies designed to trick you into sympathising with a guy solely so you can rally behind his war address. It's like a film about a blind George Bush struggling to read a teleprompter when announcing another Gulf War 2. Poor him.What the film is really doing is using disability, and the King's speech impediment, as an obstacle which must be overcome so that the social body of a nation doesn't fragment. Covertly, the film says that those with differences must accommodate themselves to society, and that the need to sound 'normal' is important because it not only makes the listener less uncomfortable, but fosters a unity which makes larger wars on 'difference' (Jews, Germans, communists, unionists, radicals etc) possible. What the film does is play into Britian's myth of pre-War unity and solidarity, a lie which allows certain groups to pretend its hands were entirely clean.Unsurprisingly, 'Speech' offensively resonates with the climate in which it was released. Today, power figures and monarchs (many of whom are puppets, beholden to the US and UK) are being toppled across the Middle East, but in Britain, the Queen ('My Government is committed to helping families and businesses through difficult times,' she says, as services are shut down across the country) and the Prime Minister (currently in the Middle East using speeches on 'democracy' as a cover to sell arms to everyone in sight) are busy demanding that their subjects tighten their belts, bravely endure Recessions and unite in the adopting of national austerity measures. While this is going on, scandals involving bank bailouts, corporate bonuses, mass job cuts and tax exemptions (while the average person pays a third of their income in taxes, a firm like Barclay's Bank, of which the Queen is a majority shareholder, pays 1 percent) continue.In 'Speech', rich folk try to appease Hitler in order to protect their vast assets, before then asking Brits to ignore the Great Depression, tighten their belts, suck it up, and nobly go to war for their country. Today it's the same story, sold with the same buzzwords. And of course, in each case, the lingo serves only to stress how ordinary Royals/bankers/politicians are to the middle and lower classes; 'The King's Speech' spends its entire running time reminding us that the King is 'just like us' with 'the very same problems'.But consider this. Throughout the film, the King and Lionel Logue, his speech therapist, refer to one another informally. Theirs is largely a relaxed relationship (Logue calls the King 'Bertie') and it is only at the end that Logue concedes and calls the King 'Your Majesty'. It is here that the King earns reverence and ceases to be Logue's equal, the message being that deference and submission are proper, as long as they are deserved. Expect this film to soften the blow when the Queen announces possibly two extravagant royal weddings this year, as well as elaborate celebrations to mark her Diamond Jubilee. 'We're all in this together' is the oft-repeated post-Recession, austerity catch phrase, but like the King's stammer, this phrase is just a red herring. A precursor to the war address. Today, twenty two out of twenty nine cabinet ministers (76 percent) are millionaires. Never has modern Britain been governed by such a narrow social base.Like 'Slumdog Millionaire', another Oscar winner, 'Speech's' 'triumph against the odds' fairy tale has attracted viewers, but it's mostly the King's three act homo-erotic love affair with Logue that resonates with them. The couple go through the standard 'boy meets, loses and gets girl' formula, a journey which seems to appeal to the masses. But who's the girl in this relationship? The audience is, because they're the ones getting Royally f***ed.5/10 – Worth one viewing.",Null,7,14,1 March 2011
Saturday Night Fever," Saturday Night Respite
","'An avowal of poverty is no disgrace to any man; to make no effort to escape it is indeed disgraceful.' – Thucydides 'The best way to escape from a problem is to solve it.' – Alan Saporta John Badham directs 'Saturday Night Fever'. The plot? A group of frustrated 1970s working class youths escape the drudgery of life by disappearing into a world of sex, drugs and the pulsating lights of local disco clubs. One of these kids, a guy called Tony Manero (played by John Travolta), meets a girl called Stephanie, a cute dancer who aspires to greater things.Being with Stephanie causes Tony to gradually become disillusioned with the life he is leading. Stuck in a dreary job and living with deadbeat parents, Tony finally decides to skip town, drop his loser friends and start afresh. Afterall, maybe he can be somebody. Maybe he can achieve something for himself.The film ends with Tony and Stephanie living together, both determined to help one another climb the ladder to success. Like most films, 'Saturday Night Fever' makes the mistake of suggesting that some external change in location will bring about some internal state of happiness, but perhaps its ending isn't meant to imply change. The film hints that this couple will forever be stuck in a rut.Directed by John Badham ('War Games'), 'Saturday Night Fever' is of course famous for its soundtrack and its groovy dance scenes. Yes, Travolta's portrayal of Manero comes across as being a bit camp nowadays, but this doesn't hamper the film. Virtually every shot, every cocky pose he strikes, is iconic.Ironically, beneath the film's razzle-dazzle is one depressing movie, very much akin to the gritty 'kitchen sink' and 'New Wave' dramas churned out by British and French film makers in the late 50s and early 60s. This kind of murky social realism would prove influential on Hollywood directors, giving birth to a string of neo realist Hollywood films in the late 1960s and 70s - though most masked depoliticization behind faux grit - arguably the most interesting period of American cinema.What's most interesting about 'Saturday Night Fever', though, is this: most films within this genre align their song and dance numbers with their audience's own desires. IE - we celebrate those succeeding on screen because we secretly yearn for that special brand of Hollywood escapism. The audience's act of escaping drudgery via cinema then becomes, in theory, the on screen act of Travolta escaping his grimy life via dance. But 'Saturday Night Fever' short circuits this fantasy at every turn, the film incrementally peeling back its disco lights to reveal a world of rape, drugs, suicide, class based frustrations and violent race wars. There is no escape, and the audience is always aware of what exactly its craving's are consoling.In this way, the film highlights the urgency with which man clings to easy, manufactured escapes. More importantly, the film demonstrates how the frustrations of the working classes are built up and then channeled down the social hierarchy, animosity misdirected and aimed at equally or less unfortunate people. Travolta articulates this during his 'cycle of s**t' speech toward the end of the film, in which he explains how his father's bitterness at having lost his job causes the old man to 'take a s**t' on his son, who passes 'the s**t' on to his Italian friends, who passes 'the s**t' on to the Mexican gangs etc etc. The film's cure to this cycle of animosity is a kind of working class brotherhood. It suggests the forging of an empathic connection, born of collective suffering, between all men. Recognise the basic antagonistic struggle in which we are all caught, and join forces in a sort of mutual struggle.8.5/10 – The 70s were odd. Even the silliest films had a kind of social urgency or attachment. Nowadays we have 'Slumdog Millionaire' and 'High School Musical', then we had 'Rocky' and 'Saturday Night Fever'. Is it because films then seemed to be about real people, or because today's people aren't really real?",Null,4,6,3 October 2009
Moneyball," Hey Pete, why doesn't your boss travel with the team?
","Directed by Bennett Miller, 'Moneyball' stars Brad Pitt as Billy Beane, the general manager of the Oakland Athletics baseball team. When he loses three star players in one season, Beane is forced to rebuild his squad. The problem is, Oakland's owners are broke. Beane thus adopts a new strategy. He hires an economics guru, Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), and uses a sophisticated sabermetric approach to analysing, scouting and acquiring players. Using this method he buys a number of 'cheap' players, and uses them to win 20 consecutive games, an American League record.'Moneyball' is at its best when it's telling a familiar, underdog tale. This is a David vs Goliath battle in which little guys go up against Big Money. Organised sports as a rigged game, 'Moneyball' details the way in which money leads to an accumulation of power and so the amassing of resources to the detriment of others. This has led to one chunk of American film critics reading the tale as both an attack on capitalism and a love letter to Occupy Movements. Hilariously, another chunk of critics read the film as being a celebration of the 'progressive power of free markets', 'value creation' and 'the rational, free, independent judgement of innovators'. According to such oppositional views, the film either pities poor Billy Beane for being crushed by Big Money, or celebrates him for being innovative and making efficient use of underused, overlooked workers. The latter view offers the usual free market fundamentalism: competition promotes efficiency, innovation, forces employees to work harder and faster, urges employers to maximise the use of their capital, to make better use of dollar-to-talent ratios, and incentivises the use of those who don't command as much in labour markets. In real life, truth's almost the complete opposite (capitalism hampers innovation, progress, aggregate efficiency goes down etc).Epitomizing the film's ideological confusion are readings related to its treatment of baseball. Several critics see 'Moneyball' as highlighting how math, science and a very specific corporate logic 'dehumanises' and so sullies sports. To such critics, Beane, who tries to calculate his way to success by collating statistics, has given birth to a kind of robotic, post-human, soulless game in which players are treated as a collection of reliably reproducible and measured machine traits. How dare Billy Beane! But humans are and have always been machines. Beane's highly rigid method of analysis is no different to that of experienced coaches and selectors. Such selectors may seem to be choosing players based on instincts and gut feelings, but in reality are filtering players through their own formulae and algorithms. They may not know it, but they're making, or attempting to make, choices as rational as any computer. Beane's more rigid method merely forces us to confront how mechanistic humans always are, which of course is depressing. Indeed, 'Moneyball' may be the most depressing ball movie out there, morphing American's two religions – capitalism and baseball – into a noxious, fluorescent-lit numbers game, humans born to be reductively tabulated, quantified and disposed of, all in the name of profit curves, 'winning' and GDPs.'Moneyball' was written by Steve Zaillian, who wrote 'Schindler's List', and Aaron Sorkin, who wrote 'The Social Network'. Like 'List', the film fetishizes the idea of a kind of 'humanistic capitalism'. It offers 'more capitalism' and the 'cleverer use of players/workers' as a solution to what are really problems of exploitation. If your best players/workers/ideas are constantly being poached by wealthier clubs, forcing you to become 'organ donors to the rich', then suck it up and be a smarter Social Darwinist. This, of course, echoes Sorkin's 'The Social Network' screenplay. Hinging on nerds vs bullies narratives, both 'Moneyball' and 'Network' pretend to offer critique, but really offer wolves dressed as populist sheep. Think out-of-the-box, harder and smarter, and you'll compete with the big leagues. It's the American way. Incidentally, Billy Beane's role in elevating Oakland has been hugely over emphasised. The team thrived primarily because of superb pitching and not because of Beane's methodology. During the period displayed in the film, Oakland were second in the league in fewest runs allowed, but finished in the bottom half in runs scored. Why? Because of three dominant pitchers: Mark Mulder, Tim Hudson, and Barry Zito. All three wee early-round draft picks, highly scouted and were not selected using Beane's methodology.Ironically, 20th century baseball has achieved a much higher level of competitive balance than most other ball games. Some attribute this to funding caps and 'tax systems' which essentially divert profits to smaller teams. Indeed, the year 2013 also marks the first year to feature 'competitive balance draft picks', which awards players, via lottery, to small-market, low revenue teams. Most find this kind of 'wealth distribution' abhorrent, some find it a necessity, whilst most hardcore post neoclassical economists, a field now called thermoeconomics, find such acts to be a positively pointless gesture when talking in terms of systems as a whole. The fact remains, though, that the difference between top and bottom tier baseball teams seems, at least for now, to be narrowing (roughly a 20 percentage points difference, 10 points plus or minus, between the best and worst teams).'Moneyball' was directed by Bennett Miller. It's a slick film, always fascinating and Miller keeps things moving at a fast pace. Unlike most baseball movies, Miller's action takes place behind the scenes, in boardrooms, cubicles and in front of computer screens and TV monitors. The film's closing title card states that the Red Sox would win using Beane's methodology, but this is a kind of lie. The Red Sox had the 2nd highest baseball payroll of 2004.7.9/10 – Entertaining but thin. Worth one viewing.",Null,1,1,24 June 2013
The Avengers," Whedon Anonymous
","Joss Whedon's 'The Avengers' opens with the arrival of Loki (Tom Hiddleson), Norse God of Mischief, on the planet Earth. Here he encounters Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), leader of a superhero law enforcement agency. This introductory sequence is designed to show off both Loki's ruthlessness and the manly coolness of Nick Fury, but it achieves neither. It's an over-long sequence, filled with bad CGI and second-rate action.The film then offers a series of vignettes in which Fury assembles a group of superheroes, including Captain America (Chris Evans), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). Their task? Stop Loki and his giant CGI army. The problem? All these superheroes are too busy bickering to band together, organise and efficiently kick butt.Your typical Whedon tale centres on a Scooby Doo gangs of likable heroes ('Serenity', 'Firefly', 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer', 'The Astonishing X-Men' etc) and ends with a hero sacrificially dying for the greater good. Whedon's heroes are also never able to prevail without a little help from their buddies, and there is always some tension between being the sole saviour and having to work with others to accomplish a goal. As he typically has only tiny budgets at his disposal, Whedon also relies heavily on clever writing, witty banter and comedic irreverence to generate excitement. With 'The Avengers', however, he has been granted zillions of dollars and has been unconsciously domesticated by the demands of the summer blockbuster. The result is a film which is continually pulling in two directions, wanting to be huge, bloated and filled with generic spectacle on one hand, and wanting to be clever, small and intimate on the other. In the end, the vulgarity of money wins out over good prose.Still, a number of classic Whedon moments do survive. One cleverly written vignette has Black Widow tied to a chair, seemingly being interrogated by a gang of villains. We then learn that it is she who is in control of the situation and that it is SHE who is interrogating THEM. Another clever moment sees Loki imprisoned in a glass cage at the heart of our heroes' stronghold (yes, that cliché again), no one realising that Loki has designed his own capture, the God of Mischief attempting to live up to his namesake and sow discord within his enemy's own home. Most of the film's other good scenes revolve around the Hulk, who's imbued with much pathos by Mark Ruffalo, an actor renowned for his many melancholic-man roles; Ruffalo elevates everything he touches.The rest of 'The Avengers' unfortunately degenerates into CGI fisticuffs, Michael Bay styled mayhem, exploding cities, CGI aliens, errant missiles and sequences which feel like an angry kid bashing action figures together. Here's a film which spends zillions of dollars bludgeoning us, when a guy like Whedon can cook up infinitely more excitement with a simple rope, chair or the sheer possibility that the Hulk might go schizoid. Like most Marvel projects, 'The Avengers' mistakes excess for excitement.Whedon's never been a good visualist. Even his stint writing for the 'X-Men' comics ('The Astonishing X-Men', a series arc which plays almost exactly like Whedon's 'The Avengers' movie) relied more on words, banter, and the energy of his prose than well drawn panels. In this regard, most of 'The Avengers' is slow and generically shot, though it does contain a few great visuals. A brief shot of a SWAT squad advancing on the Hulk's tiny shack is particularly cool. Beyond this, the film offers the usual super-hero subtext. Here the enemy hopes to invade America (New York) and obtain the Tesseract, a much coveted cube which can provide endless energy and which was placed on Earth thousands of years ago by Gods. Our heroes, of course, band together to stop the theft of the Tesseract. In a previous Marvel film, 'Captain America', a Nazi figure called Red Skull also attempted to acquire this energy source. In Marvel lore, it's always our squeaky clean, white Western ubermensch who decide who gets to keep Earth's resources. Same as the real world, though the Pentagon rarely wears spandex when it's nuking for oil grids.Incidentally, Whedon's Loki is one of the most pathetic super-villains of all time. He's a whiny dude, with all the menace of a high school chemistry teacher. You'd think The Avengers would assemble only for big fish, but no. They apparently take on wimpy Norse Gods as well.7.5/10 – See Josh Trank's 'Chronicle'.",Null,4,8,24 August 2013
Angels & Demons," Oh God, not another one...
","My dad was a sailor. He used to beat me in Morse Code and spell out I LOVE U in child abuse. But even that experience wasn't as painful as watching this wacky crap. How could the Vatican, which released a statement denouncing 'Angels and Demons', find anything in this film offensive?

Black Swan," Not too old to die young
","Satoshi Kon directed 'Perfect Blue' in 1998. That film centred on a character called Mima, a young pop-star who leaves her clean-cut pop band in the hopes of beginning a career as an actress. But as Mima is forced into racier material, the film's narrative begins to break down, points-of-views, dreams, nightmares and private delusions overlapping and co-mingling. Eventually it becomes clear that Mima's breakdown is the result of, or induced by, a deeply disturbing culture. She's a victim of a world which pits sister against sister, which demands conformity, perfection, submission, is deeply sexist, bows to the tyranny of the image and is obsessed with both celebrity and a form of feminine perfection which tends toward neuroses, mental instability and finally collapse.Darren Aronofsky bought the rights to 'Perfect Blue' over a decade ago, an act which essentially allows him to rip it off with 'Black Swan'. His film borrows 'Blue's' plot, themes, shots, but switches acting for ballet and changes Mima's name to Nina. And so Nina, played by Natalie Portman, is a young ballet dancer. She takes on the task of portraying both the white swan and black swan roles in an upcoming production of Swan Lake. Unfortunately Nina's director, sleazily played by Vincent Cassel, doesn't believe Nina to be capable of portraying both roles. Nina's a fine white swan, he says, but isn't sexy, dark and brooding enough to be a black swan as well. 'You need to touch yourself and live a little,' Cassel says. Nina takes it upon herself to prove this man wrong. She too can be a slut, and so soar! Both 'Perfect Blue' and 'Black Swan' then deal with a very specific identity split; the woman's pressure to be both virgin and whore, good girl and bad, and so a success. But as their original self images are undermined and deemed not sufficient, both girls become increasingly unstable, living up to expectations and personality images which must be painfully forged and constantly maintained. They must 'break themselves down' in order to be 'rebuilt' for an Other's gaze. In 'Perfect' you're always aware of how this gaze is socially forged (fans, cameras, sexist and patriarchal pressures, money etc), whilst in 'Swan', other women, and Nina herself, largely become the 'problem'; the source of mental illness.Nina begins to change. Once frigid, a virgin, and a thoroughly good girl, Nina eventually succeeds in becoming a total slut, raving in dance clubs, having lesbian sex, fantasising about murder (she symbolically kills a rival/double and thus becomes TOTALLY BAD) and raging against everyone. She's the new ideal, both good girl and bad, a fact which angers ageing ballerina Beth (Winona Ryder), who is forced to confront the impossibility of maintaining the 'necessary' level of perfection. In 'Perfect Blue', Ryder's character is called Rumi, both women once successful in their younger days but now pushed aside to make way for younger models. In both films older women hate their younger replacements, but 'Perfect' looks for root causes and ends with sympathy for its elder woman, whilst 'Swan's' elderly women remain distant and/or villainous. Indeed, even Nina's mother, an ex ballerina who obsessively pushes her daughter, is treated as yet another monstrous woman by Aronofsky, rather than victim.Aronofsky and Satoshi's differing preoccupations thus lead to vastly different climaxes. In 'Perfect', Mima recognises the causes of her breakdown, rebels and asserts her own identity. She will henceforth be what she wants to be. In 'Swan', Nina literally self-destructs on a ballet stage. The implication is that Nina suicidally gives her body wholly over to both the stage and the gaze; she is entirely yours, entirely possessed, a submission which echoes that of Ram the Wrestler in Aronofsky's last picture. Both deal with the giving of flesh over to the idea of celebrity, worth and fame, of giving one's flesh entirely over to art, until healthy passions give way to a very neurotic need to affirm one's worth to a culture which deems them worthless. But unlike 'Perfect', 'Swan's' more misogynistic than about misogyny. It's about 'perfection' in a much more general sense. But seeking perfection and mastery in, say, the arts or sciences, is a perfectly noble or even healthy goal. Seeking perfection due to socially constructed feminine ideals is something else altogether. Aronofsky's film deals with the former, and so ends with a kind of lie.Bizarrely, 'Swan' doesn't recognise its aesthetic as being totally camp. The film is totally clichéd, totally goofy, filled with silly dialogue, obvious symbolism, material that has long been the subject of parody and plays like an Italian giallo movie, yet Aronofsky takes everything ULTRA SERIOUSLY. Indeed, much of 'Swan' is comprised of chunks of better movies. You have bits of early DePalma, early Polanski (especially 'Repulsion'), 'Showgirls', 'The Red Shoes', 'Black Narcissus', and of course 'All about Eve'. Nina's tale is also a less sophisticated, less touching version of Betty's tale in 'Mulholland Drive' (also with doubles, identity blurring and mental breakdowns). 'Swan' also borrows a number of well worn ballet clichés, like the 'ballerina who dies in the end' cliché ('Waterloo Bridge', 'Red Shoes', 'Red Danube', 'Spectre of the Rose', 'Story of Three Lovers'), the 'female vamptress cliché', the 'one dancer embodies the dark flip-side of the other cliché', the 'psychosomatic disorder cliché' ('Limelight', 'Grand Hotel') and the 'female rivalry cliché', seen in dance films like 'Wishing Star', 'Showgirls', 'Dance, Girl, Dance', 'The Unfinished Dance', 'Suspria', and the classic 'Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?' Aronofsky, though, acts like these films don't exist.6/10 – See Altman's 'The Company'.",Null,1,2,4 March 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Cash Cow Cinema
","The 'Pirates of the Caribbean' franchise takes the oddball, zany adventures of early Hollywood pirate movies ('The Black Pirate', 'Captain Blood', 'The Buccaneer', 'The Sea Hawk', 'The Black Swan', 'Captain Kidd', 'Hornblower', 'Blackbeard', 'The Crimson Pirate', 'Fairwind to Java') and spins them off into even wackier territory. Indeed, much of the joys of the first three films were in watching the various tales and characters veer off into increasingly mad, busy and nonsensical avenues. Unfortunately this excess quickly got out of hand, 'action sequences' prolonged to boredom inducing lengths, dull subplots piled upon dull subplots. Eventually the franchise struggled to modulate its madness and started to take itself too seriously.'Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides', the fourth film in the franchise, has a shorter running time than its siblings. It's more light-footed, moves better and keeps the level of subplots and characters somewhat down, though its best madcap moments (mermaid attacks, Johnny Depp swinging from coconut trees, giant ships stuck in tiny bottles) never match the wacky highs, comedic power poses and ridiculous gags of the previous movies.All actors love acting in pirate movies – it gives them a chance to chew scenery and munch on deliciously ridiculous dialogue – and so most of the cast is a delight to watch. The dull, straight faced Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are jettisoned for this instalment, leaving more room for tongue-in-cheek grandstanding and juicy dialogue chewing. The dialogue here is itself really good, witty and injected with a kind of deliberate theatricality ('Death is upon us as we sail for the Fountain of Youth!', 'I support the missionary's position!').The plot is hokum, but the actual construction of the script is somewhat interesting. It revolves around a series of romances, each epitomising a different type of romantic love (love for one's self, unconditional love, selfish love, love for a father, love for one one cannot love, a love-hate romance etc). Director Rob Marshall is too much of a hack to make anything of this. The production belongs to its actors, set-designers and writers. Marshall's too prim and proper to properly marshal their madness. 7.9/10 – This is apparently the eight most profitable film ever made. Worth one viewing.",Null,3,3,29 August 2011
Come and See," Makes Schindler's List look like Sesame Street
","Elem Klimov directs 'Come and See'. While the film predominantly follows the rites-of-passage journey of a young boy, it is remarkable how often and effortlessly Klimov shifts visual perspective, offering us the objective and subjective states of a wide range of characters and objects. For example, in one of the films most surreal scenes, several characters are shown guiding a cow across what seems to be open and unguarded terrain. Suddenly a series of intense firefights break out. Several characters are killed, but it is the fate of the cow with which the film is most preoccupied.The images of the cow standing untouched by the raging skirmish, then struck by a barrage of bullets, and finally of its eyes rapidly shifting and dilating before death, are indicative of 'Come and See's' ability to produce indelible images from what are often quite standard war film situations. Like Malick, Klimov is as much interested in the landscape (and the objects and people that inhabit it), as he is in representing the minutiae and widening horror of his protagonist's journey from home to the multiple sites of slaughter and genocide that mar his countryside.The journey of a wide-eyed innocent across apocalyptic terrain is common territory for the war film (Ichikawa's 'The Burmese Harp', Tarkovsky's 'Ivan's Childhood', 'The Human Condition' etc), but Klimov is going for a much more macabre tone, bludgeoning us with the sheer intensity and sick morbidity of his images.Unlike, say, 'Schindler's List', 'Come and See' is also remarkable for its use of abstract colour and sound. This is not a realist film; its shocks and effects are more dreamlike, from the mutedness of its burnished cinematography, to the extraordinary close-ups of several of its characters' impossibly aged faces, to the hyper expressive performances of many of its actors, to the impressionistic and at times almost expressionistic use of sound. In this context, the title of the film is not just a call for audiences to bear witness, to 'see' that which is not imaginable, that which has little visual record, and to get a sense of the physical conditions (the 'come' of the title) experienced by those during the war, but a description or pointer towards the more spectatorial expectations of the film. Of course the order 'come and see' also functions as an exploitative challenge; 'Come and see if you dare!' Indeed, many Chinese war-porn/propaganda films feature eerily similar titles.The film is essentially an epic journey and many of its images possess an almost Dantesque quality. It can also be seen as a 'coming of age' film, a remarkable 'coming' or progression (or is it regression?) that is etched upon the utterly transformed face of its central character. Unsurprisingly, Spielberg screened 'Come and See' several times for cast and crew prior to shooting his Holocaust film. 'See' would prove a huge influence on Spielberg's 'Empire of the Sun', 'Schindler's List', 'Wr Horse' and 'Private Ryan', in its mixture of child-like innocence (lots of dollying in to the shocked children's faces) and brutality. This is the worst aspect of Klimov's legacy, his film opening the doorway for an onslaught of other shock-porn movies - all the way to Gibson's 'The Passion of the Christ' - all of which pretend to be history lessons and important 'humane' testimonies, when in reality they simply use progressions in technology to escalate violence levels, push tolerance levels and are built around a primary need to jolt apathetic, desensitised audiences. Hilariously, as war-porn gets more hard-core, in real life the numbers of genocides, wars and atrocities demonstrably increase, whilst media coverage decreases and public apathy increases. This is the mistake of all 'war films': people don't repeat because they forget (the implication being that we must therefore shock ourselves into awareness), we forget because we repeat (see 'The Shining'). The human animal needs denial more than food.So while 'Come and See' and its Spielberg imitators lack any real historical depth, complexity, nuance, understanding of human beings, and trade in simple exploitation, they also possess a kind of psychological naivety, perhaps best exemplified by Klimov's final scene, in which a kid essentially refuses to shoot a young Hitler. WW2's engine had little to do with Hitler, but here he's reduced to the genesis of evil, the seed from which WW2 blossoms.Though commissioned by the Soviet Union as a propaganda piece, 'Come and See' was made shortly prior to the fall of the Iron Curtain, a period in which artists had a certain amount of freedom. Klimov's films is thus at times self consciously a meditation on Stalinist war films. In this regard the film literally begins upon the beach where Tarkovsky's 'Ivan' ends, from where it attempts to create a new 'war narrative', shunting aside Stalinist glorification for a kind of psychological shell shock. The result, though, is basically a Soviet version of 'Men Behind the Sun', the infamous Chinese propaganda film in which we're called to bear witness to the activities of sadistic Japanese soldiers. In Klimov's case - the film focuses on the Nazi atrocities in Byelorussia - we leer at sadistic, vile, rapacious, murderous and cowardly Nazis while Communist partisans are portrayed as playful, comradely and righteous people. If a countries leadership willingly sided with the Germans from 1939-41, invaded countries (Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Finland etc) carried out numerous atrocities against other nations and their own people and supported the Gulag system, then the viewer needs to be extremely careful when they view material that has been officially sanctioned by that leadership.8/10 - Worth one viewing.",Null,40,60,11 July 2007
The New World," Been there, done that
","Captain John Smith and his men erect a small fort at the edge of a forest, claiming Virginia in the name of the British Empire. They have hopes of finding gold and wealth, but after months of living in this harsh environment, gradually begin to die of disease and starvation. Seeking help for his men, John Smith (Colin Farell) ventures off into the forest with a small band of sailors. He hopes to ask the Algonquian tribes for assistance, but is instead captured by the Powahtan warriors. The Powahtans take him to their village, where he spends several months living amongst the natives. It is here that Smith falls in love with Pocahontas, a local girl.In typical Malick fashion, Smith initially romanticises the native villagers. 'They have no jealousy,' he says, 'no sense of possession'. Smith sees them as 'beautiful' and 'perfect', devoid of 'greed', 'pride' or 'envy'. But when the natives attack the English fort, Smith's idealistic view of them changes and he abandons Pocahontas.Enter John Rolfe (Chris Bale), a British plantation owner. Rolfe falls in love with Pocahontas and takes her back to England. She journey's with him to this New World, where she meets the Queen, has a baby and reminisces about the past. The film then ends. The first half hour of Terrence Malick's fourth film is brilliant. He captures the energy of Colonization and contrasts it with the confusion of the natives, as they spy upon these white skinned Gods.Unfortunately it's all downhill from here, as virtually everything done in this film Malick has done before and done better. The romance between Smith and Pocahontas is never convincing, lacking the chemistry seen between the leads in 'Badlands' and 'Days of Heaven'. The duo also never share any substantial or interesting moments together and no attempt is made to show how the two 'aliens' understand each another and communicate. Instead, they simply lock eyes and roll in the grass. Thematically, there's also nothing new. All of Malick's films feature characters returning to the pastoral realm of Henry Thoreau. They run from civilisation and attempt to forge a natural paradise. This idyllic haven then withers as either disillusionment creeps in or civilisation encroaches. Here, Malick has Smith fleeing from the 'New World' (Europe) and finding 'peace' amongst the natives. But this primitive world loses its appeal as a sort of sickness and disenchantment begins to creep in. A similar change takes place in 'The Thin Red Line', when a character called Witt re-evaluates his perceptions regarding local islanders. In contrast, Pocahontas is taken to the 'new world' of England, but she promptly feels stymied and hungers for her 'old world' back in Virginia. But Malick never delves into anything beyond the superficial. He fails to examine the effects of Colonization on the natives, never effectively compares the 'old world' with the 'new' and fails to look at how a real multi-cultural relationship/romance would work. But the biggest flaw in the film is the poor choice of music. Malick's ethereal imagery requires great music to act as the 'glue', binding the images together. His earlier films had iconic scores and memorable voice over narrations. But everything in 'The New World' is muted and second-rate (Horner's brilliant score was rejected due to editing problems), leaving nothing to really drive the picture forward. Couple this with a rather bland colour palette (the film is all browns and drab skies) and you have a film that simply lacks the sensuality of Malick's previous films.So 'The New World' is ultimately a creaky rehash of the usual Malick themes. He's made the same film four times, and attempts here to keep things fresh by using only subjective shots and an understated anti-narrative style. The idea here is to strip the film down so that it becomes a string of fleeting memories held together by ambient music, but it just doesn't work as well as his other efforts. 'The Thin Red Line' covered all this stuff before and in far greater detail, whilst Malick protégé David Green and other sensualists like Mann, Kar Wai Wong and Lynch have gone on to match Malick's sensual aesthetic.Malick originally studied philosophy and translated a book by German philosopher Martin Heidegger. His films all deal with the same philosophical ideas (a mix of Heidegger and Taoism), his characters all in search of an Edenic new world which seems lost but actually doesn't exist. As such, his characters all detach themselves from society and create Donnean islands unto themselves. They create their own morals, their own laws and live within their own private Edens. But Malick and Heidegger view human society as being no less natural than nature, and so Malick constantly contrasts the Romantic ideal of man-in-harmony-with-nature, with the Post Enlightenment ideal of man ordering or manipulating nature.For an elaboration of this philosophy, see my review of 'Badlands'. Suffice to say, Malick's 'romantics' are searching for some mythical wholeness which is unattainable precisely because all pre-enlightenment myths of wholeness have been displaced by the modern discovery of a plurality of worlds. The tensions of Malick's films, however, arise from the fact that the modern world which allows for all, also allows for nothing. As plurality is threatening, the Social Order attempts to reduce this threatening plurality - and the sceptical undermining of knowledge and morality it entails - to one universal world again by means of conquest and domination. And that is the paradox Malick explores: the Post Enlightenment world which preaches multiplicity but seeks to impose its own unity, its own singular Law (imperialism/colonialism/the Big Other), and the Romantic Ideal which promises some spiritual wholeness, but delivers only the lawless, malevolence of Nature.8/10 - Malick's first failure. Take a look at an amazing book by Harry Thompson called 'This Thing of Darkness' which touches upon similar themes and so much more.",Null,0,1,6 May 2008
Scarface," Fly Away Little Pelican
","'Capitalism too has to keep moving, keep expanding, or it dies. And because logarithmic growth is in its DNA, it can only grow on the basis of ever-increasing levels of consumption.' - John Sanbonmatsu For French philosopher Jean Baudrillard, our era of post-modernity eradicates the traditional logic of model and copy, sign and referent. Signs now refer only to other signs, images to other images, and the world itself becomes a kind of hyper-real orgy, an inextricable landscape of simulations and simulacra.Brian De Palma's 'Scarface' is a 1983 remake of Howard Hawks' 1932 gangster classic. Unlike Hawks' film, however, De Palma's aesthetic is resolutely postmodern. It is also a film which is explicitly about a postmodern culture, specifically one which is ruled by desire, production and which thrives on the constant and insatiable circulation of money, drugs, images and objects. Unlike other gangster films, the look of 'Scarface' is thus aggressively pop, more akin to 'A Clockwork Orange' (itself a future world in which all art, actions and objects are rendered impotent) than the more provincial world of 'The Godfather'.De Palma's aesthetic therefore contributes to a general 'derealization' of the world, in which there seems no clear distinction between reality and artifice. Consider the way the various sunsets in the film - outdoors, on indoor murals, on our hero, Tony Montana's shirts (Al Pacino), on giant billboards etc - seem equally unreal. Miami and the 'billboard' Miami, are all part of a single simulacrum. Throw in countless references to the original 'Scarface', and early gangster flicks like 'Little Ceasar' and 'The Public Enemy', and you have a film that is obsessed with its own artifice. Where then, do these characters exist?Midway in the film, during a montage sequence, De Palma traces Tony's rise to the top of his own criminal empire whilst the song 'Push it to the limit' plays over images of whirring money-counting machines. It's a cheesy scene, but the film's point is clear. There is no anchor to Tony's inflationary economy, no limit, no equivalence between labour and profit. In a reversal of his 'Get To Know Your Rabbit', De Palma has cocaine highs echo the fantasy of capitalism; a perpetual money machine, without limits, ends or consequences, that spits out cash faster than eyes can count.But capitalism also functions like cocaine, in that it is an all consuming 'substance' that engenders narcissism, egomania, delusional paranoia, pleasure and, of course, inescapable addictions which induce a need for more and more. Cocaine, in short, is capital, a point that is reinforced when Tony's cocaine addiction becomes inseparable from his limitless desire for 'the world and everything in it'.More than any other gangster movie, 'Scarface' thus captures a totally madcap world; an almost Baudrillardian simulation obsessed with desire and production. Everywhere capital, power and desire form boundless circuits which dissolve previous social codes and reterritorialize them in simulations of traditional codes, observing no law but that of limitless excess. The 'look' of the film is thus not only the look of the cocaine experience, but the 'look' of late capitalism itself.Because it is mired in this tacky shamelessness, people have labelled 'Scarface' a sort of inferior 'junk food' sibling to supposedly more 'authentic' and 'real' films like 'Goodfellas'. But it is the very falsity of 'Scarface' that makes it real. A huge generational shift took place during the 1980s (the 'shame free' enjoyment of pornography, of Bling, of video game mega violence etc) and one of the reasons 'Scarface' was so critically unpopular at the time was that it went against the Reaganite grain. Here is your American Dream, it said, and feel how tawdry, how plastic, how criminal it is at its base. 'The World is Yours', but what a hollow world it is.'Scarface' is thus the first Bling Film, grotesque in its glitzy 80s materialism. But it is Bling as purgatory. You can buy the stuff, snort the cocaine, get the woman, live in the mansion, but nothing will fill that existential lack. When Tony growls, 'Is this it? fking sucking, snorting?', it is not just the American Dream rendered cynical, it approaches Sartre in its existential ennui: 'Is this it? Breathing, eating, defecating?'With its Tarantino-styled chainsaw scene, pre-'Miami Vice' art design and shameless vulgarity, 'Scarface' also marks the point at which the old gangster paradigm was superseded. 'Scarface' intuits a future landscape of video game hyper-reality and violence as always excessive. It posits crime as incessant, paranoid and vengeful (revenge against destiny, competitors, class beginnings, genetic identity etc) and is one of the few gangster films to equate violence with castration, pleasure with self-abuse and action with male-impotency.Note too that 'Scarface' opens, not in garish overdrive, but with newsreel footage of Cubans being expelled for disobeying the 'spirit of communism'. Birthed in the jails of Castro's Cuba, Tony's path to psycho-pathology is the result of ideological rejection; his excesses are the mirror image of the communist ethos. With Tony sitting in his lair like a paranoid President ('Is this it? Snorting? Vote rigging? Executing?'), fretfully protecting his expanding empire, surrounded by banks and banks of security cameras and a weapon's cache that would formally only have been in possession by a military, the film's bloodbath finale now reads like a pessimistic take on modern America, quaintly convinced that it can take on everyone at its own ultra violent video game.8.9/10 - An awful future, slowly dreaming itself awake.",Null,8,13,28 June 2009
Howl's Moving Castle," Sophie, are we a family?
","Hayao Miyazaki's 'Howl's Moving Castle' revolves around Sophie, an insecure young woman who is transformed into an old lady by a spiteful witch. An outcast before her transformation, Sophie takes to her new body like a fish to water; she leaves her bustling town for the anonymity of life in the mountains. Here she gets a job working for Howl, a powerful wizard.As is typical of Miyazaki, 'Castle' is filled with loving details, picturesque towns, interesting machines, beautiful landscapes and that fusion of steam-punk and retro-art which Miyazaki so adores. More interesting is the way all of Miyazaki's major characters go through a physical metamorphosis. Sophie's outward appearance, for example, seems to fluctuate based on self-esteem and mood. Howl is similarly preoccupied with 'how he looks', using potions and magic to create the illusion of a handsome wizard.These themes dovetail into the film's thoughts of war and conflict. Here Howl's gradually tainted by partaking in a war between two rival cultures. The more he fights, the more his body becomes black and monstrous. He also literally 'loses his heart'. For Miyazaki, deeds and actions affect beauty as strongly as private perceptions. You are what you do.'Howl's Moving Castle' was based on a novel by British author Diana Wynee Jones. Miyazaki has altered Jones' tale slightly, however, and included vast air wars which he says were designed to evoke the Western invasion of Iraq. 'The film was profoundly impacted by the war in Iraq,' Miyazaki would later reveal. 'The reason I didn't attend the Academy Awards was because I didn't want to visit a country that was bombing Iraq.' In this regard, the film moves slowly from peace to chaos. When propaganda fliers fall from the sky (perhaps echoing the 2002 dropping of 500,000 pamphlets on Iraq by US airships), Miyazaki's landscapes begin their slow slide toward smoke and flame. For Miyazaki, peace with oneself forestalls conflict, but more importantly, those who pretend to oppose 'evil' often partake in the very 'evils' they denounce. By the film's climax, all sides are responsible, even Howl, who spends his days and nights catching the bombs which threaten to fall on innocent civilians. When he retaliates against those who drop them, his hands become overrun with black feathers; he begins to turn into the very monsters he decries.'Which is who?' Sophia asks, looking up as armadas swirl. 'What difference does it make?' comes the reply. Throughout the film, divisions between 'us' and 'them' seem irrelevant. There can be no 'good' and 'bad', no 'love' and 'hate' when the sheer act of partaking in violence makes everyone indistinguishable. Such a stance is reductive and at times false - one can oppose evil and violence, even with violence, and not be 'evil' - but nevertheless offers an interesting contrast when we consider how wars are actually mis-sold ('We're under attack because we love freedom, and our enemy hates freedom. They hate and we love. We differ from our enemy because we love. Our enemy hates.' - George Bush).Whilst 'Howls' first three acts are strong, its final act overwhelms its audience with confusing subplots which make little sense upon first viewing. Only with re-watches do Miyazaki's intentions become clear. Indeed, the film becomes more tragic with familiarity. Howl, for example, is revealed to have 'caught falling stars' as a child, saving them from impact and so death. One of these 'falling stars' he 'gives his heart to' in order to 'save its life'. As Howl grows up, this desire to 'catch falling stars' stays with him; like the infamous dream in The Catcher in the Rye, Howl's preoccupied with preserving life.The 'castle' of Miyazaki's title refers to Howl's home, a bulbous walking machine which epitomises Howl's rootlessness. As the film progresses, this castle falls apart, until it is reborn with wings. Howl and Sophie then fly off into the horizon, recalling an early, charming scene in which he quite literally sweeps the girl off her feet. The film climaxes with conventional light-shows of the kind you don't usually associate with Miyazaki. Howl's also designed to resemble traditional Manga heroes (sharp hair, big eyes, triangular jaw), lending some of the film's visuals a familiar feel. Still, the film's early moments, aided by composer Joe Hisaishi, are as good as Miyazaki at his best.8/10 – Multiple viewings required.",Null,1,2,16 January 2014
Walk the Line," Sooner or later, God'll cut you down
","Written and directed by James Mangold, 'Walk the Line' charts the life and times of renowned country music artist Jonny Cash. The film stars Joaquin Phoenix as Cash and Reese Witherspoon as June Carter, the woman with whom Cash has an elaborate romance.Despite likable performances by Phoenix and Witherspoon, 'Walk the Line' is wholly formulaic. Unfolding like a superhero origins tale, the film watches as Cash rises from humble beginnings, dons a costume, becomes a star, drug addict and then lover. Fidelity and faithfulness are the film's chief preoccupations – the 'walking the line' of its title – Cash called upon to be faithful to a wife he betrays and then a lover he gives up a serious drug addiction to be with. Though a by-the-numbers biopic, and though it completely flattens and simplifies a rich life, 'Walk the Line' is entertaining, glossy and ends on a cute note.7.9/10 – Worth one viewing.

Alien 3," Given the nature of our indigenous population, I would suggest clothes
","Structured as a series of nightmares, the 'Alien' franchise sees actress Sigourney Weaver playing Ellen Ripley, a female astronaut who is repeatedly menaced by phallic and vaginal alien creatures. Throughout the series, Ripley bounces from hell to worse, the poor girl persecuted, tormented and subjected to ridiculously extreme ordeals. By the franchise's fourth instalment, Ripley can't even die peacefully; her body is cloned and resurrected for the purpose of torturous marriages with the very alien monsters she seems unable to escape.Bleak, grimy and hopeless, David Fincher's 'Alien 3' is one of the more interesting films in the 'Alien' franchise. The film was originally to be based on a script by science fiction author William Gibson, but that screenplay was jettisoned. Another screenplay was written by Vincent Ward, but this was also discarded. Ward's script, oft voted one of the greatest unfilmed scifi screenplays of all time, saw Ripley marooned on wooden Monastery Planet populated by Luddite monks. The monks view Ripley as a sexual temptation sent by God and the alien she brings with her as a manifestation of God's wrath. This script was loosely influenced by the first Dark Horse graphic novels, published in the 1980s, set in the Alien universe ('Alien: Book One'). Those comics began to introduce religious elements into the series, the alien monsters worshipped by cults, viewed as Gods by some, satanic or apocalyptic creatures by others. Ridley Scott's 'Prometheus' tries to recapture some of these elements, its heroine a Christian girl who's looking for God but who finds only death, nightmarish monsters and a spiritually vile and/or vacant universe. This unrelenting pessimism – a kind of messed up, corporeal religion in which man's abandoned by God and repeatedly raped by monsters – is the franchise's best quality.Fincher's 'Alien 3' aims for a similar nihilism. It uses elements from Ward's script, but changes the Luddite monastery into a penal colony populated by rapists and murderers who have 'found God'. Ripley teams up with this band of convicts to defeat her own private little monster, an alien creature which follows her from LV-426, the planet seen in the previous 2 'Alien' films.It's a good idea, but almost nothing works in Fincher's film. The idea of combining Ward's monks with criminals offers nothing. Better to pick one idea and stick with it. The film's thriller set pieces, horror moments and special effects are also atrocious, as is the film's dialogue, which reeks of bad screen writing. Sigourney Weaver – iconic with her bald, shaven head – sells her lines, but the rest of Fincher's cast play their roles like cartoonish caricatures. Elsewhere Fincher overuses low angle shots, his camera work is poor, the film's big 'selflessness' theme is unexplored, most scenes flow awkwardly, the film's climax feels like a poor imitation of 'Terminator 2's' climax (Fincher made alterations when he learnt that Cameron's film was also ending with a sacrifice in a cauldron of lava), the shape and size of the film's alien creature is inconsistent throughout, and much of the film spends its time watching characters figure out things the audience already knows.Still, there are some good things in 'Alien 3'. The film bravely kills off the cast of 'Alien 2' (fans hate this), features an appropriately sickening autopsy on a little girl (the sequence was heavily cut), Fincher's production designers create perhaps the best sets and architectural designs of the franchise, Fincher's cinematography is uniformly excellent and the film ends with a strong scene, Ripley sacrificially falling into a pool of fire as an Alien bursts out of her chest. This sequence was omitted from the 'Alien 3: Assembly Cut', as Fincher never liked it and felt the idea was forced upon him by producers.As is well known, 'Alien 3' saw Fincher facing huge pre-production and on-set difficulties. He was hounded by producers, the film's script was incomplete when shooting began, was being re-written daily, and many sequences in the script were reverse engineered to accommodate grand sets which had already been constructed. Fincher would later disown the film. The problems he encountered here would lead to him become a very controlling, methodical director.7/10 – See 'Pandorum' for a slightly better take on the same material.

Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Indubitably, my dear Watson
","Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce played Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson throughout a 14 film series which started in 1939 and ended in 1946. Younger audiences are largely unfamiliar with these films, but some are very good and worth seeking out. For many, Basil and Nigel are the 'definitive' Holmes and Watson, some of their films even on par with Bogart's 'The Big Sleep' and 'The Maltese Falcon'.Guy Ritchie's 'Sherlock Holmes' series, of course, is a different beast altogether. Big budget action comedies, Ritchie's franchise depends heavily on the sheer exuberance of actor Robert Downey Jr, who plays the film's titular hero. Manic and overflowing with energy, Downey plays Holmes like a cross between two of his previous roles, the armoured superhero of 'Iron Man' and the motor-mouthed detective of 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang'. Resolutely postmodern, his Holmes is a jester, a trickster, pure Id unleashed. A giant bag of unrestrained ego, Downey's always right, seems to know the future and is always in total control, even when (or especially when) absolutely wrong.The sequel to Ritchie's first Holmes film, 'A Game of Shadows' possesses all the positives and negatives of its predecessor. It sports some nice Victorian-era scenery, is pleasantly under-lit for a blockbuster (lots of muted, murky lighting to simulate the grungy tone of late-1800s Britain) and Downey's schizophrenic performance mirrors, sadly, our own postmodern, drug-addled brains. Watching him is like checking your email and flicking through a digital TV-guide, all at once.Like Ritchie's first film, 'Shadows'' plot is mostly junk. Ritchie's script is lazy and cheats often, Holmes magically solving problems, deus ex machinas whimsically conjured up and our heroes figuring out ridiculously complex problems simply because their screenwriters will closure into fruition. In Ritchie's defence, this is exactly how most Holmes tales functioned. And while your typical detective story ends with a coda in which the hero 'explains' and 'ties together' the story the audience has just watched/read, Ritchie's 'Holmes' is packed with miniature mysteries within the main mystery which are 'solved' using similar flashback/flash-forward devices. We're thus offered a 'heightened' form of your typical detective walk-through.The film's villain is Professor Moriarty, a character who, like Holmes, possesses a near supernatural intellect. Some context: Charles Darwin published the 'The Origin of Species' in 1859 and Arthur Conan Doyle his first Sherlock Holmes story in 1887. It is commonly thought that Doyle's hero owed much to the development of the nineteenth century scientific method, with its emphasis on observation, logic, deduction and a dash of imagination and daring, but Holmes, with his unbelievable gifts for problem solving and frequent impossible leaps of logic, was originally meant as a joke, a mockery of the flurry of scientific discoveries that the era saw being made. Doyle was himself fond of mysticism, spiritualism, magic and often wrote about the Dark Arts. He cooked up Holmes as an attempt to ridicule that which he believed was slowly killing off various branches of enchantment, religion and spirituality. Of course this backfired completely. People are fond of order, control and the commanding aura of Holmes, and quickly took the detective to heart. From then on, Doyle found himself unable to abandon the character.What's interesting about 'Shadows' is that Moriarty is as much an uber intellect as Holmes (Holmes specialises in inductive, not deductive reasoning). Indeed, the guy's brain is so big, he's single handedly manipulating whole countries, controlling continents and orchestrating World War 1! Standout scenes include Holmes and Moriarty locking horns over chessboards, both masterminds attempting to anticipate and counter the anticipations and counters of their foes. These scenes of intellectual sparring work well. What works less well are the film's countless big, action set pieces, which seem tacked on to satisfy blockbuster junkies. In this regard, Ritchie's Holmes is very much a 21st century hero, a guy who must be all things to everyone, ticking all boxes, catering for all demographics and all audience needs. He's comedian, brain and muscle man, all at once. Part sitcom, part vaudeville, part mystery, part action movie, it's the kind of film that's too dumb to take seriously, but, paradoxically, whenever it takes itself seriously you want it to shut up and get back to comical buffoonery.7.9/10 – Slight, but faster and funnier than its predecessor. Better Holmes flicks: 'Zero Effect', 'The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes' (1939), 'The Hound of the Baskervilles' (1939), 'They Might Be Giants' (1971). Worth one viewing.",Null,1,3,11 January 2013
The Monuments Men," Because earth without art is just 'eh'
","George Clooney directs 'The Monuments Men'. The plot? Clooney plays Frank Stokes, a Lieutenant in the United States Army tasked with assembling a team of soldiers, museum curators and art historians. Their mission? Proceed into Nazi occupied France and rescue precious works of art from the hands of looting Germans.Like Clooney's 2008 film, 'The Leatherheads', 'The Monuments Men' is an attempted throwback to Old Hollywood. Unfortunately the result is dull, shapeless and populated by tired, ageing actors, all of whom look like they wish to be elsewhere. Clooney casts Bill Murray and John Goodman, hoping that the duo might provide a little comedic spark, but no luck. Everyone's on life support.Elsewhere the film disgorges familiar WW2 mythology. Here Americans are the ultimate saviours of European lives and culture, rather than architects of wanton destruction and global looting campaigns of their own. Along these lines the film functions as a dramatically inept version of 'Saving Private Ryan', another men-on-a-mission movie which specialised in bulldozing history. The straw-man of 'Saving Private Ryan's' final sequence, in which civilians are asked whether they've 'earned the sacrifices of dead soldiers', is even replicated in 'The Monuments Men'. Here we're asked whether any work of art is ever worth a soldier's life. 'Yeah,' an elderly man replies for us. The answer is not just creepy, but obfuscates the larger realities of war and soldiering, which oft have little to do with lofty ideals; only lies need constant veneration.And so by its final act, it becomes clear that Clooney intends 'The Monuments Men' to be a giant love letter to art. Art, the film argues, is 'very important', and so by extension movies too (and we actors as well!). Such a stance is fine, but in the context of WW2's killing fields, nevertheless wholly conceited. This narcissism perfectly echoes most Greatest Generation mythology.4/10 – See John Frankenheimer's 'The Train', an excellent 'art heist' flick, also set at the height of World War 2.

These are clearly not the mortality rates of an action hero.But to make things worse, 'Mission Impossible 3' is about Tom Cruise's wife getting kidnapped. His wife? Domestic drama does not belong in the 'Mission Impossible' series. If I wanted to watch a movie about women and midgets I'd watch...I don't know, 'Little Women'.What's Ethan Hunt doing in a romantic relationship anyway? Action heroes only have one relationship. The relationship between them and death!Sigourney Weaver spent 4 movies kicking alien butt, but I didn't see her begging for a husband. Charles Brosnan didn't moan about his dead wife whilst mercilessly gunning down punks.To be a true action hero, you've got to be a cocktail of quick carnage and quiet wisdom. You've also got to have no human attachments. From the wise Japanese samurai of 'Yojimbo', to Bruce Willis' John Mclane in the 'Die Hard trilogy', true action heroes all have one thing in common: they're loners.Clint Eastwood don't need no stinkin' sidekick. Lee Van Cleef always rides alone and Rambo didn't even bother to learn English. Who's he gonna talk to? His guns? Even John McClane, the ironic action hero of the 90's, kills a skyscraper full of terrorists just so he can tell his wife he wants a divorce. That is true manliness.But nah, the golden age of the action hero is dead. These days we got pretty boys like Keanu Reeves and Tom Cruise jumping around like little sissy girls on wires. Makes me wanna vomit sawdust.4/10 - This is one big ego project. Aside from the pre-credit sequence, the whole film is cliché.",Null,5,8,24 November 2008
Lucky Number Slevin," Pulp Suspects: The Usual Fiction
","Paul McGuigan directs 'Lucky Number Slevin', a film which plays like 'Yojimbo' making love to Guy Ritchie while 'Usual Suspects' and 'Pulp Fiction' force feed each other LSD bananas. The film's a good decade out of date, emulating the many 'hip', 'cool', 'irreverent' crime and con thrillers of the late late 1990s, all of which tried desperately to parrot Tarantino. See Mamet for this stuff done better.Our star is Josh Hartnett, a noir loser who's pushed through a postmodern amusement park. Usually with these films you'd have the hero, the 'wrong guy', buffeted by a ridiculously convoluted noir plot. But here things are even more meta, climaxing with a revelation in which our hero 'may or may not' be the wrong guy and 'may or may not' be the one actually pulling the strings. These days, casting Ben Kingsley in a film guarantees an absolutely ridiculous, absurdly 'ethnic', racially dubious performance. The guy's jumped from Indian to Jew to Iranian to Arab to Cockney to Asian to puppet, but now he's a Yarmulke wearing Rabbi gangster. I'm waiting for the black-face Kingsley. Then I can complete my 'Kingsley's Racist Caricature' collection and sell it on ebay. For free.The film's best moments are a couple of simple, sexually charged conversations between Hartnett and actress Lucy Liu.6/10 – Worth one viewing.",Null,0,0,28 March 2012
Requiem for a Dream," Terribly one-note movie about drugs.
","Tricks and wizardry cannot mask a shallow plot. The audience takes a relentless pounding. The camera whirls, the actors vomit, lights flash and Jennifer Connley snorts crack. An hour and a half of cinematic abuse.The film's point: drugs take many forms, destroy lives, are all around us and man innately possesses an addictive personality.Millions of dollars spent making a movie that tells us that drugs are bad. With it's hokey game-show scenes and show-reel like gimmickery, 'Requiem for a Dream' is a Film School geek's wet dream.That said, I think the film is slightly important. If the target audience is simply 'those who are likely to do drugs' then this film should have a positive effect. I personally found all the 'trickery' and 'jolts' amateurish, and the plot laughably melodramatic, but I suppose this would horrify teens who might be considering doing drugs. But do drug addicts watch movies about drugs? I don't think so. I think this is all a wasted exercise, with the director simply choosing material and subject matter that would justify the tone initially attempted in 'PI'.The sole question this film puts on my lips is: 'can art change the world'? Can a work like 'Requiem' really go out there and shake up the drug culture? The answer seems to be no. Art, mostly, reaffirms the already existent trends and notions of the time. Few pieces of art challenge, let alone are great enough to enforce a change. This film neither revolutionises or reaffirms. It just exists. It's impotent.7/10 - Once you've seen one drug movie, you've seen them all. Makes a good companion piece to 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas', 'Trainspotting', 'Drugstore Cowboy', 'Maria Full of Grace', 'Traffic', 'Pure', 'Big Bad Love', 'The Corner' (from the makers of 'The Wire'), 'Wonderland', 'Leaving Las Vegas', 'BasketBall Diaries', 'Barfly', 'Scarface', 'The Doors' and 'Panic in Needle Park'. Then you have weird auteur addiction movies like 'Altered States', 'Clockers', 'Crash' and 'Naked Lunch'.Worth one viewing.",Null,18,38,17 May 2005
Captain Phillips," Voices of the voiceless
","'Of the crooked timber, no straight thing can ever be made.' - Immanuel KantPaul Greengrass directed 'United 93' in 2006. The film was marketed as an 'apolitical' and 'objective' account of the September 11th attacks, but was devoid of all historical context, and so functioned more as a Pentagon propaganda piece. Here was a film about a handful of state assisted Saudi Arabians attacking at least 3 high profile US buildings which totally ignored the United States' relationship with Saudi Arabia, totally ignored how these attacks were used as a pretext to launch two illegal wars, totally ignored US ties to Al Qaeda, the group purportedly behind the attacks (on the very day of 9/11, the US were collaborating with Al Qaeda within the Macedonia civil war), and totally ignored both the motivations behind the attacks and what certain Saudi's stood to gain from another Western crusade. To this date, the 9/11 Commission, the White House, FBI, CIA and British government have failed to provide proof (not garnered from water-boarding) that Al Qaeda carried out 9/11 or that Al Qaeda chieftain Osama Bin Laden masterminded the attacks, let alone that these groups or individuals constitute the governments of Iraq and Afghanistan, the two countries upon whom wars of retaliation were subsequently waged. Osama Bin Laden was killed in 2011 (again no evidence was presented to the public). In 2001, before the US invasion of Afghanistan, the Bush administration turned down offers by Afghanistan's Taliban groups to turn Bin Laden peacefully over to US authorities.Like 'United 93', 'Captain Phillips' revolves around a vessel being hijacked. Here the Maersk Alabama, a Danish/American container ship, is boarded by four armed Somali pirates. The pirates battle with the Alabama's crew, before escaping with the ship's captain (Tom Hanks) aboard a lifeboat. The United States Navy then arrives. They surround this lifeboat with a small fleet and proceed to assassinate three pirates. The fourth survives, and is subsequently jailed in America. Captain Phillips survives.Whilst Greengrass obviously sympathises with both his Somalis and the crew of the Alabama, you simply can't frame a film as a thriller, or depend heavily on the US Navy loaning you a flotilla of aircraft carriers and destroyers, and not expect it to be anything other than compromised. This is ultimately a film in which the Somalis are manic bad guys (high on drugs, no less), in which the Alabama's crew are good guys 'delivering aid to Africa' (most of their cargo wasn't relief aid), in which all context is ignored and in which the US Navy does 'murderous but wholly necessary things'. The film is matter-of-fact to a fault. This is all there is to reality, it says. Accept it.But as everyone knows, to the point of being smugly annoying, that is not 'all there is'. The Somali pirates are largely a result of Western companies dumping nuclear and toxic waste off Somalia's coast, coupled to severe illegal over-fishing by foreign super trawlers (300 million dollars worth of seafood stolen from Somalia each year). The United Nations would itself release numerous reports blaming toxic waste for mutations, deaths, diseases and illnesses within Somalia. Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah, the UN envoy for Somalia, would say: 'There is uranium, lead, cadmium, mercury, industrial, radioactive, hospital and chemical waste killing Somalis and completely destroying the ocean.' Why can companies do this? Because Somalia's government has all but collapsed, thanks to Western Empires deliberately destabilizing and developmentally arresting the nation, funding warlords, dictators (Siad Barre et al) and instigating proxy wars with border nations. This has been going on, uninterrupted, since the late 1950s; any local government body not beholden to Western corporate interests, and which attempts to nationalise resources, will be destroyed. In the early 2000s, Somalia began to fight back. To oppose US-backed warlords, right-wing religious factions began to unite, some under the name The Union of Islamic Courts. The UIC united almost all of Somalia and provided stability, but was nevertheless swiftly demonized by the West – their unwitting creators - as 'Islamist terrorists'. Because the CIA solves everything with bullets and blood, the US and UK then pushed its Ethiopian puppets into invading Somalia. Tens of thousands died and the UIC was pushed back. Tired of all this crap, and forged in a cocktail of anarchy, the militant group Al Shabaab was formed, partially to fight off Western and Ethiopian gangs. Today, they are US public enemy number 1.Whilst Greengrass undoubtedly intends his film to be a work of social critique, possibly like some of his earlier pictures ('The Green Zone'), 'Captain's' narrow scope hampers things. You can not tackle such a loaded event in such a constrictive manner and expect it not to set up, intentionally or otherwise, many false assumptions. One senses Greengrass attempting something approaching satire – the idea of a film in which a zillion dollar US fleet is absurdly pitted against four lowly pirates who literally struggle to 'climb to the top of a (socioeconomic?) ladder' is genius – but satire is completely beyond him. Juxtaposed scenes in which Hanks and our pirates talk about 'fighting for promotions' feel, for example, reductive rather than enlightening.Beyond politics, the film is tense, well shot, but also repetitive and overlong. The casting of Hanks brings dubious (and possibly ironic) connotations, Hanks the poster boy for a post-John Wayne Americana ('Apollo 13', 'Private Ryan', 'Band of Brothers'), genteel but packing heat. Philosopher Jacques Ellul once predicted that future propaganda would increasingly portray itself as being 'apolitical', 'naturalistic' and cloak itself in 'realism'. Greengrass' military-men are emblematic of this shift: grim, stoic and fixated on 'just doing their jobs', everything forever outside their purview and moral radar. Greengrass' camera adopts the same stance.6/10 – Wastes a good premise.",Null,41,80,3 January 2014
Sucker Punch," Pastiche porn: now with newfound guilt
","Zack Snyder directs 'Sucker Punch'. The plot: a young woman and her sister are sexually abused by their father. The eldest sister, Baby Doll (Emily Browning), fights back and is wrongly blamed for her sister's death. Baby Doll is then sent to a mental hospital; she will be lobotomised in five days. Whilst being operated upon, Baby Doll temporarily escapes her traumatic reality by slipping into a fantasy world nested within her 'real world'. Here, the hospital's operating theatre becomes a literal theatre within a brothel, whilst the hospital's evil head nurse becomes a powerful pimp.Within the brothel fantasy, Baby Doll is forced to perform salacious dance routines for an audience. Significantly, Snyder never shows Baby Doll dance. Instead he cuts away, short-circuiting his audience's salacious desires for abuse by showing her retreat further into a string of fantasy sequences. These fantasy sequences take the form of video game levels, Baby Doll's mission in each level tied to corresponding missions in both the brothel and the hospital. For example, when Baby Doll battles a fire breathing dragon in the video game level, this is simply a means of violently staving off the dangers of stealing a cigarette lighter in both the brothel and hospital levels. All the other video game action scenes have a similar symbolic function. A cook's belt in the brothel/hospital level becomes a CGI train in the video game level, for example.Whilst 'Sucker' may superficially resemble films like 'Inception', 'Existenz' and 'The Matrix', its granddaddy is more akin to something like 'The Shining'. In both films, each level of fantasy is triggered by the denial of abuse, though Kubrick offers no clear 'levels' or 'separations'; all reality is already fantasy.Eventually a ray of light shines for Baby Doll, the poor girl dreaming up a pair of sisters to help her escape the hospital/brothel, one of which symbolically becomes her own dead sister. From here on. the film can be viewed in one of two ways. Either as a fantasy in which Baby Doll rescues her sister in the fantasy world, whilst she herself remains behind and is lobotomised (reversing an earlier scene in which Baby Doll's sister is raped because Baby Doll saved herself), or an equally unpleasant fantasy in which Baby Doll's sister dies in both the real world and the fantasy world, whilst Baby Doll, whose dreaming body remains behind in the mental hospital, pretends to escape the brothel as an avatar called Sweat Pea. Either way, Baby Doll's regressed to a vegetable.Snyder attempts to critique his audience and action movie expectations. 'I didn't put them in those provocative outfits,' Snyder says in interviews, 'you did! The audience in the brothel are us sitting in the theatre! The exploitative part of it is in the viewer! The viewer brings that!' He's right to an extent, and it is clever the way Snyder both structures his film as a giant rape movie and revokes each of Baby Doll's sexualised dance routines before likening the unseen acts to conventional action scenes (ie action movie violence is sublimated sex). But this still doesn't change the fact that the raison d'être of the film, Snyder's entire desire to make this film, stemmed from a desire to find a narrative which allowed him to go wild with zany spectacle. The end result is a film which does exactly what it condemns; a 12A certificate film that markets the sexy spectacle of abused teenage girls for teenage boys.Some have said that 'Sucker' offers a strictly male fantasy version of female empowerment (ie, the false 'feminism' of Cameron, Scott and Tarantino etc). That Baby Doll can't even escape without the help of a magical old man. This is true, but the film also has a genuine aura of tragedy. Each of Baby Doll's fantasy battles are also explicitly giant, mocking, castration fantasies, filled with deflating zeppelins, and much phallic imagery; she's a meta-aware sex object.Today we casually accept the consented sexual exploitation of young women and typically only accept female-driven 'heroism' when its sexualised or presented as fantasy. Similarly, TV and cinema are now awash with 'porn porn', plots in which supposedly 'enlightened' audiences are asked to 'sympathise' with the 'deep troubles' of beautiful women who are 'horribly exploited', subjugated, raped or objectified by 'bad men', acts of hypocritical sympathy which only exist to titillate audiences in the first place. In short, everything 'Sucker Punch' does has long been a 21st century trend. Today, sexploitation almost always masquerades as a critique of patriarchy.Elsewhere 'Sucker' focuses on what academics like to call the effects of the 'male gaze' on women. But the 'gaze' does not only affect women; everyone loses autonomy when realising that he/she is a visible object, and objectification is itself a general condition or main erotic impulse of late capitalism (again another Kubrick film, 'Eyes Wide Shut').Ironically, 'Sucker' is of interest primarily in the way it exemplifies cinema's ongoing death throes; its mimicking of video game aesthetics to generate post cinematic affect. What you literally have here is a film about modern film's inability to offer escape, Baby Doll forced to retreat further and further away from the brothel's sound-stage and theatre spaces and into 'modern' virtual landscapes generated by the 'combined' and 'shared imagination' of whores who must continuously construct interactive fantasy levels, schizoid digital noise, lest they realise that both they and their audience are perpetually imprisoned. It's the kind of thing critiqued in Cronenberg's 'Existenz' and 'Crash' - an addiction to increasingly intense digital spaces as a form of escape and denial - though Snyder could care less. 'Sucker Punch is like a video game that doesn't exist,' Snyder says. 'It's the game you want to play but it hasn't been made; when I drew two pages of storyboards, I rewarded myself with one game of Black Ops.' 6/10 – Worth one viewing.",Null,3,8,7 April 2011
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Welcome to the Island of Misfit Toys
","'Everybody's going to hurt you. You just have to find the ones worth suffering for.' - Bob MarleyAn adaptation of his own novel, director Stephen Chbosky's 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' stars Logan Lerman as Charlie, a shy, suicidal teenager. Ostracised at school, Charlie eventually bonds with a group of misfits, including Sam (Emma Watson) and Patrick (Ezra miller), a couple of free-spirits who, like Charlie, are hiding wounds and deep insecurities.'We accept the love we think we deserve,' a character states, the line encapsulating Chbosky's chief theme. Belittled by bigots, homophobes, rapists, abusive boyfriends and judgemental eyes, Chbosky's kids internalise persecution and so learn to hate themselves. Believing themselves incapable of being loved, they then embark on paths of self-destruction. All are eventually saved, however, Chbosky an optimist to the end. The future, art, love, friendship, even drugs and sex, have the power to rehabilitate at best, at worst provide good material for tortured artists; Charlie wants to be a writer.'Wallflower's' signature song is David Bowie's 'Heroes', a ballad about beautiful losers who nevertheless occasionally taste victory. Life sucks, Chbosky says, but you can triumph in the face of adversity with a little help from your buddies, if only for a day. 'We are infinite!' Sam screams after hearing Bowie for the first time, silhouetted against traffic lamps as she hurtles through a tunnel. It's a moment of ecstasy, possibility and emancipation, which our cast of kids hope to bottle and preserve and make last forever. But all tunnels end, and everyone's eventually spat back out into the black. The gang cope. They push past dog-eared copies of 'The Catcher In the Rye' and moody tunes by The Smiths. They learn to survive, if only because they have few other alternatives.'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' boasts some fine atmosphere, nice low-light photography and Chbosky's gang of hipsters are infectious. On the flip-side, Charlie and his friends are a giant writer's fantasy – people like this don't quite exist in real life – Emma Watson is miscast, Sam reeks of what Nathan Rabin infamous dubbed 'Manic Pixie Dream Girl' clichés, a sexual abuse subplot oozes bad-taste and the film's last act overloads on sentimentality. The film costars the likable John Cusack and Paul Rudd. For contemporary kids, the film has become a minor classic.8/10 – See 'Ghost World', 'The Spectacular Now' and 'The Wackness'.",Null,0,0,6 August 2014
3:10 to Yuma," For a one-legged rancher, he's a tough son of a....
","James Magnold's '3:10 to Yuma' stars Christian Bale as Dan Evans, a struggling farmer who agrees to escort gang leader Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) to a nearby train station. Wade is to be transported to prison. His men are determined to prevent this.Magnold's film is both a remake of a 1957 classic, and an adaptation of an Elmore Leonard short story. Unlike previous incarnations of this tale, though, Magnold portrays Dan Evans as a down on his luck farmer. With one bad leg, a farm in ruins, a sick child and a lifetime of misfortune, Dan's the quintessential underdog. Tired of the world spitting on him, Dan embarks on a noble quest; he will get Wade to his destination. Nothing will stop him. He will be a hero.The majority of '3:10' contrasts the morality, integrity and family life of Dan with the brutality, barbarism and lawlessness of Wade. Indeed, at first glance it appears that Wade is subtly corrupting Dan's family. He's the archetypal outsider, weaselling his way into Dan's life with the intention of seducing any and everyone. 'Walk in my shoes,' Wade whispers.As the film progresses, though, it becomes apparent that it is Dan who is in fact leading Wade into temptation. Longing for a family of his own (he was abandoned by his mother and he pines for a young barmaid), and slowly growing sympathetic to Dan's own plight, Wade thus gradually shifts from outlaw to hero. Ironically, he does this all out of a moral desire to mythologise and make a hero of – and so save – Dan.And so '3:10 to Yuma' (both versions) boasts one of the strangest final acts in the history of Westerns. Here, Wade picks up his sick-shooters and joins Dan in a battle against Wade's own henchmen. Both films then end with Wade imprisoned, having assisted the very man assigned to put him in a cage. He's completed his transformation from an outside (outlaw) to an insider (farmer), though the film's final shot suggests that this transformation is short-lived.Magnold's script occasionally has good chunks of dialogue ('Squeezing that watch won't stop time', 'I've been standing on one leg for three damn years waiting for God to do me a favour... but he ain't listening'). For the most part, though, Magnold's dialogue is poor (he can't capture the blunt, macho poetry of Leonard) and he squanders very good ideas which weren't part of the original stories. And despite a strong last-act, '3:10 to Yuma' is poorly shot and poorly cast. Their bodies forged by modern gym routines and their inflections copied from cinema's past tough guys, Bale and Crowe never convince as 19th century frontiersmen.7/10 - See 'Hombre', 'Ride with the Devil' and 'Bad Company' (1972).",Null,3,3,5 November 2014
The Expendables 2," I now pronounce you man and knife
","Simon West's 'The Expendables 2' is an action comedy which misses the point of its own novelty. Hoping to stoke the flames of nostalgia, the film collects several classic action movie stars (Jet Li, Chuck Norris, Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Van Damme, Dolph Lundgren, Bruce Willis) but then makes them play second fiddle to a conventional plot which is several times worse than the many B movies the film emulates.West would have done better to go smaller rather than bigger, showing these macho heroes in absurd scenarios which we've never before seen. Stallone getting a pedicure? Schwarzenegger working for Green Peace? Lundgren as a store clerk? Jet Li at the laundromat? Van Damme as a Spanish tutor? Statham as a gay cross dresser? Norris as an ultra right-wing Christian on a crusade to turn R rated action movies pg13 (oh wait)? I'd pay to see that.But alas, no.

Source Code," Groundhog Rashomon Monkey Deja Quantum Primer Code
","Duncan Jones directs 'Source Code'. The plot? A terrorist plants a bomb on a train. The bomb explodes, killing several hundred people, including passenger Sean Fentress. When the terrorist reveals that he shall soon detonate another bomb, a secret Government Agency springs into action. In their possession is a supercomputer dubbed Source Code. Source Code, we are initially told, allows its 'pilot' to 'enter memories' once belonging to recovered, dead bodies. As Sean Fentress' body is the only body on the train not to have been completely pulverised, it is selected to be used by Source Code. The plan? Army Pilot Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) will use Source Code to 'go into Sean's memory'. Once there, he will search Fentress' head for clues which will hopefully allow law enforcement officers in the present to stop the terrorist and thwart his second detonation. Sounds familiar? The plot's Tony Scott's 'Deja Vu', mixed in with a little 'Rashomon', '12 Monkey's', 'Quantum Leap', 'Primer' and 'Groundhog Day'.Like 'Deja Vu' it is also eventually revealed that the supercomputer in question is a lot more powerful than its creators perceive. Source Code (again like 'Deja Vu') isn't simply creating an interactive simulation based on Sean's memories, instead it's actively creating a wormhole which allows Colter to travel back in time and into a parallel, alternate universe. In both films there are temporal limitations as to how long this 'gateway' can be left open and in both films a new parallel time-line is created every time our hero 'jumps' into an alternate universe. In 'Source Code's' case, Colter repeatedly relives the last 8 minutes of Sean's life, until, of course, he collects enough clues to stop the terrorist. As his body is dying in the present (his helicopter was shot down in Afghanistan), Colter asks to be left inside Source Code. Here he is a given a cutesy 'happily ever after climax'. This climax ignores a bevy of interesting points. Firstly, if we allow for parallel universes, Colter's actions were entirely pointless; the terrorist succeeded in any number of alternate time-lines and our Colter only in one. Secondly, for Colter to continue living in his new, parallel universe, he would have usurped and effectively killed Sean, whose body he now possesses. Thirdly, as Source Code triggers the creation of parallel universes, and as it actively creates alternate realities, during every one of Colter's jumps he would have triggered a whole new round of train explosions. The guy's practically a mass murderer.Duncan's film is at its best when its evoking Hitchcock, specifically the aesthetic of 'North by Northwest' and the tone of 'The Lady Vanishes'. His aesthetic is one of clean lines, lots of horizontals and verticals, lots of nice, uncluttered aerial footage (of train lines and well manicured landscapes), and some of his architectural choices (Millenium Park, The Cloud Gate) are somewhat interesting (a kind of contradictory, postmodern futurism). The film's classier than Tony Scott's 'Deja Vu', but the sleazy nature of Scott's film also made it a bit better; less pretentious and free to go odd places. 'Source Code', in contrast, is repetitive, overstays its welcome and pretends to be about a hero who cheats chronology in order to save the lives of strangers, yet is quite cynical in the way its train passengers are repeatedly collected and coldly murdered/dispatched. The film's part of a wave of time travel movies, all of which tap into a very specific fantasy. Like the tag-line to 'Quantum Leap', these heroes 'leap from life to life, time period to time period, striving to put right what once went wrong'. It's the fantasy of a military industry complex that, not content to neurotically control everything in the present, must reach far into the past, future and even alternative realities, all to stop terrorist bogeymen.7.9/10 – Worth one viewing.",Null,0,2,22 January 2013
Iron Man 3," Zero Complex
","Directed by Shane Black, 'Iron Man 3' sees actor Robert Downey Jr returning as Tony Stark, a billionaire weapons contractor, playboy and superhero.Whilst wholly routine, the film goes off in some new directions. Here Stark is undergoing an existential crisis, the poor guy fearful of death, personal limitations and apprehensive about using his Iron Man suit. In short, Stark has both a hero complex and an inferiority complex. The film is thus packed with several symbolic moments, Stark fighting in semi-exposed suits, remotely from a distance (using automated drones) and acutely aware of his frail human body. Elsewhere the film questions the fascism of the genre, by having its chief 'villain' be an Osama Bin Laden proxy created by the US Government to stoke fears. This Bin Laden proxy is played by Ben Kingsley, who manages yet another totally ridiculous, racially dubious role.When 'Iron Man 2' was released, many believed that the only way the franchise could get more mad-cap was to hire Shane Black, throw in an R rating and have the film model Black and Downey's 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang'. 'Iron Man 3' doesn't have a R rating, but it was written/directed by Black. Strangely, this results in a film that is less zany than its predecessors. And whilst 'Kiss Kiss' was a postmodern smörgåsbord, gleefully proud of its irreverence and irrelevance, Black's 'Iron Man 3' is a staid, turgid thing. Maybe it's the Marvel Effect. The recent 'Avengers' killed all of Joss Whedon's gleeful excesses too, drowning imagination in dull money.Unlike most superheroes, Iron Man has no need for anonymity. He's pure ego, allowed to be a celebrity, public figure, playboy, comedian, rich kid, toy-maker, invincible muscle man, billionaire industrialist and one man military industrial complex. Whilst most superheroes function as power fantasies, Iron Man goes several steps beyond. He's a very white, Western, 21st century fantasy. A celebrity superhero for the reality TV generation; everyone must know his name.7.5/10 - Worth one viewing.",Null,0,1,5 December 2013
United 93," LET'S ROLL! (over some Arabs)
","'The resolve of our great nation is being tested, but make no mistake, we will show the world we will pass the test.' - George W BushPost 9/11 cinema seemed to witness an increase in at least three types of films: those that portrayed families under siege by faceless terrorists ('War of the Worlds', 'Mist', 'Cloverfield' etc), those which attempted to appeal to the heroism, courage and duty that large scale national catastrophes elicit ('United 93', 'WTC', 'Spider Man', 'Ladder 49' etc) and those which openly attacked US foreign policy ('Lions for Lambs', 'Syrianna', 'Redacted', 'Rendition', 'Valley of Ellah' etc).Of these films, Paul Greengrass's 'United 93' and Oliver Stone's 'WTC' were two of the first to directly address the events of September the 11th. Both focus on the actual disaster, both attempt to be gritty and realistic, both focus on ordinary Americans and both pretend to avoid sensationalism.But what ideology do these films serve? Observe, for example, how both films seem to focus on exceptions to the norm. Of the four kidnapped planes, 'United' focuses on the only one which failed to reach its target. Similarly, 'WTC' tells the story of the only 2 members of the Port Authority Police Force who made it out of the WTC rubble alive. In terms of historicism, these films mimic Spielberg's 'Schindler's List' and 'Private Ryan', two other faux-realistic films about exceptions (the Jews who survived, the son who lived etc) which turned violent carnage into personal triumph for the purpose of national regeneration.In 'United 93', we have the passengers of a hijacked plane knowing they're about to die. They thus decide to storm the pilot's cabin and bring their plane down before it hits its target. They, apparently, make a sacrifice so that others may live 'free'. This notion of national duty and personal sacrifice is mimicked in 'WTC'. The effect is that both films mythologise 9/11 as a moment of American triumph, rather than a national failing. 'United' deals with American heroism in the skies and 'WTC' deals with American heroism on the land. Both serve to rebuild national identity: ie, we are a nation of victims, attacked by irrational 'savages'. If we hope to prevail, it is our duty to respond with heroism, solidarity and self-sacrifice, the very 'United' of the film's title.In his writings, Jacques Ellul examines the workings of Judeo Christian myths. He says that post WW2 political propaganda will increasingly appeal to both feelings of guilt and sorrow. Soldiers, firemen and citizens will become dead Christs, their suffering mythologised and used as emotional tools to, unintentionally or not, draw the support of the public. As the end of 'Private Ryan' proclaims - a film which rapes pre-WW2 history as expertly as this current crop of Gulf War 2 films distorts post-WW2 history - we must 'earn this', because 'they' went through 'hell for you'. And so we pin ribbons on our heroes and build altars to our everyman Christs, praising them for protecting us from 'evil'. But the truth is, we owe our uniformed Christs absolutely nothing.By focusing their narratives on 'exceptions to the rule', these films serve the purpose of preventing us from asking truly important questions. They avoid any context, political or otherwise, and are content to simply focus on ordinary people being affected by the sudden and violent intrusion of History. But it is a History without a Cause. It is History without Context. It is History without Meaning or Motive. That the majority of the hijackers belonged to a repressive country and puppet state armed and backed by the United States is ignored. That - as social scientists like Robert Page and others demonstrate in their analyses of all major terrorist acts over the past half century - terrorism is never religiously motivated but always designed for reasons of autonomy or national liberation, is likewise ignored.The result of such things are three fold. Firstly, such art helps to bolster a virtual threat; an invisible, spectral enemy. The covert message of such mythology is that this omniscient threat of Terror legitimises our obscene measures of self-defence.The second result of such art is to convey a sense of national victimhood. Such victimhood is itself a contradictory force. It provides us with the moral basis for retaliation and power accumulation...and yet such a power can only be acquired once one feigns weakness. Thirdly, in the guise of apoliticism, such art engenders a very specific type of passivity and acceptance. When the monster attacks, one just does one's duty. Such a reaction is automatic, even sacrificial, because trust (and a righteous belief in one's self, one's government etc) is understood.Significantly, 'United 93' opens with images of intent-looking Arab men. They speak in whispers and ominous prayers, before we cut to over-head shots of a cityscape and then various shots of civilians going about their business. The film draws a clean line from Terrorist Other, who sweeps down from the heavens like an angel of death, to innocent civilians, everyone a possible target.Mass confusion then ensues, but in the real world NATCC and NORAD had explicit procedures whenever an aircraft drifts from its flight plan. This 'incompetence' narrative is in keeping with the official 9/11 story, though not a single person within the NATCC, the FAA or NORAD has been so much as reprimanded for poor 9/11 management. That US military planners had bizarrely decided to stage more than one dozen military simulations on 9/11, effectively removing many east coast-based U.S. air force fighter jets from the picture, is likewise ignored. This is thus a film designed to help embed the 'official version' of the events surrounding 9/11, legitimising for a global audience the 9/11 mythology: 19 psychotic Arabs drove some planes into some big buildings because, gee, they're crazy and hate our 'freedoms'.2/10 – Superficial.",Null,7,14,4 June 2010
Deja Vu," Securing the future, George Bush style
","'De Ja Vu' is one of Tony Scott and Jerry Bruckheimer's better collaborations. The film stars Denzel Washington as an ATF agent who is brought into the folds of a government programme called 'Snow White'. 'Snow White' 'opens a time window' which allows viewers in the present to look four days back into the past. Using this forensic tool viewers in the present are able to gather clues which may help them solve crimes which have already been committed. The catch is, 'Snow White' unfolds in real-time. What it shows is always four days, 6 hours and 3 minutes ago. While this limitation hampers 'Snow White's' effectiveness - once the device misses a moment, it's gone forever - it is still a remarkable tool: it's essentially a super-controllable time-camera, a 'worm hole' which can be manually moved about such that those in the present see anywhere in the past, albeit within the four day window.The film's theories, machines and techno-babble are ridiculous. Science fiction has always gleefully expounded on mind-bending ideas, but 'De Ja Vu's' problem is not that its ideas are too far fetched – the film's central idea is a good one - but that everything works too well. Tony Scott doesn't sell us the idea of 'Snow White'. It works too powerfully, too precisely, too conveniently, too quickly. On the flip side, it's hilarious the way Scott doesn't care. And though his film bares resemblance to such time-movies as 'Primer', '12 Monkeys', 'Minority Report', 'Looper', 'The Butterfly Effect', 'La Jettee', 'Source Code' and 'Frequency', the real influence seems to be the sequence in big brother Ridley Scott's 'Blade Runner' where Harrisson Ford manipulates a photograph, trawling its borders in a search for clues. What 'De Ja Vu' does is construct a whole film out of this sequence, Scott treating the whole world as a photograph which his boundless camera bounces back and forth exploring. 'Snow White's' not a time machine, so much as its a forensic tool which turns yesterdays into a virtual, explorable globe. It's like a cross between Google Earth Street View and a giant magnifying glass.The film's central crime is a terrorist attack on a New Orleans river ferry. The way the film handles the terrorist, the terrorist attack and the government's solution, is crass. The film ignores a very spooky aspect of the US government: its paranoiac obsession with preventing tragedies in the future through money, high-tech gadgets, covert forces, data-mining, wide-spread surveillance, illegal information gathering and the breaking of any number of privacy and/or civil rights laws. It's a kind of super-neurosis, the state organism so uber-desirous of control that it's not only oppressive and controlling in the present, but reaches far out in to the past and future as well, obsessively gathering all it can to preserve and protect itself. But Scott's too small an artist to see these nefarious avenues. He's in the Cameron, Spielberg, Bay mould, interested in technology only insofar as its able to zap eyeballs. It's along these lines, and these lines only, that 'De Ja Vu' works. Scott's more interesting in playing with cameras, time-lines and points of view.The film was written by Bill Marsilii and Terry Rossio. Their script was heavily changed by Scott, who has since apologised and expressed regret for his meddling. Marsilii and Rossio's script was allegedly more highbrow, clever and had less plot holes. Still, some good stuff remains in Scott's final version. Consider your typical Tony Scott car-chase, only now it takes place simultaneously within two time-lines, Denzel carrying a camera on his vehicle (akin to the Google camera, currently mapping our streets for Google Earth) which allows him to catch up to and chase a car that travelled a particular route four days ago. It's a cool idea, even if Scott doesn't milk it fully.More interesting is the way the film implies that what we're witnessing is the third or fourth 'unfolding' of its particular events. Late in the film Denzel uses 'Snow White' to physically jump into the past in an attempt to stop the terrorist action. What the film does, however, is start 3 or 4 jumps after Denzel's first jump into the past. The effect is such that the past versions of Denzel are leaving clues for both Denzel and the audience in the future, the hope being that these clues allow us to 'break the conspiracy of time' (no matter what actions occur in the past and present, the film says, the future outcome is always the same, though it unfolds in a slightly different way) and catch the terrorist in the present. In this way the film itself becomes a time-window, a forensic wormhole akin to 'Snow White's' own event horizon. Meanwhile we become time-detectives.The film's cast and characters are more functional than interesting. Only Denzel Washington stands out. He's always good in these every-man roles. The film ends with a very forced romance, which for some reason always finds its way into these time-traveller movies. It's funny the way human beings can't think of any other reason to break the space-time continuum other than sex. Interestingly, the film's 'worm hole' functions in such a way that those in the past can 'feel' or 'sense' that they're being watched by observers in the future. As far as I know, this is the opposite of an event horizon under the general theory of relativity, in which the boundary marks the point at which events beyond cannot be affected by outside observers. In 'De Ja Vu' there is no point of no return. A light shone through 'Snow White' will reach into the past and cause knock-on reactions. In a way this epitomises the unconditional hopefulness, naivety or optimism of the film. The past, present and future will be changed through sheer will and covert technology, it says, and your tomorrow will always be safeguarded. Meanwhile, in the real world...8/10 – Worth one viewing.",Null,1,2,12 December 2011
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," More lost boys
","'You know what I saw recently? Munich. I hate it, all this false complexity. But I'm not always dismissing Spielberg. A much better film cinematographically is his previous one, War of the Worlds. I like its dark, grainy atmosphere. His films are all variations on the story of paternity rediscovered, his big obsession. The tragedy of Spielberg is that he's much closer to what we call 'art' when he's doing what he probably thinks are commercial projects.' – Slavoj Zizek'Film is my drug and every few months I need a new fix.' - Steven SpielbergDirected by Steven Spielberg, 'ET: the Extraterrestrial' stars Henry Thomas as Elliot, a kid living in suburban California. As his parents have separated, Elliot's a bit depressed. Thankfully Elliot befriends a small alien creature, whom he dubs 'ET'. Like Elliot, ET's name starts with an E and ends with a T. More importantly, ET's also been abandoned by his parents. This separation leads to ET's body becoming pale and sickly. ET eventually dies, but is magically resurrected when his parents return. 'ET phone home!' ET triumphantly says. The message is clear. For Spielberg, himself the son of divorced parents, the family unit has the power to heal and nourish.The motif running through all of Spielberg's key films is that of the recovery of the father figure. In 'ET', both Elliot and the alien are abandoned by their fathers. 'Empire of the Sun', 'Hook', 'AI', 'Minority Report', 'Catch Me If You Can', 'Indiana Jones' and 'War of The Worlds' likewise all focus on parental abandonment. 'Jurassic Park' itself begins with child hating archaeologist, Dr Alan Grant, threatening kids with a raptor bone (a symbol of the paternal superego). Only later, in a very brief scene, does Grant throw away this bone. At this point he suddenly becomes a father and reconciles with the children. As he nestles in a tree, cradling the sleeping kids in his arms, the predatory dinosaurs of the night slowly morph into benevolent herbivores the following morning.Philosopher Slavoj Zizek would himself call 'Schindler's List' an 'ugly remake of Jurassic Park', with the Nazis as the dinosaur monsters, Schindler as the cynical-profiteering and opportunistic parental figure and the infantilized ghetto Jews as threatened children. The story the film tells is not about the Holocaust, but about Schindler's gradual rediscovery of his paternal duty towards the Jews. His transformation into a caring and responsible father, echoes Sam Neil's character arc in 'Jurassic Park'.The same story is repeated in 'Duel', in which a weak and effeminate father must battle demon trucks in order to assert his masculinity and reclaim his marriage, and again in 'The War of the Worlds', in which Tom Cruise plays a divorced working class father who neglects his two children. The invasion of the aliens reawakens in him the 'proper paternal instincts', resulting in him rediscovering himself as a caring father. In the final scene he finally gets recognition from his son who, throughout the film, despised him. So at their core, Spielberg's films are all 'the story of a divorced or working class father who strives to regain the respect of his children'. Sometimes this tale is told from the perspective of the child, sometimes it is told from the perspective of the adult. In each case it's the same story.Mostly, though, Spielberg's cinema is a cinema of 'trauma avoidance'. The reason's for Daddy (or state/nation/leader) being a jerk are suppressed and the crisis of masculinity is repaired or avoided via Daddy's battles with fantasy monsters (nazis, sharks, dinosaurs, trucks etc). In short, power and patriarchy are rehabilitated via fantasy.One can see similar 'trauma avoidance' in 'ET', a film which posits fantasy as an imagined escape from pain. In the film, Elliott's broken family is not in any real sense repaired, or its brokenness even explored as a truly solvable emotional problem. Instead, the film uses aliens to provide a false emotional closure. In 'ET', the little alien becomes a mediator who provides a substitute father, only to disappear and 'go home' once Elliot's mother embraces the good scientist (and new father?) in the final shot. As Spielberg's art is always about avoidance and not confrontation, daddy's absence is never resolved or investigated, and so his creepy rehabilitation must be repeated, over and over again, from one film to the next. Whether it be young Elliot in 'ET' or Chris Bale in 'Empire of the Sun', Spielberg's fantasies palliate traumatic human experiences (divorce, war, slavery, terrorism, Holocaust etc) by offering viewers the film's imaginative plenitude as a compensation for its characters' emotional losses. But despite all this, almost everything in 'ET' works. The film oozes raw, naked emotions and never pretends to offer anything other than a child's knee-high perspective, which Spielberg's shooting strategy reinforces. Autobiographical to the core, the film perfectly reflects its author, a man who has made a career of avoiding painful truths by indulging in fantasy. It's once these personality traits are married to external issues (Munich, Amistad, Ryan etc), that you get profoundly untruthful junk.8/10 - Would spawn a whole genre of 'suburban kids' adventures'.",Null,14,24,15 September 2008
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Save us John Wilkes Booth!
","Directed by Timur Bekmambetov, 'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter' stars Benjamin Walker as Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States. Lincoln aspires to be a politician by day, whilst spending his nights battling vampires, who are 'racist', 'rely on the slave trade' and whom are able to 'infect only those with impure hearts'. Lincoln, tough and virtuous, defeats the vampires.A dull, humourless, generic action film, 'Hunter' pretends to be edgy, daring and exploitative but is in actuality every bit as hokey and sentimental as most Lincoln tales. As referential as John Ford's 'Young Mr. Lincoln' and as prostrate to Lincoln mythology as Steven Spielberg's 'Lincoln', Bekmambetov's film completely wastes its wacky premise.2/10 – Needs more Clinton.",Null,1,6,18 October 2015
G.I. Jane," Botox goes to boot camp
","Though not as evil as his later war film, 'Black Hawk Down', Ridley Scott's 'G.I Jane' is an equally dumb war movie which finds actress Demi Moore enrolling into a Navy Seals training camp. Her mission? To prove she has what it takes to be 'one of the guys'.In the late 70s Scott got it into his head that he was a feminist. Like most directors (Tarantino, Cameron, Snyder, even Scorsese with 'Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore' etc), though, Scott has a wholly misguided view of feminism; the notion that female empowerment means women beating up men, shunting aside femininity in favour for hyper-masculinity, guns, violence, murder and abuse, and engaging or partaking in the same actions which typically subjugate women. The end result is 'G.I. Jane', a film about women standing up for equality by travelling to Libya and killing Libyans because a US spy satellite crashed in a foreign, third world country. What the hell? The further irony is this: the film is about people accepting women, but is acted by a woman who doesn't accept herself, Moore desperately flaunting her plastic surgery, her bald head, her toned body, her silicone-gel breasts and subjecting herself to all manners of abuse, all in the name of proving that she is a 'serious actress' and has what it takes to be 'loved by us'.Aesthetically the film is surprisingly ugly for a Ridley Scott production, with kitschy production design and dated, tacky music-video lighting.4/10 – Worth one viewing.",Null,5,9,5 July 2011
Training Day," The films of Ayer
","This is a review of 'Street Kings', 'Training Day' and 'End of Watch', three films by David Ayer.Ayer's best film since 'Harsh Times', 'Street Kings' stars Keanu Reeves as Detective Tom Ludlow, a burnt out cop who spends his days dodging bullets, taking down bad guys and dealing with a corrupt law enforcement system rife with scumbags in uniform. Sounds clichéd? Ayer's film moves like magic. He captures the tone and tempo of sleazy pulp fiction, revels in the genre's trashiness, writes in a baroque, pulp-prose style and volleys dialogue back and forth like Howard Hawks on cocaine.Ayer, who started out as a screenwriter, also has an ear for snappy noir dialogue. His characters don't talk, so much as they play ping-pong with words, prose hurtling along with staccato intensity; like drumbeats. It's trashy, but it knows it's trashy; 1950s B movie sleaze filtered through a modern prism.The film's all hand held cameras and snappy cuts, pausing now and then only to capture noir infused, sun drenched shots of California. We get convenience store shootouts, foot-chases through LA's Latino quarter, ominous nighttime skylines and the bloody haze of downtown ghettos. In Ayer's films, California's a war zone.The message here is also less problematic than that of Ayer's other work. Here Keanu plays your typical loose cannon of a cop. He's a modern Dirty Harry, a fascist with a badge, a ruthless authoritarian who breaks the law and shoots up punks, all in the guise of doing the 'greater good'. To eliminate evil, Keanu believes, you have to employ risqué tactics, perhaps even the mendaciously immoral and outright illegal. The ends justify the means. Deal with it.Only they don't. Keanu eventually realises he's a messed up dirt-bag who's been used as a violent blunt object by both the good guys and the bad. Ticked off, this little pawn visits his king, a chubby Police Chief who's house, in a nice bit of symbolism, literally has money, drugs and blackmail tapes leaking out of its walls; the up-scale veneer can barely hold back the corruption.Ayer also wrote the screenplay for 'Training Day'. Another cop thriller, it stars Denzel Washington as a vicious LAPD narcotics officer who takes an ambitious rookie (Ethan Hawke) under his wing. Washington's a criminal and crooked cop. Ethan, in contrast, is our great white hope, representative of Good, white American values, family and strong morals. Faced with the multi-ethnic criminality of both LA and Washington, Ethan opts firstly to simply walk away. Let the animals kill themselves. But Washington won't allow it. He attempts to corrupt Ethan – first with marijuana and later with harder vices - before provoking him into righteous violence. Even then Ethan refuses to deliver the kill blow; its up to the people of the slums – Latinos, Russians and blacks – to finish off their own kind. Ethan's hands remain clean. Whilst the film's first hour is thrilling, it becomes increasingly racist and stereotypical as it progresses.Racism and stereotypes are precisely what gush forth from Ayer's 'End of Watch'. The film finds actors Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena playing a pair of LAPD cops. They're young, macho cowboys, high on testosterone and hungry for action. Much of the film juxtaposes the goodness of our virtuous heroes, their family lives and desire for peace, family and domesticity, with the wild savagery of LA's underclass, who actively hunt our heroes and violently intrude upon their private lives. It's your typically racist Cowboys vs Indians story. Our cops are a fraternity of hazing, backslapping, well-meaning frat-boys (they shoot and kill only in legitimate self-defence; yeah right), who hold the line against the savage chaos that is the Other. It's a jungle out there, which Ayer fetishizes and salivates over, his cops finding black kids tied up in cupboards and butchered limbs hidden in basements. You can find similar scenes in early films which demonized those pesky Native American Indians; monster's gonna getcha.As this is a millennial police drama, two generations removed from Rodney King and a bevy of other scandals, Ayer's cops are more thankless grunts than boys in blue. They're soldiers. The film, with its pseudo documentarian shaky cam aesthetic (which, bizarrely, makes the film feel manufactured and fake rather than 'authentic), as a whole mirrors 'Saving Private Ryan', the poster boy of modern cinematic fascism, which likewise masked bigotry, blood-lust and hatred behind patriotism and seemingly wholesome values. 'Black Hawk Down' for cops, the film's a love-letter to the thin blue line, a blood-and-guts glorification of 'those who keep the savages at bay', which is to say, it's total propaganda and trades in bogus mythology.Crime films routinely demonstrate no social understanding, and routinely ignore the systemic causes of the appalling, violent conditions underprivileged minorities find themselves in. Others focus on 'corrupt policemen' and 'rotten apples', which itself misses the larger point that all law enforcement is systemically corrupt. The police/polis has a repressive function, its goal is to make politics disappear, for as long as there is no politics, a hierarchal distribution of power remains intact. The police, including disciplinary institutions and their various ideological components, are there to uphold the status quo and make sure that equality doesn't interfere with the hierarchal distribution of power; these social institutions are inherently inegalitarian. Today people have no problem accepting that the thin red line, the armed forces, does not act in the interest of You or Other, but it's the same with the thin blue line. Indeed, the dollar value of crime stopped by police infinitely out-weights that caused by the same. Borne of the desire of the wealthy to restructure society, to manage the urban poor and potential workforces, the law doesn't exist to prevent injustice acting upwards (the old notion that police protect the happy middle classes from the crazy, lazy lower classes), but largely to promote injustices acting downwards.7.9/10",Null,0,1,25 December 2012
In Bruges," You can't sell horse tranquilizers to a midget
","Playwrite Martin McDonagh directs 'In Bruges', his feature film debut. The plot? Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson play Ray and Ken, two Irish hit men. Ray is a lovable young man and Ken is his paternal superior. The duo have just completed a job in London, but things didn't go well; Ray accidentally shot a child.Guilt-ridden, Ray spends the rest of the film in a suicidal daze. Ken sympathises with the guy, and the duo have a number of touching conversations. These are the two most touchy-feely assassins since John Cusack in 'Grosse Point Blank'.McDonagh's plot later takes focus when the duo's crime boss arranges for Ken and Ray to travel to Bruges, a small town in Northern Belgium. Ken views this as a vacation, an opportunity to explore the historical city, but Ray hates the place, he wants to die or perhaps hook up with pretty local girls.McDonagh lays the symbolism on thick during the film's first 40 minutes. Bruges is portrayed as Purgatory, a transition point between Earth and judgement, with Hieronymus Bosch paintings, ominous dialogue and much talk of sins needing be repaid. Several noir elements are also set up (bottles, midgets, stairs, prostitutes, weight, fat people, lists, rivers, guns), all of which come into play during McDonagh's final act. Here his characters increasingly find themselves buffeted by, not only their warrior code, but noir fate.Midway into the film, Ken receives a message from his boss: his new mission is to kill his partner Ray, a long-standing cliché in assassin movies (see even the recent 'The American'). Ken refuses and his boss grows furious. The film then ends with your typical final act shootout, though the script is smart enough to subvert expectations at times. McDonaghand has enough wit to mock genre conventions, but isn't strong enough to create his own rules.7.9/10 - Can't compete with John Cusack's 'Grosse Point Blank'. Both films feature neurotic assassins and attempt to mix action with humour, but 'Grosse Point' trumps 'In Bruges' in virtually every category. It's funnier, wittier, has more action, and it's character's are ultimately more touching. 'In Bruges' is neither serious enough to be a major dramatic work, nor funny enough to be a memorable comedy.Worth one viewing.",Null,6,8,31 October 2008
John Wick," You stole my car, and you killed my dog!
","Directed by Chad Stahelski, 'John Wick' stars Keanu Reeves as John Wick, a retired hit-man. When his wife dies, and his cute puppy is killed, Wick embarks upon a quest for revenge. Standing in his way is Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist), a local gangster with hundreds of men at his disposal.'John Wick's' a love-letter to over 70 years of action movies. Its oldest ancestor is Fritz Lang's 'The Big Heat', a 1953 film in which a vengeful cop takes down the mob bosses responsible for car-bombing his wife. 'Wick's' other blatant influences include John Boorman's 'Point Blank', Sergio Leone's spaghetti Westerns, John Woo's Hong Kong action flicks, the crime dramas of Jean-Pierre Melville, 'Yojimbo', 'Payback' (1999) and the tough-guy films of Charles Bronson ('Mr. Majestyk' in particular). Where 'Wick' differs from these films is in its slick action sequences. This is unsurprising; Stahelski has long been a stunt coordinator.'John Wick' has been compared to Gareth Evans' 'Raid' movies. But unlike Evans' work, 'Wick' has a sense of humour, it knows it's ridiculous, and its well-honed comicbook dialogue manages to be simultaneously funny and portentous. Indeed, the film spends 30 minutes hyping up the superhuman dangers of John Wick, who subsequently unleashes himself upon every mobster in the film like a lava-spewing Mount Vesuvius. More interesting, though, is the world Stahelski has created. Like 'Alice in Wonderland' with machine guns, this is a dream world which seems to exist 2 inches below contemporary reality.

Chinatown," The nose knows
","Less a gushing homage to noir than part of a wave of 1970s conspiracy thrillers, Roman Polanski's 'Chinatown' is one of the best (and few) examples of a film revitalizing and expanding conventions of past Hollywood.The early noirs of the 1940s and 50s used rapid-fire dialogue, claustrophobic sets, shadowy cinematography, canted angles, convoluted plots and various shady characters to construct an impenetrable web of conspiracy and betrayal. Within this web our heroes find themselves trapped, helpless, confused and yanked about like a puppet on a string.The very cinematic language of these films was oppressive, every detail actively scheming against both off-screen audience and on-screen hero (frequently a private investigator or police detective), both attempting to hack their way through the film's conspiratorial universe, often to no avail.Of course these early noir directors didn't know they were making noirs. The term hadn't been invented and these artists were simply responding, intuitively, to the anxieties of the time: the trendiness of existentialism, expressionism, the onset of war, urban sprawl etc.The last of the noirs made in the classic mould was, arguably, 'Blast of Silence', a film which anticipates both Antonioni (where space and self disconnect) and Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' (loners in oppressive urban jungles) and provides clues as to which direction the genre was heading. From this point onwards, classical noirs ceased and noir then branched off into two directions, 'neo noirs' and a whole mass of films which are noirs but are never classified as such.Neo noir was born under the sway of postmodernism, and so these films tended to be formalist games and vapid exercises in aesthetics. Concurrently with their rise came wave after wave of genuine noirs which, like the noirs of the 1930s and 40s, consciously or unconsciously reflected a changing world. And so whilst early noirs gave us noirs confined to tiny rooms, their characters battling their way from one small sound-stage to the next, these noirs expanded and began to take into account the growing consciousness of its post war audience.So we have such widely divergent films as 'The Parallax View', 'Marathon Man', 'Capricorn One', 'Apocalypse Now', 'Taxi Driver', 'Manchurian Candidate', 'Z', 'Three Days of the Condor', 'The Spy Who Came In From The Cold', 'The Conformist', 'Cutter's Way', 'All The President's Men (In 'Perspectves on Film Noir', Raymond Durgnat even calls a science fiction film like '2001: A Space Odyssey' a film noir) etc etc, all films influenced by Vietnam, Watergate, whistle-blowing and a growing suspicion of any and all leaders. The existentialist's web of fate, in which a malevolent universe 'naturally' conspires against man ('The Killing', 'Wrath of God' etc), thus increasingly gave way to more politically charged plots. The genre remained quiet in the 1980s, aside from a subset of 'tech noir' films like 'Blade Runner' and 'Terminator'. Both films are about hunters, noir fate personified as relentless source code (man as machine, his future engineered). The Coens and Lynch then came along, the former neo-noirists largely interested in parlour tricks. Around this time neo noir also intersected with nudity, films like 'Basic Instinct', 'Body Heat', 'Last Seduction', and 'Jade' serving up femme fatales as figures to fear and salivate over.The 1990s saw noir seeping into television ('The X-Files', 'Twin Peaks' etc). With zeitgeist tapping tag-lines such as 'The Truth Is Out There' and 'Trust No One', such shows posited a world of vast conspiracies, the common man at the mercy of all manners of ridiculously elaborate forces (religion, genetics, government plots, class, economics, monsters etc). It was now man's duty to trawl through these labyrinths of information, discovering some elusive 'truth' that ensured his own freedom. In the mid 1990s the puppet masters then took the form of diseases and genetic disorders. Then with the internet age came the 'conspiracy documentary', which proliferate on websites and peer-to-peer networks.Nowadays, noirs have the expansiveness of such shows as 'The Wire', their characters at the mercy of a far wider range of forces (politics, science, sex, religion, globalization, capital, mysticism, Hollywood, genetics, technology, screenwriters, family, fate, bureaucracy etc). The best of these take place in a forever un-mappable universe, conflicts never resolved, characters trapped in the global flux, their heroes increasingly rootless, set adrift in a world of influences so vast that the human mind can do nothing but succumb. These noirs are such widely divergent fare as 'Ran', 'Inland Empire', 'Demonlover', 'Mulholland Drive', 'The Wire', 'Code 46', 'Boarding Gate', 'Platform', 'Eyes Wide Shut', 'Miami Vice', 'Girlfriend Experience' etc etc. Of course nobody thinks of these films as 'film noirs'. They much rather champion self-consciously emulative fare.In any case, if 'Chinatown' doesn't have the scope of later noirs ('Chinatown', unlike modern noirs, firmly believes its conspiracies can be uncovered), it's nevertheless one of cinema's most elegantly written tales. Elsewhere the film is brimming with neat details; consider the way Polanski constantly jumps from arid landscapes to fertile orchards (Chinatown's 'conspiracy' revolves around land, water and agricultural property), the 'water motifs' inserted into virtually every sequence (ponds, stuffed fish, paintings of lakes, swordfish etc) and the way Polanski aptly casts John Huston as the film's villain, Huston's 'Maltese Falcon' being one of the first films to bring together all the tropes that we now commonly associate with 'noir'.9.5/10 - Masterpiece.",Null,2,4,31 July 2010
Gravity," Save me Keanu!
","Alfonso Cuaron's 'Gravity' stars Sandra Bullock as Doctor Ryan Stone, a biomedical engineer. As the film opens, Stone is repairing the Hubble Space Telescope. Accompanying her on this spacewalk is Lieutenant Matt Kowalski (George Clooney).Cuaron quickly sketches Stone and Kowalski's personalities. Stone hates space, human connection, is depressed and is grieving for her deceased daughter. Kowalski, in contrast, is a dapper astronaut with a mega-watt smile. He loves life, people and zero-gravity space optimism. You got problems? Kowalksi's got your back.When orbital debris destroys Stone's NASA shuttle, 'Gravity' quickly morphs into a frenetic action movie. Here we watch as Stone and Kowalski, with limited oxygen supplies, make a beeline for the International Space Station. Along the way Kowalksi attempts to cheer Stone up, but she resists his pep talks. Nihilistic, grief-stricken and with no one home waiting for her, Stone already has one foot in the grave.Upon arriving at the ISS, Kowalski sacrifices his life to get Stone into the station. Once there, more debris peppers the ISS, forcing Stone to hastily evacuate. She hops aboard a Soviet Soyuz module and aims it at the Tiangong, a Chinese space station.Because she's stuck in the worse damn day of her life, Stone quickly realises that the Soyuz module has no fuel. She attempts communication with Earth, but reaches only lonely Eskimos and their sickly dogs. Resigned to her fate, Stone slips deeper into depression. Luckily a ghostly apparition of Kowalksi appears. Thanks to the power of motivational speaking, this apparition empowers Stone, fills her with self-belief, a desire for connection, vague spirituality and faith in humanity. Reinvigorated by mansplaining, Stone becomes determined to live! Kiss my butt, Newtonian physics! 'Gravity' climaxes with Stone using a fire extinguisher to propel her toward the Tiangong. Whilst the Chinese station rapidly deorbits, Stone scrambles into its Shenzhou module and returns to Earth. Her landing is a success, but her module touches-down in a lake. Weighed down by her bulky spacesuit, which she frantically tears off, Stone almost drowns. To resist the pull of gravity, the weight of grief, Stone must thus symbolically remove her excess baggage. As the film ends, Stone's been reborn.Cuaron signals Stone's transformation with much hokey symbolism: Stone is 'reborn' from the fetal position, sits alongside pictures of St Christopher (the patron saint of travellers) and eventually emerges from water like a recently baptised baby, or a newly evolved creature pulling itself out of the primordial soup. Stone's very name signifies a heavy object, a burdened heart that wants only to succumb to gravity's depressing, all consuming vortex. Ironically, its the very forces pulling her toward death which usher Stone away from the darkness of space and back into Earth's loving embrace.Alfonso Cuaron has always loved elaborate long-takes. In 'Gravity' he pushes this infatuation to its limit, his plot reverse engineered for the sole purpose of indulging in zany, zero-G camera-work. This camera-work is mostly intrusive, self-conscious and distracting. Master directors know when to cut, how to compose an image, hold a frame and how to juggle medium, close and long shots. Cuaron, though, bludgeons you with superfluous technique. His shots aren't elegant, just long. Aren't clever, just long-winded. Aren't beautiful, just expensive. And rather than majestic, sublime, claustrophobic or suffocating, his space and spaces feel like zillion dollar Hollywood plastic. Compare to 'Apollo 13' and 'The Right Stuff', where man's orbital tin-buckets feel like real, perilous places.Though 'Gravity' boasts a clever race-against-time plot, in which our hero leapfrogs from safe haven to safe haven, the film's 'thriller' sequences are nevertheless mostly silly. Stone uses fire-extinguishers like WALL-E, Clooney's sacrifice is cribbed from 'Mission to Mars' minus the opera, and the film's shots of bouncing astronauts, exploding machines and flailing arms seem goofy rather than 'authentic'. With more CGI than pixel-poster-boy 'Avatar', 'Gravity' never feels more than a blue-screen show-reel made slick by a budget that dwarfs most real space-missions. Stick Keanu Reeves in here, re-title it 'Speed 3' and inject a sense of humour, and 'Gravity' might play better. But Cuaron wants to make 'serious art', a desire which his film is not grave enough to sustain. The film features Ed Harris as the voice of NASA Mission Control. Harris also appeared in 'Apollo 13' and 'The Right Stuff'.7.5/10 – See 'Wings of Hope'.",Null,1,3,26 March 2015
Mulan," Mephisto in Onyx
","Tony Bancroft directs 'Mulan', an animated musical produced by Walt Disney studios and hailed by its makers as the first 'feminist' Disney film. The plot? In dynastic China, a young girl named Mulan assumes the identity of a man in order to fight in the Emperor's army against marauding Huns. Mulan is portrayed as a budding feminist, a spunky young woman who abhors rigid gender roles, fights against sexism and believes that women should be celebrated for their brains and brawn rather than their bodies, bodices and/or domestic/sexual duties. In this regard she puts on pants, grabs a sword, slays barbarians and saves the lives of several men, most notably the Emperor of China. Significantly, in her final showdown with a muscular Hun, Mulan (and her male comrades) wears a dress. Her sidekicks are a lucky insect and a pint sized dragon, both creatures who, like Mulan, are underestimated and forced to conform to the rigid preconceptions of others. Like most supposedly 'progressive' or 'feminist' films, female empowerment here boils down to women proving that they can be as violent, barbaric, base and hyper-masculinist as men. This is not feminism, as conflict exists where none should.The film's intent and content clash in other ways: Mulan's supposedly 'feminist' actions ultimately stem out of a duty toward her father (and his duties to the Emperor), idealised male and female bodies discriminate against anything less than ideal (almost everyone other than Mulan and her lover is a buffoon), the film is packed with stereotypes, portrays Mulan's victory as a victory of Western ideals over those thought to be more traditionally Chinese, is resolutely white, in real life the Emperors of China were as brutal as any Hun, and the early dynasties were themselves as sexist to men as they were women (hordes of men were castrated and made eunuchs to fulfil specific 'effeminate' roles in dynastic politics). The film is less sexist and racially insensitive than is typical of Disney, but still grates.Disney has a history of taking stories from different cultures and sanitising them of anything 'too ethnic'. Here the film is based on the legend or ballad of Hua Mulan. The character has been ascribed to different dynastic periods (Sui, Tang, Ming etc), but Disney instead opted to set their film during the Han Dynasty. This allows the filmmakers to get away with creating a 'nice Emperor' (China was somewhat progressive during this period) and use a type of 'Han Dynasty iconography' that resembles more traditionally Japanese iconography (rose petals, samurai attire etc), which perhaps plays well to geographically confused Western audiences. The date of the movie is odd, the film conflating events and invasions that took place in different dynasties (bizzarely, its emperor, Zhou, and chief warrior, Shang, are named after separate dynastic periods).The film banalizes totems which mainstream culture oft associates with 'oriental' or 'asian' cultures. So we have lots of bamboo, dragon statues, great walls, plum blossoms, Chinese gardens, kung-fu, Chinese lanterns, Chinese fireworks, chopsticks, ink brushes, Chinese hair combs, pandas etc. It's wonderfully drawn, but all feels like the result of a corporate brainstorming session. As with most Disney films, anything remotely alien, alienating, hostile or strange is made to seem resolutely familiar and/or cleansed of all cultural and racial background.'Mulan', the first Disney 'princess' with a body count, would lead to a period in which Disney made a greater effort to target male audience members. She, and the princess of 'Tangled', seem to mark a change in Disney princess body-types (younger, less 'womanly', less curvaceous, more spunky and 'teenage'; the new sexual ideal). The film is wonderfully animated, very cool, some of its animation work has a primal quality, reminiscent of Ralph Bakshi's 'Lord of the Rings', only more abstract, and at times resembles minimalist Chinese ink paintings. The film possesses several exciting action sequences, its song-and-dance routines are less grating than usual, our lead has wonderfully expressive eyes, and a strong sexual undercurrent exists, as is typical of Disney.7.9/10 - Worth one viewing.",Null,0,1,3 September 2012
Se7en," It's more comfortable for you to label me as insane
","'I just don't think I can continue to live in a place that embraces and nurtures apathy as if it was a virtue.' – Detective Somerset David Fincher's 'Seven' sees rookie cop Brad Pitt hooking up with veteran detective Morgan Freeman. In typical cop movie fashion, Freeman is due to retire in a week, but a spate of violent killings pulls him back on the job, the serial killer committing ritualistic murders inspired by the seven deadly sins.The first act of 'Seven' is rife with clichés: a hotshot rookie paired off with a wise old timer, a serial killer who loves toying with cops, a narrative which bounces from one lavishly decorated crime scene to the next etc etc. Throw in the obligatory foot chase, library scene, motor mouthed police captain (Lee Ermey) and an aesthetic which owes a little too much to both 'The Silence of the Lambs' and 'The X Files', and you'd think you had a fairly routine serial killer movie on your hands. Only you don't.Fincher creates a festering world, dank, putrid and forever bathed in rain. More interestingly, his narrative goes to great pains to reverse the trend found in most serial killer movies. Whilst most genre films treat their killers as monsters, deformed and different from us, 'Seven' challenges our view of monstrosity and paints a world in which the monster is us. 'We see a deadly sin on every street corner,' John Doe, our serial killer states, 'and we tolerate it! We tolerate it because it's common, it's trivial!'Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Envy, Wrath, Pride and Lust are everywhere, even in Morgan Freeman's wise detective hero, the moral centre of the film. 'We're no worse than he is,' Freeman says, sympathising with John Doe and chastising others for labelling him insane. Both men are teachers in their own way, both trying to fix the world, Freeman by arresting the guilty, Doe by killing them outright. Doe, without history, family or fingerprints, thus becomes a kind of symbol for man's collective guilt, trying desperate to shock the world out of apathy.These themes are summed up best in a throwaway bit of dialogue when Pitt asks the owner of a prostitution parlour whether he likes the things he sees around him. 'That's life,' the guy shrugs.Ultimately, the message is not only that we are all guilty, but that in creating 'relative' versions of guilt, society only degenerates into a kind of mass indifference. 'It's easier to lose yourself in drugs than it is to cope with life,' Freeman says at one point. 'It's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it. Hell, love costs: it takes effort and work.' The film ends with Freeman quoting a line by Ernest Hemingway – 'The world is a fine place and worth fighting for.' – and then stating that he agrees only with the second part. The world's cesspit, but it's worth fighting for.Fighting for a better world is, in a sense, what Fincher's 'Fight Club' is about. Released at the tail end of the 1990s, the film belongs to a group of films ('Magnolia', 'Safe', 'The Ice Storm', 'American Beauty', 'Fight Club', 'Being John Malkovich', 'Fear and Loathing', 'Far From Heaven', 'The Savages', 'Happiness' etc) which sought to explore middle class resentment, each seeing American life as being empty, mundane or a suicidally dull bore.Post-war cinema had long worked out its existential issues with a variety of masterpieces (cf Antonioni, Bergman, Ray, Minnelli, Sirk etc), but then came two decades of excess and so stupor. When American cinema finally re-woke up to its deep rooted malaise, it tended to skirt around the issue. Fulfilment thus became a sexual problem, all these films revolving around white males who seek empty flings and biochemical bliss. 'Fight Club' belongs to this group, though here sex becomes a kind of bare-backed man-on-man homo-erotic violence. Elsewhere Fincher attacks rampant consumerism, and highlights a perceived loss of masculinity in our modern society by having his hero, a wimpy Edward Norton, gradually becomes his alter ego, the animalistic Tyler Durden. Tyler represents Norton's repressed animal nature and sense of rebellion. It is through Tyler that Norton – who spends the film drifting from one support and rehabilitation group to the next – learns to lash out, creating a underground boxing club which eventually evolves into 'Project Mayhem', a terrorist group which seeks to tear down modern civilisation.But the great joke of 'Fight Club' is that the film subtly mocks the fantasy image of Tyler Durden. Durden, the manly anarchist and poster-boy for raging male hormones, is ultimately just another ineffectual support group. Another product to buy into. What's offensive is that, whilst the film acknowledges that reactionary forms of rebellion don't work – capitalism absorbs and internalises all attacks - and that raging against the usual figureheads are empty gestures (Norton wants to blow up credit card data-banks and beat up his boss), it's unable to point to either any real solution, or any actual 'cause'. This would require artists who are actual geniuses.8.5/10 - Worth multiple viewings.",Null,0,1,19 March 2010
I'm Not There," Mister Tambourine Man
","Bob Dylan helped show the Western world popular music could be more than just boy-meets-girl tunes and superficial hooks. His songs had, at times, depth and vision. But 'I'm Not There' doesn't care about any of that. Instead, director Todd Haynes (who, unsurprisingly, has an Arts Degree in Semiotics) reduces Dylan to a series of signifiers and signs. Dylan, of course, has himself frequently been accused of being 'meaningless', 'opaque' and reliant on 'nonsensical metaphors' and ridiculous 'signs'.'I'm Not There' thus sets about portraying Dylan as a kaleidoscopic conman. 'Who is Bob Dylan?' Haynes asks. 'Whatever' is his postmodern answer. He's not here, he's not there, we can never know.Whilst some of Haynes' subplots do offer 'interpretation', and so concede that Dyaln himself might 'mean something', for the most part the film eschews truth for fashionable obfuscation. Haynes doesn't care about Dylan's music or Dylan the historical figure. Instead, he presents us with the public's ever changing perception of Dylan. He approaches Dylan through a layer of smoke and mirrors, presenting us with masks rather than truth. For those of us who know or care about Dylan, the film is the equivalent of flicking through Dylan's album covers.Dylan's 'different faces' evolved out of the public's growing need to peg him down. Here was an artist who constantly jumped from one genre to the next, playing with the plasticity of music as he moved from folk, to country, to rock, to Gospel, to reggae, to pop, to jazz and finally to blues. Each change confounded the pubic. Dylan's abstract prose and poetic metaphors only served to further muddy the waters. Who exactly is Dylan and what exactly was he trying to say? No one seemed to know.Dylan was also an intensely private man who only presented his art to the world. As the public had no true perception of his private life, they mythicized him. As they had a shifting perception of his music, they created masks for each stage of his career. There was the rock-n-roll face, the wise prophet face, the skinny country hick face...each one presenting itself at roughly 5 year intervals.But though Dylan's music continually reinvented itself, changing shape and form, even an idiot could tell that artist's 'voice' (not in the acoustic sense) and personality stayed the same. He was always the same guy. Always trying to distill, for better or for worse, some truth down into song form. One need only listen to his music to see the singular human being behind those plural masks.But Haynes doesn't understand the essential thing about Dylan and his life: his music. Or maybe he's intimidated by genius, and has no means of finding the visual equivalent of Dylan's tunes. Or perhaps he wisely intends to let the songs speak for themselves.Regardless, Haynes takes the easy route and creates a film comprising of 9 or 10 disconnected segments. Each segment has Dylan played by a different actor. Each segment adds fuel to all the usual Dylan clichés. In other words, Haynes' film is a fitting tribute to the Dylan many perceive has made no literal sense since 1963, but an insult to Dylan the lyricist and artist. Haynes is content to give us an Andy Warhol style portrait of man who doesn't exist.The problem is, I think, that 'I'm Not There' was made by people who were mere children in the 1960s. People who had gained generational consciousness only in the 70s and early 80s. Of course an artist need not belong to the era he's expressing through his art, but those arising out of the 70s and 80s all had postmodern sensibilities. These filmmakers are akin to DJs, inclined toward pastiches of popular culture. A copy of a copy or a quote of a quote. Everything is trashy so let's just revel in junk.All artists draw from previous achievements, but great artists also reach for the unique, the personal, the sublime, some ineffable truth. We don't get this with hyper post-modernists. As most of popular entertainment is pretty superficial, bubblegum, trendy, and outdated fast, hyper post-modernists basically indulge in cut-and-pasting and so replicate superficial material. What is there to really think about in most popular art? Now Todd Haynes isn't the postmodern monster that Tarantino or the Coens are - judging from his excellent other films, he has a sort of beautifully homosexual, introspective and intellectual side - but here his postmodern sensibilities are entirely at odds with Dylan's more traditional, modernist sensibilities. Haynes cuts and chops, giving us montage and murals, whilst Dylan just wants a simple pen in his hand and a harmonica in his mouth. Dylan's a thinker and feeler who's been chopped up and reduced to a series of freak-show segments, tabloid images and advertisement posters. Depressingly, this is also the film's very point. Haynes is unable to peg Dylan down so instead serves us a giant 'he's not here'.7.9/10 - See Altman's 'Vincent and Theo' and Ashby's 'Bound For Glory'.",Null,1,1,28 May 2008
The Big Lebowski," What makes a man?
","'The man in me will do, nearly any task.' – Bob Dylan A 'noir plot' is really an impenetrable web of cosmic betrayal in which our hero is trapped, helplessly pushed around like a tumbleweed in the wind. Consider Howard Hawks' 'The Big Sleep' - a film which 'The Big Lebowski' homages - in which we the audience feel a bit like Humphrey Bogart, as we hack our way through Hawks' convoluted narrative.The Coen brothers' 'The Big Lebowski' is just as confusing as Hawks' film, filled with dead ends, double crosses, and confused characters who eventually learn that there was really no mystery at all. But what happens, the Coen's ask, when you take a stoner, a guy who just abides, and put him in a noir plot? What happens when you swap an active hero like Bogart, with a a passive slacker like Jeffery Lebowski? Jeffery 'The Dude' Lebowski doesn't try to battle his way out of his noir plot. He doesn't fight fate. He simply says 'f**k it!' and abides. As such, the film's tumbleweeds, bowling pins etc, are all metaphors for a highly deterministic universe. The tumbleweed itself, like The Dude, simply goes where the wind takes it. It's a reversal of our typical noir hero.The issue of the femme fatale is also updated. Maude Lebowski, a feminist and artist, has The Dude checked by a doctor. She then sleeps with him simply to get herself pregnant. She's a woman who uses and discards men, using them purely as sexual objects. Throughout the film, The Dude even makes some subtle jabs at Maude's male replacement role ('Hey man, why don't you fking listen for a change?') But what makes Muade choose Jeffery as the perfect mating partner? And why does the narrator deem the Dude worthy of such noble treatment? The film articulates these questions itself when the Big Lebowski asks the audience, 'What makes a man?' With it's phallic imagery and its frequent threats of castration (scissors, ferret, dropped cigarette etc) and male rape ('f**k you up the ass!'), the film goes on to offer some answers.Firstly, all the men in the film are weak. While the Big Lebowski is confined to a wheelchair, Smokey, the landlord, and Donny are all d*ckless. When talking about penises, Donny even says 'What do you need that for, dude?'. Then there's Jesus, who lusts for kids and Walter, who's so whipped by his ex that he still babysits her dog. Then there's Jackie Treehorn, the alpha male who, quote, 'Treats objects like women, man!' The film's original script makes the themes of masculinity even more implicit. In the final scene, when The Big Lebowski is thrown from his chair, he yells: 'Stay away from me! You and these women! You wont even leave a man his balls!' But unlike everyone else in the film, The Dude (always in shorts, his legs wide apart) seems more in touch with his masculinity. By abiding and not refusing to be 'tied down' to any one cultural identity, he is flexible and free ('Do you see a ring on this finger? Do I look like I'm fking married?').All these themes have recently led to feminist writers discovering and falling in love with the film. In her writings, gender theorist Monique Wittig says that 'woman' and 'man' are merely political and economic categories. We create personas based on external forces. Wittig says that the rise of the individual and the liberation of desire require the abolition of gender categories. And that's just what the Dude is, freedom from desire and total individuality in the face of a world that wants him to conform.These writers read The Dude as a noble individual who, because he refuses to adhere to the films ready made male stereotypes (castrated or alpha male), is a more whole character and thus more appealing to the female Other. But they fail to realise that The Dude, like the cowboy, is himself a heroic distortion of the male identity. To the Coens, he represents an idealised version of the 'failed male'. One who pleasures himself with constant buddy interactions, poses with cool solidarity (and nonconformity) and is always strictly heterosexual.But the dude is really a bum and a failure, constantly playing with his balls in fear of castration. The appeal and popularity of the character is essentially down to males loving the carefree masculinity he projects, despite the world deeming him a failures as a man. In fact, the only truly 'successful' man in the film, Jackie Treehorn, makes a living out of subjugating women, has a big d*ck, and seeks to develop machines to replace women so he can jack off with technology.So war and female sexuality are both tied into the rug at the centre of the film. As such, the film treats the Persian Rug as a mini Persian War. A piece of territory which the female (Maude) eventually wins. The dude thinks he's a 'man's man' who gets the woman and doesn't have to bother about rearing the kids, when in fact he's just abiding to the superiority of the Female Other.But the Dude is unconcerned about all this. Unlike the pacifists (Donny, Landlord, Smokey), nihilists (Russians) and aggressors (Walter/Bush) in this war, the Dude is very much a non-interventionist. He has no real desires, avoids women, is happy and lives life without worry. He's the ultimate introvert, while the Big Lebowski is the ultimate extrovert. Ironically, both men really haven't accomplished anything on their own. When the Big L asks 'Are you employed Mr Lebowski?', he's just covering up the fact that he's also useless and unemployed.9.5/10 - Worth multiple viewings.",Null,5,9,25 May 2008
Unbreakable," Dad, do you think you could beat up Bruce Lee?
","While directors like Steven Spielberg and Brian De Palma are routinely compared to Alfred Hitchcock (Spielberg's too infatuated with special effects, and De Palma's too camp, too baroque), M. Night Shyamalan's a better fit. Shyamalan's scores often reference Bernard Hermann, he shares Hitchcock's penchant for walk-on cameos, the macabre, stretching scenes out to breaking point and like Hitchcock adores elevating pulpy material (while Hitch was all about spy movies, murder, horror and sleaze, Shyamalan's chewing on comic books, UFOs, aliens and ghosts).More than this, though, Shyamalan's films are brimming with Hitchcockian camera angles, compositions, camera work, and hinge on the kind of low-key, restrained set pieces that Hitchcock long perfected. Like Hitch he also fine-tunes every inch of his screenplays, storyboarding heavily and polishing his dialogue. This lends his films a very mannered style. Classy, family friendly insidiousness.Of course Shyamalan's not in the same league as Hitchcock. Not even close. But on a strictly surface level he does at times deliver the same kind of aesthetic rush. You might say Shyamalan's best films all blend some of Hitchcock's 'Frenzy', 'Psycho', 'Marnie' and 'Birds', with a little 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' thrown in for good measure; goofy pulp meets some serious paranoia.Like Hitch, there's also a thin religious thread running through Shyamalan's work. With Hitch we had some low key Catholicism in 'I, Confess' and 'The Wrong Man' (amongst others), and of course with Shyamalan you have his early Christian features, and later his alien invasion movie 'Signs'. And while 'The Wrong Man' is an excellent noir undermined by hokey Christian salvation, 'Signs' is one of the best alien invasion movies....if you completely ignore its regressive reliance on 'Christian signs' and divine intervention (the film even ends with a giant crucifix). There are other similarities too. Hitchcock deemed film a 'low art', and did his best to stay clear of 'big issues' and 'weighty topics', yet had no qualms about structuring some of his films as political allegories, most notably 'Lifeboat', ostensibly a disaster movie but actually conceived as a WW2 era call to arms, solidarity and mobilisation. Echoing this is Shyamalan's 'The Happening'. Aesthetically the film's 'Birds' meets 'Body Snatches' meets Romero, but politically it's one of the more interesting post-9/11 monster movies (compare it to 'Mist', 'War of the Words', 'Cloverfield' etc). Where those films typically watch as hapless whites are stomped on by faceless bogeymen and nasty monsters-cum-terrorists, though, 'The Happening' deals with - if one ignores its more obvious eco-message - what military tacticians typically call 'blow-back' (violence directed toward the civilian population of aggressor governments). Here, our Americans heroes are literally set upon by 'terrorist suicide bombers', in the form of suicide inducing trees and vegetation, because they indiscriminately 'trample on territory that does not belong to them'. Overlap Shyamalan's foliage with the West's recent Middle Eastern Crusades, and the message is clear; the 'trees' want payback.Shyamalan directed 'Unbreakable' in 2000, an attempt to imbue your typical 'comic book movie' with gravitas. The film finds Bruce Willis playing David Dunne (like Marvel heroes, his first and last names start with the same letter), a stadium security guard (he misses his previous calling as a football star; a calling his wife, a caregiver, deems 'violent') who is the sole survivor of a train accident. After the accident David is contacted by Elijah Price (Samuel Jackson), the proprietor of a comic book museum. Elijah convinces David that he has both superpowers and a responsibility to use his gifts for 'the greater good'. Meanwhile Elijah, who suffers a rare brittle-bone disease, is revealed to be a 'super villain', a demented terrorist who is responsible for thousands of deaths. Elijah sees David as his antithesis, a man who is quite literally unbreakable. 'If someone like me exists, there has to be someone else at the opposite end of the spectrum!' Elijah yells. It's an opinion oft voiced in comic books: the super-villain is both a reaction again, and the cause of, the super hero, and vice versa.It's a very good film, stylish, every scene directed with a certain flair. But 'Unbreakable' is also far less radical than it thinks. Shyamalan doesn't rewrite the superhero rule book, he simply...slows....things....down; behind the solemnity, David's character arc is typical of the genre. Bizarrely, David's super abilities are treated as being a fact, rather than something more ambiguous. The result is that David is 'definitely a super hero' (complete with super hero costume and weakness), which results in Elijah 'definitely becoming a super villain', rather than something more ambiguous and disturbing. Interestingly, while the film outright acknowledges that David has super powers, it then thoroughly dispels any fantasies of heroism by ending with David calling the cops rather than using his superpowers to defeat Elijah. In this way David grants Elijah the unkindest gesture. Similarly, in David's big action set piece, Shyamalan goes out of his way to stress how much David relies on outside help to defeat a murderous kidnapper. He's not a full superhero...yet.But though the film downplays its 'white saviour angles', it still ends up affirming them with its racially dubious overtones. 'Do you know what the scariest thing is? To not know your place in this world, to not know why you're here,' Elijah says, echoing a theme found in most of Shyamalan's films, in which characters struggle to figure out their identities, or where exactly they fit into the archetypal fairytale. In 'Unbreakable', it's clear where black dudes fit; literally behind the bars of a Mister Muscle security guard.8/10 – Worth two viewings.",Null,2,3,9 March 2012
Star Trek," TV, the final frontier
","Directed by JJ Abrams, and made by a cast and crew plucked from the world of prime time television, 'Star Trek' (2009) attempts to inject some life back into a dying franchise. Abrams' film recasts the characters from Gene Roddenberry's now iconic 'Star Trek' series, erases the more cerebral, sociological aspects of 'Trek', ditches everything remotely resembling science fiction and swathes itself in zany special effects. Murder, vengeance, death, genocide, violence and ego-maniacal 'rights of passage' arcs are the film's raison d'etre, instantly making 'Star Trek' the antithesis of Roddenberry's humanist, quasi-Utopian vision. In truth, the 'Star Trek' franchise has been degenerating for years, slowly becoming a crypto-Imperialist action series. But it nevertheless often tried to be weighty, and always had a certain recognisable aesthetic about it. A certain elegance. Abrams' 'Trek', though, is pure mayhem; a zillion dollar car crash.Still, the film works well as popcorn. 'Star Trek' is fast paced, takes helpful cues from Joss Whedon's 'Serenity', abounds with zippy dialogue, TV teen soap-drama, sitcom level humour and has some moments of poetry, like a sequence in which Captain James Kirk is born, his body exploding into existence amidst flame and vacuum. Unexpectedly, Abrams also manages to capture the feeling of brotherhood, family and camaraderie that made the original 'Trek' so popular. But is it genuine or cosy familiarity?On the downside, Abrams is weak with visuals. He relies on words, the rhythm of his scripts, rather than strong images. As a result, most of 'Star Trek's' pleasures are derived from the patter of dialogue, the pace of its twists and turns, rather than anything we actually see on screen. This is not surprising. Spectacle is now largely dead. Successful blockbusters are moving away from image oriented screenplays to word oriented screenplays. Audiences are left dazzled by frenetic storytelling, constant plot beats, incessant vignettes, canned drama and fast dialogue, rather than extended set pieces, new ideas or effects.Still, there are some neat visuals scattered about. Consider one in which distant shuttles trickle across the screen. Mostly, though, the Starship Enterprise is ineptly photographed, and Abrams' space battles are shot with a frenetic, urgent, pseudo documentary camera. It works at times, but also reeks of a kind of desperation. The 'Star Trek' franchise had a few cool sets in its past, but there aren't any in Abrams' film. His starship bridges look like Apple showrooms, and real life factories and chemical plants are used as stand-ins for engine rooms. Later, a villain's ship is simply a mass of cliffs, chains and dark rooms. Unsurprisingly, the film is a raging rip-off of 'The Wrath of Khan'. Marooned characters, truth bugs, villains bent on vengeance, the Kobayashi Maru, a self-sacrifice scene, a reluctance to admit a fear of failure, planetary destruction, super-weapons (a planet destroying super-weapon that rips off both Trek's 'genesis device' and 'Star Wars'' Death Star), ships hiding in clouds etc etc...are all ideas borrowed from 'Khan'. It's all very cheap - particularly one sequence in which Abrams wipes out a planet for kicks - but because things are so fast paced, you're quickly beaten into submission.Incidentally, the film exists in an 'alternate reality' such that anything which happens in this new series does not undermine what has gone on in previous instalments. But why not jettison this idea completely and simply reboot the franchise? In attempting to placate fan-boys, Abram' screenplay gets increasingly ridiculous. Other silly moments abound: wouldn't someone have spotted a giant star that was about to go supernova? Why do the black holes have to be at the centre of planets to be effective? Since when do black holes send you back in time? How can these holes destroy entire planets but not ships? Why throw Kirk in an escape pod rather than jailing him in the brig? Isn't it too much of a coincidence that Kirk lands on the very same planet where Spock is hiding and where Scotty has been working? How gimmicky is the concept of 'interplanetary beaming'? How can people respond so callously to the destruction of an entire planet? Why didn't the planet have orbital defences? Why promote Kirk to captain so swiftly? Why doesn't the villain – essentially a clichéd pantomime Bond villain – not age after 25 years? 8/10 – Science fiction is supposed to be a genre of ideas. Though fast and fun, Abrams' 'Trek' points toward a depressing future for this new franchise. Things are going to get a lot dumber. Worth multiple viewings.",Null,7,16,11 May 2009
Akira," Amoebas don't build houses
","Japan. The near future. Tetsuo, a young street urchin, begins to develop psychic powers. Local authorities believe him to be the successor to Akira, a dangerous psychic responsible for a nuclear explosion which decimated Tokyo 31 years ago. Akira is currently in cryo-freeze, cocooned in a heavily guarded bunker several miles below the earth's surface. The Japanese military want Tetsuo securely locked away with him. Attempting to rescue Tetsuo is Shotaro, the leader of a rowdy biker gang.Directed by Katsuhiro Otomo, 'Akira's' one of the more influential Japanese science fiction animes of the 1980s. The film featured a larger budget, more animation cells and more fluid motions than was commonplace in Japanese animation at the time, and would go on to influence a number of directors, amongst them James Cameron and the Wachowski 'brothers'. And as is typical of sci-fi anime, our cast are a bunch of loudmouth kids who can't stop yelling, and the film spends most of its time salivating over machinery, vehicles, computer screens, urban landscapes, urban alienation and apocalyptic imagery.Japanese animated films tend to be preoccupied with adolescent metamorphosis. Japanese culture is itself plagued with a specific form of infantalism. They've dubbed this phenomenon 'hikikomori', which refers to a large, growing subset of the Japanese population who essentially refuse to 'grow up', take on responsibilities or enter the workforce. In most cases this rejection of adulthood is due to a perceived, socially exacted trauma. To millions of Japanese men and women, the adult world has been discredited, is traumatic, offers little, and is already a nightmarish, pseudo-robotic, cyberpunk nightmare which offers nothing but anxieties and phony social expectations, interactions and demands. They ditch it all. Caught between the cosy, stable traditions of Old Japan and the schizoid dystopia of New, the hikikomori choose to remain protectively cocooned and stuck in limbo. Mamoru Oshii's anime, 'The Sky Crawlers', deals indirectly with this arrested development.'Akira' is, in a way, also about extended adolescence and the anxieties of growing up. The film's biker gangs are populated by naughty kids, led by Shotaro, their own daddy of a leader. Shotaro constantly admonishes his boys for trying to 'grow up' and 'be big like him', but he's no more childish than the other figureheads in the film (some of whom are literal babies). Tetsuo, meanwhile, wants to break free, his adolescent metamorphosis mapping a passage from puberty and impotency to power and authority (he literally gets bigger and bigger, increasingly large and powerful). Everyone else wants Tetsuo infantalized and frozen, like little Akira, cryogenically frozen as a child and presumed nonthreatening, but Tetsuo won't have this. He fights them off, conquers his uncertainties and confusions, but goes positively nuts whilst doing so. From this point onwards, anxieties very specific to Japanese culture pop up: the fear of too much power in the wrong hands, of nuclear annihilation, of urban sprawl, of technology's smothering of tradition, the threat of overreacting leaders etc. Indeed, it was around the mid 1980s that Japan began to gain technological prominence and redefine itself. In many ways, 'Akira' is tapping into a zeitgeist that was perhaps weary of its growing technological power and influence. And so Tetsuo paradoxically resists his metamorphosis whilst also revelling in power, an internal power struggle which eventually becomes too much for him to bear. From this point onwards the heroes of Japanese anime would get increasingly impotent, self-reflexive and stuck in existential ruts, until you reach the self-loathing heroes of 'Evangelion' and 'Sky Crawlers', social outcasts in giant robots who can't even muster the will to fight.'Akira' was based on a 2182-page manga by Otomo himself. The film sports a number of atmospheric passages, but its attempts at depth, nuance and scope also clash awkwardly with the demands of a teenage audience. Aesthetically, French comic-book artist Jean Giraud is a massive influence, as he was upon 'Blade Runner' (to which 'Akira' is oft compared) and Hayao Miyazaki (who adored him). Fans of 'Akira' hate its English dub. Oshoro's next feature, 'Steamboy', traded 'Akira's' cyberpunk for steam-punk.7.9/10 – Worth two viewings.",Null,2,4,13 February 2013
Inglourious Basterds," Kino Fist
","Most Holocaust movies, no matter how gory, are exercises in wish fulfilment. Today they've morphed into Jewish revenge fantasies ('Munich', 'Defiance', 'Zohan', 'Debt' etc), exploitation flicks dressed up in big budget gloss. Reflecting the now superpower state of Israel, these films typically feature Jewish action heroes dishing out punishment to cowering terrorists/Nazis and then feeling 'kind of bad about it'. Quintin Tarantino's 'Inglorious Basterds' is divided into 5 chapters. The first is a wordy rip off of Leone's 'Once Upon A Time In The West', the audience watching as Shosanna, a pretty Jewish girl, has her family massacred by a Nazi officer known as the 'Jew Hunter'. Shosanna escapes and we cut to Chapter 2. Here we're introduced to the 'Basterds' ('Dirty Dozen', Casterellari's 'Bastards' etc), a group of Nazi hunters comprised almost entirely of Jews. Significantly, the Basterds use Apache hit-and-run tactics and delight in scalping their enemies; the film is a 'victim's fantasy' on a large scale, not only Jews fighting back, but African slaves (characters discuss the racial implications of 'King Kong') and American Indians as well.The next 3 chapters of the film involve Shosanna inheriting a cinema which is later used to screen a propaganda film called 'Stolz der Nation', a Nazi version of 'Private Ryan' in which German sniper Frederick Zoller fights off 300 Allied soldiers (an allusion to the Spartans). As Hitler is attending the film's premiere, both the Basterds and Shosanna plot his assassination (which they dub 'Operation Kino', a nod to the Bolshevik propaganda movement). Significantly, the Basterds fail completely in their plot to kill Hitler. It is a flaming cinema screen and a stack of explosive film cans which kills him. In other words, cinema literally kills Hitler.But the death of Hitler has no historical effect. It is 1944, the war's end. What the film allows, therefore, is simply a chance for Jews to kill Hitler days before Hitler kills himself. Like all of Tarantino's film, everything hinges on revenge. What's different, though, is that in this case the 'revenge' plays out as an acknowledged fantasy rather than ideologically tainted history masquerading as 'realism'.'Basterds' ends with three formally and narratively connected moments of 'catharsis'. In the first, Zoller mowing down hordes of Allies is inter-cut with the cackling faces of German audiences. In the second, a Basterd named Donny repeats the motion, violently mowing down helpless Germans. Significantly, the actor playing Donny is the director of the film Zoller is trapped in and Donny is given no audience reaction shot. We, instead, are positioned as the audience, and made to giggle at the spectacle of Hitler's body perforated by bullets. It's an implicative tactic used often by Verhoeven: we are the Nazis, cheering the murder of people for what they represent rather than who they are. Later, during the film's third 'catharsis', Tarantino literally puts us in the perspective of a Nazi being marked by a swastika, the director marking his audience for their sins. It is not only that the Basterds vengeful massacre is formally identical to that of the Nazis, but that both sequences are manifestations of ideology. Brad Pitt, the hillbilly leader of the Basterds, even sports a Hitler styled moustache and hair cut. The difference is, the Basterds' vengeance is authorised by the American state and 'sanctioned' by the iconography of American movies and pop culture. In this respect, 'Basterds' is one step beyond Tarantino's other movies, his old fan-boys turned into Nazi buffoons whilst his 'new audience' is granted the privilege of ironic, self critique.'This is a uniform you can't take off,' Pitt growls as he carves a swastika into the forehead of a German. The scene embodies the ideology of the Allies in its very arbitrariness: the Nazis aren't Nazis because they're evil, they're evil because they're Nazis. The victors write history and history scars the Other as one-dimensional totems of evil. Moreso, the German is denied a chance to take off his uniform, to repent, and instead becomes the scapegoat for the entirety of Western evil. By making Pitt an improbably hillbilly anti-racist vigilante, Tarantino takes the endemic racism of the American South and displaces it onto the figure of a Nazi with whom he has everything in common but the uniform. Message? Jew Hunter and Nazi Hunter are one and the same, both bent on genocidal quests. Sacriledge? It's important to note that the Allies were indifferent to the fate of European Jews during WW2, Europe/America was largely antisemitic, WW2 was not fought for 'just' or 'altruistic' reasons (but for old fashioned Imperialism), and all of Christian civilisation is itself based on both the hatred of Jews (the bedrock figure of Judas in the Bible is itself a calculated slur against Judaism) and the racial superiority of the white man over the black.But the point is, this hypocrisy survives precisely because power is adept at turning history's Hitlers into alphas and omegas of racist imperial ambition. It fetishizes Hitlers and swastikas so as to disguise how widely shared the ideologies they represent are in the West. When we make the symbol evil instead of the ideology, we only end up vindicating those who share the ideology, the racism, and the imperial ambition. Europe/America might have conquered the world to acquire living space for the white race, you see, but at least they weren't Nazis.Late in the film Shoshanna and a Nazi officer battle over a projection booth. The scene portrays two propaganda films, two bodies and two identical ideologies at war with one another, both vying for the same cinematic space. The message is not only that 'historical truth' becomes dependent on whoever survives the battle for the booth, but that, maybe, the two competing reels aren't that much different anyway.8/10 - Interesting, though its form totally undermines its content.",Null,3,10,3 December 2009
Amistad," The Black ET
","Spielberg's quest to be taken seriously has taken him many places. What's surprising, though, is that he's never made a film about Vietnam. While documenting the fears, hopes, and joys of Baby Boomers, Spielberg has overlooked one of the shaping experiences of his generation.This avoidance, I suspect, is due to two reasons. The first, is simply discomfort. Spielberg's a conservative filmmaker. His films reinforce a familiar status quo: American common sense in the form of a decent, white, suburban middle class. When he has dealt with serious issues, Spielberg has ALWAYS looked to the past. Racism in 'Amistad', racism and sexism in 'The Color Purple', anti-semitism and genocide in 'Schindler's List', war in 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Empire of the Sun' (he's visited WW2 seven times throughout his filmography). He can't even tackle modern terrorism (Munich) without going back 3 decades.On the other hand, the contemporary world, for Spielberg, seems not to be threatened by such serious social and political issues but by imaginary beasts: aliens, giant sharks, resurrected dinosaurs etc. While he's critical of certain aspects of contemporary life (anonymous scientists and military officials who want to take our aliens away, self-serving civic leaders who want to keep our beaches open, showmen who cut corners on theme-park safety), there's little sense of history or place in these films. The legacies of slavery and the Holocaust are absent. The contemporary world, according to Spielberg, is a flat landscape of suburban tracts, amusement parks, and seaside resorts. In Spielberg's contemporary films, good triumphs, order is restored, families are united, and the malls open on time. Vietnam is too unwieldy to exist within this orderly and traditional world. A world devoid of US militarism, third world poverty or capitalism. Spielbergland is noble. All the human horrors exist in the past.All artists digest and absorb. Spielberg's second reason for not visiting Vietnam is simply that he has a very narrow view of the world. His world view was shaped by countless hours sitting in his bedroom, absorbing John Wayne films, magazines, toys, comic books, cartoons and TV serials. They're the building blocks of how he sees the word. Most artists mature as they get older. They throw away the old blocks and develop more complex building blocks. But like an autistic man with the mind of a child, a part of Spielberg is stuck in ten year old mode. He's still a kid in the 50's, locked in his tiny suburban bedroom, oblivious to the world around him.As such, the entry way into most of his project is always from the point of view of a child. 'Saving Private Ryan' isn't a war movie, it's Spielberg playing with toy soldiers, 'Empire of the' Sun isn't a war drama, it's horror seen (or remembered) through the eyes of a boy. Same story for 'AI', and 'Catch Me If You Can'. He even turns Tom Hanks' character in 'The Terminal', into an awkward, inarticulate, man boy.This innocence and childlike fear is fine for some projects, but it often ruins his serious ones. In 'Amistad' the child's view, and Spielberg's entryway into the project, are the eyes of Cinque.Cinque is a black ET, plucked from his family and thrust into an alien world. He just wants to go home. Spielberg handles Cinque effortlessly well, the problem is how he handles the adults around him. With ET, Spielberg kept the adults at a distance. They were faceless, out of focus, their faces not shown. Throughout his filmography, parents and adults are likewise often divorced, distant or unapproachable. He doesn't understand them, so he throws them away.But with Amistad, the story rests not solely on the shoulder's of ET (Cinque) but on the shoulders of adults. The result is the usual 'serious' Spielberg movie. Crigne worthy drama peppered with moments of gleefull Spielberg horror.6/10- While Spielberg's earlier 'Color Purple' felt like a cynical attempt to cash in on the success of the (superior) Roots TV series and the rising popularity of black literature, Amistad has far nobler intentions. Still though, it's plagued by bland direction, unimaginative scripting, poor dialogue, jarring cinematography and a talky ending. It's a watered down version of 'Goodbye Uncle Tom', worth viewing only for 2 brilliant sequences and a well paced first 30 minutes.",Null,16,23,19 October 2007
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Show me on the doll where Mr Lucas touched you
","Directed by Gareth Edwards, 'Rogue One' is a prequel to George Lucas' 'Star Wars'. It opens on the planet Lah'mu, where little Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) witnesses the apparent murder of her family by the henchmen of a Galactic Empire. Jyn's father is Galen, a weapon's developer. His buddy, Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker), takes Jyn under his wing.After its generic opening scenes, 'Rogue One' flashes forward fifteen years. Here a pilot called Rook defects from the Empire with vital information from Galen, whom Jyn had previously assumed was dead. Galen's information reveals plans of a super weapon known as the Death Star. Rook smuggles this information to Gerrera. Gerrea passes this information on to the Rebel Alliance, who are currently waging a guerrilla war against the Empire. The rebels respond by sending Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) to assassinate Galen. Jyn tags along. Cassian refuses to assassinate Galen, and together he and Jyn instead go to a high-security Imperial facility on the planet Scrif. They hope to infiltrate this facility and beam the Death Star plans to a Rebel fleet in orbit. A big battle ensues.'Rogue One's' plot is needlessly convoluted. What should be a swashbuckling tale of plucky Rebels outsmarting Big Bad Wolves is instead filled with dull subplots about abandoned girls, guilty scientists, random space-Asian-force-ninjas, and generic villains who spew cartoonish dialogue in-between an endless parade of establishing shots. A better writer would have jettisoned half this material and constructed a script that moves.'Rogue One's' plot was haphazardly cobbled together by boardroom puppets and money men. Its aesthetic is similarly soulless. Like most raised on Spielberg, Cameron and Lucas, Edwards' shtick is to replicate everything he's seen as a kid, before replacing the light-heartedness of his fore-bearers with grunge, emotional distance and a low-key tone. His awful previous films, 'Monsters' and 'Godzilla', pretty much play like 'Rogue One': dull characters running across glum landscapes whilst big CGI objects do explosive but ultimately unthreatening things. 'Rogue One' itself plays like 'Saving Private Ryan' meats 'Star Wars' as directed by a director of joyless pornography, Edwards rolling out yesterday's decor to appease the basest, most unimaginative expectations of an audience desperate for yesterday's murder. George Lucas may be a joke today, but his original trilogy was once weird as hell. In contrast, Edwards' version of 'Star Wars', a franchise whose mysteries were long killed by millions of video games, books, comics and sequels and prequels, comes out the gate looking like a deflated balloon.Edwards' cast is no better. Diego Luna is cool as Cassian, but Edwards has mostly obediently assembled a bland band of politically correct faces; the white girl, the Latino, the black guy, the Asian etc etc. This is casting by robots and banks, every decision dictated by spreadsheets and market researchers, all calculated to guarantee maximum demographic penetration. There's no spontaneity, creative decisions or real art here; just machine logic, up and down and all the way around. Lucas' 'Star Wars' may have been white as hell, but Lando Calrissian, a disco space pimp with a private mining empire and lady-cape, didn't feel like an attempt to court black dollars. Everything in 'Rogue One', in contrast, reeks of reverse engineering.'Rogue One's' first action scene occurs at the 31 minute mark. Here, on a desert planet, Imperial stormtroopers battle rebels. Lasers fly back and forth, but there's no real danger; Edwards' stormtroopers are more inept than usual (a problem in a supposedly 'gritty' 'Star Wars' film). The film then climaxes with a half-hour battle on land and in orbit. A replica of Lucas' Battle of Endor, this sequence finds giant Imperial walkers missing everything in sight on land, whilst giant Imperial Star Destroyers miss everything in sight in orbit. And unlike Lucas' climactic battle, Edwards' lacks drama, danger, a cool score, good compositions, intelligent pacing and clean camera work; its mostly a blur of CGI whilst humans attempt to hack into the silliest computing filing cabinet ever conceived. 'Star Wars' was a weird independent film by a geeky kid who just wanted to make goofy B movies. Today it's only B movies which get A-list budgets, and 'Star Wars' has not only become the template for virtually all tent-pole movies, but become emblematic of Hollywood's escalating drive to capture dollars and lowest common denominators; 'Star Wars' as the ultimate Hollywood and so American Success Story.Ironically, 'Star Wars' was conceived as a giant middle finger to Uncle Sam. Writing of his franchise, Lucas would say: 'I took concepts I was going to use in a Vietnam War picture, and put them in space. So you essentially have a large technological empire going after a small group of freedom fighters; a small independent country like North Vietnam threatened by gangsters aided by empire. The Empire is like America ten years from now, after Nixonian gangsters assassinated the Emperor and were elevated to power in a rigged election. This 'total control' police state was welcomed by the people, because the Empire created civil disorder by instigating race riots, aiding violent groups and allowing the crime rate to rise.' But of course the United States has made a career out of imagining itself the injured victim. Indeed, both the nation's Imperialism and national image hinge on it being seen as an underdog. And so somewhere along the line, Lucas' tale of Vietnamese communists and the 'force' which helps them defeat Western Imperialists and their giant space gonads, got turned upside down. Thus 'Star Wars' became, not just the ultimate tale of How We See Oursevlves vs The Other, but an altar to Hollywood capitalism itself; big, loud, faceless, endless, soulless, bland, impersonal, pointless, infinitely propagated for the sole purpose of profit, and completely designed by yes men, algorithms, the deluded and those fork-tongued marketing gurus on cell block 1138. And here's another one. And another one. And another one. And another one.5/10 - Sithspawn.",Null,14,30,9 January 2017
Coraline," Wasted opportunity
","'Of course you don't understand. You're just a copy!' - Coraline JonesThough not as good as 'Monster House', 'Corpse Bride' and 'The Nightmare Before Christmas', three other recent animated horrors aimed at kids, 'Coraline' nevertheless has better material at its disposal. The tale of a little girl who ditches her annoying life and parents in favour for disappearing through a 'rabbit hole' and living in a freakish simulation with creepy witches and rag-doll copies of her parents, this little film has the kind of twisted plot that would appeal to a Dahl, Dick, Cronenberg or Lovecraft (It's the children's version of 'Existenz' or 'Mulholland Drive').Unfortunately the film is unwilling to commit to the dark ideas its script demands it pursue, whatever horrors and psychological issues the film hints at ultimately bulldozed to make way for generic plot points and a deus ex machina ending designed to hook a male audience.The film's visual style has been praised, but it is low rent Tim Burton.7/10 – Worth one viewing.

This Is the End," Cannabis clerics
","Directed by Seth Rogen and Eva Goldberg, 'This Is The End' stars various Hollywood actors as comical versions of themselves. The film then portrays Los Angeles as a cauldron of bad manners, vices and judgemental jerks. Seeking to put an end to this debauchery is nothing less than the Bible's Book of Revelations, whose prophecies 'come true', resulting in all 'good people' being 'sucked up into heaven' whilst all 'bad people' find themselves trapped on a planet Earth now awash with demons, beasts and fiery infernos.At this point, 'This is the End' becomes a parody of post-apocalyptic action movies. Cleverly, the film portrays our heroes working together and putting aside differences, but only on the surface. Behind smiles, they're all conspiring against one another. Our heroes then discover that they too can 'enter heaven', if only they 'be good', 'die for others', 'sacrifice themselves' and 'learn to unconditionally love their fellowmen'. Yes, this is a stoner comedy which, like David Gordon Green's recent 'The Sitter', is preoccupied with ethics. It also advocates dying selflessly for others. Anti-Christians scoff, but the film was written by two Jews, and philosophers of every creed and race have been espousing the same for centuries.'This is the End' stars a funnier than usual Jonah Hill as an absurdly polite goof-ball and Danny McBride as Satan incarnate. James Franco, as usual, steals the show, playing himself as an overly sincere, drugged out playboy. The film climaxes with Whitney Houston's 'I Will Always Love You', a song which succinctly sums up the film's message. Whilst 'End' has some funny moments, it's mostly inconsistent, too heavily improvised and its final sequences are not only awful (Backstreet Boys?) but contradict everything that came before (Heaven is just Hollywood painted white?). The film's best gags feature McBride and Franco attacking each other with invisible ejaculate, and Emma Watson eavesdropping on our heroes as they discuss how not to molest her. Plato would be proud. 7.5/10 – Worth one viewing.",Null,1,3,30 December 2013
Dawn of the Dead," Brain Dead
","'I was trying to come up with a concept about a new society, revolutionary...in political terms, that's taking over and devouring the old society.' – George A. Romero In the lead up to and wake of the September 11th attacks, Hollywood saw a resurgence in films featuring anti-Arabic and anti-Persian sentiments. Most of these films unconsciously pandered to nationalist fears, and featured aliens, monsters or creatures shooting down buildings or zapping screaming Americans.Zack Snyder's 'Dawn of the Dead', a remake of a 1978 George Romero's horror classic by the same name, finds a group of Americans holed up in a shopping mall whilst bloodthirsty zombies roam outside. Beginning with unconscionable, near subliminal shots of Muslims praying in unison, the film quickly becomes one big anti-Islamic blood orgy, the film ascribing to the zombies the 'evil madness' of jihadists.These new, post 9/11 zombies are not the placid, stumbling fools of Romero's 'living dead' series, but an angry, enraged, wrathful mob, who exist not to consume, but to transform, pollute and convert others. Significantly, the mob starts by infecting children, converting the family unit before spreading further outwards. This modern zombie doesn't only expresses Western fears of violent 'Islamic' (and soon, 'Confucian') oppositions to modernity and secularism, but Western understandings of the 'Islamic agenda', namely the Muslim exists only to breed, emigrate, infect and submit the world to some wild, archaic version of Sharia Law.This reverses Romero's attitude to zombies. Throughout Romero's films – and this is why thrill seeking audiences increasingly abandoned him – the zombie is not a relentless bogeyman, but a symbol for cultural or revolutionary shifts which usurp and devour previously entrenched, old societies. Think the tall, black Zombie leader whose proletariat uprising overthrows a George Bush styled warmonger in 'Land of the Dead', toppling his unjust empire. 'Night of The Living Dead' likewise saw 'the zombie' as being symbolic of various mid-60s uprisings against tyrannical paternal and political despots. In later Romero films, the zombies innocuously represent a culture of tech savvy, media proficient whizkids; a digital mob which clumsily replaces an outmoded analogue generation and its assorted cultural and familial values. From here on, Romero's zombies become resolutely postmodern. Neutered, without purpose and ineffectual, they are like so much digital noise, born to proliferate with record buttons, youtube accounts and cell phone cameras.So unlike other horror directors, Romero doesn't see the 'zombie' as a monster. Instead he treats them with a much more objective tone, dispassionately watching as they change from radicals, to consumerists to angry abolishers of bourgeois property. In his last two films, the concept of the 'zombie' changes further. In a stagnated society in which progress seems impossible, the zombie becomes a fantasy concocted by backward looking survivalists; a pipe-dream in which those remaining few outside the network society dream up half thought out zombie uprisings and apocalyptic purges. In this way, Romero's 'Survival of the Dead' anticipates (and critiques) the new generation of zombie rip offs artists like Zack Snyder, and the countless kill-a-zombie video games flooding the shelves. The idea of the zombie has been killed, and so now we repeatedly resurrect (and slaughter) zombies only to preserve the illusion that the revolution is not dead.What Romero recognises is the inherent deadendedness of the postmodern condition. The present age is the age of advertisement, the age of miscellaneous announcements: nothing happens, but what does happen is instant notification. A (zombie) uprising in the present age, an age of worldly renunciation, is the most unthinkable of all; such a show of energy would strike the calculating sensibleness of the age as ludicrous. And so while Romero's films go into increasingly dour territory, material like Snyder's 'Dawn', 'Zombieland', 'Shaun of the Dead', '28 Days Later', 'The Walking Dead', 'Carriers' etc engage in cosy, survivalist fantasies.If Snyder's film is inferior to Romero's in every way – Romero's was consistently snappy, shocking, funny, nauseating, pacey, imaginative, tense – it nevertheless contains a very good first act sequence rife with cool vehicle camera mounts and smooth, helicopter shots. The rest of the film hinges on trite twists on Romero's classic: instead of the mall being a place of refuge, our heroes are for a long while barred from the mall. Instead of our heroes being cool survivalists, they're criminals, tired hospital workers and morose security guards. Instead of a truck load of military men assaulting the mall, we have a bus load of gay priests, selfish men, obese women and whores. The implication here is that America is already messed up, overworked, degenerate, immoral, poor, marginalised, disenfranchised and has long been financially exploited, her citizens barred from the pleasures of the shopping mall. In this world, the fanatical zombie purge is almost deserved.6/10 – Aside from the first 20 minutes, this is a dull, unimaginative, predictable, and poorly shot film. Snyder's cast is mostly terrible, except for Sarah Polley, an actress who consistently turns in good performances and who has made a career out of elevating independent films. See Romero's original film instead. Worth one viewing.",Null,1,5,17 May 2011
Iron Man 2," Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots
","Perhaps because he is primarily an actor, director Jon Favreau graciously gives actor Robert Downey Jr room to run wild in 'Iron Man 2'. Favreau, who even plays Downey's servant within the film, turns the reigns almost entirely over to his leading man, every sequence designed to both make him look good, and submit us to his iron will.Indeed, Downey isn't just 'Iron Man' in this film, he's a manic God, manipulating machines, computers, TV screens, existing 3 steps above the rest of his cast and outsmarting everyone, either physically or via witty comments. And when Iron Man's not dancing on stages, applauded by audiences or wooing women, he's taking part in action sequences which first require him to order disc jockey's to fire up some music. Every thing Downey does here is self-consciously a theatrical performance. Ironic meta-acting taken to the extreme, no longer does the action hero merely wink at the audience ('Indiana Jones', 'Die Hard' etc). No, meta has gone one step more meta, the actor now playing the god, playing the god, playing the god in the machine. It's not only a question of super-reflexivity, of postmodern irony squared, but rather, a kind of contempt for all material. With plot pastiched to hell, reinvigoration has nowhere else to go but inward, the actor now as fragmented and cut-and-pasted as the film he's in.Compensating for this fragmentation is Downey's own need to dominate. His need to be the deity outside the character playing the character playing the character. Compare this to the straight faced Joker in 'Dark Knight' who, despite supposedly being an anarchist, looks completely old-school next to the freewheeling Downey (or Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow).Interestingly, unlike most superheroes, 'Iron Man' has no need for anonymity. He's pure ego, allowed to be a celebrity, a public figure, a playboy, a rich kid, a toy maker, an invincible muscle man, a billionaire industrialist and a one man military industrial complex. While most superheroes function as power fantasies, 'Iron Man' goes several steps beyond. He's a very white, Western, 21st century fantasy. A celebrity superhero for the reality TV generation; everyone must know his name.Whilst Favreau is gracious to Downey, submitting the film to the actor's improvisational talents, he also provides space for his film's other heavyweights – Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke - to run wild. Rockwell hams things up, Rourke goes to Brando lengths to internalise his character and Don Cheadle projects his usual air of noble earnestness. Beyond this, all three characters are poorly written.Surprisingly, the film rectifies the big mistake of the first 'Iron' film in that it mercilessly removes much of its dull action scenes. Aside from one surprisingly good sequence in which actress Scarlett Johansen engages in a bit of martial artistry – the best pop-corn wire-work since the Nightcrawler sequence which opens 'X-Men 2' – the film downplays action in favour for sitcom level rapid fire banter. This has ticked off audiences, but spectacle is largely dead. Most recent films praised for their action ('Avatar' et al) are completely inept, turgid and/or outdated.Of course, thematically the film is horrendous. At times it looks as though Faverau wants to use Rourke as a tool to highlight Western blow-back, the hypocrisy of peacekeepers like Iron Man and their dark pasts, but the film steers clear of these things. It knows that treating the Rourke character seriously would take things in a direction audiences can't handle, so Rourke is repeatedly pushed off into the sidelines. The result is the usual Hollywood fascism: a message of anti-militarism married to gleeful explosions, hardware and mayhem.7.5/10 – 'Iron Man 2' is all about Robert Downey's iron penis. About performance. About a kind of self-conscious, actorly domination, Downey dazzling us as he goes off on his insane jazz rifts. Now all the franchise needs is Shane Black and an R rating ala 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang'.Worth one viewing.",Null,3,6,9 May 2010
World War Z," Twelve Seconds Later
","'To tolerate life remains, after all, the first duty of all living things. Illusion has no value if it makes this harder for us. We recall the old saying: if you want to preserve peace, prepare for war. It would be in keeping with the times to alter this: if you want to endure life, prepare yourself for death.' - Freud Marc Forster's 'World War Z' stars Brad Pitt as a UN specialist on the hunt for Patient Zero, the first human to have been infected with a deadly virus. This virus turns its victims into flesh eating zombies. Pitt hopes an autopsy of Patient Zero will lead to an antidote. The clock's ticking; the virus spreads fast.Based on a novel by Max Brooks, 'Z's' first half hour mostly consists of tense sequences in which Pitt runs from zombies. It's a strong opening – America is entirely overrun within hours – which climaxes with the West's few survivors sequestering themselves on a flotilla of warships.The film's second act then sees Pitt bouncing from one country to the next, the poor guy desperate to find The Cause. When Pitt journeys to Korea and then the Middle East, you think Forster's flirting with racist clichés (Zombies as evil villains of the United Nations!), but these angles quickly evaporate. Pitt then touches down in Israel, which has erected a huge wall around its perimeter. Whilst the rest of the world has fallen to the zombie plague, Israel survives, hordes of barbaric zombies lapping against her defencive bulwarks. Again, this reeks of racist clichés, until Forster throws in scenes of Israeli Defence Force agents saving Palestinians, Arabs, Hardeim, secular Jews, Persians ('Each person we save is one less we have to fight!') and then being overrun and turned into zombies themselves. Even a little multi-ethnic solidarity can't hold back the zombie horde.'Z's' second act climaxes with a tense sequence in which a commercial airline is infiltrated by zombies. Later Pitt and a Mossad agent trek to a World Health Organization building in Cardiff. Here they battle more zombies and eventually find a cure; the zombies aren't attracted to diseased humans and so humanity must 'become sick' to avoid 'zombie infection'. In other words, mankind must infect itself in order to avoid infection.Since George Romero's zombie franchise, it's been impossible to watch a zombie movie without being pre-emptively primed to search for a socio-political allegory. Romero's six zombie films, of course, mapped a broad movement away from 1960s political consciousness, to conformity, apathy and finally a proletariat zombie revolution against corporate/feudal lords. This revolution fails, and ends with humanity myopically sequestering itself in either digital bubbles ('Diary of the Dead') or reactionary, post-capitalist fantasies ('Survival of the Dead'). For Romero, zombies weren't necessarily 'bad guys', so much as they represented a new social order which continuously replaced an outmoded old.It's thus almost impossible to watch 'World War Z' without ourselves searching for a Cause; what exactly do Forster's zombie's represent? The demands of a mass-market, global blockbuster, however, makes such a task strangely pointless. Calculated to appeal to everyone, and afraid of offending, 'Z' reads like a checklist of typical (and often contradictory) zombie themes. In this regard, Forster's zombies seem to represent every phobia and affliction plaguing contemporary society: poverty, xenophobia, communication breakdowns, national, global and racial anxieties etc etc. Some of these angles stick better than others. For example, the film suggests that endemic third world poverty (North Korea, Africa, India, China etc) provides a breeding ground for pathogens. Elsewhere our hero is unemployed and job hunting, an attack in a plane reads like steerage attacking first class passengers, the film suggests that globalisation accelerates inequality, and scenes on-board military ships and air-planes suggest that the first world can no longer hide from the injustices forced upon everyone else; globalisation shrinks the globe.But other scenes contradict these readings. It is prayers to God and boisterous Palestinians which lead to zombies overrunning Israel, ethnic minorities are some of the first to be mauled, and early scenes have a more broad, existential slant. 'Mother Nature's a serial killer,' one scientist say, 'no one's better or more creative!' To confuse things further, you have Max Brooks likening zombies to AIDS ('The notion of a walking plague comes from growing up in the 1980s, when AIDS went from an obscure curiosity to a global pandemic. If that's not zombies, I don't know what is.') and far right critics reading the film as a tale about militant Islam. Meanwhile, regular Joe's read the film as a metaphor for HOW I WANT TO SHOOT PEOPLE AND NOT GET JAILED, whilst Freudian types view the entire zombie genre as mankind being infatuated with the spectacle of the apocalypse, audiences desiring the very deaths/purges they habitually disavow.Regardless of how one interpret's 'Z's' zombies, the film's 'antidote' is a stroke of genius. 'It's not a cure, just a way to hide,' characters say, the film suggesting that for humanity to survive the zombie horde, man must 'pretend to be a zombie', 'share the enemy's weaknesses' and eventually 'become one with them'. What does this say about most human conflicts?Aesthetically, Forster's film is all over the place. His CGI zombies feel plastic and don't convince, and the film's attempts at realism/authenticity are constantly undermined by Hollywood glitter. Elsewhere Forster's violence lacks gore and eschews close ups, and though his zombies are of the running variety (with 12 second incubation periods), they rarely seem threatening. Unlike Romero's films, Forster also naively keeps 'man' and 'nature' separated, never sympathises with his zombies and his protagonists are all righteous types. At its best, the film portrays a humanity desperate and under siege, afraid to touch land and so hiding on clouds and water. At its worst, the film recalls 'I Am Legend', another plastic, post-apocalyptic film, tailored for those who hate the genre.7.9/10 - Worth two viewings.",Null,2,4,10 October 2013
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Full frontal buffoonery
","'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' is a sex comedy about a middle aged man who, seeking to get over a broken heart, goes on holiday to Hawaii. Once there he meets his ex girlfriend, Sarah Marshall, the very woman he is trying to forget. Hilarity then ensues...supposedly.In some circles the film is touted as some kind of modern comedy masterpiece, but it's a slow, formulaic, unfunny film, and its song sequences can't touch 'The Wedding Singer', the broken-heart film it infrequently seems to be emulating. Nevertheless, some of the film's secondary characters – William Baldwin, Jonah Hill and the always funny Paul Rudd – generate giggles, and the film makes two pretty great uses of male, full-frontal nudity, suggestive here of a kind of vulnerability and emotional nakedness.See Paul Rudd in 'The Shape of Things' instead, a recent sex comedy which completely re-writes the rule book.5/10 – Worth one viewing.",Null,2,6,20 January 2012
Seven Years in Tibet," What Lies Beneath
","'It is better to travel well than to arrive.' - Buddha Based on a true story, Jean-Jacques Annaud's 'Seven Years in Tibet' stars Brad Pitt as Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer. As he lived in Tibet between the years 1944 and 1951, Harrer witnessed China's 'invasion' of Tibet. This 'invasion' forced the 14th Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader, to flee into India. 'Seven Years' was released in 1997, the same year as Martin Scorsese's 'Kundun'. Both films present idealised portraits of theocratic, late-feudal Tibet. They romanticise Buddhism, fawn over the Himalayas, and pine nostalgically for Tibetan customs and traditions. In the hands of Annaud and Scorsese, the more radical and so interesting aspects of Buddhism are also ignored. Orientalism (portrayals of the East by the West which generally exhibit cultural bias and/or ignorance) typically represents Eastern cultures as inscrutable and mysterious. The West is offered as a bastion of logic, empiricism and science, whilst Eastern cultures are deemed esoteric, mystical and superstitious. In 'Seven Years in Tibet', however, Harrer and the Dalai Lama take turns inhabiting the roles of 'student' and 'teacher'. Elsewhere they ridicule each other's fussy customs and traditions, whilst also displaying a shared interest in science, geography and engineering. This is perhaps not surprising. With no holy writs, no deities, and with its interests in scientific enquiry, Buddhism's always been one of the more science-friendly 'religions'. Annaud's film climaxes with the Chinese army marching into Tibet and massacring Tibetan soldiers. In reality, this battle did not occur. Before his film closes, Annaud also informs us that over a million Tibetans died at the hands of 'evil Chinese communists', a cooked number which most serious academics reject. Scenes like this make 'Seven Years in Tibet' a covertly political film, the Dalai Llama presented as a saintly figure unjustly torn from his people and so deserving of political reinstatement. That the Dalai Lama leads only one branch of Tibetan Buddhists, and that the only people calling for his 'return' are the unelected Tibetan royals who exploited Tibetans via a repressive military-ruled feudal state, are messy realities ignored by Annaud. That the Lamas speak for themselves and not the Tibetan people (just as every group of privileged exiles has turned to the United States to help them return to power, the Dalai Lama received CIA funding for a number of years), that half of Tibet's population were serfs or slaves before the Chinese arrived (the rest were under the autocratic rule of the Tibetan aristocracy), and that Tibetan peasants sided with Communists and aggressively attacked Tibetan-theocratic institutions, is likewise ignored. Indeed, Tibetan peasants were some of the most radicalised Communists in China precisely because they suffered heavily under their previous rulers. This is not to defend the actions of China – certainly the Lamas were capable of reforming Tibet themselves, certainly every populace deserves to be autonomous if it so wishes, certainly China's migration policies affect how Tibetans now vote on issues of independence – but to highlight the fact that Annaud has presented a sanitised portrait of the region.Most big films 'about' Buddhism avoid the 'tenets' of Buddhism. In 'Seven Years in Tibet', Harrer and the Dalai Lama share a number of cute scenes, but philosophy largely remains off-topic. A better director would fully exploit the possibilities that this material lends – why does a character like the Dalai Llama, who renounces the ego, selfhood and private property care about quaint systems of land ownership and leadership? Didn't exile make the Dalai Llama a wiser man? etc – but again Annaud only cares about the superficial. The film costars Jamyang Wangchuk and David Thewlis. 7.5/10 – See 'The Last Emperor', 'Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter and Spring' and 'Into Great Silence'.",Null,11,13,16 February 2015
Mississippi Burning," Slick but dumb film 'about' racism
","'One cannot separate economics, political science, and history. Politics is the control of the economy. History, when accurately and fully recorded, is that story. In most textbooks and classrooms, not only are these three fields of study separated, but they are further compartmentalised into separate subfields, obscuring the close interconnections between them.' - J.W. Smith Most films supposedly 'about racism' are covertly racist or promote racial stereotypes ('Monster's Ball', 'Color Purple', 'Sayonara', 'The Blind Side', Sidney Poitier vehicles etc etc). Alan Parker's 'Missisippi Burning' is no different (Parker directed the equally dubious 'Midnight Express' a decade earlier).Loosely based on the real life murders of civil rights workers in Mississippi, the film stars Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe as a pair of FBI agents who journey to Jessup County. Here they interrogate, investigate and trade blows with the local townsfolk, most of whom are KKK members, racist, or believe in a form of white exceptionalism typical of 1960s America. The film takes place in 1964, a year before steps were taken to dismantle America's Jim Crow Laws, which promoted racial segregation and white supremacy.Like most of these films, black characters are marginalised, a white character is our entryway into the tale, the black experience is ignored and white racism is caricatured or treated as a 'personal belief' rather than a systemic/structural phenomenon. This being Hollywood, racism is also understood entirely as an issue of 'race' rather than class (racism is a key mechanism for the stabilisation of capitalism and the legitimisation of inequality). Indeed, as the economic forces which cause such things continue to exist today, contemporary society is every bit as racist as it was in the 1960s. Minorities face tougher court sentences, are overwhelmingly sent to wars, there are more black men in prison than were used as slaves at the height of chattel slavery, and minorities dominate homeless/poverty/mental-ill-health/incarceration statistics. And as the core of the system stabilises, new forms of racism are pushed outward, other country's and cultures demonized to foster further accumulation. Ironically, the end result of this is an increased persecution of whites and the middle classes: capitalism has to come for them next. Racism is itself more than an ideology, a belief system or a negative attitude towards others arising out of prejudice. If that alone were the case then racism would be reduced to something which takes place inside human heads. But such an understanding ignores a chief factor behind racism (as well as sexism): Power and the capacity to act. Or as the old civil rights mantra went, 'racism equals prejudice plus power'.In our era, though, the most important factor in reinvigorating a whole new round of global racism is the resurgence of a certain brand of Reaganite conservatism (or neoliberalism), whose hallmark was the reinstatement of laissez-faire economic policies and rhetoric. Subject to such 'unchecked capitalism', the poor got poorer, the middle class was destroyed, debts exponentially increased, and the great big national Ponzi scheme was forced to go abroad, often violently with wars, Uncle Sam's Mickey Mouse Club desperately sucking up new members for life support. But beyond this, the Reaganite doctrine of inequality gave the official seal of approval to ideas of racial superiority that right-wing extremists had used for years to rationalise the exploitation of minorities. If the economic gap between whites and non-whites was growing, if most non-whites live below the poverty line - well, that just proved that there was a racial component in the free-market's Social-Darwinian selection process; minorities 'deserved' their poverty because they were 'less fit' and 'winners' 'deserved' their gains because of personal merit, hard work and intelligence. The logical corollary of this is that whites who are 'less fit' also deserve their poverty.But the most insidious thing about 'Mississippi Burning' is its valorising of FBI agents, who are painted as moral guardians and heroes of the civil rights era. In reality, the FBI and CIA have always been racist organisations (see Costa Gavras' 'Betrayal'), responsible for countless unlawful operations against Civil Rights activists, unions and progressive movements. The forces behind numerous assassinations and coups across the world, both parties have the blood of millions on their hands. Indeed, in the period depicted in the film, the FBI would routinely sit back and watch while local mobs or police patrols beat down on gays and blacks, just as after the Civil War blacks were left at the mercy of Southern power/plantation owners by Northern politicians who made deals with the South. Unsurprisingly, one of the first acts of the FBI, which was actually tentatively set up by the grand nephew of Napoleon in 1908, was to prosecute Jack Johnson, a black man, for a now banned law that was both sexist and racist. Parker is so steadfast in his attempts to white-wash this history that he creates a black FBI agent. But there were NO black persons in the FBI in 1964, unless they were doing janitorial or chauffeur work. No surprise then that the film omits one large fact: the FBI and Federal Government were warned in advance that killings in Mississippi would happen, and activists and law experts explained to the federal government weeks in advance that it was their constitutional obligation to send protection down to Mississippi prior to and during several planned civil rights protests. These demands went all the way to the White House, via Attorney General Robert Kennedy, but where ignored. While these demands for a few hundred marshals went out, 40,000 soldiers were being shipped to Vietnam. Twelve days later the three victims of this film disappear. End result: a film about racism which turns the historical racists into heroes.5/10 - Worth one viewing.",Null,3,7,20 January 2012
Au Revoir les Enfants," Goodbye, children. I'll see you soon.
","'To make up for its lack of a moral compass, the public is prey to sudden gusts of kitschy sentimentality followed by vehement outrage, all encouraged by the cheap and cynical sensationalism of its press.' – Theodore Dalrymple Louis Malle's 'Au Revoir Les Enfants' tells the tale of a young Jewish child who is sheltered from the Nazis (and Vichy police) by a Catholic school during World War 2. The film is the spiritual sequel to Malle's earlier 'Lacombe, Lucian' - another autobiographical tale about a boy sold out to the Nazis - but is directed with much more skill. This is the glossiest and slickest of Malle's films.The bulk of the film concerns the blossoming friendship between a young French boy and Jewish boy, and their fears of living away from their parents and home. It is along these lines that the film works best, Malle capturing the confusion, fear, vulnerability and wonder of youth. One scene, a school organised treasure hunt in the woods, is powerful.While the film thinks it is 'enlightened' and 'liberal', it merely offers another form of anti-Semitism. Malle depicts Jews as cute, lovable, superior and exotic, systematically reversing the sinister venalities of Nazi agitprop. Malle's camera is infatuated with young, Jewish beauty, salivating over the Jewish child and fawning over his 'talents', 'innocence', 'grace' and 'allurement'. In boot-licking the Jew's preciousness, the film not only suggests that a less attractive non-Jewish child is less worthy of being spared, but partakes in the very same kind of 'objectification of humanity' that the Nazis did, such a stance being one of the psychological mechanisms that enabled the Holocaust and continues to fuel knee-jerk anti-Semitism today.The film is shot in icy greys, whites and blues, and is structured as a series of recollections by a now adult Malle (the tale is partially autobiographical). Malle's camera coddles and sighs over the Jewish boy, and then weeps when the kid is removed, during the film's climax, from the school compound by Nazi soldiers. Interestingly, it is a poor youth who turns the Jewish boy in to the Nazis; working class resentment smoothly misdirected toward society's scapegoats.8/10 - Worth one viewing.",Null,1,4,27 September 2011
The Impossible," Black Hawk Down
","'Sufficiently advanced negligence is indistinguishable from malice.' - Virginia Fell December 26th, 2004. An earthquake in the Indian Ocean unleashes a violent tsunami. 50 foot waves hurtle toward Indonesia, Thailand, Sir Lanka and India. Coastal regions surrounding the Indian Ocean are devastated. Hundreds of thousands die or go missing. Millions are left homeless. As is always the case with natural disasters, the poor and the marginalised suffer the most, losing their lives, homes, possessions and/or livelihoods. When the waters recede, thousands more die due to contaminated drinking water and disease.Within 15 minutes of the earthquake, the American weather bureau in Hawaii warns 26 countries to expect an imminent tsunami radiating from the quake's epicentre. None of the countries finally affected are deemed worthy of being notified. The Japanese weather bureau detects the quake but likewise fails to pass on its information. The Indian Air Force receives news of the quake/tsunami, but this news gets lost in bureaucracy and is not passed on. Thailand is alerted but officials dare not launch a national alert for fear of causing panic. Two years prior to the tsunami, the Inter-Governmental Oceanographic Commission predicts a possible quake/tsunami in the region and stresses the need to put in place early detection networks. Because Member States all view national tsunami warning and mitigation facilities as being 'unprofitable', the Commission's cautions are ignored. Had the 2004 tsunami occurred in the Pacific Ocean, it would have been detected by the international tsunami warning system.In the years leading up to the tsunami, environmentalists warn that the destruction of each country's 'bio-shields' will exasperate the damage done by future tsunamis. They're ignored. Considered impediments to the South Asian economy, miles of coral reef are destroyed (via dynamite) and miles of coastal mangrove culled, all to make way for shipping lanes, shrimp farms, aquaculture industries and other economic choices (Thailand has lost half its mangrove cover over the past 2 decades). As predicted, areas stripped of their 'natural' defences are hit the hardest by the tsunami. Where the mangrove/coral fields were left intact, no lives were lost and little damage done. To satiate economic interests, the poor, living precariously on the water's edge, are deemed a rational sacrifice. Following the tsunami, the damaged land – now 'devalued' - is gobbled up by wealthy investors. The poor are pushed even further out and the strategically grabbed land reallocated for future tourism development.Juan Bayona's 'The Impossible', a film about the 2004 tsunami, bills itself as a film about 'the triumph of the human spirit in the face of adversity'. It was the 'human spirit' that caused the adversity, but let's ignore that. Let's focus instead on some white tourists. They're played by Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor, a British (?) couple who travel to Thailand with their two sons. On the way to their hotel, Watts reads some Joseph Conrad ('Heart of Darkness', 'Typhoon'?), presumably because she loves symbolism. After much foreshadowing, a series of monster waves descend upon our white family. 300,000 deaths later, and the couple's son learns to be less of a jerk. The family hug and fly back to Disneyland, leaving Thailand behind. Things work out pretty well for them.The film pretends to be about 'universal goodwill', about how 'tragedy brings people together'. It's mostly relentlessly dehumanising. People do not matter unless they're white, the film filled with white victims and the white dispossessed. Local characters are either invisible or reduced to a couple rescue units at the bidding of white sufferers. Whilst many have complained that our foregrounded characters are white, that's not really the problem. The problem's that background characters are likewise. The fact that the vast majority of the dead, injured and displaced were Asian never registers. This has an interesting effect. In the way the film panders to white audiences whilst pretending to be about the universality of suffering, its message becomes, unconsciously, that nobody cares, and that target audiences identify only with their own. It's not economically feasible to cater to the Other. Of course it's fitting that a film about universal goodwill largely ignores the suffering of non-white characters. The real life event hinged on a similar social dismissal. A film about the plight of wealthy, vacationing Westerners which turns a blind eye to the deaths of thousands of locals perfectly sums up the lesson of the tsunami itself; they don't matter.The film's built upon your typical Hollywood/Spielberg disaster/history movie formula ('Schindler', 'Deep Impact' etc). We're reduced to being made to empathise with a handful of souls and then positioned to celebrate when our chosen few escape the fate of thousands around them. The formula works well as popcorn – it ably resorts to the usual shock tactics and horror clichés - but is also crass: we have to cheaply kill/maim others in order to engender the basest of emotions. Along the way we ourselves are dehumanised, made complicit in dehumanising those who are sacrificed for closure and our chosen few. McGregor would defend the film's racial politics by comparing criticisms levelled against it to those levelled against 'Black Hawk Down'. But 'Down' was a sinister, similarly racist film which posited American Colonialists as victims of a historical situation in which they were precisely the victimisers, responsible for all manners of evil, namely backing brutal puppet dictators (Siad Barre et al), destabilising (and waging proxy wars with) Somlia and Ethiopia, genocide, bankrupting Somalia, manufacturing famine, assassinating revolutionary leaders, engendering untold amounts of bloodshed, arming psychos, enforcing media blackouts and waging a secret war on the democratically elected Islamic Courts Union for the specific aim of stopping any semblance of nationhood in Somalia (all at the behest of Conoco, Amoco, Chevron, Phillips etc). 'Black Hawk Down's' not a defence, it's the problem. 6/10 – Generic, well acted, white-centric, self-absorbed FX porn.

Shaun of the Dead," Zombie see, Zombie do
","'The tyranny of a prince in an oligarchy is not so dangerous to the public welfare as the apathy of a citizen in a democracy.' - Charles de Montesquieu Edgar Wright directs 'Shaun of the Dead', a spoof of George Romero's 'serious' zombie series and the 'comedic' zombie movies of John A. Russo's 'Return of the Living Dead' franchise. The film flattens and cheapens the politics of Romero's work, but is faster, funnier, slicker and more affable than all of Russo's.While Romero's films went out of their way to encapsulate the social and political mores of different decades ('Night of the Living Dead' 1960s America, 'Dawn of the Dead' the 1970s, 'Day of the Dead' the 80s, 'Land of the Dead' the 90s, 'Diary of the Dead' and 'Survival of the Dead' the first two decades of the 21st century), what 'Shaun' says is more unconscious: the modern world breeds zombies and stifles ambition, being a zombie hampers upward mobility, upward mobility is necessary to draw in women, and women are all that rescue zombie spouses from total, slothful zombiedom (the film's climactic dues ex machina even features an army being led by a woman). Meanwhile, all couples embrace being zombies and all eventually become content in their zombie society, as all heavy work is outsourced to lesser zombies, freeing middle-class zombies to work in their white collar zombie society and watch zombie TV and play zombie video games. The film advocates zombiedom, because all zombie man and his zombie audience want, in their shared perpetual stupor, is media stimulation, sex, a relatively non-taxing 9 to 5 job, and various consumer pleasures. You are fine being a zombie, you want to be a zombie, being a zombie is good, is easy, as long as you have electricity, a wedding ring, and other zombies are doing all the manual labour. Unlike Romero's films, all this is sanctioned rather than presented as being abhorrent. See the 2007 remake of 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers', which likewise embraces defeatism, and advocates that its cast and audience become alien pod-people; you're better off without your brain. Submit.Incidentally, the recent 'Zombieland' does exactly what 'Shaun of the Dead' does, using zombies as being representative of an aching longing for 1980s consumerism (the sweet, 'brainless' embrace of video games, Atari, Ghostbusters, Bill Murry, 80s fantasy etc). Contrast this to Romero's 'Land of the Dead'.7.9/10 – Though very funny and stylish, this is sitcom level drama and humour. Worth two viewings.",Null,1,3,19 January 2012
Argo," CIA green-lights Affleck movie; Jason Bourne facepalms
","Directed by and starring Ben Affleck, 'Argo' is based on a now declassified military operation which took place during the Iran hostage crisis of 1979-1980. Bizarrely for a western film, it opens with a segment which briefly sketches Western 'involvement' in Iran. The gist of the segment is this: in 1953, the US, UK and their respective corporate cartels staged a coup and successfully overthrew the democratically elected government of Iran (specifically Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh, who was set to nationalise local oil). They then installed Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, a brutal puppet who ruled as Shah of Iran until 1979, at which point he was overthrown by a local revolution led by religious leader Ayatollah Khomeini.'Argo's' introductory history lesson doesn't tell us this, but despite the rise of Khomeini being presented as a populist and spontaneous uprising, he was partially backed by both the US and UK, all with the specific aim of ousting Pahlavi, who had grown too big for his boots. Prior to his ousting, Pahlavi had begun to flex his muscles, refusing to sign away exclusive oil rights and beginning a programme to seek 'oil-sales policy independence'. The superpowers didn't like this. They staged another illegal coup, and the CIA began courting the Muslim Brotherhood and the Ayatollahs, all essentially right-wing fundamentalists. These clandestine operations echo CIA orchestrated coups against democratically elected officials in Guatemala, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Haiti, Guyana, Cuba etc etc, most of whom were trying to implement reforms, nationalise resources or help the poor. Can't have that.Shortly prior to the toppling of Pahlavi, a 'soft war' was waged against Iran. The West refused to buy Iranian oil, began a campaign of economic pressure, planted covert agitators to fan religious discontent, put embargoes in place, staged oil and banking strikes and began cynically protesting the presence of 'Iranian abuses of human rights'. Meanwhile Khomeini, who was being groomed to be the new leader of Iran, began appearing on Western news networks, which willingly gave voice to his propaganda. The message was clear: Anglo-American intelligence was committed to toppling their puppet. The Shah fled in January and by February 1979 Khomeini had been flown into Iran to replace the Shah's government and proclaim the establishment of his own repressive theocratic state. Almost immediately, the US began funding Iraq's decade long war against Iran.Over the years, whistle-blowing would reveal the point of the Iranian fiasco: the radical Muslim Brotherhood movement behind Khomeini was endorsed specifically in order to promote the balkanization of the entire Muslim Near East along tribal and religious lines. In encouraging autonomous groups it was hoped that chaos would spread in what was termed an 'Arc of Crisis', which would spill over into Muslim regions of the Soviet Union. Of course such arrangements never go quite to plan, but then, chaos partially was the plan.'Argo' takes place during the 1979 Iranian Revolution. During this Revolution, Iranians stormed the US embassy and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. Six American diplomats present in the embassy escaped and secretly found shelter in the home of a Canadian ambassador. 'Argo' tells the story of the CIA's mission to rescue these six. It finds Affleck playing CIA hostage expert Tony Mendez, who concocts a brilliantly ridiculous rescue scheme. His plan? To pose as members of a Canadian film unit scouting locations for a kitschy science fiction movie. At its best, the film works as a comedy which pokes fun at science fiction conventions, the incredulity of Mendez's idea, and the assortment of Hollywood oddballs he gathers together in an attempt to execute his plan. Various cheesy scifi tropes – multi-ethnic aliens getting along – have the larger effect of humanising Iranians, science fiction used to warmly build bridges across a very specific West/East divide.Elsewhere Affleck tries to take on bigger themes – the power of the media over the gun etc – but fails completely. His film eventually degenerates into a safe, conventional thriller. And despite its brief introductory coda, which pays lip-service to Neocolonial intervention, the film ultimately ignores the West's abhorrences and magically devolves into a thriller in which cunning CIA heroes evade menacing, monstrously portrayed Iranians. Iranians are still the enemy, prejudices are reaffirmed, the CIA is glorified, history's whitewashed and the film is designed to be self-aggrandising for Western audiences. Affleck's opening coda provides a veneer of objectivity, but the film itself salivates over the CIA, cool US foreign 'intervention', and is hilariously blind to the political context in which it was shot and released (a decade of US military occupations on either side of Iran and an ongoing embargo and covert war on Iran itself). After all, six American lives are at stake!Affleck (he'd play the pro-CIA Jack Ryan) and Matt Damon (he'd play the CIA hating Jason Bourne) wrote 'Good Will Hunting' in the mid 1990s. That film contained a funny monologue in which Damon's character justifies never joining the NSA/CIA. If he joins, he rationalises, he'll be responsible for getting foreigners killed, foreigners he has no problem with, all so oil friendly puppet dictators can be put in place, which in turn will lead to his buddies losing their jobs at home to jobs outsourced to the enemy he just killed, all in the name of oil-spilling, environment killing oil cartels who then jack up pump prices on both him and his buddies. Damon's solution? Why not save time, 'shoot my buddy, take his job, give it to his sworn enemy, hike up gas prices, bomb a village, club a baby seal, hit the hash pipe and join the National Guard? I could be elected President.' 6/10 - Affleck's trying to conjure up 1970s political thrillers ('Missing', 'State of Siege' etc), but his source material is severely limiting; 'Argo's' very funny first half quickly collapses into heavily censored, CIA sanctioned thriller clichés.

Star Trek Into Darkness," His pattern indicates two-dimensional thinking
","'Star Trek: Into Darkness' opens with its best sequence. Here Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) saves the inhabitants of the planet Nibiru from an extinction-threatening volcanic eruption. Kirk's actions violate the Prime Directive of the organisation he works for – the United Federation of Planets – which forbids meddling in the affairs of certain species. This meddling, the Prime Directive argues, may derail the evolutionary paths of other indigenous lifeforms, possibly condemning them to extinction. That the Federation does not allow one to 'play God' in such circumstances, contradicts its other Utopian mandates; it exists to help others and foster intergalactic co-operation.Whilst saving the inhabitants of Nibiru, Kirk also breaks another Federation cardinal rule; he contaminates the evolution of Nibiru culture by revealing advanced technology to the 'primitive' locals. Kirk does this to save the life of his buddy, Commander Spock (Zachary Quinto). Spock insists that Kirk made a poor decision. 'The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few,' he scolds his captain. Kirk tells Spock to shut his damned utilitarian mouth.The aforementioned sequence is pretty much the only interesting thing about 'Star Trek: Into Darkness'. In it, director J.J Abrams captures that blend of science, philosophy, adventure, space-communism and Kennedy-era chauvinism that made the original 'Star Trek' television series popular. After this sequence ends, however, Abrams proceeds to unleash a tsunamis of clichés. His film features yet another dull super-villain, generic action sequences, silly battles with comically large 'big, black spaceships', and a plot that spends most of its time inventing plot twists only to promptly undo them. The film sees Kirk 'dramatically' losing command, for example, yet he re-assumes command moments later. The film sees Spock transferred to another captain, yet is reunited with Kirk when the film's first crisis occurs. The film's villain, meanwhile, is 'sympathetically' portrayed, a stance which is quickly undone by a needless betrayal. Kirk's engineer, Commander Scott (Simon Pegg), likewise 'dramatically resigns', yet is back with his buddies soon after. The film even ends with a giant deus-ex-machina, Kirk heroically dying to save his friend, a sacrifice which is made irrelevant when he is suddenly given a miracle cure.Ironic for a franchise which espouses 'infinite diversity in infinite combinations', no 'Star Trek' movie can go six inches without ripping-off 'Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan'. As such, Abrams borrows his villain from director Nicholas Meyer's 1982 film. He also ends his picture with a reversal of the famous sacrifice at the end of 'Wrath of Khan'. In that film, Spock dies so that Kirk and his crew may live. In Abrams' picture, Kirk dies so that Spock may live. Are these reversals a conscious attempt to create a parallel universe which echoes but subtly differs from the original Trek time-line? Are these reversals simply emblematic of lazy writing? Is this all bad fan-boy lip-service? Or does Abrams have some elaborate twist up his sleeve? Is he subtly turning his Trek franchise into what Trek fans call 'The Mirror Universe', a parallel universe in which the Utopian ideals of the Federation were not realized, and in which human society became militaristic and violent instead? Is Abrams setting up the pessimistic flip-side to Trekkian optimism? After all, in Abrams' series, the planet Vulcan (a bastion of logic, rationality and the guiding force which shaped the ethos of the United Federation of Planets) has been destroyed and our heroic Captain Kirk is revealed to have 'evil' clone DNA in his blood. Does this franchise now literally go 'into the darkness' that is Mirror Trek?Regardless, the second half of 'Darkness' finds Abrams attempting to get political. His film contains a subplot which criticises extralegal killings, drone strikes and Western warmongers who manipulate hot-headed warriors and cook up false-flag operations in order to justify invasions. Though well-meaning, these themes feel shoe-horned into a picture which has no interest in them, and most are undermined by Abrams' need to turn his villain into a literal 'evil terrorist' anyway. Elsewhere the film features unimaginatively remodelled Klingons (a warrior race which now wears 'Predator' styled face-masks), clichéd Evil Starfleet Admirals (complete with 'Dr Strangelove' War Rooms), a Medical Officer who's reduced to a one-liner delivery system (Karl Urban), and yet another villain whose plan necessitates that he 'let himself be captured by the enemy and be kept in a cell'. The film also features hokey transporter technology, which now lets people 'beam' across vast chunks of space, thereby eradicating the need for spaceships. It ends with our heroes punching a bad guy on what looks like a flying garbage truck. Apparently that's how problems are solved in the 23rd century.7/10 – Worth one viewing.",Null,3,6,31 March 2015
12 Angry Men," Pardon me, but don't you ever sweat?
","'If you follow the crowd, you will likely get no further than the crowd. If you walk alone, you're likely to end up in places no one has ever been before. This is not without its difficulties, for peculiarity breeds contempt.' – Oscar Wilde Sidney Lumet's '12 Angry Men' opens with a teenage boy sitting before a judge. He's been accused of murdering his father. All evidence points to him having committed the crime and even the kid's lawyer believes him to be guilty. Enter the jury: 12 men tasked with settling upon a verdict. It seems certain that they will all find the kid accountable. After all, the facts prove that this kid killed his father. Don't they?The jury seclude themselves in a tiny room and take votes. 11 men find the kid guilty. One doesn't. The majority look at the 12th with bemusement. He's Henry Fonda, a mild mannered architect with a temperament of quiet confidence. How dare this guy disagree with them? How dare he stand alone? Tensions develop and the men begin to argue. Fonda plays it cool, stating that he doesn't necessarily believe the kid to be innocent, he simply wants to discuss the matter. After all, a kid's life is on the line. Why make hasty judgements? Why not talk things out, investigate the issue and dig a little deeper? Reluctantly, the others agree to talk. The kid's guilty, no doubt about it, so why not grant this wacky guy a couple hours of discussion? They're getting the day off work anyway. Humour the guy. And of course as the 12 men investigate the case, they begin to grow doubtful. Previously agreed upon truth comes crumbling down, ambiguities arise, new facts come to light, testimonies are cast in a new shade and the motives of witnesses and jurors are shown to be skewed by personal vendettas and a range of social/racial/personal biases.The film eventually ends with Henry Fonda, an iconic actor in one of his finest (if far too angelic) roles, having convinced the entire jury that the kid is innocent. With his quiet probing, his appeals to curiosity, truth and intellect over emotional hysteria, popular opinion and snap judgements, Fonda successfully opposes the other jurors. The film's message: question the majority, test the Gods with a hammer and be suspicious of commonly held truths. And most importantly, be tactful when contesting the majority, least they threaten you with a switchblade. But who cares? Normal is only a statistical distribution anyway.Upon release, 'Angry' was read as a cautionary tale about McCarthyism, then a hot topic. Later its message became more broad: about a callous society's indifference to the less fortunate and willingness to unjustly sustain false accusations. Today, the film's almost a parody of bleeding heart liberals, many siding with the film's courtroom conservatives as a result. 'What is this?' actor Lee J Cobb fumes in the film, 'Love Your Underprivileged Brother Week or something?' His stance is typical today. The notion that offenders are too heavily viewed as victims of oppression, deprivation, racism, mental disorder, systemic problems etc, and so deserving of support rather than punishment.Aesthetically, '12 Angry Men' is remarkable; Lumet's camera work is superb and the film drips with both atmosphere and tension. The film also differs hugely from other legal dramas, taking place almost entirely within a jury's room and so sidestepping most of the the usual genre clichés (courtroom antics, last minute testimonials, witnesses, cathartic group-hugs etc).'12 Angry Men' may also be the finest film shot around a table. Indeed, any director will tell you that filming large groups of people conversing over a table is one of the most taxing things to do. Keeping track of eye-lines, coverage, body positions, shooting each individual from multiple angles over and over again...it's a mighty chore just to get things down on the most basic level, let alone keep the thing feeling kinetic and fresh.So what's remarkable about '12 Angry Men' is how much of a spatial movie it is. Director Sidney Lumet, who has a background in theatre (a very static medium, hence, perhaps, the initial appeal of such a claustrophobic script), charts his jury's room with a fluid camera. Watch how gorgeous his mise-en-scene is, how choreographed each character's body movements are, how Lumet's camera traces each character, assigning them spaces within the room. It's an incredibly organised little movie, Lumet dancing us deftly throughout this tiny arena, only to then spew his victors back out into the real world with a series of magnificently expansive shots.Then there's the acting. Lumet has always been an actor's director, and here he populates his film with a wealth of wonderful character actors. But Fonda's the star of course. Dressed in an angelic white suit, he's exactly the kind of morally righteous everyman hero which made many of Jimmy Stewart's early roles so popular. With a mixture of 'aww shucks', suave sexiness and quiet intelligence, Fonda's immediately endearing. Unfortunately, the motivations of those who oppose Fonda are at times very heavy handed (everyone but Fonda is a raging buffoon, a sneaky attempt to elevate him), each one deliberately positioned to be shot down. End result: a heroic tale of progressive compassion defeating reactionary prejudice, in which the saintly conqueror of bigotry is himself bullying, has a firm agenda and is being buffeted by emotionalism.10/10 – More great courtroom movies: 'The Verdict', 'Paths of Glory', 'Compulsion', 'Death on the Staircase', 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance', 'Capturing The Friedmans', 'The Paper Chase' and 'Murder on a Sunday Morning'. Lesser legal flicks: 'Inherit the Wind', 'JFK', 'Adam's Rib', 'Anatomy of A Murder', 'The Caine Mutiny', 'Witness for the Prosecution', 'Miracle on 34th Street', 'My Cousin Vinny', 'Anatomy of a Murder'.

Beauty and the Beast," Cocteau vs Disney
","'The Beauty and the Beast' fable has been around for a long time, present in various forms in various different cultures under various different names. For example, in the 1600s there existed a similar Germanic folk-tale, often titled 'The Beast' or 'The Wolf Prince'.Regardless, the fable is similar in each version, and seems to have started out as a tale told to young women in order to prepare them for intercourse and future marriage. At its core, the story says that man is an animal, is bestial, until a young woman's love redeems him. Or rather: man is not a sexual animal at all, once the woman gets to know him properly.So like most folk tales, this is a giant fantasy designed to placate (and probably even has evolutionary value). In the story the Beast loves the woman, lusts for her daily, though she does not love him. To keep the Beast's hormones at bay, the young woman promises to meet him at his castle, but because she is bound to her father and loves the old man dearly, forgets all about the Beast, who slowly dies of grief. The young woman, seeing the Beast dying, then suddenly realises that the Beast loves her and swiftly falls in love.In a very archetypal sense, the fable symbolizes the union between a sexually developed man and a young, innocent female who views the man as beastly at first, but eventually grows to love him. This happens after she cuts all ties with her father, who up until that point had been the only male figure in her life. When she accepts the Beast, he literally becomes beautiful, his clothes and bestial figure vanishing such that he turns into a prince.Jean Cocteau's 'Beauty and the beast' (1946), a film which retells this tale, keeps the same structure but treats it in a much more baroque fashion. It's still a tale filled with much primal, repressed sexuality, but Cocteau is such a master stylist that he imbues virtually every scene with wonderful visual flourishes. With its dancing candle holders, animated household objects and statues, the film is a triumph of art design.Unsurprisingly, the Disney version of 'Beauty and the Beast' waters things down further. In the Disney version, the young woman is an introvert and outcast (but gorgeous of course) who views the world differently to all the other young women around her.Being different allows the young woman to see and empathise with the 'goodness' at the heart of the Beast, and so the two outcasts join together, teaching us that it's ultimately 'what's inside that counts'. (if this is so, why does the Beast transform into a prince and why is the 'beauty' always outwardly beautiful as well? Where are all the fairy tales about an ugly woman struggling to inseminate a Doberman?)This kind of 'march at the beat of your own drum' and 'be different because you are better than everyone else' morality tale is common in Disney flicks, but there is also a slightly dark underside to this updated version of the tale.Both the Disney and Cocteau version of the myth feature a 'Gaston' character who is not found in the original, ancient folk tales. This character represents the 'common mentality' or 'the standard values'. He's the 'practical male figure' who the young woman should marry, and whom she is encouraged to marry by her friends and family, but whom she possesses no love for. This little addition updates the tale for a more enlightened society, by portraying 'woman' as having a certain freedom: the ability to choose the 'bad boy', the 'beast', and indulging in her own carnal fantasies, regardless of what her parents say. Of course to make this fantasy palatable, the story has to romanticise the beast and ruthlessly villainize the 'practical man'.In any case, all these re-tellings of 'Beauty and the Beast' highlight how petty humans are. Incidentally, early art work from the 17th century featured the beast as a literal wolf or dog creature, often with an erect penis, the young woman on her ankles submissively before him. One recalls a line ironically spoken by Jack Nicholson in 'The Shining': 'Perfect for a child.' 8/10 – Cocteau's 'Beauty and the Beast' 7.5/10 – Disney's 'Beauty and the Beast' I suspect modern audiences are so familiar with this fairy tale that both Cocteau and Disney's 'retelling' seem like old news. Still, Cocteau's film features wonderful art design (Cocteau mingled with many French surrealists), inventive camera work and is pleasantly fast paced. It's probably the best version of this story, though I wonder what use modern man has for these centuries old fables.Worth one viewing.",Null,4,5,26 June 2010
Public Enemies," Thieves Like Us
","'Success is dangerous. One begins to copy oneself, and to copy oneself is more dangerous than to copy others. It leads to sterility.' - Picasso Perhaps burnt by the hostility directed toward 2006's 'Miami Vice', director Michael Mann strips 2009's 'Public Enemies' down to its bare essentials. The film initially seems to be another 'Heat', another 'The Assassination of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford', but eventually it becomes apparent that Mann's chief concerns are action and mood; a series of thriller set pieces drenched in rich HD atmosphere. The film's big themes – the worship of celebrity, the romance of mob life, the growing power of the FBI and the uneasy relationship between personal rights and national security – are touched upon only fleetingly, Mann more interested in the sound of gunfire, decor, poses, the cut of his cast's clothes and the colour of skylines.As expected, the film has several great sequences. A midnight gun fight, a botched police raid, a trip to a theatre, two exciting prison escapes and an eerie sequence in which gang leader John Dillinger (played by Johnny Depp) visits an empty police station, all help to keep we the audience engaged. But other than such sequences, the film is strangely thin, and its central romance so derivative as to be intrusive. Elsewhere Mann's signature - characters who possess an existential longing for escape - seems trite, his climax is ruined by poor CGI blood, and his anti-hero's tragic tale is so conventional as to be comical. Still, it's interesting to watch as Mann's style evolves further into a sort of minimalist functionality. Mann's crime films have always adhered to genre clichés, sticking fairly close to conventions. Aesthetically, however, his films have become far more bizarre. He's begun gutting his films of as much back-story, subplots, dialogue, introductions and prehistory as possible. The busy multi-strand epics of 'Heat', 'The Insider' and 'Ali' have also been slowly phased out, jettisoned in favour for something ethereal.His films have always had a unique atmosphere – strong night time photography, extreme focal lengths, cool musical tracks, off-centred compositions, elliptical editing – that's why he's so popular. But in removing comfortable plot beats and embracing a sort of muted minimalism, Mann is pushing toward something far more liquid. He essentially now directs big-budget, art-house movies, the poetics of a Kar Wai Wong or Wim Wenders applied to mainstream action blockbusters.The problem with Mann, however, is that his delicious style is occasionally used in the service of rather ordinary stories. A stupid tale poetically told will always amount to stupid poetry. And as 'Public Enemies' shows, Mann perhaps doesn't know where to go next, applying his new style to material and themes that he and others have fully explored.Consider one scene late in 'Public Enemies'. John Dillinger visits a theatre to watch 'Manhattan Melodrama', a 1930s gangster picture which stars Clark Gable. Like Mann's 'Public Enemies' and 'Heat', 'Manhattan Melodrama' revolves around two strong characters on opposing sides of the law. But whilst 'Melodrama' makes it clear that the actions of its criminals are abhorrent (just punishment was a requirement of the Production Code at the time), Mann's films treat their criminals with melancholic brush-strokes. We're not asked to condemn Johnny Depp in 'Public Enemies' or DeNiro in 'Heat', merely to shake our heads with the sad realisation that 'a life of lawlessness' and a 'life of normalcy' do not mix. In both films it is then the intrusion of the domestic, the regular, the family, the woman, that dooms the criminal, and not crime itself. Both lives are incompatible, and the greed of the gangster is ultimately his greed in wanting to have a piece of both worlds. And aren't all of Mann's films (with the exception of 'The Keep') about the incompatibility of professionalism (be it criminal or otherwise) and family (be it relationships or some moral, social responsibility). In 'Ali', a boxer strives to be the 'best boxer in the world', a desire which clashes with his domestic and personal life. Likewise Pacino and Deniro in 'Heat', Crowe in 'The Insider' and Caan in 'Thief'. What makes 'Manhunter' and 'Miami Vice' his most interesting films is that, in a sense, they represent opposing sides to Mann's thematic concerns. William Petersen in 'Manhunter' achieves some measure of happiness by cutting himself away from his professional job, living out that 'happy life on the beach' that literally every other Michael Mann leading man wishes for (an existential longing that goes back to the very first film noirs). 'Miami Vice', in contrast, finds its characters in a state of total numbness, lost in a world in which human connection seems impossible and in which everyone is a creature of transience and a tool of functional anonymity. So ultimately, what Mann does great is this: he marries the kind of existential masculinity of Melville to the way Antonioni's characters feel eternally uncomfortable in the places they inhabit. Couple that with a desire to copy the aesthetics of the sensualists (Malick, Lynch, Wai Wong etc), and you have one sexy film-maker. The question is where next can he go.7.9/10 – It's hard to take such a familiar tale seriously, especially after directors like Altman so thoroughly autopsied them. Makes a good companion piece to 'Dillinger' (1945), 'Thieves Like Us' and 'The Public Enemy' (1931).",Null,1,3,28 September 2009
The Babadook," Mommy knows best
","'Suppressed grief suffocates. It rages within the breast, and multiplies its strength.' - Ovid Clichés abound in 'The Babadook', a critically acclaimed film by writer-director Jennifer Kent. The plot? After the death of her husband, Amelia (Essie Davis) begins to resent her son Sam (Noah Wiseman). The domestic strains of motherhood, combined with Amelia's repressed grief, have led to Amelia lashing out at her kid. She does not want him in her life, doesn't want the responsibilities he entails and, more importantly, hates the way he reminds her of her dead spouse. As the film progresses, Amelia will actively blame Sam for her husband's death.As Amelia's unconscious and conscious worlds collide, Amelia descends into madness. At first she merely neglects her maternal duties ('If you're hungry, why don't you eat ***t?'), but eventually outright wishes that Sam were dead. Sam instinctively suspects that something threatening lurks in the family home, but cannot fathom that his mother is the source of this evil. Instead, he displaces his fears onto 'the Babadook', a shadowy creature. Amelia insists that this creature does not exist. There are no monsters, she tells her son. I am not a monster.The Babadook is initially introduced as a character from one of Sam's storybooks. 'When you realise what's underneath, you'll wish you were dead,' the book states. It henceforth becomes clear that the the Babadook serves a protective function. It is Amelia's means of externalising pain and so not fully experiencing grief. For Amelia, facing (and eventually becoming) a ghoul is infinitely preferable to confronting the overwhelming tragedy of a husband who died on the cusp of fatherhood. Significantly, Amelia spends the film avoiding conversations about her dead spouse. She adopts a strategy of silence and avoidance. To confront is too traumatic.'Supernatural monsters are expurgations of ourselves,' George Romero once wrote. 'By distinguishing them from us, we hope to destroy them and so exorcise the monsters within.' No surprise then that, phonetically, 'baba dook' means 'father grief' in several languages (Hindia, Arabic etc). Amelia eventually realises this herself; she is the Babadook. She is the beast. And the beast's unconscious desires are always within her.After an extended battle with her son, Amelia metaphorically vomits the ink from which the Babadook storybook was written, and then locks the 'creature' in her home basement. Having taken control of her unconscious inclinations, she periodically visits and feeds the 'beast'. Whether she is dangerously nurturing her hate, or whether she is merely responsibly keeping it at bay and so 'healthily' creating a place for grief to live, is left up to the audience.Obvious, heavy-handed and predictable, everything 'The Babadook' does – aesthetically and thematically - is lifted from somewhere else. The film's mother and child relationship recalls 'Rosemary's Baby' and 'The Exorcist'. Its descent into over-the-top supernatural violence recalls 'Carrie' - another film about the return of the maternally repressed - as well as the wackily repressed characters of other Brian De Palma horror films ('Raising Cain', 'Dressed to Kill'). Elsewhere the film's scratchy, low-tech monsters recall the sputtering monsters of the 'Ring' franchise, the beasts of Tourner's 'Night of the Demon', Lynch's 'Eraserhead' - itself a film about parental fears - and the ghostly shadow monsters of 'Intruders' (2014) and 'Vanishing on 7th Street'. Throw in the 'repression/denial' themes of Kubrick's 'The Shining' and Haneke's 'Hidden', the 'parental anxieties' of horror films like 'Take Shelter' and 'Don't Look Now', as well as references to 'Ghostbusters', 'Night of the Hunter', 'Nosferatu' and Polanski's 'Repulsion', another film about the female unconscious, and you have a film which plays like a flatly shot homage to better movies. Rather than art, 'The Babadook' feels like an amalgamation of trends.The political movements of the late 1950s and 1960s gave rise to horror films in which paternal or patriarchal figureheads were questioned, undermined and unmasked. One of the best of these films was Nicholas Ray's 'Bigger Than Life', in which a father - pushed by the pressures of a class and status obsessed society - descends into madness and attempts to kill his son. George Romero's 'Night of the Living Dead' likewise begins with Daddy and State revealed to be dangerous goof-balls. During this period, virtually all major horror films sought to dethrone Daddy, to question Symbolic Power, from the sexist creeps in 'Rosemarry's Baby' and 'The Stepford Wives', to the anti-authoritarian 'The Crazies'. This trend ended, roughly, with Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining', a film in which 'caretakers', be they literal fathers, or the appointed figureheads of tribes, nations and power-brokers, engage in cycles of violence against those they claim to protect. For Kubrick, spaces are haunted not by monsters, but by the weight of history itself, and Daddy's a genocidal, infanticidal maniac due to a seemingly inescapable feedback loop: Man represses because he repeats and repeats because he represses. During this period, Steven Spielberg was one of the few mainstream auteurs to churn out horror movies which went against these counter-cultural trends. His Daddies were rehabilitated, and portrayed as guardians worth re-embracing.Crazy women were in vogue in late 1980s, early 1990s cinema (hysterectomy and hysteria are derived from the same word, the latter implying that maternity and madness are one and the same). But infanticide by women, or the hating of kids by their mothers, was a bit too politically incorrect for the time period. Nevertheless, Jean Luc-Godard made 'Hail Mary' in 1985, an esoteric masterpiece about maternity being a kind of imposition, or rape, foisted upon women by an uncaring Nature. We then had films like 'AntiChrist' and 'We Need to Talk About Kevin', part of the wave of modern horror films to which 'The Babadook' belongs. In each film, mothers seek the eradication of their inconvenient sons. Only in 'The Babadook' does mommy reconcile with her maternal responsibilities.6/10 – Worth one viewing.",Null,6,11,12 January 2015

The film's a comedic take on Bruce Lee's 'Enter the Dragon', but its jokes are mostly all dated. Even by the standards of similarly trashy 'sports comedies' like 'Dodgeball', 'Blades of Glory' and 'Semi Pro', 'Balls of Fury' is weak. The film stars actress Maggie Q, who is some kind of statistical anomaly: a Vietnamese, Hawaian, Polish, American Irish woman. That's what the Q stands for.

Ted," Teddy's too tame
","Seth MacFarlane, creator of 'Family Guy', directs 'Ted', an unfunny comedy which pairs actor Mark Wahlberg with a foul mouthed, CGI teddy bear. The film's trying to humorously clash its wholesome, Christmas miracle plot with R rated humour, but all of its jokes fall flat. This type of juxtaposition is routinely done better in 'South Park', the 'Family Guy' specials, Kevin Smith's flicks, or films like 'Bad Santa', 'The Big Lebowski' and even junk like 'Harold and Kumar 3'.Our heroes are a couple of weed smoking slackers, but their plot takes a slow ten minutes to get going. When it does, the result is mostly a string of clichés, and none of our duo's antics are as funny or outlandish as even the worst stoner comedies. The film has one good joke in which our heroes discuss whether or not its offensive to invite Jews to a party, the assumption being that specifying that Jews are allowed is itself anti-Semitic. Most of MacFarlane's jokes, however, aren't rude enough, extreme enough, weird enough or smart enough to keep up with the cutting edge of today's humour.Mark Wahlberg's an underrated actor. In 'Ted' he essentially plays the same character he did in 'The Other Guys', a funnier comedy which saw him playing a wounded, doe-eyed and bizarrely earnest guy. Mark makes 'Ted' bearable.Like the 'South Park' crew – Trey Parker and Matt Stone - MacFarlane seems to have difficulties transferring his brand of humour, which is typically more hyper-intensified than live-action comedy, to live-action movies. He tries to make Ted as 'realistic' and 'three dimensional' as everything else in his film, instead of making the film itself as flat as Ted (ie a cartoon). This was the problem Parker and Stone struggled with in their early live-action comedies, most of which were unwatchable, until they ditched actors altogether in favour of cartoonish marionettes and puppets. 4/10 - Worth one viewing.",Null,2,4,21 July 2012
Black Book," Agent provocateur
","'I don't believe that people should spend their time flying on dragons.' – Paul Verhoeven (on Avatar)Here's a bit of trivia. Whilst preparing 'Eyes Wide Shut', Stanley Kubrick had several long telephone calls with Paul Verhoeven, asking for advice on how to shoot nudity. Kubrick considered Verhoeven to be one of the few directors who shot nudity well, and valued Verhoeven's advice.On the flip side, Steven Spielberg convinced George Lucas to let Verhoeven shoot 'Return of the Jedi' based on Verhoeven's film 'Soldier of Orange'. But Spielberg quickly backtracked his decision when he saw 'Turks Fruit' and 'Spleeters', saying that he found all the casual nudity repulsive. 'They probably thought I'd have the Jedi fking!' Verhoeven laughed in an interview.The point is, different people respond to Verhoeven's sensibilities in different ways. You're either in tune with what he does, or cringe at how trashy he can be.In any case, whether you like it or not, three things leap out at you whilst watching 'Black Book'. The first is the acting by Carice van Houten. Capturing a weird mixture of fragility and assertiveness, she essentially plays a Jewish girl who must sleep with Nazis in order to save her countrymen. The second notable thing is the sheer pace of Verhoeven's film. The film isn't taut, so much as it's blunt. Things happen at a feverish pace, as is common in commercial film-making, but they're garish and extreme things, pushed almost to the point of ridiculousnessThe third interesting thing is director Paul Verhoeven himself. 'Black Book' has a sexuality and frankness that Verhoeven seems to revel in. Close ups of genitals, abrupt violence, toilets, feces, nudity and dark humour...it's all very refreshing in todays PG-13 climate.In lesser hands, this vulgarity might seem exploitative, but Verhoeven's 'nastiness' for once feels entirely justified; his frequent outbursts of horror and filth seem to suit what is really a tale of deplorable and base human beings.Like most Verhoeven films, 'Black Book' is also unashamedly melodramatic. Yes, Verhoeven isn't one for subtlety, but here his characters are all morally complex. There's the Jew who falls in love with a Nazi, a Nazi who bargains with Dutch resistance fighters in order to lessen bloodshed, a fiendish plot to rob wealthy Jews, a resistance fighter who fights for himself and not his country, and an ironic twist in which the newly liberated Dutch resort to the kind of barbarism displayed by the very Nazis they despised.8.5/10 - 'Book' works as a romance, spy thriller, action movie, epic, character study and message movie. The film also ends with a brilliant shot which recalls the WTC shot at the end of Spielberg's 'Munich'. It's an elegant shot, filled with a genuine sense of darkness. While Spielberg simply says 'an eye for an eye makes everyone blind', Verhoeven's coda is far more dour. Our hero's troubles aren't over and never will be. The sudden shift from World War 2 Europe to the deserts of the Middle East is also hugely poetic, raising all kinds of political overtones. One only wishes that Verhoeven held this shot a few seconds longer.Worth two viewings.",Null,5,10,26 June 2008

The Great Dictator," The Chaplin six pack
","This is a brief review of Charlie Chaplin's last six feature films.A comical take on Lang's 'Metropolis' (1927), Chaplin's 'Modern Times' opens with the words 'a story of industry and individual enterprise, humanity crusading in the pursuit of happiness!', an ironic jab at the mantras of industrial capitalism. The film then finds Chaplin reprising his iconic role as 'the tamp', a poverty-stricken but lovable outcast whose ill-fitting clothes epitomise, amongst other things, his inability to fit in.The film watches as the tramp struggles to survive in a depressed economy. Like 'Metropolis', it satirises labour, management and dehumanising working conditions. Elsewhere life for the worker is seen to be precarious, alternatives to playing the game are but death or prison, giant clocks speak to the daily grid of blue-collar workers, bosses are shown to be obsessed with speed and production, the property class relies on police brutality and all-encompassing surveillance, and the workplace itself is painted as an absurdest torture chamber. The film ends with the tramp on a road, America's future uncertain.'Modern Times' made waves when it was released. It was banned in fascist Germany and Italy, then allies of the West, and scorned by those in power in the United States. It was also heavily praised in the Soviet Union and France, particularly by philosophers Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir and Maurice Merlau-Pony. The film's middle section, which featured Chaplin waving a red flag and unwittingly leading communists and worker unions, would get Chaplin on several government watch-lists.Chaplin followed 'Times' with 'The Great Dictator'. Hollywood studios wanted the film scuttled, so Chaplin financed it himself. It contains two criss-crossing plots, one about a Jewish barber who is essentially persecuted by Nazis, the other about a brutal dictator, a stand in for Adolf Hitler. Funny, scary and sad, the film would rock the US establishment. Hitler was, at the time, a US ally and good for business. What's more, he was viewed by those in power as a tool to destroy communist Russia. For many, Chaplin was a 'subverisive' who was 'inciting war with an ally'. Deemed particularly offencive was a last act speech in which Chaplin urges the people of the world to 'love one another', 'throw away international barriers' and foster an 'international brotherhood'. Though deliberately vague, this speech was viewed as inflammatory. Was Chaplin extolling the virtues of the United States or the Soviet Union? Regardless, the US' approach to the conflicts in Europe promptly shifted. It became an ally with Russia, Hitler became the enemy and Germany attacked Russia. In the blink of an eye, 'Dictator' went from being sacrilege to prophetic.Chaplin, British, was born into extreme poverty and often found himself sleeping on the streets of London. As such, he identified with his 'tramp' character completely, as did millions word-wide, who saw themselves in the tramp: desolate, poor and forever bumbling down life's highways. Prior to shooting 'Times', Chaplin would embark on a tour of the world, intent on seeing the effects of poverty. He'd talk to many prominent figures, most notably Churchill, George Bernard Shaw, Einstein and Gandhi.As Chaplin grew in consciousness, so would FBI files on Chaplin. He was put under government surveillance and forced to appear before a Senate subcommittee in 1941 where he was accused of being 'anti American' and an 'unofficial communist'. Many newspapers, including the Times, began a campaign attacking Chaplin, and called for his deportation. In the mid 1940s he was charged with the Mann Act and the FBI would collude with newspapers to smear Chaplin as a sex maniac who 'perverted American culture'. From here on, conservative political pressure groups would attack each new Chaplin release. Some of his films would be boycotted or outright banned. In 1947 he'd be brought before the HUAC committee.Chaplin followed 'Dictator' up with 'Monsieur Verdoux'. A black comedy, the idea for which came from Orson Welles, the films stars Chaplin as a bank clerk who loses his job and so murders women for cash and land. The film's point is explicit: if war is an extension of diplomacy, then murder is the logical extension of business. And so banking terminology is used to rationalise murder, weapons manufactures are idolised and the poor are condemned for trying to play by the rules of the wealthy. 'Numbers sanctify!' Chaplain says, pointing to Hiroshima, Nagasaki and the ruthlessness of post-war capitalism; kill millions and you're a hero.Next came 'Limelight', Chaplin's ode to silent film. Elegiac and autobiographical, the film stars Chaplin and the legendary Buster Keaton as two fading comedians. A meditation on time's passing, the film's also relentlessly optimistic; man must assert his will, his desires, no matter how glum the times! The film would be banned from several US theatres. Chaplin himself was swiftly banned from entering the US and several of his assets were seized. He'd live in Switzerland henceforth.'A King In New York' followed. It finds Chaplin playing an usurped 'dictator' who seeks refuge in America. Also autobiographical, the film pokes fun at various aspects of US culture, its irrational hatred of all things left-wing and the way in which humans are both always branding and refuse to look beyond the political, beyond superficial branding, to tolerate even the slightest bit of difference or dissent. Chaplin's son would play a hilarious anarcho-communist, but the film as whole messily mixed silent gags with sound comedy.Chaplin's 'A Countess from Hong Kong' confirms that Chaplin's films were moving from the lower to the upper echelons of society. Here Sophia Loren plays a Russian 'tramp' who is taken in by a wealthy politician (Marlon Brando). His worst feature, the film watches as 'humane' capitalism benevolently absorbs the 'detritus' of Russia and Asia. Chaplin accepted an honorary Oscar in 1972. He received the longest standing ovation in Oscar history.9.5/10 - See the slightly superior 'Duck Soup'.",Null,0,1,13 December 2013
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Skip it, bub
","A couple decades out of date, 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' is a dull superhero flick by director Gain Hood. The film stars Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, an adamantium clawed mutant with remarkable healing abilities.Hugh Jackman is well cast, looks exactly like the Wolverine of Marvel Comics lore (a cross between Clint Eastwood and a werewolf), but the film he's stuck in is wholly generic. The film's action sequences are equally silly, and feel like they belong in a 1990s Steven Seagal flick, slow-motion fireballs and all.Incidentally, Jackman's Wolverine was handled much better by director Bryan Singer in previous 'X-Men' flicks. Singer understood how to use Wolverine: sparingly, his violence hinted at and not pushed past gratuitous lengths. Gavin Hood does the opposite, mistaking excess for excitement. 4/10 – Worth no viewings.",Null,0,2,9 August 2013
The Natural," Generic, overly sentimental ball movie
","Like most baseball flicks, 'The Natural' is a mawkish, overly sentimental sports movie. Typical of the genre, it's filmed with a gauzy, nostalgic tone, spends most of its running time romanticising the game and indulges in a number of hokey, metaphysical subplots which attempt to lend a vaguely spiritual or mythical air to one of America's favourite religions. Thank director Barry Levinson for all this.Thank actor Robert Redford for everything else. Redford, who plays a hotshot ball player in the film, was known for a number of counterculture projects which attempted social critique. This one, 'The Natural', goes out of its way to sketch an America full of schemers, back-stabbers and money grubbing profiteers who destroy lives, families and the 'spirit of the game'. The juxtaposition between the film's two poles thus results in its best quality, a love-hate relationship which Redford's character eventually grows tired of and rejects. The film's final shots echo its first, fathers and sons playing ball with fathers and sons. Almost all of Redford's films during this period had the same philosophical arc: frustration followed by cynical, reflexive impotency and then disconnection; abandon the game or play it on your terms. Levinson has never been particularly strong with visuals. 'The Natural' is filled with clichés, overuses slow motion and is very heavy-handed throughout. In Levinson's defence, such things were new at the time, and in many ways 'the Natural' was a trend-setter which set in stone what we now take to be genre clichés. The film co-stars the always wonderful Richard Farnsworth.6/10 - See 'Bull Durham' and 'Moneyball'.",Null,2,6,21 June 2013
Dead Poets Society," Walt Whitman Weeps
","'Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it's time to pause and reflect.' - Mark Twain The 'teaching genre'. Typically these films deify heroic teachers whose classrooms are havens at odds with the conformity or mediocrity that plagues the rest of the institution. In this regard, these films merely take familiar stories about admirable loners and nonconformists and place them in an educational setting in which the school milieu is fairly incidental.Films like 'Stand and Deliver', 'Dead Poets Society', 'Mr Holland's Opus', 'To Sir, with Love', 'Dangerous Minds', 'Coach Carter', 'Mona Lisa Smile', 'Music of the Heart', 'Blackboard Jungle', 'School of Rock', 'Little Man Tate', 'Dangerous Minds', 'Freedom Writers', 'Pay It Forward' etc etc all follow the same narrative progression, the inspirational white/black teacher moving to a school where he/she is forced to deal with various problems (racial tensions, student apathy, learning difficulties and institutional barriers), all of which he/she solves by delivering inspirational messages in offbeat ways.Very few 'teaching films' deviate from this formula. Some of the best that do are perhaps Frederick Wiseman's 'High School', 'High School 2' and 'State Legislature', Laurent Cantet's 'The Class', Nick Ray's 'Bigger Than Life', Olivier's 'Term of Trial', 2002's 'To Be and To Have', and 'The Prime of Mrs Jean Brodie', with Maggie Smith. For the most part, though, cinema has failed to produce many interesting 'teaching movies'.And so 'Dead Poets' is another mushy 'teacher flick' which advocates 'independence' and 'non conformity' by sticking to a very generic and clichéd movie formula. Here, the maverick teacher is played by Robin Williams, a wacky guy who inspires his band of students to 'seize the day' and 'chase their dreams'.The film was directed by Peter Weir, and so it has a certain classiness which, at first glance, seems to differentiate it from the pack; it's low-key at times, well acted and beautifully shot. It's only during 'Poet's' last half hour that we realise how much we've been conned. And so as Weir's plot draws toward a typical 'I am Spartacus!' ending (you'll know it when you see it), we begin to grasp how goofy the picture really is, the film populated by one dimensional adults, villainous kids, ridiculously stuck-up parents and a plot which reduces the art of poetry to a couple selectively chosen one liners, all designed to illicit 'rebelliousness' and 'non conformity'.So serious is the film in its message, that it even has one kid commit suicide because he is unable to break free of his father's wishes. In other words, conformity literally kills, physically as well as spiritually. This is a worthwhile message, but the film is so conventionally manipulative in its final half, that all power quickly fizzles out.For a film which pretends to profess a love for poetry, you might even call this flick anti-poetry. Early in the film, Robin Williams draws a graph on a blackboard which he says is used to 'measure the worth of a poem'. On one axis of the graph is a poem's 'importance' or 'depth', on the other axis of the graph its 'perfection' or 'technique', the implication being that a work of art which succeeds on both axes, or very highly on one, is discernibly 'better' than others. Williams then erases this graph and orders his pupils to tear it out of their textbooks. You cannot measure the objective worth of art, he says, only what that art means to you personally.Later, one kid who spends hours and hours toiling over his poems, discarding them all because he doesn't think them any good, is put in front of the classroom and told to 'let go' and 'just say what comes into your head'. Suddenly he becomes like all the other students in the film, able to magically and whimsically create great poetry. What the film is advocating is not some kind of objectively great poetry, which artists strive for and toil to create, but misusing poetry as a metaphor for a kind of whimsical freedom of expression; nothing matters other than your own subjective feelings and opinions. Nothing matters, other than you conforming to your desires, embracing your right to free speech and impulsively doing and saying what you want at any particular moment. This isn't poetry, this isn't artistic expression, it's just a kind of self-obsessed, narcissistic, rash impulsiveness.Now look at all the things the students in the film use poetry to achieve. It's all sex, girls, dancing or throwing things away. Very simple, egotistical, hedonistic or impulsive things. Children and people with bipolar disorder have been shown to act with more impulsivity than other people. Artists, of course, are themselves often described as being childish (or possessing a child's imagination) and are more prone to being bipolar. What the film is unconsciously doing is tapping into the whole 'artist as free' and 'art as childish impulsiveness' cliché, without marrying it to anything truly substantial.The limits of this approach are best observed in the film's final scenes. The young artists are given the chance to save their teacher, but instead choose to save themselves. They've never been taught, through poetry or art, to really stand up for anything of value external to themselves. Only later, when their teacher is kicked out of school, do they impulsively stand on their desks and show him support. But of course now it's a wasted gesture.Significantly, the one kid who 'stands up' in defence of his teacher is the one kid who was serious about poetry and seemed sceptical of William's character. His act of 'standing up' is the only true act of rebellion in the film, the artist putting himself on the line, standing up for something worthwhile. Weir completely misses the implications of this. 7.9/10 Generic. Worth one viewing. See 'If' and 'The Magdalene Sisters'.",Null,26,42,17 July 2010
The Hustler," The Church of the Good Hustle
","'The superior man understands what is right; the inferior man understands what will sell.' - Confucius'The Hustler' begins with a cold opening. Here we're introduced to Fast Eddie (Paul Newman), a pool hustler who has just scammed a guy out of some easy money. From the onset we realise that Eddie's world is one of scheming vultures; back room predators all looking to tear the flesh off weakened animals. Director Robert Rossen then launches into a thirty-minute segment in which Fast Eddie wages war with a talented pool player called Minnesota Fats. They lock horns and do battle, after which Eddie eventually emerges defeated. 'You're a loser,' loan shark Bert Gordon (George C. Scott) growls, an insult which sears Eddie to the core. From here on, Eddie is shown living in the transitory noir spaces of bus stations, bars and seedy hotels. He views himself as a loser, beaten and subjugated, and so begins to live as such. Whatever beauty the game of pool once had, has now been lost to Eddie. Whilst once he waxed poetic about the artistry of the game, the possibilities of the table, he now sees the sport as an ugly form of ego-affirmation. Pool has become a game of one-upmanship in which the goal is to castrate and dominate, victorious warriors wielding cue sticks like phallic symbols.As such, the rest of Rossen's film is filled with cripples, limping women and games of dominance and subservience. We watch as Eddie forges a relationship with a Polio victim (Piper Laurie), a limping woman who escapes the world by making up fantastical stories and drugging herself with alcohol. The world sees her as a loser, and so she engages in games of self-destruction.Eddie won't be dragged down with her, though. He's a beautiful player, an artist, but he wants more. 'You've got to have character,' the sharks explain to him, 'the killer instinct!' The real world implications of this are sinister. If a person is talented, one expects them to be a winner. But no. One must also have 'character', where 'character' is a euphemism for a kind of phallic dominance; prosperity at another's expense.The film thus gets to the heart of sports and competition and its relationship with masculinity, hierarchy and capitalism. The drive to win, assert one's 'manhood', and profit are, or can be, corrupting of human relationships and corrupting of whatever aesthetic or spectatorial value sports may have. Eddie learns this at the end of the film, and then gives a speech that has now become a cliché in sporting movies: its not about winning, its about playing the game right. It's about community, self-respect and the artistry of the sport. Whilst Freud once saw 'civilisation' as an repressive force that thwarts base animal urges, transmuting them into psychopathologies, 'The Hustler' (like modern evolutionary psychology) suggests that a larger threat may be the way civilisation thwarts civility and instead champions 'character'. There is a kinder, gentler side of human nature, and it seems increasingly to be a victim of repression. But while Eddie elevates cynicism to philosophy, berating the film's cast for selling their souls, it is ultimately they who school him. Flexing their muscle they ban him from all future pool halls, a threat which Eddie has no choice but to accept. What he learns is that his wisdom provides him with no moral choice but to give up the game altogether. There are no other options. A line can thus be traced from the 'running away' heroes of 1950s-70s cinema ('Cool Hand Luke', 'Rebel Without a Cause', 'Hud', 'They Might be Giants', 'Some Came Running', 'A Thousand Clowns', 'The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner', 'The Devil Probably', 'The Passenger', 'Five Easy Pieces', 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest', 'Goodbye Columbus' etc) all the way up to 'Searching For Bobby Fischer's' young chess prodigy, Joshua Waitzkin. These are all characters who refuse to abide, conform and who question the values ascribed to post war capitalism. Symbols of cinema's disenchanted adolescence, they also all ultimately reject the games being offered.Ultimately, what 'The Hustler's' bleak ending does is steal the beauty away from mankind's phallic strutting. Much human activity revolves around games of domination, even outright sanitised sadism. Sublimated cruelty then becomes a virtue, a Darwinian-Nietzscean struggle for existence; win or lose, cripple or be crippled. The question a film like 'Bobby Fischer', the spiritual successor of 'The Hustler', asks, is how can one play, how can one enjoy the beauty of personal mastery, whilst not compromising the ethical compass.Perhaps it's fitting that behind the scenes of 'The Hustler' we have a similar struggle. A communist, director Robert Rossen had always been preoccupied with the themes found in 'The Hustler'. See, for example, 1947's 'Body and Soul'. In 1953 he was also called before 'The House Committee on Un-American Activities' and blackmailed into 'naming names'. Betrayed and forced to sell his soul to the HUAC (and to film studios), Rossen spent the 1950s making largely forgettable films before hitting us with 'The Hustler' the moment the Hollywood blacklist was cleared. The film was his own form of redemption.Beyond this, 'The Hustler' is interesting for another reason. In 1961, the old studio system was collapsing and production codes were weakening. 'The Hustler' thus posses a rare cocktail: a frankness, a sense of 'adultness', mixed with the restraints of classical film-making. It's at once as gritty as 1970s neorealism, but in possession of a subtlety and classiness which those films often lacked. Powerfully acted across the board - George C. Scott in particular is excellent - the film also boasts exquisite photography by Eugen Schufftan.9/10 – Masterpiece. Martin Scorsese would make a sequel which mostly misses the point of Rossen's film.",Null,2,3,20 May 2010
500 Days of Summer," There's a Chinese family in our bathroom
","'All great architecture is the design of space that contains, cuddles, exalts, or stimulates the persons in that space.' - Philip Johnson Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Tom, a young architect who falls hopelessly in love with Summer, an attractive girl who works at his office. They enter a relationship but she is reluctant to commit to anything serious. She's been burnt by past relationships and no longer believes in commitment, whilst he is a romantic who believes in 'true love', 'destiny' and 'love at first sight'.'500 Days of Summer' has been praised for its 'originality', but its really just a formulaic romantic comedy wrapped up in some simple role reversals. Usually the commitment-phobe is the male, but here it's Summer, who from the very outset warns Tom that she is merely looking for an empty sexual fling.But though the film's humour never rises above sitcom level, '500 Days of Summer' does boast another interesting performance by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Levitt, who has churned out a series of great performances in such low budget independent movies as 'Brick', 'Manic', 'Mysterious Skin' and 'The Lookout', looks set to become a major A-list actor with his recent casting in Chris Nolan's 'Inception'. His introspective acting style, his quiet sexuality, his brooding characters, make him far more attractive than the usual one dimensional Hollywood poster boys.The most interesting thing about the film, though, is the screenwriter's choice to portray Tom as an architect. Writers love to write themselves into their films, and often base their scripts around incidents and emotions that they personally experienced in real life. Scott Neustadter, the writer of '500 Days of Summer', himself admits that this screenplay was based on a real romance he had several years ago. But because writing is a solitary, visually boring occupation, with many negative connotations wrongly attached to it (writer as introvert, drunk, brooding, lonely, hostile, outcast etc), screenwriters often like to place themselves in their stories via the slightly more 'glamomerous' art-form of 'architecture'. They see architecture as a sort of respectable cousin to writing. The use of architecture in this way has a long tradition in film, popping up in everything from crap like 'Indecept Proposal' to 'There's Something About Mary' to more prestigious fare like 'Don't Look Now' and 'The Fountainhead'.What's unique about '500 Days of Summer', though, is that the lead hero is both a writer (he writes greeting cards) and an architect who learns to turn his back on writing (which he associates with lies and ugliness) whilst embracing architecture (which he associates with beauty and truth). The irony is that once he embraces architecture, with all its structural beauty and clean lines, he finally learns to appreciate the truth, beauty and power of words.Anyway, in the real world all artistry has long been eradicated from architecture. In Europe especially, architecture is now a dead art, architects living in a world where every building is subject to government regulations and strict design codes. In the UK, for example, you can't make even the simplest modification to your home (which are all, on average, over sixty years old) if the government deems it to be too outlandish, too 'upseting'. A simple garage or conservatory extension is often denied by the local government, who deems such things to be 'too obtrusive' to the 'style' and 'chacteristics' of other homes in the area. Today architecture is only alive and vibrant in places like the Middle East, where heavy industry is on the rise and space is plentiful. 7.5/10 - This is an above average romantic comedy which, because of its excellent final scene, has managed to leave an overly positive final impression on audiences.Worth one viewing.",Null,1,4,8 October 2009
Cloverfield," You say Gojira, I say Godzilla
","'Memory-keeping is a function increasingly assigned to the electronic media, whilst a new awareness of the artifice of representation casts a cloud of suspicion over the documentation of the past.' – Jose Van Dijck (Mediated Memories in the Digital Age) 'Cloverfield' is the last in a long line of post 9/11 monster movies. Reflecting the anxieties of a populace cowering irrationally in the fear of faceless middle eastern terrorists, these films all feature everyday Americans under attack by giant CGI beasts. With their huge monsters and burning cities, this micro-genre closely resembles a burst of similar films released after the atomic bombings of Japan ('Godzilla' etc) and, to a lesser extent, the nuclear anxieties of early cold war cinema, with their giant radioactive beasts and bugs ('Them!', 'The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms' etc).Of these post 9/11 monster movies, only Spielberg's 'War of the Worlds' and Frank Darabont's 'The Mist' have aged well. Spielberg's film may be dishonest in portraying the enemy as technologically advanced Muslims ('Are they terrorists!' a character yells at one point) embedded in underground sleeper cells and waiting to strike, but its camera work and action set pieces have a balletic grace that few directors can match. And while Darabont's 'The Mist' handles its CGI sequences ineptly, it's beautifully written and features genuine character interactions.Great characters and great action sequences are precisely what 'Cloverfield' lacks. Instead, the film hopes to wow us with documentary realism. Filmed to resemble footage awkwardly captured by consumer video cameras, 'Cloverfield' pretends to be the 'authentic' and 'documented' account of an important historical event (an attack on New York by a giant monster). What's interesting is that, aside from its mediated view (the film is shown solely through one man's perspective), it is also simultaneously re-meditated, the witness filming others who are themselves filming the event (on phones and cameras).This faux documentary style of cinema isn't new. 'Cannibal Holocaust', 'The Last Broadcast', 'The Blair Witch Project', 'X-Cops', 'Open Water', 'Paranormal Activity' and 'The McPherson Tapes' all presented themselves as recovered historical footage, each showing attacks on humans by various monsters (witches, cannibals, werewolves, aliens etc) which the eyewitness was fortunate to record due to his possession of a camcorder. Significantly, the cameraman dies at the end of each of these films.'Cloverfield' continues this trend. At one point in the film the cameraman crosses a dangerous bridge and yells that he 'wants others to see what went on here'. It's a throwaway bit of dialogue, but it highlights how humans are increasingly outsourcing themselves to their technical, extended memories. It does not matter if we survive, what matters now is that the 'camera is kept alive' and that its digitized memory is safely stored. What the characters in 'Cloverfield' are concerned about is not their own memories of the event, but their ethical responsibility to 'capture' and 'digitally remember' the event for future generations.This mirrors real world trends, in which ordinary events are increasingly treated as history before they even occur. Think of the hordes of people walking around recording mundane events with their cell phones, or the thousands of people who visit sporting events, ceremonies and music performances, eyes affixed to their tiny camcorder or phone screens rather than the event itself. On a more graphic scale, think of the Korean student in the US who went on a shooting rampage at a University. In the middle of the slaughter he stopped suddenly to mail a 'press pack' to the media, then promptly resumed his mayhem. The priority for these people is no longer to experience the event itself as it is occurring, but the recording of the event for future consumption.But what people are really doing, with all their technological gizmos, is attempting to prolong the pleasure of the event. They digitise and store their 'special moments' for some kind of future gratification. The end result is that so many moments are collected, stored and saved for later use, that the user either never gets a chance to revisit the event, misses the event as it occurs in the present, or trivialises the 'special event' by putting it in a digital data-bank filled with millions of other similar events. It's a form of modern greed, the user frantically hording digital memories.On a larger level, films like 'Cloverfield' demonstrate that we are in a culture that is formally nostalgic to an astonishing degree. It is precisely the failure of historical awareness that leads to the rise of nostalgia. Those who can't remember the past are condemned to have it resold to them forever. Everything becomes a 're-make', a bland simulation, but one that always seems 'new' because there is neither the memory nor the historical context/awareness of the original.And so the characters of 'Cloverfield' run to their deaths, desperate to save their digital memories for future consumption, historical archival and personal fame. The irony is that what they record has been recorded before, both by cinema and by history.7/10 – Films like 'Cloverfield' and 'War of the Worlds', mark an age where cinema spectacle is dead. They are anti CGI and anti spectacle, downplaying special effects for fleeting glimpses of CGI wizardry and shaky-cam realism. The way out of this trend seems to be 'word cinema', a reliance on word oriented drama and literary twists and turns, and the upcoming hype of 3d, itself a nostalgic technology of the past.Worth one viewing- I'd take the 1954 'Gojira' or even 'Godzilla vs Mothra' over this rip off. For a better modern 'giant monster movie', check out 'The Host', 'The Mist' and 'War of the Worlds'. What's amazing is how identical these new big budget movies are to the old classics. For example, there is nothing separating 'Jurassic Park' from either 'The Beast from 20,000 fathoms' or 'The Valley of Gwangia', aside from the replacement of solid-state models with CGI.",Null,3,4,17 June 2009
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Slaying Dragons
","'Every socialist experiment of any significance in the twentieth century - without exception - has either been crushed, overthrown, invaded, corrupted, perverted, subverted, destabilised, or otherwise had life made impossible for it, by the United States. Not one was permitted to rise or fall on its own merits; not one was left secure enough to drop its guard.' - William Blum ('US military and CIA interventions since World War II')This is a review of Martin Ritt's 'The Spy Who Came in from the Cold' (1965) and Tomas Alfredson's 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' (2011), two films based on espionage novels by John Le Carre. Arguably the finest spy movie ever made, 'Cold' was directed by Martin Ritt. As he was loosely affiliated with various left-wing movements, Ritt was blacklisted in the 1950s. This period saw the US government putting the squeeze on worker movements, unions, civil rights activists and communist groups within the United States, as well as embarking on a (thus far) 100 year campaign to murderously eradicate the same in over 80 countries across the world. Coupled to this is/was a covert war against both independence movements and any and all threats to capitalist profit (everything from Catholic priests to Bittorrent websites). Covert US actions against Indonesia, for example, would see some 3 million killed, and the outright murdering of both the Indonesian communist party and those who supported it. Total deaths incurred over the last century, in similar actions, total more than ten million, with hundreds of millions more dying to the policies, death squads and puppet regimes subsequently erected in these targeted countries. John Stockwell, former CIA station chief, would sum up such actions thus: 'Nothing we were doing in fact defended US national security interests. Genocide is genocide. We are responsible for doing these things, on a massive scale, worldwide.' Martin Ritt is yet another American director who did his best work in the 1960s and 70s. His filmography as a whole can be divided into at least three groups. One group tends to be preoccupied with watching as characters, who represent a very modern ethos of predatory capitalism, come into contact with their opposites ('Hud', 'Brotherhood' and 'Hombre'). Another group focuses on the lives of the marginalised, often African Americans ('Sounder', 'Conrack', 'The Great White Hope' etc). Yet another group tends to deal with movements or organisations being infiltrated and undermined by the literal or figurative foot-soldiers of either communism or capitalism ('Norma Rae', 'Molly Maguires' etc). 'The Spy Who Came In From the Cold' belongs to this third group. Filmed in moody blacks and whites, the film stars Richard Burton as Alec Leamas, a British Intelligence officer who embarks on a relationship with a young communist in order to infiltrate Russian Intelligence. Ironically, and to Leamas' dismay, the film climaxes with Leamas being betrayed by British Intelligence and his young lover being assassinated in order to protect the identity of a British agent. 'Return to your own side,' a loudspeaker warns, our heroes falling prey to violent demarcations which allow for no physical or ideological crossover. For John Le Carre, there is no moral difference between West and East, and little ideological difference between the capitalist Empires and the state capitalism of a supposedly 'communist', post-monarchist Russia. But while Le Carre skewers all idealism and belief, Ritt will not let go of personal idealism. 'Americans fight for ignorance, we for truth and societal growth,' he has characters say, and his Soviet Union is presented less as a bogeyman than as a hangdog family that is perpetually hounded from outside.Aesthetically, 'Cold' represents Ritt at the height of his powers. Antonioni with cloaks and daggers, the film treats us to several wonderful long-takes, and is obsessed with literal and symbolic borders, doubles, barriers and crossings. Elsewhere everyone in British Intelligence has an opposite number within the Soviet Union, East and West playing shadowy games rife with feints and parries, bluffs and double-bluffs. And like all of Ritt's films, 'Cold' is haunted by the possibility of the mole, the double agent, ideology always paranoid and fearful, not only of its own inadequacies, but of contamination.'Cold' (1965) recalls Jean-Pierre Melville's 'Army of Shadows' (1969), but works best as an antidote to the James Bond movies, which opened in 1962. Where Bond is the product of a culture of commodities and swollen egos, 'Cold' does everything it can to portray the West as a shadowy prison-yard of anguish, rage and malaise. This quiet suffering is conveyed well by Burton, whose casting recalls the spiritual and emotional currents of Britain's class conscious New Wave movements, as well as his own role in Antonioni's 'Red Desert' (1964), released one year earlier.'Cold' is slow and demands attention, but ultimately rewards its audience. Less satisfying is Tomas Alfredson's 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy', an interesting film which tries a little too hard to mimic Ritt's aesthetic. Revolving around George Smiley (Gary Oldman), a British Intelligence operative who comes out of retirement in order to find a mole responsible for leaking information to Russia, the film is less a witch-hunt than a depressing procedural in which East and West debase themselves in the name of what one character calls an 'arbitrary aesthetic choice'. 'Don't you think it's time to recognise there is as little worth on your side as there is on mine?' Smiley outright says. Without Ritt to temper such moral equivalences the film then ends on a note of nihilism, but a powerful one nonetheless, secret agents faking embraces and playing games of seduction at midnight dances.7.9/10 - 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy'10/10 – 'The Spy Who Came In From The Cold'",Null,1,2,8 January 2014
We Were Soldiers," My Chemical Romance
","'The more films show violence explicitly, the less they deal with it. And the less they make us understand what its roots are and where it's coming from.' – Wim Wenders'We Were Soldiers' is another war movie which uses advancements in technique and technology to resurrect centuries old war movie narratives.Like most of these films ('Saving Private Ryan', 'Black Hawk Down' etc) the plot revolves around misguided notions of honour, war is reduced to a soldier's duty towards his 'brothers in arms' (if any wider context is offered, these films self-destruct with hypocrisy), violence is glorified (people misguidedly believe that 'graphic violence' can not be 'glorification' - see 'Passion of the Christ'), contemplation is revoked in favour for a string of titillative cum-shot/gun-shot action sequences, hyper-realism becomes mis-conflated with reality, the director is obsessed with attaining false notions of 'realism' and 'authenticity' (the closer the medium gets toward 'reality' the further it gets from 'truth'), soldier's are deified as salvific figures and the story is structured around both the 'no man left behind principle' (the military cares about its deified soldiers - a lie) and a pornographic desire to serve up violent action sequences for the audience's enjoyment (the chemical rush afforded by violence operates in the same space as mammalian orgasms). Nevermind that US involvement in the Vietnam war was essentially one big war crime (the US wanted to stop elections, not 'bring about a free Vietnam' as this film states), no, we have myths to uphold! No surprise then that Mel Gibson's the film's central star; his 'Passion of the Christ' is 'We Were Soldiers' and 'Saving Private Ryan' in Sunday School garb: 'Earn This' fascism for the bullet porn generation.Incidentally, several recent studies show that those convicted of violent crimes have higher levels of testosterone; their testosterone levels resemble that of young males entering or going through puberty. The attraction of war is a juvenile thing, and so its no surprise that films, regardless of genre, which revel in violence tend to appeal to younger or male audiences. But not too young. As computer games and game consoles increasingly take war off the cinema screens and onto the screens of interactive media (kids can now band together online and fight battles by proxy), today's kids are likely to find 'We Were Soldier's' positively archaic.6/10 – Worth one viewing.",Null,1,4,15 September 2010
The Adventures of Tintin," I don't like cocaine, just the way it smells
","Guaranteed to bring you to arousal, if you're sexually attracted to crap, 'The Adventures of Tintin' is an animated adventure by director Steven Spielberg. The film was based on a series of graphic novels by cartoonist Georges Remi.Remi's strip-cartoons revolved around Tintin and Snowy, a young adventurer and his trusty canine. Billed as 'movies on paper', they offered complex (for their time) plots, an impeccable sense of pace and were renowned for their 'ligne claire' style, which utilised uncluttered panels, no hatching and bold, clean imagery. This style would go on to influence everyone from Warhol to Lichtenstein to Chris Ware.In almost every respect, Spielberg's 'Tintin' is the opposite of Remi's. Whereas Remi's aesthetic is minimalist, Spielberg's is one of excess. He opens with an over-long title sequence, for example, and uses a roving, constantly moving camera which simply can't compete with the elegant, locked down compositions of Remi. And where Remi's characters and landscapes were beautifully abstract, Spielberg has opted for a wholly awful aesthetic, with photo-realistic locales and creepy, pseudo-realistic characters. It's uncanny valley hell, especially if you're familiar with the real-life actors upon which Spielberg's heroes and villains are derived.Epitomizing Spielberg's obsession with excess is the motion capture technology used to animate 'Tintin's' characters. Such technology allows computer models to replicate even the minutest of expressions as they occur in real-time on live actors. But every cartoonist knows that less is often more. Remi conveyed more with a simple black dot than Spielberg's army of microprocessors and virtual muscles. Like 'Avatar', Spielberg's 'Tintin' is art for technology fetishists. Those who fall for the latest product roll-outs and believe that technological objects are empowered by dint of their intrinsic properties.'Tintin' takes 24 slow minutes to get to its first action sequence. Here a realistic looking dog in a realistic looking town does cartoonish, unrealistic looking things. It's a tasteless juxtaposition. Compare to Disney's action-pups in 'Bolt'. Compare too to Yuri Norshteyn's many primitively designed, yet wonderfully animated animals.'Tintin' then enters its best segment, our heroes battling villains on an old cargo ship (taken from Remi's 'The Crab with the Golden Claws'). From here we progress to a desert town, where Spielberg attempts to dazzle us with an elaborate long take in which Tintin bumbles from mountaintop to coastline. Like all the exposition and action in the feature, this sequence is dull, and pales in comparison to Zemeckis' many recent, similarly conceived sequences ('Beowulf'). Also included are a battle on a pirate ship and a climactic fight in which dockyard cranes spar. The latter sequence is dull, the former shows us two things we've never seen before: ships firing their cannons at one another through the crests of waves, and ships entangled at their masts, swinging wildly like oceanic pendulums.Old fashioned (they're based on stories almost a century old), 'Tintin's' plot needed severe updating for savvy audiences raised on modern animated films. Likely to appeal to those unfamiliar with animated features, Spielberg's tale is predictable, slow, never surprises, and his audience is always ten steps ahead. Worse still, Tintin's an annoying character (why British and Scottish accents?), soulless in the eyes, built by morticians and devoid of personality. Tom McCarthy, Tintinologist and author of 'Tintin and the Secret of Literature', would accuse Spielberg of not understanding Remi's creation. 'Gauche and anachronistic, Spielberg's adaptation is not just a failure,' he'd say, 'but an assault on a great body of art so thuggishly moronic as to make one genuinely depressed'. 'Tintin' made almost four hundred million world wide. Spielberg spent a little over 2 weeks doing hands-on direction.3/10 – Better recent animated films outside of Pixar, DreamWorks, Disney and Miyazaki: Chomet's 'The Illusionist', Lunak's 'Alois Nebel', Hosoda's 'Summer Wars' and 'The Girl Who Leapt Through Time', Oshii's 'The Sky Crawlers', 'From Up on Poppy Hill', Satoshi Kon's 'Paprika' and Yeon Sang-ho's 'The King of Pigs', arguably the best animated feature of 2011.

Ocean's Twelve," Soderbergh does Mamet
","The 'Ocean's 11' franchise started in 1960 with Lewis Milestone's 'Ocean's 11', a glossy heist thriller which saw a gang of thieves pulling a daring operation in which several Las Vegas casinos are simultaneously robbed. Milestone was a bit of an auteur, known for several fairly good war films, but his 'Ocean's 11' remains an anonymously directed affair. Instead, crooner and mega-star Frank Sinatra seems to be the one pulling all the strings, playing the titular role of heist-master Danny Ocean within the film, and the star and money-man calling the shots outside the film. The production was reportedly wrapped around Sinatra's lengthy stays in Las Vegas, where he performed various concerts at up-scale casinos, hotels and theatres.While Milestone's 'Ocean's 11' made ridiculous amounts of money back in 1960 – everyone wanted to see its big name cast: Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr, Peter Lawford and Angie Dickinson – today it's a hugely dull movie, with large chunks of exposition, unnecessary filler and a heist that's been bettered by countless heist films released both before and after. With notions as to what is and isn't 'cool' constantly changing, 'Ocean's 11' also looks completely neutered, its 'smooth', 'relaxed' and 'cool' cast now positively lifeless. Half a century later, only Sinatra comes off looking well, though precisely because of him the film plays like one of those bad crime movies by modern African American rappers, designed to show off the star's 'riches', 'bling', 'money', 'rule breaking', 'flashy accessories' and 'bad boy criminality' (Sinatra had close ties with the criminal underworld – both the Italian mafia and US government). It's a white bread version of such mega-celebrity egotism. Milestone's best scenes? A colourful Saul Bass opening and a wordless ending shot, much imitated by Tarantino, in which our suited gang of heroes walk down a pavement. Everything between these scenes can be missed.Steven Soderbergh would release a remake of 'Ocean's 11' in 2001. It's a much better film, featuring a cast of photogenic mega stars (Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Matt Damon, Elliot Gould etc), smooth operators, bad boys and likable character actors. 'I owe you for the thing with the guy in the place,' is the line which gets the plot rolling, a slice of dialogue which epitomises the film's comically nonchalant attitude. If Milestone's film strove to be cool, Soderbergh goes for a kind of meta-cool, our cast both too cool for cool and playing uncool with coolness, mega stars Brad Pitt always chomping down on food, Matt Damon bumbling with style and George Clooney perpetually basking in his own silly magnificence. As the heist movie is intrinsically formulaic – first act: assemble the 'samurai', second act: plan the heist, third act: escape or get captured – Soderbergh indulges in a kind of postmodern devil-may-care attitude. Meanwhile, the film's aesthetic is retro cool, with European/French touches, glossy locales, eye popping lights, sparkling surfaces/bulbs, lush cinematography, romantic editing/music, liquidy shapes and a camera that salivates over its suave actors, smooth villains and expensive locales. It's all about the money.Soderbergh describes his 'Ocean's 11' as a 'big wind up toy', and while its designed to be 'just entertainment', it does fit in with a number of the director's 'heavier' films ('King of the Hill', 'Che', 'Traffic', 'Eric Brockovich', 'The Girlfriend Experience'), which have focused on economic inequality, economic depressions, Marxist revolutionaries and violent corporate muscle. Indeed, the casinos where Soderbergh's heists take place, the Bellagio and several other mega-casinos on the LA Strip, were built in the 1990s by entrepreneurs and corporate raiders like Steve Wynn (the real life model of Benedict, the film's villain, played sexily by Andy Garcia) with junk bonds and help from organised crime lords. With its art galleries and upscale restaurants, the Bellagio was then part of a diversification strategy in LA to earn profits from non-gaming sources. Yet the appeal of all these amenities, like gambling itself, is fuelled by a drive to offer consumers escape from a reality of diminished opportunities for upward mobility (within an American economy of diminishing wages, outsourcing and continuous lay-offs). Within a postindustrial, globalized economy, gambling, and even crime, increasingly appears to offer the best way, in the words of Jackson Lears, 'to get ahead in a world where work no longer seems reliable'. Indeed, each of the film's robbers comes with some indication that they embody the disaffection created by the increasing division of American society into 'haves' and 'have nots', whether it be a criminal past, lack of work, or entrapment in a job they find to be unrewarding. Even the bank-roller behind the heist, a former casino owner named Reuben Tishkoff (smoothly played by Elliout Gould), wants revenge against a new economy in which corporate moguls like Benedict can use their financial muscle to push him out. On the flip side, such readings are contradicted by the film's need to work as a big budget wish-fulfilment fantasy, and the fact that the crime genre has always portrayed the criminal as Soderbergh does here: cinema's lovable criminals may live on the outside, but they're still perfect conformists, chasing money in their own way because of capitalism's failings.Soderbergh would release a sequel, 'Oceans 12', some years later. This one takes the form of a 'con movie', its narrative bending giddily in all directions, mercilessly toying with both convention and audience expectations. The film wasn't well received, despite being as good as its predecessor, which led to Soderbergh releasing the dull, and far safer, 'Oceans 13' in 2007. The villain's name is literally 'Bank' (Al Pacino) in this outing, but the film is mostly dumb.8.5/10 – Some overlooked modern heist films: Mamet's 'Heist' and Neil Jordan's 'The Good Thief', a remake of Melville's genre defining 'Bob The Gambler'.",Null,3,5,20 February 2012
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Ethnic cleansing
","Stanley Kubrick directs 'Dr Strangelove.' The plot? General Ripper, a manic US general, orders a nuclear attack on Russia. He believes the 'purity of his essence' has been contaminated by the enemy, the mere existence of whom threatens his gene pool. To maintain the purity of his lineage, Ripper thus initiates 'Attack Plan R', an order which results in the 843rd bomb wing leaving their fail safe points and proceeding into enemy airspace. In response, the Russians reveal that they are in possession of a 'doomsday device'. Throughout the film, Americans and Soviets will attempt to defend and propagate political ideologies that mutually define the other as a danger to purity.Ripper, like most of the film's characters, is sexually dysfunctional. He misinterprets his post coital fatigue (or erectile dysfunctions) as a Communist plot and believes that 'the enemy' is sapping his 'sexual essence'. To reassert both himself and his masculinity, Ripper sees it as his duty to deny or destroy Russia. As he gains power, Ripper munches on phallic cigars and unsheathes huge, eroticised machine guns.Group Captain Lionel Mandrake (Peter Sellers) tries to stop Ripper, but is himself too weak and effeminate to overpower the psychotic general. Mandrake, a nervous flight commander named after a flightless male duck, has a broken leg, frequently stammers and proves not 'masculine' enough to overpower the deranged Ripper. This tension between masculine/feminine/creation/destruction permeates the entire film.Enter Buck Turgidson (George C Scott), a warmonger who seeks to capitalise on Ripper's sneak attack. The ball's already rolling, he says, so let's roll along with it. Buck's name is symbolic of sexual virility (Buck: vibrant male, turgid: swollen).But once again, Sellers plays the effeminate foil to his hyper-masculine counterpart. He's President Merkin Muffley, a bald and small man, unable to commit to combat and constantly seeking to 'work with the enemy'. 'Merkin' and 'muff' are slang terms for pubic wigs and female pubic hair respectively.On the other side of the Atlantic we join Major Kong, a George Bushesque Texan warmonger. His B52 bomber is making a run for a Russian base at La Putta (the whore). Unfortunately, a Russian missile damages the aircraft's radio and they are unable to receive the recall code. Kubrick's films frequently deal with systems, machines and communication networks breaking down. Here, a bizarre and complex series of freak accidents - impurities or oversights in the system - essentially leads to Armageddon.The recall code is itself discovered by Captain Mandrake. An acronym for 'Purity of Essence' and 'Peace on Earth', the code points to both party's fascist mindset: for peace to arise, there can only be one pure lineage. The Other must be eradicated. When Kong reaches his target, he rides a bomb down to ground zero. This activates the 'doomsday device', blanketing the earth in a series of atomic explosion. Like most Kubrick films, the film climaxes with a system failure. The irony here is, not only that base human drives result in intrinsically corrupt and inherently stupid systems, but that it's precisely a series of fail safes and precautions, a neurotic desire for total control, that kill us. Once an irrationality (or rather, super rationality) is introduced via the psychotic Ripper, the system self destructs.Before the film's iconic finale, its cast of world leaders listen as Dr Strangelove, a wheelchair bound ex-Nazi professor, describes the steps 'necessary' to preserve life. With passages equating US presidents to 'fuhrers' and with world leaders discussing fascist policies and eugenics, its clear what power and ideology has ultimately triumphed. The film ends with bombs going off in tandem with the 'newly risen' capacity of Strangelove and his Nazi affiliations.With 'Strangelove' Kubrick recognised the inherent beauty of the mushroom cloud as well as its horror. Spectators often embrace apocalypse, or unconsciously desire some idealised notion of it. But rather than the arms race, it is libidinal drives which Kubrick satirizes. Think Major Kong straddling a 20 megaton thermonuclear bomb as it plummets towards a soviet ICBM site, hollering inane Texan war whoops as he falls. If violence always has a sexual element, and vice versa, this is warfare as a kind of sexual hysteria, Kong whipping his bomb in a masturbatory frenzy, hat in hand, before the screen is engulfed in the brilliant over-exposure of nuclear detonation, the perfect oneness of pleasure, where the intersecting vectors of sex, death and speed collide headfirst in an orgasmic explosion of fission, fcking and fallout. The great black joke of 'Strangelove' is that war stems from the phallus and that nuclear stalemate is a kind of sexual frustration (or strange love) to the technocratically evolved male; there are forever strong, dangerous unconscious drives conspiring to launch the ultimate attack. No surprise then that the film is awash with sexual imagery. Phallic Guns, cigars, swimsuits, playboy centrefolds, dominant young bucks, sexually dysfunctional wheelchair bound degenerates and a narrative book-ended by copulating aircrafts and an atomic ejaculation...the film's entire semiotic language is a consistent ballet of creation (sex) and destruction (war). This is combat out of obedience to the crotch, war as the drive to dominate and possess (there is a 'mating-warring association' deep in the male brain, dominance associated with the phallus; think how phrases like 'f*** you up' and 'get some action' have double meanings), man seemingly raping/pillaging to create space for his dark cycles of creations.The film is also unique in the way it blends genres (comedy/thriller/documentary). Kubrick's camera is initially detached, godlike and methodical, coolly milking the suspense, while the film's second half, with its outrun missiles and nervous faces awaiting annihilation, plays likes a precursor to contemporary 'ticking clock' action movies. Kubrick changes aesthetics styles once again for the film's (now much copied) ground battles, which incorporate urgent documentary-like war footage. The rest of the film swings between comedy/satire, and straight drama. This results in strange and complex juxtapositions.10/10 - Masterpiece.",Null,23,42,26 July 2008
The Bodyguard," The atomic number of zinc is thirty
","'The Bodyguard' is bookended by two very excellent scenes.Everything in between those scenes is primarily interesting in the way it condenses a number of very powerful fantasies. So you have the fantasy of a celebrity falling in love with a regular guy, of the chivalrous knight rescuing the princess, of being the 'strong silent type' who can't help it that ladies (and their kids and sisters) fall for you, and for the ladies, you have a man dedicating his life to defending you, your nest and your kids.The film was directed by Mick Jackson, a television director. His direction is plain, but the film channels well the tone of 1960s/1970s crime movies ('Point Blank', anything by Siegel, Peckinpah, Steve McQueen etc). Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner are our stars, he doing a monosyllabic Steve McQueen routine, she a bit abrasive in front of the camera. Their romance is underwritten.'Bodyguard' movies were all the rage in the late 80s/early 90s, think 'Terminator 2', 'The Specialist', 'In The Line Of Fire' etc. Why is this? Pop culture and pop music have a lifespan of a few months if you're lucky, today's fad swiftly turning into tomorrow's joke. All this film's 'hollywood', 'MTV', 'music' and 'popstar' moments thus now look tacky, changing trends having rendered them silly. Costner's the only artifact who's survived, his character modelled after Kurosawa's 'Yojimbo' and other Samurai flicks. Like McQueen often did, Costner strips his character down to the bare minimum, leaving time with nothing to take away.7.5/10 – 'The Bodyguard' made zillions at the box office, writer Lawrence Kasdan and actor/producer Kevin Costner hitting upon a script that condensed a powerful set of very archetypal fantasies.

MASH," Suicide Ain't Painless
","The 'multi-character anti-narrative mosaic' was invented with 'MASH'. I've coined that ridiculous phrase myself, but how else do you describe what Altman's created here? Let's examine the ingredients. Firstly, Altman constructs a self-contained environment. In 'Gosford Park' it was a country estate, in 'The Company' it was a ballet school, in 'Prairie Home Companion' it was a theatre and in 'Short Cuts' it was nothing less than the city of Los Angeles. In 'MASH' Altman constructs a mobile army field hospital, with functioning roads, helicopter landing pads, tents, barracks, mess halls and a make shift golf course.His environment created, Altman then inserts his cast. But rather than give us a comfortable 3-act story, Altman has his characters interact, seemingly spontaneously, within his giant set. And so within this huge environment little mini narratives play out, the audience having to work hard to pick out the subtle character arcs and personality traits, Altman's camera floating back and forth, catching bits of dialogue and fragments of story. In a sense, it's up to the audience to synthesize the story and turn it into a cohesive 'whole'.This seemingly haphazard way of storytelling is further highlighted by Altman's love for overlapping dialogue, shapeless scripts and his willingness to let his casts improvise. And beyond this you then have the typical self-referential Altman layer, in which the act of preparing, improvising and putting on a performance is mirrored to the act of preparing, improvising and creating Altman's film. (Almost all of Altman's films revolve around large groups of people getting together and putting on a show. In 'MASH' this 'performance within a performance' takes the form of an operating theatre, football game, peep show and radio sex act).But what separates 'MASH' from Altman's other films is how joyously rebellious it all is. Altman has always been a filmmaker with a strong anti-establishment streak (one of his first films, a parody called 'Pot au Feu', was a cooking show which presented the recipe for a cannabis joint), but never has he been this wacky and irreverent. Wounded soldiers are airlifted to the tune of 'Suicide is painless', and the cast seems to go to great lengths to be as sexist, misogynistic, anti-religious (in one neat scene at a table, they strike the pose of Da Vinci's Last Supper), anti-establishment and gory as possible.But it's the juxtaposition between the film's playful sense of anarchy and its gory hospital scenes that is Altman's very point. These are characters so engulfed by the madness of war that their only means of coping is to lose their minds in as controlled a way of possible. You might say that their antics are precisely how they cope with their environment.But just how anti-establishment is 'MASH' and is it right to call it an 'anti war' film? In an essay comparing 'Full Metal Jacket' to 'MASH', philosopher Slavoj Zizek deemed 'MASH' Altman's most conformist film. For all their practical jokes, jabs at authority and sexual escapades, the MASH crew perform their duty with maverick-like efficiency. They are no threat to the smooth running of the military machine.In other words, this very 'detachment', the ability of MASH's cast to adopt a persona of cynicism, practical jokes and mockery - to view themselves as existing outside the system - is itself modern ideology. As to give oneself completely over to ideology, to revoke one's Self in favour of a one dimensional military persona (Hot Lips, Pvt Pyle) is itself a suicidal act, working ideology requires the subject to retain a kernel of individuality, whereby he views himself as being external or opposed to the system he inhabits.While Altman prides himself on being the great deconstructor of genre, Zizek cites 'Full Metal Jacket' as a deconstruction of Altman. Altman's sex acts and attacks on women and religion become the institutionalised acts of Kubrick's Sgt Hartman, religion upheld, femininity denigrated and sex transposed to violence. While Altman has one troop seek and then reject suicide as a cure for his sexual impotency, Kubrick flips this by having a young cadet embrace suicide as the logical outcome of his own sexual over-identification with the military. Altman's cast may get a slap on the wrist for toying with a Christian trooper, but when Pvt Joker denies the Virgin Mary, Kubrick is careful to counter violent punishment with a swift promotion. Significantly, the second part of Kubrick's film ends with a scene in which Joker, a character seemingly plucked straight out of 'MASH', shoots a wounded Vietcong sniper girl. Far from an outsider, Kubrick reveals Joker as the fully constituted military subject. In other words, an ideological identification exerts a true hold on us precisely when we maintain an awareness that we are not fully identical to it. By 'joking', by seeing themselves as 'opposed' to military ideology, the MASH boys are creating a human space that thwarts their own suicidal self destruction. And what is suicide but total identification; the giving of the Self totally to ideology.Kubrick was a big Altman fan, and cast Mathew Modine in 'Full Metal Jacket' based on his performance in Altman's military drama 'Streamers'. But what's interesting is that Kubrick's last war film (its an anti 'anti war film' film) is, on one level, a response to the ineffectual rebellion of something like 'MASH' or 'Catch 22'. For all their antics, Altman's cast are simply school boys making noise in between lessons.Interestingly, while Altman's film ends with an overlong football match, Kubrick filmed but then removed a sequence from 'Full Metal Jacket' in which his marines play football with a sniper's decapitated head.8/10 – Though it's more a carnival show than a comment on war, 'MASH' is still lots of fun. The film's irreverence has lost some of its bite (1st major film to use the F word), but should nevertheless appeal to those with a macabre sense of humour.",Null,5,11,17 March 2009
The Way Back," Walkabout
","Directed by Peter Weir, 'The Way Back' watches as a group of men escape a Soviet Gulag. They then travel south from Siberia to Mongolia to China to India. The film was based on the memoirs of Slawomir Rawicz, a Polish POW.Though it purports to be based on a 'true story', every inch of 'The Way Back' oozes implausibility. The actions, mannerisms, words and survival tactics of Weir's characters ring false, and the film's plot is blatantly a tall tale based on phony memoirs. Whilst it is certainly possible to travel from Siberia to India on foot, Weir's film never convincingly conveys why human beings would risk their lives doing this. Aware of this fact, Weir inserts various heavy-handed subplots about 'freedom' and the 'drive to escape communism', as though Eurasia were so small, so devoid of hiding places, that one must logically scale the Himalayas and trek across China and Mongolia in the name of liberty.'The Way Back' boasts gorgeous location photography and fine performances by Ed Harris, Jim Sturgess and a young Saoirse Ronan. Actor Colin Farrell steals the show as Valka, a murderous Russian inmate with a fondness for Joseph Stalin. Unfortunately Valka - whom Farrell imbues with wonderful textures - exits Weir's picture early. A better film would have perhaps followed him, as everything after his departure reeks of incredulity.6/10 – Worth one viewing. See 'Papillon'.",Null,3,5,29 March 2015
Begin Again," Second Chances
","A cute film by writer-director John Carney, 'Begin Again' stars Keira Knightley as Gretta, a young singer-songwriter who has recently been dumped by her boyfriend. Echoing Gretta's plight is Dan (Mark Ruffalo), a middle-aged record producer who has recently been fired by his production company. Deciding to put their pasts behind them, Dan and Gretta 'begin again'; they work together to produce a new music album.Before it pushes toward a generic climax, 'Begin Again' delivers at least one great sequence. Here an intoxicated Dan watches as Gretta performs a song at a bar's open mic. As Gretta sings, Dan imagines the unattended instruments around her coming to life, layers and layers of sounds being added to her naked vocals. This magical moment marks the start of the couple's romance, but it's a romance which Dan never lets advance beyond the recording room. He's primarily infatuated with Gretta's voice, her love of music, and the future album that gestates within her.Music has long housed and shaped our fantasies. Contemporary music itself largely exists to market sex. In 'Begin Again', like Carney's own 2007 feature, 'Once', music reignites dying passions, and reinvigorates a pair of lost-souls. By the film's climax, Dan has restored his derailed life, Gretta has pushed past heart-ache and the duo have created a hit music album. An attempt to be 'raw', 'truthful' and 'authentic', this album is recorded in 'real world locations', amidst the noisy clatter of pedestrians and traffic.

Megamind," Where'd you park the invisible car?
","'Megamind' stars Will Ferrell as 'Megamind', a super-villain who delights in his daily feuds with local superhero Metro Man. Metro Man is played by Brad Pitt, his character a suave, debonair and hilariously cheesy ode to all things manly. Megamind, meanwhile, is your classic superhero villain, only fifty times cooler and a hundred times more slick. Forget Heath Ledger's overrated Joker. Megamind's where it at. The guy struts about like a cocksure peacock, smoke machines, Black Sabbath, AC/DC and strobe lighting forever heralding his oncoming awesomeness. Megamind understands the showmanship of villainy. The wild, ego-maniacal, unbridled jouissance of it all. The guy's Id unleashed. You can almost smell his cool. He also wears mascara.'Megamind' is also a bit deeper than your typical superhero flick. Here the villain, Megamind, is shown to be a byproduct of both the city which ostracises him and the 'good guys' who bully him. Metro Man is himself a giant egotistical jerk whose craving for power is a result of his own abusive, absent parents. Meanwhile, most of the film charters how crime and law, superhero and super-villain, all function as a kind of self-sustaining feedback loop. Late in the picture another character, a socially and sexually rejected kid who is abused by both our hero and villain, himself becomes a violent super villain. The film is unique in that it positions us to sympathise with villainy and explicitly shows how abuse is oft internalised and then redirected.Mostly, though, the film is simply cool. Megamind moves like an 1980s heavy metal rock-star. He's obsessed with 'presentation', his cape frequently fluttering to some blazing Guns n Roses track. The rest of the film pokes fun at overcooked superhero clichés. Its female love interest, for example, is modelled on DC comics' Lois Lane, and Megamind's dad is a nod to Brando's Kal-El. Elsewhere the film, which is almost always funny, parodies glam rock and comic book tropes. As computer animation allows for a kind of hyper fine-tuning, the film's virtual camera work and virtual action sequences are machine precise.8.5/10 – As Pixar drowns in phony syrup, DreamWorks Animation seems to get better.

Alien," Bring back life form. All other priorities rescinded
","'You don't understand what you're dealing with, do you? Its a perfect organism. Its structural perfection is matched only by its hostility. I admire its purity. A survivor...unclouded by conscience, remorse, or delusions of morality.' - Ash ('Alien') 'What we're dealing with here is a perfect engine, an eating machine. It's really a miracle of evolution. All this machine does is swim and eat and make little sharks, and that's all.' - Dr Hopper ('Jaws') 'Even the most minute of them have an instinct, a perfect talent for industry, social organisation, and savagery that makes man look feeble by comparison!' - Dr Medford ('Them!') 'What we're talking about here is an organism that imitates other life forms and imitates them perfectly. It could have imitated a million life forms on a million planets. Now, it wants Earth!' - Dr Blaire ('The Thing') 'If the sales are good, we'll make another.' - Ridley ScottRidley Scott directs 'Alien'. A haunted house tale, the film watches as the blue-collar crew of the space-freighter Nostromo are systematically killed by a mysterious alien. This alien, slimy and phallic, functions as a kind of roving penis, a reproductive machine which exists only to rape, inseminate and reproduce.Much of the film finds an astronaut called Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) being menaced by both the biomechanical horror of the creature, and the cold inhumanity of a certain, very 1970s corporatism (epitomized in the film by scheming computers, duplicitous robots and traitorous companies). Ripley's softer, feminine instincts are repeatedly conspired against in the 'Alien' franchise. This has led to Scott's film being labelled 'feminist'. It's not. Ripley merely reprises your typical damsel-in-distress role, stripping down to her panties, fleeing secreting penises and choking on phallic Playboy magazines, all for the audience. By the franchise's end, she would become the alien queen; the source of the beasts.As is now well known, the film's sets and creature designs were inspired by both Swiss designer H.R. Giger and 'Heavy Metal' artist Mobius. Their visions, coupled to Ridley Scott's own elaborate storyboards, were responsible for 'Alien's' budget being graciously tripled by the film's producers. The money men saw a hit on their hands. 'Jaws 2' became the highest grossing sequel the year before.The film's tone mixes cinema verite, classy Kubrickian camera work and B movie peek-a-boos. It was one of several films to bring the venereal horror of Giallo splatter cinema into the mainstream. Despite a strong start, though, 'Alien' gets increasingly predictable. The film differs from other slasher movies only in the way it makes overt the sexual undercurrents bed-rocking the violence of its siblings. Dripping with post-coital atmosphere, Scott's set pieces are staged as literal rapes and overt intergalactic sex sessions, making explicit the unconscious of other slasher movies, with their maulings, penetrations and blood orgasms. And as with most slasher movies, Scott's characters exist only to be killed. They behave stupidly throughout and are thinly sketched.Though the 1960s and 70s were seen as cinema's liberative, post-studio era, the period's permissiveness had the opposite effect and quickly spawned an increasingly rigid film industry. One sees this most clearly with the 'horror classics' of the 1970s, most of which were redecorated B movies of the past, only now with A-list budgets, newfandangled gore and modern special effects. These films pandered to the audience's basest instincts, pandered to the audience's most self aggrandising understanding of itself, but they raked in big cash and offered the possibility of incessant sequels, so all was fine; the model works, so it procreates. Today virtually all Hollywood movies are B movies, retro, or exploitation films glossed up in glitz. And as their goal is to tap into increasingly harder highs, and as anything over a pg12 rating is now viewed as being too niche (or 'demographically conservative' in producer speak), one eventually ends up with schizophrenic horror movies like Ridley Scott's own 'Prometheus', which simultaneously tries to recapture the shocks of the past (Caesarean sections/abortions replacing 'chest births') whilst also being bloodless and sanitised. You know. For kids, gore hounds and nostalgic old timers all at once.Most of the 'classics' of 1970s horror 'updated' or 'dressed up' their predecessors. Spielberg's 'Jaws', for example, borrows the score and various scenes/shots from 'Creature From The Black Lagoon', whilst Cameron's 'Aliens' climaxes with the ending to 'Them!'. Ridley Scott's predecessors are Ford's 'The Lost Patrol', Hawks' 'The Thing', and horror schlock like 'Fiend Without a Face', and 'It! The Terror from Beyond Space'. The film's narrative structure, which tricks you into thinking its a tale about men, before turning a female astronaut into its central hero, recalls 'Psycho' and Hooper's 'Chainsaw Massacre'.Old B movies, though, are Scott's chief inspiration, particularly Mario Bava's underrated 'Planet of the Vampires', which also features a space crew responding to a distress signal, landing on an alien planet, exploring a derelict ship, finding giant alien skeletons and coming under attack from monsters. Scott's horse-shoe alien ship is also Bava's, as are his smoky, rocky planet surfaces, shots of helmets next to flight chairs, alien climates, alien interiors and flame thrower guns. Scott's big set piece, in which his crew stumble across the giant skeleton of an ancient alien, even recalls an identical scene in Bava's flick. Elsewhere Scott's face hugging critters recall the creatures of 'Fiend Without a Face', and his last act, with air ducts, ventilation shaft encounters and a climax in which the alien is blown out an airlock, recalls 'It! The Terror from Beyond Space', another film in which astronauts respond to distress signals and explore alien derelicts. Scott would deny the influence of 'Planet of the Vampires' for many years, but seems to have finally admitted it with 'Prometheus'. In addition to other similarities, Prometheus' crew are unmistakeably wearing the skintight suits of Bava's own astronauts.8/10 – Worth multiple viewings.",Null,3,6,3 December 2012
Blades of Glory," You're my pretty lady
","'Blades of Glory' is a formulaic but funny comedy starring Will Ferrell and Jon Heder as a pair of male ice skaters. The plot's 'Dodgeball' meets 'Cool Runnings' meets 'Semi Pro' meets 'every Will Ferrell' movie, but Ferrell manages to elevate things somewhat. He plays Chazz Michael Michaels, a crotch-grabbing, man-chest exposing 'ice devouring sex tornado'. Jon Heder, who took straight faced ridiculousness to remarkable heights in 'Napoleon Dynamite', matches Ferrell's brand of dead-pan goofiness blow for blow.There are several epochs of irony, one of which American comedy seems to currently be wallowing in (Ferrell is a caricature of a dopey American, blissfully unaware of how ridiculous he is to the rest of the world). First you had Socratic irony, which was really a form of rhetorical dialogue. From this – saying the opposite of what's true to underline the truth - you'd trace a line from Chaucer, to More, Sidney and Milton, arriving finally at Swift and Austen. Then you had Romantic irony, which was a sort of philosophical tool. German philosopher Karl Schlegel believed that it bestowed a 'multiplicity of perspectives' from which the 'truth could then be unlocked'. Then you had a sort of post WW1 irony which was used as a tool of dissent to highlight the disjunction between, say, patriotic rhetoric and the reality of war. This led to a widespread use of irony as a means of puncturing deceitful propaganda. Up until this point irony always had some moral objective; it offered an overview, serving to cut through accepted wisdom and expose fraudulence. It might say 'This belief is wrong', but it doesn't say 'All belief is wrong'. But then came the era of postmodernity, which trades in postmodern irony. Here, everything is exclusively self-referential, there is always an implication that art is used up (and so justifiably recyclable), and irony is used to undermine all sincerity, all possibility of truth, all emotion, all moral certainty, as well as to kill off the possibility of a meaningful moral position. Irony, then, is indistinguishable from cynicism. It now assert its right to have no position whatsoever. It now says 'nothing at all'. As Paul de Man pointed out, 'this does not make it into an authentic language, for to know inauthenticity is not the same as being authentic.' Meanwhile, every comedy coming out of the US wears a badge of goofy irony, satire even, without actually being about anything. These scripts go far beyond making no effort to laughing about their lack of effort. Of course holding Ferrell responsible for a lack of radical comedy is silly, especially when you consider that his 'The Other Guys' is pretty much the only watchable mainstream satire about the recent global financial crisis.7.9/10 – Worth one viewing.

This is simple, shock value comedy, the film salivating over bizarre combinations of swear words, gross out humour and giggling over the spectacle of seeing classy, respectable, A-list actors (Kevin Spacey, Colin Farrell, Jaime Foxx, Jennifer Aniston, Donald Sutherland) dirtying themselves up for giggles.

Nacho Libre," Chancho, when you are a man, sometimes you wear stretchy pants in your room
","'Your only job is to cook! Do you not realise I have had diarrhoea since Easters?!' - Senor Ramon Thus far, all of Jared Hess' films have been about likable weirdo losers who become likable weirdo heroes with a little help from their likable weirdo friends. 'Nacho Libre', which finds actor Jack Black playing a Mexican monk/cook who enters the world of wrestling to make money for a local orphanage, continues this trend.The film was heavily criticised upon release, but Jared Hess makes cult films which tend to appeal to a select few and tend to get funnier and funnier with multiple re-watches (the 'Lebowski Effect'). They're designed for the kind of viewer who likes weird intonations, bizarre nuances, freakish characters and lines like 'Those eggs were a lie, Esqueleto. A LIE! They give me no eagle powers! They give me no nutrieeeeents!' spoken absolutely dead-pan in ridiculous accents by odd cartoon characters. You know who you are.Much of the film's humour plays like a weird riff on Catholicism, with wrestlers being viewed as false idols and wrestling being deemed innately sacrilegious ('Wrestling is ungodly Ignacio. People cheer for him because he is a false idol!', 'It is in the Bible not to wrestle your neighbour!', 'I don't believe in God, I believe in Science!').Some have viewed the film as being anti-Catholic, but Hess is a devout believer and paints religion, and indeed most of his cast, with a warm glow. The film co-stars the sublime Ana de la Reguera as a fetishized nun. Our hero wants her to praise his heroism by break her vows of celibacy, but she's oblivious to his yearnings and instead gives him a hilarious thumbs up. The film, surprisingly, doesn't exploit Jack Black's singing gifts. He's given one funny song - he hums 'Piel Canela' with a mariachi band - but most of his other songs are truncated or interrupted.8.5/10 - See 'Eagle vs Shark'.

The Best Years of Our Lives," Happy Days
","Regarded by William Wyler fans as one of the director's best films, 'The Best Years of Our Lives' is a fine but somewhat over-long melodrama which charters the lives of three American military servicemen who struggle with post-war civilian readjustment. The film pre-dates 'The Men', a similar film by Fred Zinnemann and starring Marlon Brando, by almost four years. Our trio of veterans are Fred Derry, Homer Parrish and Al Stephenson, all of whom return from WW2 to their homes in Boone City, Ohio. The men belong to different military branches (Airforce, Army, Navy) and different social strata. Their early scenes are powerful. Wyler watches as the trio, who've never met one another before, share a military transport plane back home. Their journey takes them over an airfield packed with hundreds of disused aircraft, the machines discarded and dilapidated, echoing their own bodies. Later they fly over cities, towns and the American corn-belt; normalcy looks so far away from up here. The trio struggle to readjust to civilian life. Derry's wife no longer loves him and he resents his new job. Homer has it even worse. He's lost both hands in the war and now uses a pair of augmented hooks. Ashamed of these hooks, much of the film watches as Homer's family and sweetheart struggle to accept his disfigurement. Interestingly, Homer's played by Harold Russell, a real life veteran who really did lose his hands in the war. The film somewhat exploits him, too proud of Harold's hooks, his mutilated body, even as Wyler warmly bring us close to the kid. But a little goes a long way. While early scenes with Homer are powerful, by the 90 minute mark Wyler has lingered salaciously on these hooks far too long, treating them more as a special effect, novelty icon or freak show attraction. The film's last subplot involves Al Stephenson. He's given a job at a bank but is reprimanded because of his over eagerness to grant loans to retuning soldiers. But rather than fire him, Stephenson's boss compassionately schools the veteran; he teaches Stephenson how to properly function in the workplace.All three veterans are thus presented as outsiders (early shots show them sitting in B-17 observation bubbles, taxi cabs or dark corners, always cut off from others) who eventually learn that others are willing to accept them. The trio's perception that they are 'no good' (Derry), that their masculinity has been shattered (Homer), that they are too old or out of touch (Stephenson), is thus shown to be 'all in their head'. Veterans, in other words, are accepted by all, it's up to them to accept themselves. The film was praised in the 40s and later by a whole new generation of critics in the 60s and 70s, for 'deglamourising war' and pointing out how servicemen are effectively 'used, mauled and discarded by the state.' Overall, however, it's a very comforting film. Wyler's tone is one of piety, state, military and family units are all shown to be reassuring and willing to lend helping hands, America combs over its scars and moves on, family and work life go on uninterrupted and all problems are solved with relative ease. Wyler goes into some dark terrain – he came back from the war a wounded man and was determined to get this film right – but mostly reassures; roll up your sleeves and get back to business.The film sports some superb black-and-white cinematography by Gregg Toland. Its structure is also interesting – first act: men as outsiders observing the inside, second act: women as outsiders shut off from and watching men, third act: men and woman sharing the same conciliatory space – and works well whenever Wyler's not laying on thick domestic melodrama. The film ends powerfully at an aircraft scrapyard.8/10 – Worth one viewing. See the similarly ironically titled 'The Lucky Ones' and 'Paths of Glory'.",Null,2,5,5 November 2012
The Town," Very fun, but formulaic
","Ben Affleck directs 'The Town', an entertaining crime picture in which a band of thieves rob banks, fall in love with women who endanger their lives, are tracked down by police detectives, engage in 'one risky last job', get caught, take part in a bloody police shootout and die. In other words, the film is wholly derivative of Michael Mann's 'Heat' - itself a film which deliberately stockpiled clichés - and to a lesser extent Kathryn Bigelow's 'Point Break'.The film may be nothing but a clothesline of clichés, but like his earlier crime picture, 'Gone Baby Gone', Affleck's style is low key, gritty and actor-centric enough to differentiate it from most mainstream, action fare. You know what's coming, but 'The Town's' faux verisimilitude and faux naturalism keeps things somewhat fresh, even if Affleck's view of tough types and working class Boston is merely cookie-cutter underclass romance.The film is so shamelessly generic that it seems to tap into not only recent 'heist' and 'gang movies', but old, black-and-white Warner classics (eg 'White Heat', 'Public Enemy' etc; notice the similarity to Mann's titles), in which we salivate over daring hoodlums and their blaze of glory fade outs. For this reason, the film's pleasures are mostly archetypal.8/10 – 'The Town' is part of Affleck's calculated 're-imaging process' ('Hollywoodland', 'Gone Baby Gone' etc), the actor, after a decade of being a Hollywood laughing stock, desperate to reinvent himself as a 'serious artist'.

Closer," Warning: Love in Progress
","Mike Nichols directs 'Closer', arguably his best film since 'Silkwood' and 'Carnal Knowledge'. Like many of Nichols' early works, the film is based on a stage-play, in this case a 1997 Patrick Marber play of the same name.Like 'Carnal Knowledge', the film revolves around two couples who repeatedly cheat on one another, attempt to scar one another and struggle to define their own criss-crossing relationships. In this regard, two characters, one a photographer and one a writer, attempt to keep other human beings at a comfortable distance, via either camera lenses, computers or pens. Another character prefers the anonymity of false identities (false names, accessories, fake stripper personas etc) and foreign countries. Each of these characters views love as a blank slate or attractive absence upon which they can project their own illusions and/or desires. Once the object of desire gets too close the attraction wears off. They are counterpointed to another character, played by Clive Owen, who is brutally honest (and hilariously vulgar) when it comes to his personal perversions, lusts and genuine affections. Owen's a doctor, a pragmatist, enamoured by a brutal corporeality, and seems initially to be the only character who seems capable of a healthy relationship. With time, though, we see that love for all four characters is largely an exercise in power, damage infliction and a game of rampant hormones. 'Without truth we're just animals,' one character says, but truth is precisely what wrecks all the film's relationships. The film's title thus has a triple, somewhat paradoxical meaning, love strongest when we AREN'T CLOSE to the object of desire, impossible UNLESS one gets truly close, and often SABOTAGED by the discomfort of proximity.While Marber's characters are as dysfunctional and hyper-sexualised as our own Western societies, they all seem to have their own very specific, individual faults. The two women, played by Natalie Portman and Julia Roberts, seem unable to love themselves, and so survive by creating idealised bodies to be 'loved through', one creating photographs as a bulwark, the other turning her own body into protective art. When these shields are broken and their lovers get closer, they both deliberately sabotage their relationships. Much of the film contains characters vying for the complete possession of their lover, attempting to dig deeper and deeper in an attempt to gain some secret knowledge or deeply intimate space which may or may not exist; 'closeness' here is likened to a kind of possession. And of course when this raw, uncompromising level is reached, the lovers recoil in shock; closeness seems traumatic.Like most stage-play adaptations, 'Closer' largely consists of talking heads, long conversations and simple camera set ups. Nichols is an old-hand at this, so he makes it work. The film is gripping, tense and flows well, but there is something overly sensational about its plot, Marber deliberately constructing his story as a tawdry car-wreck, audiences invited to peer, sleazily, at festering, mutilated corpses. Sadly, much of 'adult theatre' has become this way, and an increasing number of play-writes turned directors - think early-Mamet and Neil LaBute – who once relied on a certain kind of high-brow sensationalism to sell tickets to dulled audiences, are starting to bring these same caustic plots over to film. It's not that play-writes aren't right to expose certain aspects of human nature, but that often these stories seem sneering or designed to shock.Still, there's lots of good stuff here. The film's screenplay is interesting in the way it omits the parts of its plot that more formulaic films would have dwelt on, its cast is mostly good (the stilted dialogue may irk those unfamiliar with stage plays) and Nichols' direction is mostly fine, aside from a poor opening and closing. The film is predominantly vulgar and hopeless.Incidentally, actors Natalie Portman and Jude Law played similar characters in Wong Kar-Wai's 'My Blueberry Nights', a film somewhat similar to Nichols' 'Closer'. Portman's performances in both film were poor; she can't convey 'sexiness'. In both films the film-makers also strain heavily to make their young, female characters quirky and likable (lots of hair dye and hipster hats). See Antonioni's 'Beyond the Clouds' for this material done about as good as it can be done.8/10 - Worth one viewing.

Shutter Island," Blip Time: Part 6
","'Scorsese is old-fashioned and is making the same films that DW Griffiths was making early last century.' – Peter Greenaway (For Part 5 of this quest, see my review of Cronenberg's 'Camera') The schizophrenic experience is an experience of isolated, discontinuous and disconnected material, signifiers failing to link up into a coherent sequence. Like the 'heroes' of Cronenberg's later films, the schizophrenic does not know personal identity (identity depends on the persistence of an 'I' or 'me'), is unable to create concrete models of self and world, and is incapable of experiencing continuity through time.These symptoms are themselves associated with our postmodern era, a schizoid age which philosopher Gilles Deleuze calls 'the control society', in which fragmentation extends like a blanket across every aspect of our lives, from the sciences, to modern psychoanalysis, to our economic models, to technology, to culture/familial/social relations, to art and communication and further outwards and inwards in all possible directions. The last paradigm here is genetic engineering and nano-medicine, fields which are slow moving.Eventually this schizophrenic confusion scrambles or destroys the possibility of critical perspectives altogether, such as those found in modernist traditions. This is a direct contrast to the modernists who founded cinema, guys like Eisenstein, Pudovkin, Murnau, Renoir, all of whom were loosely allied with an ethic of social realism, and who attempted to capture the vital elements of social reality on screen. Such realism was depicted, for example, in the epic struggles of the Russian Revolution and classic depictions of poverty, exploitation, and upheaval within society. Over time, both modernism and realism followed the path of photographic representation, visible in a plethora of documentaries, docudramas, historical dramas, and other forays into cinema verite.Eventually, the modernising ethic spawned by Enlightenment rationality and 20th-century industrialism intersected with such wildly divergent influences as Capra, Huston, Visconti and DeSica. When modernism died in the 70s, postmodernism began absorbing the trendiness of Existentialism and reacting to the failure of Positivism's reductionism, and the collapse of socialism's New Left. It re-introduced content, but only ironic content, rejecting any form of realism and becoming anti-realist.So, in a very general sense, we move from the modernism of the 30s-60s (Eisenstein, Pudovkin, Renoir etc), to the last burst of rebellion in the 60s and 70s (new-modernists like Antonioni, Kubrick, Kurosawa etc who both upheld and critiqued Enlightenment principles), to an age of defeat, giving rise to the increasingly nihilistic, nostalgic and fantastical postmodern era from the late 70s onwards (Scorsese, Leone, Tarantino, Spielberg, Lucas etc). Or, using this century long period as a brain model, we have birth, a burst of hope, increasing disillusionment, impotency, a flight to fantasy and a mental collapse which gives way to pieces of rubble; the schizoid experience. The task now is to sort the rubble, re-organise and rebuild.This, of course, is what the character of Spider tries to do in David Cronenberg's 'Spider' ('Spider' is the same film as 'Shutter Island', 'wife' replaced with 'mother'). Cronenberg calls this his 'internet movie', Spider slowly web-browsing through the debris of history so he can determine whether his father 'traded his mother in for a new one'. Except, the old mother is the new mother, both are prostitutes, and Spider's nostalgia, his need to recreate a happy family that didn't exist, is ultimately what corrupts or skews his own little internet search engine. Cronenberg's typical mind/body splits are thus reversed from this point onwards. The subject's 'computer memory' isn't reconstructing the past, but actively and constantly destroying memories specifically so it can create new ones which satiate its short term desires.Enter 'The Departed' and 'Shutter Island', two of Scorsese's most schizophrenic films, which operate solely by cannibalising the past and serving it back up as a kind of postmodern, schizoid blip-time carnival. 'I don't want to be a product of my environment,' Jack Nicholson says at the start of 'The Departed', announcing the film's disregard for any larger, real world universe. 'The environment', in this case, is but a collective data-bank of past images, memory traces which Scorsese rearranges and spits back out as mediated drug rush. If 'Goodfellas' was every gangster cliché jazzed up for modern audiences (the very theme of 'Goodfellas' is the falsity of itself as a film) 'The Departed' is 'Goodfellas' jazzed up, a mash-up of a mash-up, an amalgamation of an amalgamation, blended smoothly together to appeal to testosterone-laden males who get high off the head-shot gratification. In our post 'The Wire' world (if 'The Wire' hopes the map the world, 'The Departed' turns away and serves up static), such things come off as pointless.Far more interesting is 'Shutter Island', if only because it shows how far Scorsese has drifted from the neorealist ethic. In this case, the plot is a standard issue Scooby Doo tale in which a police detective investigates a crime at an insane asylum. Throw in countless 'homages' to Hitchcock, Kubrick's 'Shining', Lang and a plot that rips off everything from 'The Cabinet of Dr Caligari' (it's the same film as both the 1920 and 1962 version), 'Repulsion', 'Spider', 'Next Door', 'Shock Corridor', 'Perfect Blue', 'Fight Club', 'A Tale of Two Sisters', 'Lilith' 'Detour', 'After Dark My Sweet', 'Le Orme', 'Memento', 'Inland Empire', 'The Sixth Sense', 'The Others', along with the Holocaust flashback-inserts of Lumet's 'Pawnbroker' (Scorsese reduces the Holocaust to confetti), and you have one ridiculously evil movie, arguably Scorsese's worst since 'Cape Fear'. Of course it's also his most profitable film to date.The Departed – 7.5/10 Shuttler Island - 4/10 Compare Cronenberg's undercover movie, 'Eastern Promises' (watch it again, it's gorgeous), with Scorsese's undercover movie, 'The Departed'. Then compare his schizoid movie, 'Spider', to 'Shutter Island'. Cronenberg examines the very condition Scorsese now wallows in.(For Part 7 of this essay, see my review of 'Demonlover')",Null,7,14,14 July 2010
Capote," The Journalist and the Murderer
","Truman Capote wrote 'In Cold Blood' in 1966, a novel which detailed the 1959 murders of Herbert Clutter, a Kansas farmer, and his wife and two kids. Capote would travel to Kansas in an effort to learn everything about the crime. Accompanying him was Harper Lee (author of 'To Kill a Mockingbird'), who assisted Capote with interviews and note-taking. The Clutter's killers were arrested some six weeks after the murders. Capote's book was published six years after he arrived in Kansas. Many regard 'In Cold Blood' as having popularised the 'faction' or 'true crime' novel, which typically mixes fictional elements with traditional investigative reporting (Gonzo journalism would be borne shortly afterwards).Capote's book was largely an exercise in whetting the reader's appetite, page after page dwelling on portentous scenery and the imminence of murder. What elevated the novel, though, was Capote's sympathy for Dick Hickock and Perry Smith, the two men responsible for the Clutter murders. As a homosexual and outsider, Capote found himself drawn to these two men, and became particularly infatuated with Perry, who was half-white, half-Cherokee, his dark skin and ancestry as much of a social stigma as Capote's homosexuality and fey, oddball mannerisms. Indeed, both Capote and Perry's families were riddled with suicides, and it was not lost on Capote that had he not been embraced by New York's literati he too may have, like Perry, tumbled into some abyss. What 'In Cold Blood' thus unconsciously suggested is that the unsettled outsider exists precisely because the Clutters are 'settled', comfortably embedded in rural America. The novel doesn't absolve the murderers, but nevertheless always implies that Perry and Dick are perpetually homeless, tormented, excluded and perhaps even driven to criminality because the Clutters have a home; are a long-embraced part of white America. 'Capote', a 2003 film by director Bennett Miller, doesn't delve into these aspects of the novel. 'You are a kind and generous man,' Capote, played by actor Philip Seymour Hoffman, says sarcastically at one point to a Kansas sheriff who 'graciously' offers to categorise Perry as being 'officially white', but for the most part such social/racial avenues are left unexplored.Still, the film has other things on its mind. Though based on a book by Gerald Clarke, screenwriter Dan Futterman did much of his own research and was heavily influenced by a 1989 New Yorker article by Janet Malcolm (along with her subsequent book, 'The Journalist and the Murderer'). Malcolm's thesis was that journalists inevitably betray the subjects they saddle up to; they suck up to the subject, flatter it, get close, exploit it for news, then cut all ties. Malcolm, who was interested in the ethical and psychological consequences of 'journalist' and 'subject' relationships, specifically focused on author Joe McGinniss's relationship with Jeffrey MacDonald, an Army doctor convicted of murdering his family in the 1970s. McGinniss, like Capote, would befriend 'his' convict and write a book ('Fatal Vision') based on the murder he investigated. And like Capote, Mcginniss would lead 'his' convict on, acting like he believed MacDonald was an innocent victim and acting like his prose would help MacDonald's case in and out of court.So much of Miller's film revolves around Capote's guilt at having befriended killers in order to facilitate a book which benefits not the killers but Capote's own reputation (the film's title now has a double meaning: Capote's cold blooded treatment of Perry). Capote, the film argues, usd these criminals, manipulated them, led them on and then gave them the sudden cold shoulder, a betrayal which Miller argues led to Capote being consumed by guilt. 'I did all I could to help you,' a self-pitying Capote tells Perry at one point. But we know it's a lie. Because of his emotionally and morally exhaustive experience, Miller would have us believe, a shameful Capote never wrote another book. A postscript tells us he died an alcoholic, of a drug overdose.Miller and Futterman over-estimate 'In Cold Blood's' effect on Capote, but assuming they're right, this is still a very thin film. Social relations in America are downplayed, Capote and Perry's similarities aren't substantially delved into, and the ethical questions raised by Capote's 'journalism' (he appropriates suffering at best, lies and manipulates at worst) aren't really fleshed out. The film doesn't go far enough. Still, in its own low-key way, 'Capote' is preferable to the sentimental, preachy 1967 version of 'In Cold Blood', and Miller's misty landscapes, haunting chords and greyish blue, near monochromatic palette captures well the brooding, southern Gothic tone of Capote's novel.Interestingly, Miller's narrative structure loosely echoes that of Capote's novel, which waits and waits for Perry's own description of the grisly murders, until scenes of awesomely vicious, shocking violence hit us hard in the face. The rest of the film is comprised of gloomy shadows, forlorn faces and long shots of rural Kansas, all evocative of Capote and Perry's shared loneliness. For a better, somewhat similar film, see 'Flesh and Bone'.Beyond all this, Philip Seymour Hoffman gives a convincing performance as Capote (this really was how Capote spoke and behaved). The film's ancillary characters are mostly cardboard, particularly Harper Lee, played by Catherine Keener. Like 'In Cold Blood' and 'Gone With The Wind', Lee's 'Mockingbird' is another cherished American novel that's become a 'classic' for all the wrong reasons. Though touted as a book about 'racism', Lee's stance was mostly one of 'gradualism', the author believing that the South should be allowed to sacrifice justice, and that it was capable of progress if left to slowly evolve on its own. Hoffman would pick up a Best Actor Academy Award for his portrayal of Capote.7.9/10 – Very good and at times haunting.

Ocean's Thirteen," Weakest in the trilogy
","The 'Ocean's 11' franchise started in 1960 with Lewis Milestone's 'Ocean's 11', a glossy heist thriller which saw a gang of thieves pulling a daring operation in which several Las Vegas casinos are simultaneously robbed. Milestone was a bit of an auteur, known for several fairly good war films, but his 'Ocean's 11' remains an anonymously directed affair. Instead, crooner and mega-star Frank Sinatra seems to be the one pulling all the strings, playing the titular role of heist-master Danny Ocean within the film, and the star and money-man calling the shots outside the film. The production was reportedly wrapped around Sinatra's lengthy stays in Las Vegas, where he performed various concerts at up-scale casinos, hotels and theatres.While Milestone's 'Ocean's 11' made ridiculous amounts of money back in 1960 – everyone wanted to see its big name cast: Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr, Peter Lawford and Angie Dickinson – today it's a hugely dull movie, with large chunks of exposition, unnecessary filler and a heist that's been bettered by countless heist films released both before and after. With notions as to what is and isn't 'cool' constantly changing, 'Ocean's 11' also looks completely neutered, its 'smooth', 'relaxed' and 'cool' cast now positively lifeless. Half a century later, only Sinatra comes off looking well, though precisely because of him the film plays like one of those bad crime movies by modern African American rappers, designed to show off the star's 'riches', 'bling', 'money', 'rule breaking', 'flashy accessories' and 'bad boy criminality' (Sinatra had close ties with the criminal underworld – both the Italian mafia and US government). It's a white bread version of such mega-celebrity egotism. Milestone's best scenes? A colourful Saul Bass opening and a wordless ending shot, much imitated by Tarantino, in which our suited gang of heroes walk down a pavement. Everything between these scenes can be missed.Steven Soderbergh would release a remake of 'Ocean's 11' in 2001. It's a much better film, featuring a cast of photogenic mega stars (Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Matt Damon, Elliot Gould etc), smooth operators, bad boys and likable character actors. 'I owe you for the thing with the guy in the place,' is the line which gets the plot rolling, a slice of dialogue which epitomises the film's comically nonchalant attitude. If Milestone's film strove to be cool, Soderbergh goes for a kind of meta-cool, our cast both too cool for cool and playing uncool with coolness, mega stars Brad Pitt always chomping down on food, Matt Damon bumbling with style and George Clooney perpetually basking in his own silly magnificence. As the heist movie is intrinsically formulaic – first act: assemble the 'samurai', second act: plan the heist, third act: escape or get captured – Soderbergh indulges in a kind of postmodern devil-may-care attitude. Meanwhile, the film's aesthetic is retro cool, with European/French touches, glossy locales, eye popping lights, sparkling surfaces/bulbs, lush cinematography, romantic editing/music, liquidy shapes and a camera that salivates over its suave actors, smooth villains and expensive locales. It's all about the money.Soderbergh describes his 'Ocean's 11' as a 'big wind up toy', and while its designed to be 'just entertainment', it does fit in with a number of the director's 'heavier' films ('King of the Hill', 'Che', 'Traffic', 'Eric Brockovich', 'The Girlfriend Experience'), which have focused on economic inequality, economic depressions, Marxist revolutionaries and violent corporate muscle. Indeed, the casinos where Soderbergh's heists take place, the Bellagio and several other mega-casinos on the LA Strip, were built in the 1990s by entrepreneurs and corporate raiders like Steve Wynn (the real life model of Benedict, the film's villain, played sexily by Andy Garcia) with junk bonds and help from organised crime lords. With its art galleries and upscale restaurants, the Bellagio was then part of a diversification strategy in LA to earn profits from non-gaming sources. Yet the appeal of all these amenities, like gambling itself, is fuelled by a drive to offer consumers escape from a reality of diminished opportunities for upward mobility (within an American economy of diminishing wages, outsourcing and continuous lay-offs). Within a postindustrial, globalized economy, gambling, and even crime, increasingly appears to offer the best way, in the words of Jackson Lears, 'to get ahead in a world where work no longer seems reliable'. Indeed, each of the film's robbers comes with some indication that they embody the disaffection created by the increasing division of American society into 'haves' and 'have nots', whether it be a criminal past, lack of work, or entrapment in a job they find to be unrewarding. Even the bank-roller behind the heist, a former casino owner named Reuben Tishkoff (smoothly played by Elliout Gould), wants revenge against a new economy in which corporate moguls like Benedict can use their financial muscle to push him out. On the flip side, such readings are contradicted by the film's need to work as a big budget wish-fulfilment fantasy, and the fact that the crime genre has always portrayed the criminal as Soderbergh does here: cinema's lovable criminals may live on the outside, but they're still perfect conformists, chasing money in their own way because of capitalism's failings.Soderbergh would release a sequel, 'Oceans 12', some years later. This one takes the form of a 'con movie', its narrative bending giddily in all directions, mercilessly toying with both convention and audience expectations. The film wasn't well received, despite being as good as its predecessor, which led to Soderbergh releasing the dull, and far safer, 'Oceans 13' in 2007. The villain's name is literally 'Bank' (Al Pacino) in this outing, but the film is mostly dumb.7.5/10 – Some overlooked modern heist films: Mamet's 'Heist' and Neil Jordan's 'The Good Thief', a remake of Melville's genre defining 'Bob The Gambler'.",Null,0,0,20 February 2012
Lost in Translation," Stylish mood piece, perhaps romanticises alienation
","'If love is blind, why is lingerie so popular?' - UnknownSophia Coppola directs 'Lost In Translation'. The plot? Two alienated characters - a sultry American young woman and a suave but elderly Hollywood movie star - have a platonic affair whilst in a Tokyo grand hotel. Both are romantically involved with vapid parters, her a celebrity photographer, him a wife back home in America, and so begin to feel increasingly estranged from their spouses.Themes of isolation, globalisation, alienation and existential ennui are brought up, but Coppola never develops them into anything substantial. Yes, jet-lag is the quintessential postmodern condition, fragmentation and dislocation perhaps mankind's future state of mind, but Coppola keeps things on the level of poetry, unable to link cause and effect to anything particularly revelatory. Indeed, by now it becomes apparent that all of Coppola's films are autobiographical tales which repeat the same story: the tale of a privileged white girl - a princess in a castle very much like young Sophia was once herself - who is surrounded and sick of affluence and who is rescued from alienation by overt or covert sex with a daddy figure. Like much of Woody Allen's filmography, sex is offered as an existential cure. Which is fine; human connection, sexual or otherwise, is electric, but too often this reduces what are social, political and economic problems to a kind of navel gazing and narcissism.The film is well acted by a sexualised Scarlett Johansson and a charmingly forlorn Bill Murray, who essentially plays her sugar daddy. The film offers nice ambiance, sparkling cityscapes, the romantic glow of fluorescent lights and a dreamy soundtrack, but Coppola prettifies and romanticises that which should suffocate. As a comparison, see Olivier Assayas' 'Summer Hours', and his duology of 'Demonlover' and 'Boarding Gate', two trashy B movies which cover similar ground. Some others: 'Red Desert', 'What Time Is It There?', Claire Denis' '35 Shots of Rum', Jia Zhangke's '24 City', 'Still Life' and 'Platform', 'The Girlfriend Experience', 'Syndromes and a Century', 'Pulse', 'L'Enfant', 'Code46', 'The Class', Wim Wenders' 'Land of Plenty' and the various existential musings of Antonioni, Bergman and Nicholas Ray ('Bigger Than Life', 'In A Lonely Place' etc). These films aren't necessarily better, but attempt to deal with the various causes which instigate the very melancholic mood that Coppola serves up.One further odd detail is Coppola's need to tell this tale against the backdrop of Japan. There is a perception that existential angst is a uniquely 'white problem' and 'upper class' problem, individuals of colour, because they are perceived as a 'collective' rather than 'individuals', always immune to such suffering. It would take an essay to chart the linkages between political, psychological and social fragmentation (and so alienation) - the Inclosure Acts hundreds of years ago, capitalism's commodification of time, urban drift in the Industrial Age, Jameson's 'waning of affect', the death of master narratives etc etc – but the point is, these isolating forces affect minorities just as much, if not more, than they affect whites.Films always portray the angst of middle and upper class white people in a heroic, portentous, important light. Characters of privilege are shown to suffer an existential ennui that is harsher to the trivial, material struggles of people of colour, of Mexican immigrants, foreigners, migrants and that little Chinese guy you buy noodles from on a Friday. In reality, depression is hugely under-diagnosed among racial minorities and US born Asian American women are more likely to attempt suicide than Americans. The stereotype that racial minorities are always happy with their circumstances, because they are ostensibly simple people ruled only by primitive compulsions, is untrue.Perhaps a more relevant film would not have required a foreign country to bring out themes of alienation (see 'The Hotel' in which an American Asian kid feels alienated in America), let alone focused on privileged white characters. There's a kind of navel-gazing in this film, a kind of self-absorption, which is ironic, considering that the film's two lead characters are alienated precisely because they believe everyone around them to be self absorbed navel gazers.Because the film is packed with Asian clowns, jokes in which Japanese confuse L's and R's and moments ('Let them be who they are!' one character says) which mock the Japanese for the way they appropriate western culture and render it camp, the film has been deemed racist by some. Make up your own mind. But this is all less a problem than Coppola's unwillingness to delve deeper into the causes of her character's ennui.8/10 – Gorgeously shot, but this Antonioni's insufferable brand of ennui romanticised and made cosy, flirtatious and sentimental.

Tangled," Poor plot, but a return to form for Disney
","'The one thing that the public dislike is novelty. Any attempt to extend the subject-matter of art is extremely distasteful to the public; and yet the vitality and progress of art depends largely upon the continual extension of subject-matter. The public dislike novelty because they are afraid of it. It represents to them a mode of Individualism, an assertion on the part of the artist that he selects his own subject, and treats it as he chooses.' - Oscar Wilde 'Believe in the character. Animate with sincerity.' - Glen Keane As Pixar becomes evil, Dreamworks and Disney's animated features seem to get better. 'Tangled', based on the German fairy tale 'Rapunzel', is perhaps the studio's best animated film since 'Bolt', though both are still far too manic, the products of a popular culture that has been reduced to an Eternal Now, where noisy, shallow entertainments constantly give way to replacements that are only superficially distinguishable from their predecessors. Disney, and all of modern culture, works hard to create an audience that values artificial newness and not much more.This kind of creepy replication is at the heart of 'Tangled', a film which sees a cute princess, Rapunzel, kept in a constant limbo so that an evil witch may be rejuvenated over and over and over again. Rapunzel and her handsome prince's willingness to stick to formula, to remain frozen in character, is what enriches the witch, her body growing like some kind of bulbous, perpetually expanding Disney bank account. It's only when Rapunzel and her man break away from their roles – she transforms from hermit to princess, he from bandit to prince (itself formula) – that the cycle is destroyed.The plot's mostly junk, but aesthetically this is an exquisite, gorgeous looking film. The man responsible for this is master animator Glen Keane, who has little to no prior experience with computer animation. The result is that 'Tangled' uses no motion capturing and has a visual style that hearkens back to Disney classics of yesteryear. Disliking the 'sharp', 'straight' look of computer animation, Keane issued a mandate for soft, round edges, organic looking movements, and warm hand drawings whose lines and colours resemble that of traditional oil paintings on canvas. Beyond this, the film treat us to richly rendered forests, super expressive characters, an eye-popping colour palette, whispery light effects, and sexy greens, pinks, blues and whites. The film's character animations are themselves very good, particular an odd horse that behaves like a bloodhound, moves like a laser beam and seems designed to mimic the upper body of a chess piece. The human characters are a delight too; visually it's a good film.'Tangled' was the first Disney fairy-tale since 'Beauty and the Beast', which was released way back in 1991. Since those straight faced, earlier Disney films, Disney has slipped into the grip of post-modernity. It's princes and princesses now know that they're 'princes' and 'princesses ', constantly indulging in sarcastic, ironic, pop-culture referencing winks. Thankfully 'Tangled' does go too overboard with this, and when it does the gags and jokes mostly work well, as do some of its parody's of modern Broadway tunes. And as with most computer animated films, the virtual camera work here is super fine-tuned, everything ultra choreographed, which lends both the film's action sequences and exposition a special visual kick. All this comes at a cost: 260 million dollars for this baby, roughly three times higher than your average Pixar budget.This being Disney, the film is overtly sexual, with phallic towers, sexually manipulative women, fertile valleys, wide eyed couples and strong, sexual currents. And as with most modern Disney films, which get increasingly self-referential ('Bolt' was itself rife with films within films), there's an unintentional meta-plot going on, our animators' love aligned to Rapunzel's love of 2d drawing, of art, which escapes its prison and bursts into a 3d fantasy world of criss crossing spatial axes. Incidentally, Disney's previous 'princess film' was 'The Princess and the Frog', an offencive little Obama-era film about a 'black princess'. In comparison, 'Tangled' is hyper white. Like brushing your teeth with bleach while the KKK eats mayonnaise on your lawn. Only whiter.8/10 – Worth two viewings.",Null,2,5,15 March 2012

Barry Lyndon," A man at war with the cosmos
","Kubrick's 'Barry Lyndon' project was initially a project about Napoleon Bonaparte. Simply titled 'Napoleon', the film aimed to portray the life of a lowly man who had seemingly conquered his environment. Like an obsessive film director (guess who), Napoleon tamed his surroundings, forcing the cosmos to bow to his own singular vision.Kubrick envisioned this film as being awash with intricate plans, strategies, military formations, and animated schematics. His Napoleon was a man who took control and waged war, not against the Spanish, Russians or Italians, but against an indeterministic, malevolent universe. But of course, like Johnny Clay in 'The Killing', Napoleon does eventually fail. He suffers a series of military defeats which leads to him realising that, even without his obsessive micromanagement, all his battles would have achieved the same results. Variables far beyond his reach governed the final outcome.The Napoleon project failed to materialise for various financial reasons. Always the pragmatist, however, Kubrick then decided to make the complete thematic opposite of Napoleon.And so we have 'Barry Lyndon'. Unlike Napoleon, Barry doesn't scheme or try to force things into position. A man at the mercy of (or oblivious to) the cosmos, he does as told, taking fortunes and misfortunes as they occur.While Kubrick's 'form as content' approach dictated that Napoleon be awash with intricate plans. . .plans in which a mere man seemingly thwarts nature (a largely Gnostic nature that is evil, malevolent and hostile), Barry Lyndon's 'form as content' approach dictates that Kubrick's universe completely subvert Barry the man.And so we have a cosmic tragedy in which the very form of the film attempts to reduce man to nothingness. Kubrick's painterly canvas locks his actors into predetermined compositions, such that they appear to have no free-will, unable to break free. He portrays the universe (director) as the ultimate artist, its beautiful brush-strokes concealing its suffocating ugliness, life itself portrayed as being the artistic result of the universe's unmappable web of rules and formulae.Similarly, each event in the film is portrayed as being the direct result of some prior occurrence. The first scene highlights this continuous past/present relationship. Watch too how the clouds, trees and walls in the first shot 'frame' Barry' father; man is a spec on the horizon, playing his ritualised games as the cosmic order engulfs him. Likewise, the character's are all bound by duty and rigid social roles. Their lives are ritualised, robotic, learnt and rehearsed. While 'Dr Strangelove' and '2001' are swathed in birth and sex imagery, here Kubrick uses a semiotic fabric of chance. Every scene is awash with games of chance, duels, courtship, cards, gambling, luck etc, all of which bolster the notion of fate on Barry's life.Even the narrator subverts Barry's story. While the acting and visual compositions attempt to relegate Barry to the background, the narrator attempts to undermine his tale by negating all drama and tension. Why are you watching this man, he says? He is nobody. ('Though this encounter is not recorded in any history books, it was memorable enough for those who took part') Of course, visually, the film is unsurpassed. But this is a film in which beauty and cosmetics seduce us away from innate malevolence. This is a Schopenhaueren world in which finiteness is at war with the infiniteness of Time and Space. A world in which the present is constantly Becoming without Being, man a desire machine continually wishing without being satisfied, his efforts always thwarted, victory rarely won. Time, and the transitoriness of all things, are merely the form under which the will to live, has revealed to Time the futility of its efforts. In this world, no man is happy, always living in expectation of better things, always striving or demanding 'satisfaction'. A world in which man accepts the present as something that is only temporary and regards it only as a means to accomplish his aims. Beauty, sensuality, aesthetics, splendour and riches, are thus futile attempts to escape the inherent misery. Disillusion behind illusion.Thus, Kubrick places emphasis on the landscape and background to such an extent that his visual style subverts the character's on screen drama. Typical cinematic language is therefore REVERSED, such that we have a BACKGROUND which is constantly fighting to drown out Barry's FOREGROUND story. Expanding the metaphor further and we have a universe which gradually dwarfs and suffocates Barry's life.Kubrick's constant use of long zoom ins and zooms outs further highlights this theme. Here is man, ZOOM OUT. . .and here is man put in context. The irony is that whenever Barry attempts to assert himself over this natural law, he's punished terribly.The most severe punishment occurs during the duel at the end of the film. After a misfire, fate rolls in Barry's favour, giving him the opportunity to shoot his opponent down. But no. Refusing yet again to be a pawn, Barry altruistically chooses to exhibits free will at its most pure. He sacrifices himself. And of course he's punished dearly for this. Frozen in time, he's robbed of his leg, immobilised, pinned in place by history, no longer able to prowl his pretty canvas.And so the entire film is about the inevitability of loss. Barry loses his father in the first shot, his first love (cousin) in the next. He loses his home, his family, his surrogate father (the general), his second surrogate father (chevalier), his son, his wealth and finally his leg. With the loss of his leg, he is then literally frozen as 'art'. As historical image. Significantly, the only object in the film able to outpace Kubrick's zoom out is a coffin, which moves inexorably toward the moving camera. As death is constant, all history is about loss.20/10 - Doomed to never be fully appreciated.",Null,45,54,18 July 2007
The Grapes of Wrath," Land of Plenty
","John Steinbeck published 'The Grapes of Wrath' in 1939. A well-regarded work of early 20th century social realism, the novel watches as migrant farmers struggle to survive the Great Depression. Droughts, landowners, banks, business cartels, technological changes and strikebreakers weight down upon our heroes, but they stand tall. The novel ends with Tom Joad, one farmer's saintly son, vowing to defend the oppressed and the downtrodden. As Tom embarks upon his quest, ominous flood waters threaten to drown his family and, by extension, his social class.Steinbeck's novel contains a famous sequence in which a farmer's home is demolished by a tractor hired by a bank. The angry farmer attempts to shoot the tractor's driver, but the driver insists that he is 'only following orders'. When the farmer counters that he will shoot the person who gave the orders, the driver replies that this too would be useless, as this individual is simply another bank employee. 'Well, where's the president of the bank?' the farmer growls. The driver states that there is no president, only a board of directors who themselves receive their orders from the 'East'. 'Where does it stop?' the farmer cries. 'Who can we shoot? I don't aim to starve to death before I can kill the man that's starving me!' The reply: 'Maybe there's nobody to shoot. Maybe the thing isn't men at all. Maybe it's a bad thing made by men, and by God that's something we can change!'Steinbeck's point was clear. There is no individual who is ultimately responsible for the economic forces which are harming people. Rather, all individuals are complicit in, and beholden to, a system they are themselves a product of. Such a stance would get Steinbeck labelled 'anti-American', 'a liar', 'communist' and 'a Jew acting for Zionist-Marxist interests'. His book was burned in the streets, attacked in Congress and banned from schools and libraries. The fact that his first wife was a communist, and that he publicly picked fights with FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, notoriously anti-union and anti-worker, only made things worse. Over the next few decades Steinbeck would be hounded by the state, and everything he wrote would wind up in a FBI document. It would later be revealed that he was put under government surveillance as early as 1935. Fearing attempts on his life, Steinbeck would buy himself a gun for self-defence.John Ford directed 'The Grapes of Wrath' in 1940. The film is regarded as a classic, was showered with awards, but Ford ultimately disliked the picture. The film's leftist slant rubbed against Ford's political conservatism, and the meddling hands of producer Darryl Zanuck oft irked the director. Zanuck is himself responsible for the film's hokey ending, which was installed without Ford's consent.Ford's grievances aside, 'Wrath' remains one the director's finest pictures. Like Steinbeck's novel, it watches as a family of Oklahoman farmers are torn from their land. Seeking employment, and respite from drought and sandstorms, they venture toward the state of California, the new Promised Land. Unfortunately their journey points only to broken promises and shattered dreams, an entire nation's notions of 'manifest destiny' mocked along the way.Ford has a number of exceptionally photographed pictures ('My Darling Clementine' and 'Drums Along the Mohawk' especially). Aesthetically, 'Grapes of Wrath' is every bit their equal. Poised between myth and social realism, the film boasts fine cinematography by Greg Toland, which is abstract in places, expressive, poetic, even ghostly. Unfortunately, like most realist and neo-realist works, which sanctify the poor, the film's photographic depiction of poverty is highly sentimentalised: a continuation of very specific type of Victorian-era aestheticization.Like most John Ford films, 'Wrath' features endless waggon trails, armies of travellers 'heading west', bands of folksy old-timers, expansive vistas and puts a wonderful emphasis on 'community'. Unlike most Ford films, however, 'Wrath' re-contextualises Ford's usual tropes and embeds them within a plot which counters the conservatism (and stands against the class-bias and implicit racism) of some of his more popular films. Ford would continue this trend with his next picture, 'Tobacco Road'.'In the souls of the people, the grapes of wrath are filling and growing heavy,' Steinbeck would write. The line, ominous, hinted not only at violent revolt, but the ushering in of a better society. This call for socialist solidarity is erased in Ford's film, which engages in subtle forms of depoliticization and which for the most part avoids Steinbeck's critiques of state, private property etc in favour for populist boss-bashing. Leading the charge is actor Henry Fonda, who plays Tom Joad. Like his role in Ford's 'Lincoln' some years earlier, Tom's part folk hero, part Jesus Christ, a homespun redresser of social wrongs.Ford and Zanuck dilute Steinbeck's novels in other ways. 'The old methods of intimidation and starvation perfected against the foreign peons are now being used against the white workers,' Steinbeck would write, the author aware of America's long history of exploitation. Indeed, the refugees from the dust bowl accounted for only six percent of the southwestern migrants to California. Most were Mexican and Filipino workers, but this doesn't fit Ford's view of quintessentially white, rugged, American pioneers. The film is also wary of pointing fingers at the state (the land retirement policies of the US government – like the notorious Agricultural Adjustment Act, which was designed to artificially inflate the cost of crops – were instrumental in displacing farmers and landowners) and ignores the confluence of forces (The Depression, the collapse of the tenant system, the rise of mega-agribusinesses, mechanised farming etc) which were pushing people into poverty. Expecting such nuance from one of the most mainstream directors and producers of the era is silly, but it nevertheless partially explains why Ford and Zanuck received comparatively little resistance when assembling their film.8.9/10 – Masterpiece.

Pacific Rim," He ain't heavy, he's my Jaeger
","'Everything is equal. We have no borders between robots and people. In the foreign stories, robots are always the enemies. In Japan, they're our friends.' - Osamu Kozaki Japan's obsession with robots stretches back to the 1950s, when robot mangas like 'Astro Boy' and 'Tetsujin-28' became popular. Inspired by the US fire-bombings of Japan, and influenced by everything from Frankenstein, to 17th century karakuri puppets, to Sengoku-era samurai armour, to WW2-era hardware, to the Shinto belief that 'everything has a soul', these robots would spawn countless animated television series, most notably 'Giant Robo', 'Voltron', 'Gundam Suit', 'Robotech', 'Evangelion' and 'Mazinga Z', the latter of which was very popular in Mexico during the 1980s.Mexico during the 1980s also happened to be where a young Guillermo del Toro lived. He devoured these robot cartoons, a childhood feast which would inspire his own Giant Robot Feature, 'Pacific Rim'.Released in 2013, 'Pacific Rim' stars Charlie Hunnan as Raleigh Becket, a hotshot Jaeger pilot. Giant nuclear powered robots, Jaeger's are humanity's last line of defence against the Kaijus, colossal beasts who attack Earth via portals deep within the Pacific Ocean. As the neural load of Jaeger's is too dangerous for a lone pilot to handle, each Jaeger is piloted by two psychically linked pilots, a concept dubbed 'drifting'.Tonally, 'Pacific Rim' is unlike most modern blockbusters. Directed by every boy's inner child, Guillermo's film knows its a ridiculous cartoon but nevertheless adopts a sincere, straight-faced stance. Elsewhere the film's carnage is undercut by 'Rim's' warmhearted subplots, in which feuding pilots learn to work together, put differences aside and 'drift in the same direction'. That this direction amounts to collaborative warfare is something Guillermo, an outspoken pacifist, can't avoid, but he nevertheless strips his film of all the war-porn tropes which usually bog down similar films.'Pacific Rim' was a box-office dud in the United States, a country which likes its anime re-packaged a certain way ('The Matrix', 'Edge of Tomorrow', 'Inception', 'Black Swan' etc). Guillermo del Toro mostly doesn't abide by these cosmetic conventions, his film light but never flippant, unpretentious, devoid of unnecessary subplots/dialogue masquerading as 'depth', and free of all the usual totems of Americana. Perhaps because of this, the film was a massive hit in Japan and China.Aesthetically, 'Rim's' also a bit unique. Guillermo's Godzilla-battles take place amidst giant waves, his behemoths covered in sea-spray, knee-deep in roiling rain-spattered oceans, their chassis lit by kaleidoscopic purples, blues and pinks. The film's creature designs and fisticuffs are also better than average for this genre, complete with elbow rockets, plasma cannons and gigantic brass knuckles. The film co-stars Idris Elba. Its butt-kicking electro-metal score, by Ramin Djawadi, signals Guillermo's premise with capital letters: HERE THERE BE GIANT ROBOTS PUNCHING GIANT ALIENS IN THE FACE.8/10 – See 'The Host' (2006).",Null,3,4,17 March 2015
Empire of the Sun," 'Empire of the Sun' and 'Saving Private Ryan'
","William Goldman got it right when he called 'Saving Private Ryan' a detestable piece of crap for people who enjoy balloons. It belongs with 'Schindler's List' in the realms of children's film-making, which Spielberg tackled better with the Indiana Jones films, but which here is marketed inexplicably as 'adult film-making', thereby denigrating that term and infantilizing further the adult genre.Watching 'Ryan' is an entirely passive experience in which we feel compelled to admire the artistry with which an entirely trite and simplistic, but also flattering and complacency inducing, 'message' is instilled in the audience. There's something altogether sinister about propagating the idea that tyranny/evil is an alien and foreign characteristic.All Spielberg's 'serious films' are stuck firmly in the past. He takes a historical event which we readily recognise - some event with motifs, symbols, easily recognisable moments, images and values - and then spits it all back out at us. 'Ryan' is Spielberg's 'ultimate WW2 history lesson', summing up American's most basic understanding of WW2: WW2 was a noble war, Uncle Sam cares about his troops, General Marshall takes personal interest in every fallen soldier, the enemy are faceless, skinhead Aryan barbarians, American is good, Hitler is evil, the SS intended to enslave the world, America won the war, remember this, be good, patriotic and earn it.But it's all a myth. WW2 was not a Good War nor was it fought on altruistic grounds. It was a war based on staggering hypocrisies and waged for old fashion Imperialist reasons. All wars need to be sold and WW2 was one of the most carefully plotted lies in history. But Spielberg reduces it to false myths; a series of recognisable signs and second hand iconography. Flags. Heroes. Death. Honor. Shut up and love your country. Like Gibson's 'Passion of Christ', this is a supremely evil film which asks us to exalt dead Christ soldiers for dying so that we may be free. Both films offer orgies of cruelty and suffering, bogus mythologies regenerated with techno-wizardry and masochistic point-of-view shots which serve, not to disgust us, but to celebrate the necessity of gore. This is sadomasochism as public-consumption spectacle, succumbing thoroughly to the Cult of the Military/Church. The Cult which says that Freedom isn't free, and that the cost of freedom is blood which must be periodically sacrificed on the altar of Liberty by the military/clergy. This kind of thinking tends to believe that we only have freedom because we are allowed it by the government/God, and that, not only should be grateful for it and turn an unquestioning devotion onto the government/military/church, but that when the 'timeless call' (the name of another Spielberg propaganda piece) comes, we should be ready and willing to die.The film's only function is for the audience to exclaim: 'Look at those amazing special effects! Gimme more!' While its covert purpose is the jingoistic and chauvinistic regeneration of nationalist ideology, the very 'evil' that the film's context was supposedly attempting to overcome. Couple this with the film's warped sense of civic virtue (ie: to be a true member of society, you must 'be good' and earn your keep) and you have a pretty fascist picture. 'Ryan' pretends to be a realistic, morally nuanced film about the war, but in reality it's psychologically inauthentic slice of fascism. It's a character driven piece with no actual characters. It's a show reel of scenes stolen from at least 50 other war films (A Walk In The Sun, Beach Red, Bataan, Objective Burma, Guadalcanal Diary etc). End result, a couple of technically amazing battle sequences bookending two hours of propaganda. Simply shaking the camera does not equate to realism.Far from 'revolutionising the way we see war', 'Ryan' adds nothing to our perception of war. There is nothing beyond the gunfire. Nothing to distinguish it from any war film released between 1943 and 1963. Ten years on and the film's sole effect has been to influence a series of next generation computer games which recreate the exhilaration of combat in this new, pseudo-documentary style. In some cases, entire scenes from 'Ryan' are recreated as levels for kids to play. 'Ryan' isn't war, it's just action. It's Spielberg playing with toy soldiers (Spielberg's first film as a kid was a playful war movie).So make no mistake, this isn't realism. The real D-day landing was painfully slow and lasted countless hours. Combat is banal, mundane and always less seductive than its celluloid representation. What the film really 'accomplished' was the successful marrying of the 'pornography of violence', its unrelentingly brutal voyeurism, with extreme, pro-nationalist ideology. The audience responds by 'enjoying' watching the film, never bothering to actually address the underlying fascism.'Empire of the Sun' is likewise a cartoonish film for those who like balloons. Jim (Christian Bale) is a wealthy child who lives in war torn Shanghai. Spielberg touches upon a couple issues (class, fantasy, loss of childhood) but the main gimmick is that Jim lives in a fantasy world of comic book heroes and fighter jets and so is able to somewhat resist the horrors around him. His fantasies are only shattered when the illusion of his parents is confronted by reality. Jim's reunited with his family and is now safe from harm, but spiritually, he's dead. Unfortunately, Spielberg never commits to the bleakness of Ballard's vision. For Spielberg, what Jim's been through was only a consequence of mommy and son being separated. Ignoring the fact that the film is saccharine, tasteless and that the musical score undermines every emotion, it's annoying to see how Spielberg romanticises the Japanese Army and portrays the Chinese (the historical victims) as a bunch of idiots. Watch how the Japanese Army never kill so much as a single person, implying that the worst of its conduct relied upon repossessing real estate and partially neglecting the medical and sustenance needs of westerners in captivity. Oh the horror.5/10",Null,9,21,22 July 2008
The Passion of Joan of Arc," 'The Passion of Joan of Arc' vs 'The Trial of Joan of Arc'
","This is a very brief review of Carl Theodor Dreyer's 'The Passion of Joan of Arc' and Robert Bresson's 'The Trial of Joan of Arc'.Some thoughts...1. What's immediately apparent when comparing these two films, is how focused Dreyer is on showing the opposing forces present at Joan's trial. Who was the chief architect of her martyrdom? The English invaders who imprisoned her? The French clergy who tried and condemned her? God? The girl herself? The people who identified with her and gave her martyrdom political purpose? 2. Dreyer always keeps Joan isolated within the frame, plumbing a solitary soul's duress under persecution. Elsewhere he deftly shows the transformation of the witnessing masses from a crazy mob into a responsible voice of moral protest.3. Maria Falconetti, who plays Joan in Dreyer's film, is given some of the most celebrated close ups in cinema history. What became of her? One legend claims that she so identified with her one major film role that she ended up in an insane asylum, convinced she was Joan.4. Unlike Dreyer's film, Bresson's is filled with non professional actors. His is a dry, almost distant film.5. Whilst Dreyer's film oozes grand emotions, Bresson's is modern, minimalist and existentially blunt.6. Bresson avoids the circus and stresses Joan's solitude. His Joan is defiant in court, but privately she is at a loss, constantly praying for answers.7. Dreyer's Joan (a kind of instinctual folk hero) acts according to her feelings, while Bresson's acts according to her conscience, which fluctuate as she broods.8. Bresson's Joan is actually reluctant to embrace martyrdom. She's in over her head, unsure, confused.9. In Dreyer's film, the audience becomes both Joan and the masses supporting her. In Bresson's, however, the audience is positioned as an outsider. We're the prison guards, the jailers, the priests, always 'seperated' from Joan (by holes, by walls, by bars). The poor girl's kept at a distance.10. Bresson's film is filled with visual echoes. Joan's hands, chained across a bible, resemble a pair of wings. At her execution, her hands, now tied behind her back, reappear in closeup. When doves appear, shot from below, we are reminded of Joan's 'winged' hands to haunting effect. The point: an image of confinement has become one of ultimate liberation.11. Bresson's film begins with two sounds: the ringing of church bells, followed by a drum roll. It ends only with a drum roll. Joan silences the Church that has put her to death.12. Bresson has criticised Dreyer's film on numerous occasions, stating that he found the acting 'grotesque'. He's right. Joan was a hardened warrior who fought with men. Why then does Dreyer portray her in such a melodramatic fashion? On the flip side, Dreyer's images do tap into something almost primal.13. Bresson's film abounds with delicious ambiguities. Was Joan really receiving messages from God? Is she deluded? Was she a crazy freedom fighter or holy saint? Was she simply a 15th century terrorist, opposing the English occupying army and the tents of the Catholic Church? 8.9/10 - 'The Trial of Joan of Arc'8/10 - 'The Passion of Joan of Arc' Both masterpieces, though I personally prefer Bresson's austere approach.

Gone Baby Gone," Honey, I blew up the kid
","There's nothing better than a noir or detective plot done well. The thrill of the chase, that impenetrable web of mystery, those brave private investigators who carve their way through labyrinths of deceit, bad guys and double crosses. It's just so damn juicy when done well.'Gone Baby Gone' isn't a great film – first time director Ben Affleck is still learning the ropes – but its got a script that knows how to jerk its audience around and is filled with some great performances, most notably young Casey Affleck in the lead. Casey, so great in 'The Assassination of Jesse James', charms us with his lopsided grin, his guttural voice and kind face. He and his girl are our Bogarts, and together they work their way through the film's mystery (the kidnapping and potential murder of a child) with workmanlike efficiency.7.9/10 – Author Dennis Lehane wrote both 'Mystic River' and 'Gone Baby Gone', both films trying to examine the effects of a shocking crime on a close knit community. 'Mystic River' may have better production design and a more palatable sense of tragedy, but 'Gone Baby Gone' has a better lead hero in Casey Affleck. He's a humble and likable private investigator, immediately endearing. Still, this is old school mystery fiction. The true noirs of today are such widely different films as 'Inland Empire', 'The Wire', 'Mulholland Drive', 'Eyes Wide Shut', 'Boarding Gate', 'Miami Vice', 'Girlfriend Experience' etc, all offering a far more sensual world of overlapping labyrinths and unresolved conflicts. They are noir as globalized conflict, whilst fare like 'Mystic River', 'Gone Baby Gone', 'Zodiac' etc are decidedly retro.Worth one viewing. Though excellent for a debut, once you know the film's outcome, director Ben Affleck's aesthetic isn't seductive enough to keep us coming back for second helpings.",Null,2,3,15 February 2010
"Monsters, Inc."," Something evil this way comes
","'James, this company has been in my family for three generations. I would do anything to keep it from going under!' - Henry J. Waternoose ('Monster's Inc')One of Pixar's best films, 'Monster's Inc' plays like a buddy comedy in which a hairy blue monster (John Goodman) and a one eyed testicle (Billy Crystal) struggle to protect a human child from corporate bad guys.The film is super cute and supremely precious, but never dips into the kind of annoying mawkishness that plagues Pixar's later films ('Up' and 'Wall-E'). This is primarily thanks to the vocal talents of John Goodman and Billy Crystal, two seasoned comedians who not only lend the film real warmth, but are able to capture the kind of edgy, rapid-fire banter that Hawks and Wilder were known for. Unique in the Pixar canon, this is thus a dialogue driven film, relying on sharp exchanges, a screwball plot and lots of buddy interactions.Like most Pixar films, this is also a hypocritical message movie. Here we have a 'big corporation' (Monsters Inc - they're literally comprised of 'corporate monsters') who not only specialise in 'exploiting' humans, but refuse to adopt better, more efficient and 'environmentally friendly' practises. Thankfully such preaching is handled with subtlety (unlike 'Wall-E'), though the film does end with an annoying cliché: the kind hearted and fatherly company boss is revealed to be a devious bad guy, the film reducing ideology, systems and power structures to the morality of an evil figurehead. The belief that replacing a monster's head will cause its body to magically transform - indeed, the belief that the head is itself somehow separate from the body - is a fantasy common in cinema.Visually, the film looks great. This was Pixar's big attempt to successfully render fur, wind and hair, a hurdle they had to get out of the way before conquering water, fire, metal and surface reflections with their later films. It's staggering to see how far computer animation has come in such a short space of time. This film's textures, resolutions and animations look positively archaic when compared to Pixar's later efforts. Incidentally, 'Monsters Inc' is part of a longstanding battle between Pixar and DreamWorks Pictures (founded by Spielberg, Katzenberg and Geffen in the mid 90s). With the surprise success of Pixar's 'Toy Story', DreamWorks set about discovering Pixar's next project. When their spies learnt of 'A Bugs Life', DreamWorks therefore rushed out the similarly themed 'Antz' in an attempt to steal some profits.Next from Dreamworks came 'The Prince of Egypt' and 'The Road to El Dorado', two animated films designed to rip off Disney's 'Hercules' and 'Mulan'. Dreamworks' 'Shrek', a monster flick designed to cash in on Pixar's 'Monster's Inc', came next, followed by 'Sinbad', a knock off of Disney's 'Atlantis: The Lost Empire'.The battle continued with 'Shark Tale', Dreamworks' copy of 'Finding Nemo', 'Megamind' which copies 'The Incredibles', and 'Flushed Away', which mimics 'Ratatouille'. No surprise too that the hero of DreamWorks' 'How to Train Your Dragon' is called HiccUP, and that the film was the studio's response to Pixar's 'Up'. And so on and on it goes, corporate warfare and artistry dancing their intimate ballet.The point is, 'Shrek', which was released the same year as 'Monster's Inc', used a tale of monsters to poke fun at Disney, Pixar and Disney fairy tales, whilst 'Monster's Inc' celebrates the portals, multidimensional windows and doorways of business magnate Steve Jobs' 'Apple Computers' (Jobs was chief executive of Pixar). What's interesting, though, is that 'DreamWorks' is now turning the brand awareness generated by its crappy early animations into giant 'cash cow sequels' ('Shrek 2 and 3', 'Kung Fu Panda 2', 'Madagascar 2 and 3', 'How to Train your Dragon 2' etc), whilst Pixar, now fully absorbed by the Disney Machine, has sold out and become a monster of its own, milking their early projects with the planned releases of 'Cars 2', 'Monsters Inc 2' etc etc.8.5/10 – The takeover has already started. Pixar is turning into the very monster it rallies against in this film. Today it exemplifies what Robert Pfaller calls 'interpassivity', performing our indictments for us whilst allowing us to consume with impunity.Worth three viewings.",Null,2,4,17 September 2010
Ant-Man," Greatest film since the Sistine Chapel
","Cool and funny people do cool and funny stuff in 'Ant-Man', a film in which cool and funny people do cool and funny stuff. Sometimes the cool and funny people stop doing cool and funny stuff and talk about serious things instead, like evil terrorist plots to destroy the world. Also sometimes they shrink and fight and punch each other.One of the cool and funny characters in the film is played by Paul Rudd, who is cool and funny and also cute. Paul Rudd's character has many cool moments, like moments in which he does cool things, and says funny things, and also shrinks himself to the size of an ant. Sometimes he flaunts his six-pack, which is really hot and chiselled but not as hot and chiselled as Chris Pratt's six-pack, which is really hot and chiselled. My boyfriend Steve says Paul Rudd is boyfriend material for even straight guys, which makes me jealous because I don't like Steve thinking of other guys that way. But I guess it's no big deal.Marvel movies are way cool, but not all of them, only some of them. I like the part in 'Ant-Man' where the guys shrink and then try to break into a building. It reminded me of that Pixar movie ('Finding Nemo'?) with the little toys, but 'Ant-Man' is way better because I saw it yesterday. Also it stars Michael Pena, who is really cool. Except he steals jobs from John Leguizamo now. My mom says not to say that because it's ironic and racist, but I don't understand why.10/10 - A film with things.",Null,2,3,4 December 2016
Captain America: The First Avenger," Dumb, dull, Marvel movie
","Chris Evans plays Captain America, a one time dweeb who, because of a scientific experiment, is reborn a super-soldier. He's America's answer to Hitler's Ubermensch, possessive of qualities which Hitler's evil henchmen supposedly don't have: honour, love, respect, morality, self sacrifice, bravery and an American accent. The film's villain is Red Skull, a stand in for Hitler.The film goes past the proto-fascism of most comic book movies and outright salivates over American supremacy, advocates eugenics, portrays the US as virtuous because of its weaponry, and features a hero who spends most of his time earnestly expressing his adoration of patriotism, patriotic duty and ideals. The film contains a sequence in which Captain American, before he takes the fight to Germany, is reduced to starring in silly, one-dimensional propaganda pieces for TV and radio. The film pokes fun at these goofy showbiz-cum-agitprop segments, but they're exactly what the film as a whole is. Captain America's uniform – a more overt version of 'Spiderman' and 'Superman's' American Flag inspired garments – is itself literally the Star-Spangled Banner. Imagine a superhero wearing a Nazi Party Flag and protecting Colombians, Native Americans, Mexicans, Sudanese, Somalians, Iraqis, Afghans and Filipino's from Red White and Blue Skull. Call him Kapitan Klaus and his sidekick Herr Dreyer. I'd pay to see that.The film's aesthetic is 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow' meets 'Indiana Jones'. It is poorly directed by Joe Johnson, a director who mostly specialises in trash. It is dull and contains no exciting action sequences. Tommy Lee Jones steals the show as a hard-as-nails military man.'Captain America' comics blossomed in the 1940s, milked kill-a-Nazi mania, and then essentially turned into an anti-communist adventure series in the 1950s (during the first quarter century of the comic book industry's existence, most of the major figures within its business and creative departments were Jewish, so these stories were understandably influenced by a certain political outlook). Though Marvel Head, Stan Lee, is perceived as a kindly, gentle old man these days, his pre-code stories were often shockingly (by today's standards), sexist and racist, some now 'unavailable' due to their racist portrayals (particularly of Asians). It took until the 1970s for writers like Steve Englehart to begin 'Captain America's' revisionism process. But this more nuanced 'Captain' is not found in Johnson's film. His film remains stuck in the 40s.But even modern comic book tales retain proto-fascist elements. These are all stories where 'might equals right', 'violent goodness equals victory', and where an absurd, destructive, simple-minded world-view is espoused in which a champion of the status quo and the norms of a given era or society is pitted against and defeats the champion of some less popular ideation. Our hero, of course, always knows what is really good for the majority, and dutifully defends the terrified masses from some super-terrorist, but only so that they too may be sent to war by the good-guy leaders of his good-guy world, enslaved to the proper, righteous nation-state of mind rather than some other. And though the hero knows what is 'good' and 'just' and is certain that his violence is justified, it is nevertheless a Marvel trademark to have him play coy and uncertain about his violent capacities, paying lip service to 'am I really doing the right thing?' for a few pages before decapitating his adversary. You know, like getting UN approval before bombing your neighbour.3/10 – Johnson's 'The Rocketeer' does this stuff better. See 'Team America: World Police' instead.

The Bourne Ultimatum," Enjoy your egg whites
","'At the root of Bond is something neo-fascistic and totally materialist.' - John Le Carre The Bourne franchise stars Matt Damon as Jason Bourne, a kind of anti-James Bond who, though a secret agent trained by the CIA, finds himself turning his back on his murderous past and waging a clandestine war against Treadstone, a Black-Ops arm of the US military.As action movies go, 'The Bourne Identity' is stronger than most. The best of its franchise, 'Identity' features a number of low-key and inventive action sequences, most of which involve our hero using brains rather than brawn. Bourne's quick thinking, unpredictable and stays several steps ahead of his pursuers, the opposite of Bond, who's always playing catch up.The film's sequels, 'The Bourne Supremacy' and 'The Bourne Ultimatum', merely rehash the franchise's first film, emulating its 'running man' plot and attempting to mimic its action sequences, blow for blow. What was once fresh quickly becomes stale, and Bourne's 'ingenious' battle tactics now rarely surprise. Still, both films contain a number of subplots which aren't usually found in Western action movies. Here Bourne, once a state sanctioned assassin, tracks down the victims of his past and attempts to atone for his sins. Elsewhere he colludes with whistle-blowers and left-wing newspapers (The Guardian, itself slowly dying in real life), attempting to expose a CIA which routinely engages in off-the-grid criminal activities (in real life, they'd brazenly assassinate the leaders of, or engender coups in, Congo, Morocco, Jamaica, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Mozambique, Guyana etc). This is a far cry from James Bond ('Goldfinger', we recall, opens with Bond blowing up the oil supplies of Latin American revolutionaries). Bond's the Imperialist's, misogynistic foot-soldier, Bourne's a disillusioned grunt in an age of Bradley Manning, Jullian Assange and John Kiriakou, which of course makes him a threat. As journalist Kevin Gosztola observed, 'To this day, the only CIA officer to go to jail for torture is now officially an officer who blew the lid on torture and who never tortured anybody.' Bourne is himself both whistle-blower and action hero. A John Rambo for liberals, his journey is one from forgetfulness and a kind of cultural amnesia, to direct confrontation. He attempts to expose and remember, whilst the CIA attempts to cover up and silence. This aligns the franchise with 1970s political conspiracy thrillers; the State is the enemy, and Bourne's a loaded weapon aimed at his own former employer. Indeed, when pitted against foreign agents, Bond repeatedly says 'my argument is not with you'. Unlike Bond, a relic of the Cold War, Bourne's decidedly post-Cold War. Bond's always had a very rigid sense of self-identity ('The name's Bond. James Bond.'). Bourne, though, doesn't remember his name, his past, his identity, and carries a satchel full of passports with faces he doesn't recognise. The locales our globe-trotting hero visits are similarly blurred and indistinguishable; everywhere looks the same. Bourne's both representative of a culture that doesn't really know what it stands for, and one which can't morally reconcile its post and pre amnesic identities.Whilst a 'liberal action film' is some kind of contradiction (the inevitable glorification and aesthetizisation of violence etc), the Bourne franchise nevertheless does atypical things. Women are consistently the film's moral guardians, Bourne symbolically turns books and pens into action weapons, the series goes out of its way to portray water boarding as an abhorrent act which leads to utter dehumanisation (water and water-boarding, continual motifs in the franchise, led to the very creation of Bourne) and Bourne himself is explicitly obsessed with 'what represents me?' (and by extension, America). While Bond's your typical spy hero designed to bolster faith in crown, country and offshore escapades, the Bourne franchise ultimately deals with Bourne accepting the responsibility for his own moral corruption; he chose to be Jason Bourne. He is culpable.No surprise then that Doug Liman, who directed 'Identity', has a father who was chief counsel for the senate in the Iran-Contra Affair. And Paul Greengrass, director of 'Supremacy' and 'Ultimatum', is himself a left-leaning Cambridge graduate and political documentary filmmaker.The most interesting of the franchise, 'The Bourne Legacy' was released in 2012. It starred Jeremy Renner as Aaron Cross, another Black-Ops CIA agent. The film again rehashes the Bourne formula – Cross is pursued by the CIA, who again want him silenced – but also does a number of interesting, new things. It's explicitly concerned, for example, with issues of collusion and participation. How can organisms like Bourne and Bond exist, if not for the complicity of whole swathes of society? In 'Legacy's' case, Cross maps a network of globe-spanning factory workers, scientists, politicians, engineers, all of whom contribute to the workings of an illegal CIA project. Fascism, then, depends on a complex mix of unconscious complicity, ignorance, compartmentalisation, collusion, separation, disavowal and outright secrecy. When the CIA project – Operation Outcome – is exposed, it then quickly evaporates, like shadow exposed to light. Members are hunted down, agents are 'suicided', and scientists are reassigned or murdered. Such murders recall countless historical events. Regimes, from Ancient Rome to even 21st century democratic states, tend to squelch intellectuals when fearful of exposure.As an action movie 'Legacy' is weak. A stupid last act and many moments derivative of its predecessors undermine its fairly serious first hour. The film contains sequences involving Predator Drones, now the weapon of choice for the US military when it comes to naked war crimes. Recent legislation essentially makes it 'legal' for such drones to assassinate brown and black skinned people. Accidentally killed civilian targets are then ipso-facto reclassified as 'terrorists', 'insurgents' or, as has happened several times, simply 'animals' (dogs or cows). Of course Bourne and Bond are themselves drones. But while Bourne wants escape, Bond's the kind of guy sent to silence him.7.9/10 - Worth one viewing.",Null,1,4,22 March 2013

Fargo," The Straight Story
","'When a film like Fargo is successful, then clearly nothing makes sense.' â€“ Ethan Coen'The story that follows is about Minnesota. It evokes the abstract landscape of our childhood - a bleak, windswept tundra, resembling Siberia except for its Ford dealerships and Hardee's restaurants. It aims to be both homey and exotic, and pretends to be true.' - Ethan Coen Jerry Lundegaard (William H Macy) is a car salesman who urgently needs money. Out of desperation he hires two criminals to kidnap his wife, his intention being to extort 1 million dollars from her wealthy father. But in typical noir fashion, his plan falls apart.This is another tightly wound neo-noir by the Coen brothers, but like David Lynch's 'Straight Story', it's also a reactionary piece aimed at its audience. Lynch followed up the critically derided 'Lost Highway' with 'The Straight Story', a film which pretended to be homey, realistic and 'straight', when in fact it was a disturbing tale filled with hidden horrors and disguised menace.'Fargo' likewise pretends to be a straight story. After audiences and critics scorned the ridiculously cartoonish 'Hudsucker Proxy', the Coen's released the more somber 'Fargo, presenting it to their audience as a film based on a real event, and using subdued camera work and a great deal of restraint to lend the film a sense of authenticity.But as Police Chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) learns when she meets her old friend Mike Yanagita, things shouldn't be taken at face value. So though touted as a 'serious film' based on a 'factual event', 'Fargo' is really an exercise in seeing how FAR the Coens can GO (hence the title) without cracking up laughing. The film pretends to be based on a true story, when in fact it is a work of fiction borne from the playful minds of the Coens. Virtually every scene is skewed or warped, filled with moments of repressed humour, ridiculous mannerisms and laughably named characters. The con, or joke, is how far the audience is suckered into accepting the on screen follies. This sort of audience contempt would reach nihilistic proportions in the Coen's later films.8.5/10 - A slick slice of neo-noir, not as inventive or daring as 'The Big Lebowski', but its simplicity allows it to reach a kind of lean perfection. Still, the film has two flaws. Firstly, all these formalists (De Palma, Mamet, Leone, Tarantino, Coens - Hollywood's reigning post-modernists) always serve up reheated seconds. 'Fargo' thus works more as a slick photocopy or parody of noir, all the imperfections airbrushed and whittled away by history, the Coens more interested in reproduction and ironic distance, than tapping into something genuine.The second flaw is the Coen's increasing nihilism. Art's all a big joke, either an unknowing prank on the audience or an invitation for artist and audience to, in tandem, mock the follies of the schmucks on screen. The Coens pretend to deal with tragedy, but rarely do they tap into any kind of affecting sadness.",Null,2,2,22 August 2008

The Aviator," Disappointingly hollow
","Though a film director, Howard Hughes is more accurately remembered as a half-baked engineer, an irresponsible pilot, an underhanded billionaire capitalist, and most spectacularly, a world-class neurotic whose famous descent into unwashed, paranoid junkie madness in the years before his death, assured his notoriety after many other late industrialists had faded from the country's consciousness.You'd think such an eccentric personality would lend itself to an interesting film, but Scorsese seems unable to get inside the mind or life of Howard Hughes. His Hughes is a caricature. A fast talking businessman plagued by occasional bouts of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.'The Aviator' plays like a bloated retread of France Ford Coppola's 'Tucker: A Man and his dreams'. The cocky entrepreneur, the boardroom battles, the obligatory romance, the scenes where our hero's 'out of the box' thinking solves some design flaw. Both films are identical, hollow and overstuffed pieces of work.Like Jeff Bridges in 'Tucker', Leonardo Dicaprio plays a cartoonish maverick, desperately fighting for our attention. Attempts by Scorsese to flesh out his psychology are crude. For example, an incestuous scene featuring a naked Hughes and his mother, and a couple shots of Dicaprio obsessing over silly details (handshakes, doorknobs etc). No attempt is made to link Hughes the success to Hughes and his demons. The ironic fact that his OCD is what made Hughes' business life so successful, is seemingly lost on Scorsese. The film does, however, have a nice running joke about Hughes' obsession with breasts and breast milk. The man has some warped fixation on women and their mammaries, but the film's PG rating prevents this from going anywhere interesting.Visually, both Coppola and Scorsese's films are overproduced and overly pretty. There's no sense of real time or space. Instead it's all big sets, bawdy colours and larger than life personalities. Scorsese has bought the false view of Hollywood and then spat it back out at us.Hughes' romance with Katerine Hepburn takes up most of the film's running time. It's a lifeless and dull romance, devoid of wit, understanding or heat. From here on the film loses its energy. Hughes goes from a watchable eccentric to boring caricature.One of Scorsese's signatures is that he can get inside a character's head by moving the camera or cutting into a scene. When Henry Hill is coked out in 'Goodfellas' the jumpy camera-work and breakneck editing are similarly jazzed, and when Jake La Motta takes a blow in 'Raging Bull' it feels as if you're getting smacked around in the ring with him.If the first hour of 'The Aviator' flows, it's because Hughes is at the top of his game and Scorsese is riding the character's highs with a visual style that is equally fluid and effortless. But when Hughes starts falling apart, Scorsese loses his momentum. The film drifts into seemingly endless takeoffs and landings and a drawn-out drama involving Hughes's competitors (completely lifted from Coppola's film) which features Alec Baldwin and Alan Alda as a matched set of vipers.At the end of the film, Hughes locks himself in a screening room, strips off his clothes and begins a babblogue that echoes a similar meltdown in 'Raging Bull.' DiCaprio tries hard to pull off a pantomime of madness, but neither he nor Scorsese taps into the pity and terror underlying the episode.Hughes died a skeletal drug addict, broken-off hypodermic needles embedded in his arms. He was a sad freak, a depressed maverick, an outcast and eventually a figure of public fun, which perhaps explains why Scorsese tends to play the character's tics for light laughs, even when they don't seem very funny. A darker, more complex work, would have made the Hughes character more interesting. As it is, 'The Aviator' is a huge failure, a pg13 grasp for mainstream attention, offering no truth or insight into Howard Hughes the man.4/10 - Bloated emptiness. Aside from some energetic and fun scenes during the first half hour (all of which stress DiCaprio's cockiness) the film fails to go anywhere interesting.",Null,3,6,27 April 2008
Léon: The Professional," I finished growing up, Léon. I just get older
","Luc Besson directs 'Leon', a stylish action movie. The plot? Jean Reno plays an emotionally stunted assassin who takes a young girl, played by Natalie Portman, under his wing. She's being hunted by a corrupt cop played by Gary Oldman. As the film portrays Portman as a world weary, sexualised pre-teen who frequently hits on an immature older man (and who wears a quasi-bondage fetish collar in several scenes), 'Leon's' frequently criticised for being 'like child pornography'. Interestingly, the assassin genre has a long history of sexualising underage girls (everything from 'Kite' to 'Kick Ass', the former actually banned for paedophilia). 'Leon's' tame by the genre's oft unexamined standards.Aesthetically, 'Leon's' stronger than most of Luc Besson's films. He shoots New York city like Paris, hires famous fashion designers to do the film's wardrobe and his use of music, shot selection and set pieces are all both unconventional and excellent for the genre.It's interesting to watch how the assassin genre has evolved. Early on we had Kurosawa and Leone's 'contract killer' films, which treated the hit-man as a sort of supernatural angel of death. Next came fare like 'Le Samouri', 'The Day of the Jackal' and 'The Professional' (1980), in which the hit-man is presented as a cold, methodical, robotic killer. His job was routine but lonely.Then came fare like John Woo's 'The Killer', which puts the hit-man in a crazy action movie in which he suddenly 'loves everyone' and has strict morals about whom he kills. Films like 'Nikita' and 'Leon' followed, in which the hit-man becomes a kind of emotionally damaged woman (Nikita) or mentally damaged man-child (Leon). It's as though, over time, the hit-man evolves from something mythical, to a bureaucratic professional, to a cartoon hero, to some sort of damaged soul.'Grosse Point Blank' would then deconstruct the genre further, turning the hit-man into a Woody Allen styled neurotic who questions everything he does, psychoanalyses himself and seems stuck in an existential rut.Thoroughly postmodern, 'Ghost Dog' would then autopsy and rip apart the genre completely, paving the way for fare like 'Ichi the Killer', in which all nobility was removed. Contract killers were now disgusting, sadomasochistic and vile creatures. All nihilism and gore, the film ends with its hit-man hanging himself from a tree.Today, with everything thoroughly deconstructed, it seems as though the genre's been reset, resulting in simple assassin tales like 'Hitman' and 'Shooter'. In contrast, 'Leon's' a strange hybrid. It steals its action from Asian cinema, its emotions from French cinema (specifically Melville), its mythical aspects from Kurosawa and Leone, and wraps it all up in a strange (and yes, creepy) love story between an emotionally stunted middle aged man and a seasoned kid. Besson's 'Leon' also loosely rips off another french film called 'The Professional' (released in 1980), though his film is much better.Incidentally, Luc Besson initiated a relationship with the 14 year old Maïwenn Le Besco in the early 1990s. She gave birth to his child when 16. It's clear that 'Leon' channels the director's life and lusts during this period.8.5/10 - Worth multiple viewings.",Null,3,7,21 June 2008
Oblivion," Tom Cruise vs Giant White Balls
","'In order to be effective, a doctrine must not be understood, but has to be believed in. We can be absolutely certain only about things we do not understand.' - Eric HofferThe near future. In the aftermath of a violent war between aliens and humanity, Earth has been reduced to a radiation swathed wasteland. All surviving human beings now live on Tet, a mammoth spaceship which hangs in orbit. On the planet below, small clean-up teams prowl the landscape. They look for signs of vegetation, tend to giant planet-cleaning refineries and fend off terrorist attacks launched by the Scavengers, marauding bands of alien survivors.Directed by Joseph Kosinski, 'Oblivion' finds a pint-sized Tom Cruise playing Jack Harper, the leader of an Earth-based clean-up team. Harper flies about in a small aircraft, fights Scavengers, fixes broken machines and occasionally has dispassionate sex with Victoria, a desk bound woman to whom he's assigned. Harper's life is one of risk and routine.In typical scifi fashion, however, Jack learns that he's living a very elaborate lie. Tet is not a human ship but an alien vessel, the Scavengers are not aliens but the last survivors of the human race, humanity didn't win the war but are fighting a last-ditch battle against their alien conquerers and Jack is not a human but a memory-wiped clone working for the enemy. Shocking? Predictable? Regardless, Tom Cruise's puny mind is swiftly blown. Ticked off, he straps a bomb to his ship, flies into the heart of the alien mother-ship, kicks alien butt and lives out the rest of his clone life in a lush forest with his photogenic wife.'Oblivion's' a collage of other memorable science fiction films. Its climax is pure 'Independence Day', Jack Harper's daily routines recall 'Wall-E', 'Fahrenheit 451', 'Mad Max', 'Moon' and 'Silent Running' and the film borrows big from '2001: A Space Odyssey', 'I Am Legend' (the novel), 'Solaris' and Kosinski's own 'Tron: Legacy'. Still, the film's conceptual design work is mostly excellent. Harper and his team live in sleek, modernist apartments, open plan, awash with expansive windows and affixed to tall, steel stilts. Harper's ship is also cool. It's a cross between a B-Wing fighter, an Ipod and a pair of testicles, though we don't quite believe it when this ship turns out to be space worthy (is this the first space ship in cinema history to have a propeller?). Some of the film's other designs are horrible, though, like a goofy motorcycle, silly globe-shaped 'drones' and a ridiculous alien overlord who, being a giant red eye embedded within a black monolith, looks like a cross between HAL 9000 and a loudspeaker.Whilst its first hour is strong, 'Oblivion' quickly degenerates into a series of back and forth movements, Harper repeatedly landing and launching his spaceship and discovering things we the audience already suspect. Thankfully the film is aesthetically gorgeous. Kosinski's a professor of architecture, and so he photographs spaces/rooms/structures well. His lines are all clean, his camera work, shot flow, shot selection, framing and cutting hyper precise, his camera never shaking, every movement or composition super-planned and super-locked down. It's Hitchcock, Kubrick or Depalma level visuals. Unlike 'Tron: Legacy', which jettisoned as much dialogue as possible, 'Oblivion' is very dialogue heavy. Like 'Legacy', the film's best moments are wordless and simply marry strong visuals with music. Kosinski's at his best during these moments. You sense that his visual talents are undermined by the demands of popcorn cinema. Or maybe he really does have poor taste. Like 'Legacy', the film's score is a kind of post-postmodern version of 1980s, synth/electronic music. It seems to consist of appoggiaturas and simple, repeated 4, 3 or 2 beat rhythms, upon which other layers of sounds are progressively added. This results in a 'wall of sound' (think Vangelis, Philip Glass, Korzeniowski etc) which builds slowly but dramatically to a prolonged climax (a type of 'glue' score which is slowly becoming a cliché as the shape and structure of action movies change). Because of this 'mounting' aesthetic, it is 'Oblivion's' smaller moments which create a buzz. Vague political subtext can be read into 'Oblivion'. Harper's a drone-like everyman who works hard during the day and returns home to a kind of consumerist paradise, complete with hollow luxuries, flat-screen everythings and a loveless relationship. He's a man of surfaces and inculcated superficiality. Like the recent James Cameron abomination, 'Avatar', Harper's also indoctrinated into thinking that his life is grounded on sound, righteous values. He defines himself in relation to a Master which he believes stands for all that is good and all that is honourable, and of course believes that his own actions are resolutely humane. Harper, in other words, is your typical American, hard working, self-absorbed boyscout, doing what's right, saving the planet and fighting evil terrorists who live in caves. 'Are you an effective team?' his alien overlord repeatedly asks. The film's second half then reveals the reality behind the lie: Jack's complicit in evil, works for mineral guzzling warlords and is fighting an unjust war against those he's been conditioned to think are primitives. Unsurprisingly, Jack swiftly turns on his masters. Beyond all this, the film has weak action sequences, cool flying sequences, some funny nods to Cruise's past movies (aviator sunglasses, baseball, motorcycles etc) and an unbelievable and overly elaborate alien plot (so much trouble for so little?). The film continues a growing 'return to nature' trend/anxiety, and features Tom Cruise as an astronaut, which is hilarious for some reason, but also logical, considering the height limitations NASA places on spacemen.7.9/10 – Worth two viewings.",Null,1,8,16 April 2013
Burn After Reading," Prankenstein's Monster
","'Nothing makes much sense. So you might as well make whatever kind of movies you want and hope for the best.' - Ethan Coen'Nihilism is not only despair and negation, but above all the desire to despair and to negate.' – Albert CamusFew filmmakers encapsulate the tenets of postmodernism as purely as the Coen brothers. Postmodernists vehemently deny any such thing as absolute truth, revel in nihilism, sarcasm and irony, reject objectivity (which mirrors everything 'new' in the science community, from Chaos Theory to Quantum Decoherence to The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle to Godel's Incompleteness Theorems to Turing's Halting Problem etc), maintain a posture of 'mock, ironic distance' and adhere to French philosopher's Jacques Derrida's understanding of language, in which words and images have no meaning and are viciously self-limited, all systems of signs only referring to other signs, all language a web of references. As postmodernism is associated with relativism (anything goes, the era of 'whatever'), such artists believe that no meaning can be derived from text other than whatever subjective meaning the interpreter assigns to it. Since there are no absolutes, the very linguistic symbols used by the author to communicate are undermined. With symbols undermined, surface re-arrangement becomes the artist's primary tool. Enter the age of 'that's so random', of incessant pastiche and mock sampling (taken to the extreme, see the random cutaway joke inserts of 'Family Guy'). Gradually postmodernist art evolves to the point at which it starts to mirrors the universe it believes in: total randomness and utter nihilism. The universe of noir. 'Burn After Reading' is another in a long line of Coen brothers film noirs. Noir is by definition a conspiratorial and largely indeterministic universe, and the one genre that aligns itself perfectly to the Coens' world-view (all Coen films are either noirs, screwballs or hybrids of the two, noir being screwball without the comedy). From the bowling pins and tumbleweeds of 'The Big Lebowski', to the car crashes, murders and tornadoes of 'A Serious Man' and 'No Country For Old Men', the Coen's have now started to bring the subtext of their earlier films to the forefront. Their films are now exclusively about the world being 'about' nothing other than mechanical, cosmic causality. This is the problem with being too intelligent for your own good. Everything either becomes a tongue-in-cheek homage, or you wallow in the dead end of intellectual limits, finding new and clever ways to soliloquise over the vacuity of existence. Woody Allen, like the Coens, has made a career out of doing just this. In fact, the Coens are Woody Allen with visual style, both the Brothers and Allen oscillating between 'serious' films about nothingness and 'funny' formalist games about nothingness. Early Coen films, like 'Where art Thou?' and 'Barton Fink', even went so far as to deride socially conscious artists altogether. 'Fck it, dude,' is the Coen motto, as a title card in the Coens' 'A Serious Man' essentially states.It's not that there isn't truth to such conclusions – everything is, after all, a bit meaningless – but one should question the productivity of not taking the next step and asking, 'So what now?' If the pointlessness of life exists only to be talked about and converted into art, then that talking and that art are just as pointless as life. Better, perhaps, to break through the brick wall of meaning(lessness) and choose a fork in the road: create some meaning or find some that has evaded you thus far. Which is why the mantra of cinema's late modernists was always 'nothing matters, so everything does'.And so 'Reading' is another Coen Brothers film populated by confused and stupid people living in a wholly absurd, indeterministic universe. The difference here is that all the characters are motivated by sex (usually in the Coen universe it's greed and revenge). We have Linda, a woman who is obsessed with plastic surgery and finding a man, Harry, a marshal who is making a sex machine to please women in his basement and who hops from one sexual relationship with a woman to the next (symbollically, his holstered gun/penis has 'never been really used'; he's been put out to pasture and is caught in a mid-life crisis of sorts). Then there are various wives and minor characters, all of whom are looking for love or trying to improve their body images. The only characters who escape these hang ups are Osbourne, an intelligence analyst who drinks because everyone around him is a complete buffoon, and Brad Pitt, in another wonderfully funny role as a good natured man-kid. Government apathy and American obsessions with sex and physical perfection - the moronic nature of the entire modern age – are the targets, but its handled as low scrutiny satire, the Coen's not interested in examining or empathising with the hang ups of these characters, but highlighting how useless these hang ups are in the face of a universe that is wholly uncaring. In other words, we're all raving, needy, thoughtless airheads, who should wake up to the fact that we're just bouncing around like pin-balls. The film is wrong to portray the CIA and intelligence community as a bunch of clueless numskulls (they masterfully play ignorant populaces like pawns), but the film nevertheless ends with two great scenes. One in which our intelligence analyst bemoans the fact that everyone is an idiot, whilst failing to realise that the man he is about to kill is a well meaning, compassionate and caring ex-priest. The other great scene occurs immediately afterwards, and involves a CIA agent summarising the film we just witnessed, leaving the audience with a resounding sensation that nothing has been solved, and even more embarrassingly, that there was really no problem at all. 7.9/10 – Filled with freakish nuances that make it more rewarding to re-watch than the directors' more celebrated fare.",Null,3,6,29 August 2010
The Bourne Identity," Quantum of Solace
","'At the root of Bond is something neo-fascistic and totally materialist.' - John Le Carre The Bourne franchise stars Matt Damon as Jason Bourne, a kind of anti-James Bond who, though a secret agent trained by the CIA, finds himself turning his back on his murderous past and waging a clandestine war against Treadstone, a Black-Ops arm of the US military.As action movies go, 'The Bourne Identity' is stronger than most. The best of its franchise, 'Identity' features a number of low-key and inventive action sequences, most of which involve our hero using brains rather than brawn. Bourne's quick thinking, unpredictable and stays several steps ahead of his pursuers, the opposite of Bond, who's always playing catch up.The film's sequels, 'The Bourne Supremacy' and 'The Bourne Ultimatum', merely rehash the franchise's first film, emulating its 'running man' plot and attempting to mimic its action sequences, blow for blow. What was once fresh quickly becomes stale, and Bourne's 'ingenious' battle tactics now rarely surprise. Still, both films contain a number of subplots which aren't usually found in Western action movies. Here Bourne, once a state sanctioned assassin, tracks down the victims of his past and attempts to atone for his sins. Elsewhere he colludes with whistle-blowers and left-wing newspapers (The Guardian, itself slowly dying in real life), attempting to expose a CIA which routinely engages in off-the-grid criminal activities (in real life, they'd brazenly assassinate the leaders of, or engender coups in, Congo, Morocco, Jamaica, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Mozambique, Guyana etc). This is a far cry from James Bond ('Goldfinger', we recall, opens with Bond blowing up the oil supplies of Latin American revolutionaries). Bond's the Imperialist's, misogynistic foot-soldier, Bourne's a disillusioned grunt in an age of Bradley Manning, Jullian Assange and John Kiriakou, which of course makes him a threat. As journalist Kevin Gosztola observed, 'To this day, the only CIA officer to go to jail for torture is now officially an officer who blew the lid on torture and who never tortured anybody.' Bourne is himself both whistle-blower and action hero. A John Rambo for liberals, his journey is one from forgetfulness and a kind of cultural amnesia, to direct confrontation. He attempts to expose and remember, whilst the CIA attempts to cover up and silence. This aligns the franchise with 1970s political conspiracy thrillers; the State is the enemy, and Bourne's a loaded weapon aimed at his own former employer. Indeed, when pitted against foreign agents, Bond repeatedly says 'my argument is not with you'. Unlike Bond, a relic of the Cold War, Bourne's decidedly post-Cold War. Bond's always had a very rigid sense of self-identity ('The name's Bond. James Bond.'). Bourne, though, doesn't remember his name, his past, his identity, and carries a satchel full of passports with faces he doesn't recognise. The locales our globe-trotting hero visits are similarly blurred and indistinguishable; everywhere looks the same. Bourne's both representative of a culture that doesn't really know what it stands for, and one which can't morally reconcile its post and pre amnesic identities.Whilst a 'liberal action film' is some kind of contradiction (the inevitable glorification and aesthetizisation of violence etc), the Bourne franchise nevertheless does atypical things. Women are consistently the film's moral guardians, Bourne symbolically turns books and pens into action weapons, the series goes out of its way to portray water boarding as an abhorrent act which leads to utter dehumanisation (water and water-boarding, continual motifs in the franchise, led to the very creation of Bourne) and Bourne himself is explicitly obsessed with 'what represents me?' (and by extension, America). While Bond's your typical spy hero designed to bolster faith in crown, country and offshore escapades, the Bourne franchise ultimately deals with Bourne accepting the responsibility for his own moral corruption; he chose to be Jason Bourne. He is culpable.No surprise then that Doug Liman, who directed 'Identity', has a father who was chief counsel for the senate in the Iran-Contra Affair. And Paul Greengrass, director of 'Supremacy' and 'Ultimatum', is himself a left-leaning Cambridge graduate and political documentary filmmaker.The most interesting of the franchise, 'The Bourne Legacy' was released in 2012. It starred Jeremy Renner as Aaron Cross, another Black-Ops CIA agent. The film again rehashes the Bourne formula – Cross is pursued by the CIA, who again want him silenced – but also does a number of interesting, new things. It's explicitly concerned, for example, with issues of collusion and participation. How can organisms like Bourne and Bond exist, if not for the complicity of whole swathes of society? In 'Legacy's' case, Cross maps a network of globe-spanning factory workers, scientists, politicians, engineers, all of whom contribute to the workings of an illegal CIA project. Fascism, then, depends on a complex mix of unconscious complicity, ignorance, compartmentalisation, collusion, separation, disavowal and outright secrecy. When the CIA project – Operation Outcome – is exposed, it then quickly evaporates, like shadow exposed to light. Members are hunted down, agents are 'suicided', and scientists are reassigned or murdered. Such murders recall countless historical events. Regimes, from Ancient Rome to even 21st century democratic states, tend to squelch intellectuals when fearful of exposure.As an action movie 'Legacy' is weak. A stupid last act and many moments derivative of its predecessors undermine its fairly serious first hour. The film contains sequences involving Predator Drones, now the weapon of choice for the US military when it comes to naked war crimes. Recent legislation essentially makes it 'legal' for such drones to assassinate brown and black skinned people. Accidentally killed civilian targets are then ipso-facto reclassified as 'terrorists', 'insurgents' or, as has happened several times, simply 'animals' (dogs or cows). Of course Bourne and Bond are themselves drones. But while Bourne wants escape, Bond's the kind of guy sent to silence him.8.5/10 - Worth one viewing.",Null,1,2,22 March 2013
The Matrix Revolutions," Cyberpunk sucker punch
","The Wachowski Brothers released 'The Matrix' in 1999. The film starred Keanu Reeves as Neo, a man who realises that 'reality' as perceived by most humans is actually an elaborate simulation called 'the Matrix', created by sentient machines to subdue humans and essentially use them for slave labour. A massive box-office hit, the film's archetypal 'Hero's Journey' connected with audiences, particular young males. Like 'Star Wars', The New Testament, 'Lord of the Rings' and virtually every 'modern myth', it was filled with talk of 'destiny', 'chosen ones', 'salvation', 'special missions' and supernatural powers (the force/the code), which of course only our prophesied hero, Neo, possesses. The Wachowskis released two sequels ('Reloaded' and 'Revolutions') several years later. Disparaged by fan-boys, these two films created a sort of anti-myth. Or more precisely, the machine villains of the franchise were revealed to have created an artificial myth in order to give false hope to the film's human heroes, and by extension, the film's audience. It's not so much that the sequels deconstruct what Joseph Campbell famously called the 'monomyth' or the 'Hero's Journey', but that they embodied a kind of postmodern scepticism of the 'metanarrative', and so treat the film's myths as a further layer of Matrix simulation which people 'plug into' to further delude themselves.'The narrative function is losing its functors, its great hero, its great dangers, its great voyages, its great goal.' Pilosopher Jean Lyotard wrote decades ago. 'Where, after the meta-narratives, can legitimacy thus reside?' Echoing Lyotard's words, 'The Matrix' franchise highlights a subtle cultural shift, the totalising nature of meta-narratives, and their reliance on some form of 'transcendent and universal truth', now increasingly rejected. What the Wachowskis show is that the 'master narrative' is always created and reinforced by power structures (ie the villainous machines in the film), that they are never to be trusted, that they are designed to embody progress towards a specific goal, that they dismiss the naturally existing chaos of the universe, that they are created to marshal people toward some theoretical doctrine and that they serve only to placate subjects with notions of 'order', 'structure' and 'hope'.And so 'The Matrix' sequels have interesting (ie seemingly annoying) reversals which few myths possess. Firstly, our hero (Neo) is actually the film's 'bad guy'. Secondly, the closest the franchise has to a good guy is Agent Smith, whom most perceive as the villain. Thirdly, far from being 'the Chosen One', Neo becomes just another iteration in a long line of manipulative computer programs. Fourthly, Zion, the city which Neo is foretold to 'save', is itself just another level of simulation, a memory cache designed to house radicals and provide the illusion of hope, choice and free-will, its panel of leaders all computer programs designed to foster a belief in Neo. Fifthly, the film's Oracle is not a benevolent 'helper figure' (ie Yoda), but is really working for the machines and is attempting to instigate the Matrix equivalent of 'multiculuralism', the passive assimilation or social integration between mankind and machine. In other words, the 'efficiency obsessed' machines (like some dystopian version of a drone reliant capitalist technocracy) don't want to waste time fighting humans, they want the human rebels (ethnic minorities and outcast hackers) to willingly 'join them' and so have constructed an elaborate myth to engender this symbiotic merger.Sixthly, the franchise's dialogue/acting becomes increasingly, and deliberately, phony. Everyone in the sequels speaks of determinism and of every micro-event being preordained. Everything you see in the sequels is thus not only programmed, but has happened repeatedly before in cycles, and is anticipated by super computer characters (some of whom possess ironic self awareness) which process zillions of different variables, tracing cause and effect to such an extent that they know exactly 'what happens next'. The notion of 'choice being an illusion' is important to the franchise. Previous versions of the Matrix (essentially a jail for humans) didn't work because 'human slaves' didn't have a choice. Gradually the machines allowed the slaves to have 'the illusion of choice', but this too didn't work. Choice was not the problem. The problem was that humans opted for what the machine's perceived to be 'the wrong choices' and sometimes 'no choice at all' (radical non-participation). Thereofore, the machines created Neo to encourage others to obey 'their choice' and 'be participatory'. The problem was, after six cycles, Neo got smart. The goal then became to con Neo; to trick him into believing that he too could choose. Extrapolate this theme to the real world and you have all kinds of sinister ramifications.Seventhly, far from a rebel, Neo has been supported by the system all along. Eightly, like Satan, Agent Smith throws himself out of 'heaven' when he realises he is 'facing deletion'. If Neo is part of the system, Smith is the enemy of the system. He wants to bring it crashing down. This is similar to the writings of many Gnostics who view Satan as the 'hero' of Genesis, as he sought to free God's subjects from their subservience and false realities. Ninthly, many complain about the film's 'fake sets' and 'fake action scenes', but once you realise that these characters and landscapes are supposed to be digital simulations, it all works. Why should they obey the laws of physics?Finally, 'Love' and 'the hero's sacrifice' are key themes in myths. With the Wachowskis, however, these things are subverted. A character called Trinity is created to 'install' love and self-sacrifice into the deluded Neo, whilst other characters (the elder's conversation at the water refinery, the birth of Sati through 'machine love' etc) are created to subtly introduce Neo to the idea of a symbiotic relationship between machines and man. The franchise's 'myth' is therefore a sort of unholy trinity (between man, machine and the ghosts in the matrix) in which 'enlightened' and 'free' humans are wilfully re-imprisoned by their false Saviour. Creepy.8.5/10 – Subversive anti-blockbuster.",Null,3,5,3 September 2010
The Thing," Carpenter's first B movie on an A budget
","John Carpenter's 'The Thing' serves up not only a civilizational clash between aliens and mankind, but between Hollywood popcorn cinema and the cinema verite and neorealist movements of 1960s Europe. Such an odd blend resulted in many excellent horror films in the 1970s and early 80s, which mixed fantasy plots and big budget SFX with gritty realism and grungy characters.The film – a loose remake of Howard Hawks' equally great 'The Thing From Another World' - revolves around a group of men trapped in an ice station during a blizzard. To make matters worse, a shape shifting alien is hidden among them. Much paranoia, tension and violence ensues.Carpenter's special effects range from excellent to hokey, and he does dwell on them a bit too much, but his cast – especially Kurt Russell in the lead – are what really keeps us riveted.8/10 – Like 'Alien', this is essentially a peek-a-boo haunted house movie, Ridley Scott's lavish environments replaced with better characters, dialogue and arguably more tension. Like most films which rely on easy spooks, the film is a bit too shallow and schematic. Worth two viewings.",Null,1,6,14 July 2010
Lilo & Stitch," Cute, but needlessly violent
","'Lilo and Stitch' is one of the better Disney flicks released in recent years. Some points...1. The film eschews CGI in favour for traditional hand drawn cell animation and a palette of beautiful water colours (water colour backgrounds haven't been used by Disney since the 1940s).2. The plot is a merger of 'Critters' and 'ET', in which a little girl befriends an alien and learns various life lessons. Though at times generic, the film has enough interesting flourishes to differentiate it from most other Disney flicks.3. The alien at the heart of the picture is not a cutesy creature, but a military weapon designed to destroy planets. Half the fun of the picture is watching this thing crawling about, cleverly adapting to situations and juggling its biological need to destroy with that of self-preservation.4. The character of Lilo is not your typical Disney kid, but a truly bizarre little girl who mutters matter-of-fact statements about a fish who controls the weather and a stuffed doll whose days are numbered because a bug laid eggs in its ear.5. The film tries hard to mimic the style and tone of Hayao Miyazaki, but doesn't quite manage.6. There's some neat psychology in the film. Stitch is like the embodiment of Lilo's self-destructiveness, her need to destroy everything, lashing out because she's an outcast and lost her parents in an accident. By taming Stitch, Lilo tames her own inner turmoil.7. Like 'ET', the alien is a sort of surrogate family member who heals the family unit.8. The opening coda and the final act are weak. You have a nice character study here, which is constantly being sabotaged by erroneous crap. Less action scenes and more drama would have turned this into something special. IE – 'My Neighbour Totoro'.9. The opening credit sequence is great.10. The film has (typical for Disney) two annoying, motor-mouthed characters, and the film too often resorts to violence to solve its problems.7.5/10 – Great in parts, but fizzles out.Worth one viewing.",Null,2,5,14 June 2010
Armageddon," Bruce Willis destroys deadly rock, audience angry that Affleck survives
","'Armageddon' finds humanity attempting to avoid a giant stone, which is ironic, considering the film was released by Touchstone Pictures. What the hell Touchstone? Why the mixed message? Other contradictions abound: 'Armageddon' is about giant oil companies and nuclear weapons saving the planet, which according to my High School science teacher, is exactly the opposite of what oil men and nuclear weapons do. Who do I trust? My science teacher, or director Michael Bay, whose middle name is Shallow and whose mental bays are routinely lapped by waves of total bull****.Bizarrely, the film stars Bruce Willis, who is way cool, and Ben Affleck, who destroys cool. They cancel each other out, leaving behind Bay's direction, which is great if you like epilepsy. Hilariously, the film finds two spaceships, the Independence and the Freedom, saving the planet form a giant asteroid. Yes, this literally is a film about blue-collar American oil-workers saving the world via Independence, Freedom and nuclear weapons. It's also narrated by Charlton Heston, who loves guns and thinks multiculturalism ruins democracy. Nice.The film was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, the Michael Bolton of movie producers. He makes jingoistic sledgehammer movies, one of his earliest being the super cool 'Top Gun', which had enough rock-n-roll machismo to impregnate a battalion of house wives and which cast Tom Cruise as a sexy American Nazi. Sweet.'Armageddon' climaxes with intense stuff guaranteed to get you totally pumped. The fecal matter really collides with the cooling appliance, though, when we realise that Bruce Willis, who is way cool, must sacrifice himself to save the planet. He's so brave. F**k you Affleck.Aesthetically, 'Armageddon' looks like a Budweiser commercial mating with a Levis billboard. It paints a back-lit corporate fantasy of rural and urban America, a land of overalls, proud faces, checkers games on the main square, couples necking in Chevrolet convertibles, and flapping American flags. A giant advertisement for itself, the film is a testosterone soaked celebration of white, male, American values. You know, like military might, Bon Jovi, strip clubs, oil fields, apple pie, Norman Rockwell and the ultra smoking Liv Tyler, offspring of an Aerosmith lead singer and an Elfish Queen.

He Got Game," Most of My Heroes Don't Appear On a Stamp
","A morality tale by Spike Lee, 'He Got Game' stars Denzel Washington as Jake, a convict who attempts to reconnect with his basketball star son. But are Jake's intentions pure or is he, like everyone else in Lee's film, attempting to profit off his son's newfound fame? 'He Got Game' is cartoonish, heavy-handed and awkwardly juggles satire and neorealism. It's also filled with countless powerful sequences, most of which are simple conversations involving Washington. Elsewhere Jake connects with a white prostitute (Milla Jovovich), his relationship with her recalling those who attempt to seduce his own son. Everyone's a sycophant, manoeuvring for a dollar, trading false smiles and falser platitudes. When the black man gets money, the leaches come out.Like most of Lee's films, 'Game' individualises problems. Integrity, temptation, loyalty etc are seen to be problems to be personally negotiated and not symptoms of a wider social failing; do the right thing, Lee believes, and everything will be alright. Broadening the film's themes are the film's signature song, Public Enemy's 'He Got Game'. 'Damn the game if it ain't saying nothing,' their lyrics proclaim, before advising Lee's heroes to 'pay attention to the game behind the game', in which 'the devil makes the rules' and 'folk don't own themselves but pay mental rent to presidents'. Lee would immortalise Public Enemy in 'Do The Right Thing' many years earlier, though again their lyrics ('Fight the Power') were out of sync with Lee's reductive message of individual responsibility.'Game' stars NBA's Ray Allen as Jake's son, a bit of casting which lends the film's court sessions extra authenticity. As is typical of Lee, the film's women are poorly written, except for a character played by Rosario Dawson. She's your archetypal temptress, but only, Lee makes it clear, because nobody else is looking out for her financial future. Presumably this justifies all the product placement in the film, as well as Lee's infamous side-career, marketing overpriced Nikes to inner-city blacks.It's Denzel who really elevates things, though. The man with the coolest walk in showbiz, 'Game' soars whenever Washtingon is on screen. Unfortunately it's a performance which Lee constantly undermines with unnecessary pyrotechnics. Lee is a man of excess. Denzel is too, but he's cool. Lee wishes he were.7.9/10 – Veers from powerful to terrible.

North by Northwest," My wives divorced me. Said I led too dull a life
","Alfred Hitchcock directs 'North by Northwest', a loose remake of 'The 39 Steps' and 'Saboteur', two earlier thrillers by the director. The film opens with a now iconic title sequence by Saul Bass, complete with a pulse pounding Bernard Herrmann score. The angular, diagonal lines of Bass' sequence then transition into a series of bustling New York City shots, followed by the brisk introduction of Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant), a high flying advertising executive. Opening scenes stress Thronhill's past alcoholism and propensity for lying. This is the film's great 'boy who cried wolf' joke: the film's about an untrustworthy advertising executive (who lies for a living) being repeatedly ignored when telling the truth.Hitch started his movie career in 1919, designing graphics and cards for Lasky Studios. After three years as an assistant director he directed his first feature film, 'The Pleasure Garden', in Munich Germany. This was a British/German co-production, a collaboration which led to the director slowing absorbing traits from the then burgeoning German Expressionist Movement, a movement which fed off a rise in existential philosophy and various post WW1 crises. Hitch would then direct a series of silent thrillers, in which he slowly evolved his own very distinct style. This style typically mixed a little expressionism with pop modernism, high fashion and early 20th century advertising/graphic design. The demands of silent thrillers also instilled in Hitch a strong sense of pace, cutting and visual economy. At his best his films are clean, sleek and fast, whilst also oozing a gloriously operatic kind of BIG MELODRAMA, which runs almost counter to their machine-like dispassion.These conflicting traits are all found in 'North by Northwest'. It's at once Hitchcock's most famous thriller, and his longest, most lazily paced. Its at once an expressionist nightmare, and a slapstick popcorn comedy built around Cary Grant's own slapstick past. Its at once a lean silent thriller, and a bloated big budget production. These contrasts lend the film an interesting quality, but would also negatively influence over a century of copycat Hollywood thrillers which trawl for demographics and try madly to be everything to everyone all at once. Every year 'Northwest' is released a couple dozen times under a different name, some new running man wrongly accused of something whilst tracking down a McGuffin in an attempt to solve some completely arbitrary problem. In each case the objective is the same: to construct a roller coaster plot which exists solely to facilitate action scenes.Francois Truffaut picked up on this decades ago: 'The most appealing aspect of these sequences is that they're totally gratuitous. [...] It's a scene that's been drained of all plausibility or even significance. But it's precisely that gratuity - which you're criticised for - that gives the scene all of its interest and strength. How can anyone object to gratuity when it's so clearly deliberate?' Truffaut's talking about an audacious, drawn-out, near-silent 'crop duster sequence' in 'Northwest', which Hitchcock elevates to something special. Today, though, with the rise of set-piece cinema, virtually everything's gratuitous. Still, you can't blame Hitch for his children. 'Northwest' is itself less dumb action movie than some kind of ornate, pop-modernist artifact; it's more vase than movie. Hitchcock's lines are clean, his colour coordination superb, and everything seems oh so neatly arranged. The film's art director was Robert Boyle, who in collaboration with Hitchcock gave the film its distinct look, with Frank Lloyd Wright houses, some Beaux-Art and lots of early 20th century MidWestern architecture, complete with hipped roofs, horizontal bands and ornamental rock walls. Hitchcock's aesthetic captures a kind of early 20th century American optimism; faith in industry, modernism, technology, slick ergonomics, money, decor, furnishings, top Industrial Designers (Henry Dreyfuss) and finery, even if they thematically say something else.Hitchcock saw 'Northwest' primarily as a comedy ('To me it was one big joke. I practise absurdity religiously; I wanted Grant in Lincoln's nostril'), Truffaut as a nightmare, to which Hithcock also agreed ('I'm ill at ease with the ordinary'). But the film's also very very sexy, thanks to screenwriter Ernest Lehman, who wanted to write the 'ultimate Hitchcock thriller' and who gives the film lots of risqué banter between Cary Grant and actress Eva Marie Saint.The film goes some interesting places, has some fabulous shots (an overhead, external shot of the United Nations Building kills you) and set pieces, but it's also mostly a bubblegum plot with a now dated finale, stiff/old hero, bad rear-projection, corny jokes and some dull conversations. The film's title is a reference to Shakespeare's 'Hamlet': 'I am but mad north-north-west,' Hamlet says, epitomising Thronhill's own anxieties. Of course no north-northwest exists on the compass. It's a metaphor which implies that Thornhill, like Hamlet, is a little out of tune.Like 'The Man Who Knew Too Much', much of the film plays with identities, charades, performances and role playing; everyone's pretending to be someone else, unsure who they or others are and appearances are constantly deceptive. Cold War paranoia – the film's about foreign spies and US counterintelligence – infuses everything, the film portraying rotten government bodies who callously throw lives away and who nurse paranoia at the expense of ordinary civilians. This is all encapsulated by climactic scenes in which our heroes dangle from the stony, uncaring faces of Presidents (a return to the climax of 'Saboteur'). As if to punctuate the point, Hitchcock slips into the cast, unbilled, several victims of the blacklist (Joseph Wiseman etc).All of Hitch's films have psycho-sexual weirdness. Here Eva's mid-film betrayal of Thronhill only echoes his own misogynistic past. She turns Thronhill's sarcasm and suspicions back on him, though they do eventually fall in love. Grant's character, incidentally, is constantly being mistaken for a federal agent. He played one in Hitchcock's 'Notorious'. Maybe that explains it.8/10 - Worth two viewings.",Null,1,2,21 November 2012
Knowing," Beware the solar flare
","Alex Proyas plunges further into mediocrity with 'Knowing', a film that pretends to be science fiction but is really a slice of Christian evangelism.Nicholas Cage plays John Koestler, a professor who has recently lost his wife in a car accident. Because of this tragic event, John no longer believes in God; the universe is vile and uncaring, he muses. Koestler's son Caleb, however, refuses to adopt this atheistic belief, and believes instead that his mother is alive and well in 'heaven'. Caleb's refusal to 'listen' to his father's beliefs is symbolised by his partial deafness and his need to wear a hearing aid. Equally heavy-handed is the fact that this hearing aid allows the kid to receive messages from God-like alien beings called the Whisperers. In other words, the kid is deaf to the sacrilegious ways of mortal man, but attentive to the teachings of God.More subtle are the names of the two central characters. Caleb, of course, is named after a famous character in the Hebrew Bible, a figure noted for his steadfast faith in God when the Hebrews refused to enter the promised land of Canaan. In ancient languages the name Caleb itself means 'Servant of the Lord'. In contrast, Nicholas Cage's character (John Koestler) seems to have been named after Arthur Koestler, author of 'The Roots of Coincidence', one of the first books to deal seriously with synchronicity, a concept that Cage's character wrestles with in the film.'Knowing' ends with the news that a solar flare will destroy all surface life on earth. Because they don't wish for all life to perish, the Whisperers, who resemble angelic beings, send down spaceships to 'save' those 'chosen few' who can 'hear their voices'. These 'chosen ones' are taken up to a new planet which resembles a heavenly utopia. Here they roam about this hokey landscape, playing in the grass and frolicking with white rabbits. Proyas perhaps intends to imply that this new race of 'saved ones' will go forth and multiply like rabid rabbits, but the effect is more humorous than profound.Meanwhile John, denied entry into heaven, remains on earth. With the solar flare approaching, Earth turns into a literal Hell, flames everywhere, buildings on fire and the skies boiling red. Proyas even goes so far as to throw in brief shots of scantily dressed civilians partying and running about like morons, Earth now becoming some kind of catchment area for the hedonistic, orgy loving, pseudo satanic MTV generation. It's all quite stupid.So what we basically have here is a retelling of the apocalyptic events prophesied in the New Testament book of Revelations. Armageddon becomes a solar flare, faith in God becomes 'the knowing', Whisperers become angels, white doves become white rabbits and Nicholas Cage becomes an atheist whilst his kid becomes a child of God who is saved from judgement by his steadfast belief in an odd blend of Christianity and New Age pseudo-scientific mysticism. There are also allusions to the 'white stone' and 'new names' prophesied in Revelations, though here they become mysterious black pebbles.Ignoring the silly religious tone of the picture, the film fails to work as a conventional thriller. Proyas demonstrated that he is incapable of using CGI in 'I, Robot' and here his FX work is equally ridiculous. A dream sequence features silly CGI animals, a plane crash looks wholly fake, a subway disaster looks like a poor imitations of a similar sequence in 'Speed' and the final act 'apocalypse' and 'heaven' sequences look like cheesy outtakes from Keanu Reeves' 'Constantine'.A far better film which tackles a similar message (ie - a wholly regressive message) is M. Night Shyamalan's 'Signs'. Shyamalan, himself a Christian, tells virtually the same story, only he refuses to use CGI and is a bit more restrained. Whatever his limitations, Shyamalan knows the power of imagination. More importantly, he knows that some things just cannot be rendered effectively on screen. Afterall, how can one imagine the unimaginable? How can one communicate, conceive and concretize something that is unknown, unknowable and inconceivable? In film, those who attempt to literalize these things tend to immediately render them trite. It is this lazy need to communicate everything directly with CGI, from the hokey heaven sequence at the end of 'Knowing', to the revelation of the aliens at the end of 'War of the Worlds', to the flying bubbles of 'The Fountain', to the hellish landscapes of 'Constantine', that often sabotages these 'high concept' modern scifi flicks. Incidentally, 'Knowing's' screenplay was written by Stuart Hazeldine, whose first short film was titled 'Christian5/10 – A cross between 'Final Destination', 'Signs' and 'ET', with a sprinkle of the same hokey new age mysticism of 'Close Encounters', 'Knowing' works best in its first act. The film contains one great sequence in which a child sleeps at night whilst 'aliens' watch over him.",Null,0,1,30 August 2009
Hugo," Video Killed the Radio Star
","Martin Scorsese directs 'Hugo', a film based on Brian Selznick's 'The Invention of Hugo Cabret'.A giant metaphor for Scorsese's love for cinema, 'Hugo' stars Asa Butterfield as Hugo, an abandoned kid who discovers that Georges Melies, the famous pioneer and film-maker, is 'not really dead'. Melies' career, we later learn, was a career of 'wonder', 'magic' and 'enchantment', but one which was nevertheless 'killed off' by the 'violence' and 'realism' of Europe's many protracted wars. Reality and blunt violence, then, supplanted the magic and innocence of Melies, a magic which Hugo symbolically reanimates, thereby resuscitating cinema. For Scorsese, cinema lives, cannot be killed and is periodically reinvigorated by the mix of technical wizardry, nostalgia and youthful longing which Hugo represents. 'I'm fixed now!' characters state throughout 'Hugo', a nod to a cinema which heals, enchants and fills hearts with love! That a 170 million dollar, CGI suffused, archaically scripted 3D movie directed by a guy who uses violence like piano keys is simultaneously championing the cause of cinematic revolution, film preservation, innocence and the charms of 19th century silent films, is an irony completely lost on Scorsese.'Hugo' is at its best when it's mapping the nooks and crannies of the giant train station in which Hugo lives. Scorsese also paints a number of nice early 20th century buildings and promenades, though bad CGI lighting, digital matte paintings and excessive green screens occasionally hamper things; the film awkwardly juggles realism and high fantasy, and Scorsese's many CGI assisted long takes are less impressive than he realises. Beyond this the film contains a number of homages to early cinema (Keaton, Chaplin, Lang, the Lumiere Brothers, Renoir's 'The Beast' etc), though modern audiences raised on touchpads and Wi-Fi will have no time for this. Nostalgia today goes only as far back as an internet browser refresh tab.Some have criticised 'Hugo's' happy ending, but such an ending is in keeping with the film's resurrection project. Ironically, the real Melies was forced into bankruptcy by the French and American studio systems, forces which pushed him into become a toy salesman in a train station. This is itself the fate of most post-war film-makers, including Scorsese, most eventually warped into unwitting toy pushers.Everything 'Hugo' does, Scorsese would do better with 'A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies'. Elswhere the film's many shots of kids scampering behind walls and woodwork recalls Hiromasa Yonebayashis superior 'Arrietty', whilst its themes and metaphors pale next to the recent 'Ratatouille', Brad Bird's kid-friendly examination of art, artists (also hiding behind woodwork) and their social function, good or bad.Incidentally, love-letters to cinema tend to either celebrate the camaraderie of film-making ('Bowfinger', 'Ed Wood', 'A Prairie Home Companion', 'Limelight'), or critique the tawdriness of the audience's relationship with the screen ('Vertigo', 'Rear Window', 'Contempt', 'Phantom of the Paradise', Cronenberg, Lynch etc). Others ('Cinema Paradiso') celebrate both the screen's powers of illusion and its ability to immortalise precious moments. 'Hugo' exists in none of these camps. It's emblematic of a bad romance, big, blunt and intent on bludgeoning its audience into submission.5/10 – Worth one viewing.",Null,3,5,7 February 2014
Heartbreak Ridge," Who's the leader of this club that's made for you and me?
","'The de facto role of the United States Armed Forces will be to keep the world safe for our economy and open to our cultural assault. To those ends, we will do a fair amount of killing.' - Lt. Colonel Ralph Peters 'The weaker and poorer a country is, the more dangerous it is as an example. If Grenada can succeed in bringing about a better life for its people, some other place that has more resources will eventually ask, 'why not us?'' - Chomsky Clint Eastwood stars in and directs 'Heartbreak Ridge', a dumb propaganda film about US military actions in Grenada. Made with Pentagon support and constructed in the mould of 1950s war films (particularly 'Take the High Ground' and 'Sands of Iwo Jima'), most of which saw tough-guy Sergeants (John Wayne, Richard Whitmark) grooming misfits for war, the film stars Clint Eastwood as Gunnery Sergeant Highway, a no-nonsense warrior who takes a band of delinquents and builds them up into hard-as-nails killers.All the genre's clichés are here: Highway is the tough daddy disciplinarian whom the group slowly learn to love, his grunts are all rebels and misfits who learn to 'heroically' do their duty, and high ranking military men outside of Highway are presented as being inept goof-balls. As is the case with all these films, the very non-conformity of Highway and his boys – their supposed dissidence and 'individuality' in the face of state ideology – disguises/facilitates their absolute conformity.'Ridge' climaxes with Operation Urgent Fury, the 1983 US invasion of Grenada. Before this the film shamelessly parrots the line of Pentagon spin-doctors. Eastwood and his grunts do not invade the tiny island of Grenada, instead they 'go to Grenada to rescue US tourists, school kids and students' from 'evil soldiers'. One must remember that the official pretext for invading Grenada back in the 1980s was 'the protection of American lives', specifically 800 students at the US run St George's University of Medicine. In reality none of the students were in danger, none wanted to leave and the invasion was actually designed to oust Maurice Bishop, the people's revolutionary who rallied the islands few thousand inhabitants against Prime Minister Erich Gairy. Within months Bishop had put in place policies which irked Carter and Reagan, who were all at the time busy overthrowing/assassinating similar democratically elected leaders and/or left-wing movements in Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Latin America.Bishop achieved more in a few months than anyone expected, Grenada reaching a 9 percent cumulative growth rate, unemployment dropping from 50 to 14 percent, agriculture diversified, cooperatives developed, imports dropping from 40 to 25 percent as a result of sustainability measures, literacy rates jumping to 98 percent, a free education and health system being established, the number of schools tripling and various industrial programs set in motion.At the time, Grenada's turn-around was praised by the World Bank. But Carter would adopt an adversarial attitude and put in place a program to assassinate Bishop and isolate the tiny Caribbean island. And so the UN Mission in Grenada is bugged, Bishop's party is infiltrated by the CIA, Western media begins to spread propaganda with the aim of discouraging tourists, the CIA begins a destabilisation program and rumours are spread about Soviet submarine, missile and air bases being present on the island. As far as the public is concerned, the tiny island of Grenada is a rouge, terrorist state. When all these rumours are debunked by journalists leading up to the invasion, the major news chains refuse to air retractions. Meanwhile the CIA begins planting bombs at local rallies, inadvertently kills several civilians and sets about trying to weaken the island's economy. This goes on for roughly 4 years.Prior to the invasion, The CIA begins to sew discord in Bishop's Party. Bernard Coard, Bishop's childhood friend and co-revolutionary, begins to break away from Bishop. Coard stages a coup and arrests Bishop, but Bishop is set free by a crowd of some 10,000 Grenadians, all staunch supporters. In response Coard's men apparently massacred Bishop and his closest followers. To this date no one knows where the orders came from and who committed the murders. Coard blames the CIA, the CIA blames Coard. Coard is a free man today. Gairy was given diplomatic immunity in the US. Coard's actions were used as a pretext to invade the island; these plans were drawn up years earlier.To facilitate the invasion the US constructs an unbelievable hoax in which it is stated that the Organizaton of Eastern Caribbean States had asked the US to invade the backwater island in order to 'protect other Caribbean islands from Grenadian aggression'. The invasion takes place, its date of execution designed to distract the public from American casualties and failed US policy in Lebanon (250 US troops dead days earlier). Declassified documents would reveal that US bombing runs systematically targeted Grenadian factories; one of the first targets was a canning plant which helped Grenadians can their own food (rather than relying on foreign companies).The Pentagon claims that 'weapons of mass destruction were found', which are years later revealed to be rifles manufactured in the 1870s and two Bren guns circa 1950. The US puts in place an interim government, rigged courts and tribunals are set up to assign blame, lawyers and judges are paid hush money, neoliberal polices are put in place to favour foreign investment, state enterprises are given over to foreign private interests and modern consumer capitalism is officially brought to Grenada. In 1991 the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights find that throughout this pantomime the US Government under Carter and Reagan had violated a slew of laws and articles. The report was released when US F16s were bombing Baghdad.4/10 – Worth one viewing for the always-cool Clint Eastwood. See instead 'Full Metal Jacket' and Cox's 'Walker'.",Null,16,29,18 July 2012
Salt," The Fugitive
","'Salt' adheres to the 'running man' formula ('The Fugitive', 'Chain Reaction', 'The Incredible Hulk', 'Minority Report', 'The Bourne Identity', 'Enemy of the State', 'The Sentinel', 'The Bourne Identity', 'Eraser', 'US Marshals' etc), which Hitchcock refined in such films as 'Saboteur', 'Foreign Correspondent', 'The 39 Steps' and 'North By Northwest'. In each case the film's hero is on the run, falsely accused of a crime which he or she must solve whilst being pursued. The entire 'running man' plot is itself a MacGuffin, our hero jumping from set piece to set piece as he or she attempts to piece together his puzzle.The good thing about this formula is that you don't need expensive set pieces or elaborate stories. The plot itself generates tension; the actors need only ride the wave. Amusingly, almost all of these films find a way of fitting in a scene in which the good guys and bad guys face off through a (usually bullet proof) glass wall or door. As the genre revolves around heroes in flight from pursuers, the only way to get the two dramatically together and not have the film end is to slip a piece of glass in between them.The film's plot is inconsequential – dated Cold War nonsense, in which actress Angelina Jolie saves the world from nuclear annihilation – but that doesn't matter. It's all about movement, speed and the thrill of pursuit. The film was directed by Phillip Noyce, who made two better espionage pictures with 'Patriot Games' and 'Clear and Present Danger'.7.9/10 – worth one viewing.",Null,3,5,18 May 2011
Duck Soup," Hail, Freedonia!
","'I got a good mind to join a club and beat you over the head with it!' - Groucho MarxDirected by Leo McCarey, 'Duck Soup' finds the Marx Brothers, a troupe of madcap comedians, running delightfully amok. The film takes place the same year as Hitler's appointment in Germany, an event which coincides with Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho Marx) being appointed the ruler of the fictitious land of Freedonia. Unsurprisingly, Firefly, who wakes up with a cigar in his mouth, descends from his bedroom via a firefighter's pole and executes civilians to the tune of 'pop goes the weasel!', is a fascist, the land of Freedonia (the name is a pun – there's no freedom in Freedonia) linked to fascist Italy, Germany and, with the use of Patriotic American tunes, Depression Era America.Much of the film revolves around an escalating war between Freedonia and a neighbouring country called Sylvania. This allows the film to indulge in, not only the usual Marx Brothers jokes (much anarchy, absurdity, puns, sight gags, one liners etc), but some funny political satire. And so there are digs at fascism, jingoism, deranged warmongering, an antiwar vein in which war movie heroics are spoofed, a condemnation of the judicial system, patriotism and even religion, as evidenced in Groucho's song 'We got guns, they got guns, all God's chillun got guns!' The film's satire even goes all the way up to the White House, especially with this quote spoken by Groucho: 'And remember while you're out there risking life and limb through shot and shell, we'll be in here thinking what a sucker you are.'9/10 – One of cinema's first antiwar satires, 'Duck Soup' is essentially a precursor to 'Dr Strangelove'. Charlie Chaplin tried to follow in 'Duck Soup's' footsteps seven years later with 'The Great Dictator', but couldn't quite top the Brothers' brand of rapid fire banter. Unsurprisingly, 'Duck Soup' was treated with scorn upon initial release. Its reputation took time to grow.",Null,2,3,16 September 2010
Apocalypse Now," This was a valued rug
","Francis Ford Coppola, once the most praised and powerful director in Hollywood, entered the Southeast Asian jungle to make a movie. Armed with Joseph Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness', a small army of technicians, and a 15 million dollar budget, he emerged ten months later with thousands of hours of footage, two nearly dead actors and a nervous breakdown.The cause of all this personal trauma was 'Apocalypse Now', a film in which Martin Sheen is sent up a river and into the jungles of Vietnam to find Colonel Walter Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a Special Forces officer who has gone insane.Conrad's message was that savagery and apathy can wipe out the fragile gains of civilization within a single generation. A thin line stands between civilization and total collapse. Inject a little bit of barbarism, a little bit of chaos, and everything falls apart. Coppola's film tries to build on this, and states that America's inability to relinquish the trappings of civilization (ie- to get out of the boat), ensured its defeat. We lost because we weren't, as a nation, prepared to commit genocide. We committed horrors, but we weren't prepared to go all the way.The biggest problem with 'Apocalypse Now' is that it was written by John Milius, the pro-war, gun toting ultra conservative whom the Coen Brother's based their character Walter Sobchak (from 'The Big Lebowski') on. At the end of Milius' script, Kurtz and Willard team up to fight America. They represent the warrior savage, free from hypocrisy but lost in the darkness.Coppola, of course, found Milius' script largely silly. He removed Milius' violent ending and went in search of something more powerful. For some grand statement on war and human nature. But he found none. How could he? You can't paddle down a straight line for 10 months and then suddenly expect to reach a new destination.Throughout the film, 'Apocalypse Now' tells us one thing, but shows us something else. The Colonel Kilgores of the picture actually fight the war, whilst the powerful warrior God, Col Kurtz, does little beside chopping the limbs off natives or hiding in the shadows. Milius' script saw Kurtz as the hero. A wise and seasoned rebel warrior who sticks his fingers up to the hypocritical veneer of civilization, but Coppola seems unwilling to go down that route. Coppola's 'redux' cut of the film, though badly paced, is more interesting. It adds a French plantation scene which attempts to contrast the French period of colonial rule with America's war in Vietnam. The problem with this is that US involvement in Vietnam and the Colonial mindset of nineteenth century Europe, as seen in 'Heart of Darkness', are completely different. American policy wasn't inspired by colonial aims but by ideological ones. The American experience in Vietnam was the opposite of Conrad's colonial experience. No wonder Coppola couldn't find a suitable ending. There isn't one. Late in the film, Kurtz accuses his country of hypocrisy. They are unwilling to fully embrace the darkness. If he were given a small army of savages, he says, then the war would be over tomorrow. The implication is that the Vietnamese were nothing more than barbaric savages who should be dealt with, not civility, but primal brutality.Worse yet, Coppola's 'war' is one of gorgeous cinematography and exciting spectacle. When a Vietnamese village is raided, it feels more like the Death Star trench run than a savage massacre. Killgore himself is a figure of fun rather than the monster he should be. Milius' script painted a much darker character (hence kill and gore).Still, 'Apocalypse Now' may contain no truths about Vietnam or war in general, but it is a film absolutely dripping with passion. Like 'Aguirre, the Wrath of God', 'Apocalypse Now' is very much a Werner Herzog film. Herzog was a mad artist who wanted to lift a boat over a mountain. Why lift the boat over the mountain? No reason. He simply wanted to do it in the name of art!Same thing with Coppola. He wanted to do 'somthing' great. He went into the jungle, went insane and came out with a couple thousand hours of mad footage. What is the merit of this footage? The merit is in surviving the journey. In making it down the river and back out again.And so what we have is a film about its creators. A film about the madness of the white man. The madness of the director. The madness of the crew. Ironically, the film's madness is all a result of indulgence. The indulgence of a staggering budget, studio leeway, accessible drugs, limitless resources and a giant ego. It's the shallowest kind of insanity. The insanity of unlimited power and a lack of boundaries.8/10 - 'Apocalypse Now' ultimately amounts to nothing more than a series of memorable set-pieces. These set pieces don't enrich one another or gel in any way. It's an incomplete film, and even Coppola admits that he didn't quite know what he was doing or tying to say. The film goes up the river but doesn't know why.Far more interesting is 'Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse', a documentary shot in tandem with the film. As a study in ego-maniacal madness it's far more powerful than Coppola's film. Narrated by Coppola's wife, it's also very intimate and perceptive. It's also interesting to see how much Coppola relied on Brando's improvisational skills, hoping desperately that the great actor would whip up some kind of climax out of thin air. Brando, of course, was just in it for the huge pay cheque.Though a failure, this film is worth multiple viewings.",Null,6,9,19 August 2008
The Battle of Algiers," A Powerful Film
","'A revolution only lasts fifteen years, a period which coincides with the effectiveness of a generation.' - José Ortega Gasset Using hand held cameras, non professional actors and grainy film-stock, director Gillo Pontecorvo's 'The Battle of Algiers' attempts to recreate the brutal urban phase of the French-Algerian war. Covering the period from roughly 1954 to 1957, the film is a masterclass in cinema verite. Indeed, the film seemed so 'realistic' when it first premiered, that audiences had to be reminded with a disclaimer that it wasn't a documentary.Proudly anti-colonialist, the film focuses on the Muslim Quarter of Algiers, also known as the Casbah, where a group of resistance fighters mobilize and fight against the French. But though we sympathise with the small band of revolutionaries and share their desire for independence (Pontecorvo deftly shows the injustices suffered by the Algerians under French rule), 'The Battle of Algiers' is careful not to romanticise its rebels. Their bombs kill civilians, they murder innocents, and at times they are more savage than the French.Ben M'Hidi, the leader of the resistance, himself articulates his disdain for violence. 'Acts of violence don't win wars,' he says. 'Terrorism is useful as a start. But then, the people themselves must act. That's the rational behind this strike: to mobilize all Algerians, to assess our strength.' Today the film resonates with current events in the Middle East to such an extent that the US Defence Department screened 'Algiers' at the outset of the Iraq invasion. What's sickening is that the Defence Department uses the film as a tool to teach how to clamp down on armed resistance. The film's larger point seems to have gone unnoticed by those in Power, the US' colonialist actions, be they in Iraq, Vietnam, or across much of Latin America and Asia over the past century, echoing France's actions in this film.More interesting, though, are the documentaries included on the film's recently released Criterion DVD. In one documentary, Pontecorvo revisits Algeria in an effort to see how far the country has come since its independence. Unfortunately, he is disappointed with what he sees.As oil revenues declined in the late 80s, Algeria's governing regime no longer had the funds to bolster its dreams of modernization. As a result, an increasingly disillusioned middle class (despite a rise in university degrees, there was little upward mobility as many of the prestigious jobs were still held by the French) turned to more extreme Islamist parties who promised to return Algeria to its 'Islamic roots'. The ideals of these extremists were at complete odds with the FLN (The Front De Liberation Nationale), the coalition of rebels we see defeating the French in the film. The FLN, though they relied on religious forces and symbols to mobilize the population behind the cause of independence, ultimately viewed religion from a utilitarian perspective, sufficient for mass mobilization but inadequate as a template for governance.So with faith in the FLN shattered, voters turned to more extreme parties, all of whom threatened to create a kind of totalitarian form of Islam. And it is this which Pontecorvo seems to fear the most. With the engineered destruction of Marxism-Lenism, fundamentalist Islam became the world's leading anti-American ideology. The US, ironically, has been the largest supporter of psycho Islamic movements. From their perspective, better psycho dictators in power, than actual egalitarian movements. So the Algeria Pontecorvo revisits seems to be one that has shut itself off from the world and become deeply suspicious of foreigners and non-Muslims. It is a country faced with many economic and social problems, suspicious of all 'western styled' government models. (Pontecorvo's doc was made in the late 80s. Today Algeria has shrugged off its nationalist roots and embraced the free market)Of course Pontecorvo makes it clear in the documentary that there is a distinction between Islam (a religion) and fundamentalist Islam (an ideology). One can oppose the ideology while respecting the faith. Secondly, he stresses that meaningful change is always slow. When asked about women being forced to wear veils and the terrible economic problems in some areas, the director states that it will take decades of revolution for things to improve. The point he makes is not to interfere. To let people decide their own fate and forge their own national identities.8.5/10 – Though its 'documentarian' style lacks the power it once had, and though realist works always suffer from a certain directness (everything communicated bluntly, little to ponder or absorb after etc), this is a powerful and influential film. Pontecorvo followed 'Algiers' up with 'Burn!', an even greater picture. See Costa Gavras' 'Z'. Worth two viewings.",Null,1,2,17 December 2009
Edward Scissorhands," The Porcupine's Dilemma
","'For a community made up of so many freakish outsiders, Hollywood's oddly conservative.' - Tim Burton Tim Burton directs 'Edward Scissorhands'. The film stars the chameleonic Johnny Depp as Edward, an odd man-child who was created in a spooky castle by an elderly inventor, played by horror maestro Vincent Price (in what would become his last film role). Edward's based on Burton's own life as an angst-filled loner growing up in Burbank California. Misperceived, ostracised and constantly brooding, he created Edward as a teenager, the character's scissor hands (he's literally unable to get close to anyone) emblematic of Burton's feelings of isolation, his inability to connect with others, and the misconception others placed upon him. Cute.Burton worked with Price earlier on 'Vincent', and clearly adores the actor, or rather, what the actor is associated with; expressionism, classic B movies, early horror films etc. 'Edward Scissorhands', with its popcorn Gothicism, Expressionism and Surrealism (Lang, Murnau and most of all Czech surrealist Jan Svankmajer, are huge influences on Burton), itself borrows liberally from 'Frankenstein', 'Beauty and the Beast', 'The Cabinet of Dr Caligari', 'Elephant Man', 'The Phantom of the Opera' and 'The Hunchback of Notre-Dame', and is arguably better than the filmed versions of each. It's an ugly tucking tale, but Burton puts his own spin on things and doesn't overreach; his film stays on the level of a simple children's tale, very whimsical, magical and charming. The film's memorable score is by Danny Elfman, though Burton initially approached Robert Smith of the English Gothic Rock band 'The Cure' to do the soundtrack. Edward, and even Burton in real life, strongly looks like Smith. Not so cute.'Hold me,' a character played by actress Winona Ryder whispers. 'I cant,' Edward cries. The couple spend the film caught in the porcupine's dilemma, someone getting hurt whenever they get close. As is typical of these films (see 'Elephant Man' et all), the 'townsfolk' and 'angry locals' who 'bully' our 'ugly duckling hero' are ridiculously caricatural. They're a horde of dumb bad guys who, reminiscent of the final scenes in James Whale's 'Frankenstein', arbitrarily decide to pick on poor Edward, form a gang and run him out of town. In response Edward, like Quasimodo and The Phantom of the Opera, flees and consigns himself to a tower overlooking regular folk. Ryder's character then spends the rest of her life lost in a lover's lament, missing the scissor man who stole her heart. The film's bookends are magical, Burton's tale offered as an explanation to a sleeping child as to why snow falls from the sky. Snowflakes, we learn, are essentially 'the sadness' of our hero, Edward, as he carves ice sculptures from the mountaintops of the love he never had. Coppola would cast Winona Ryder in his 'Dracula' film some years later, recognising the similarities in her role here with the classic damsels of horror-tales past.While Edward is essentially a cyborg, the film portrays him more as a 'monster' or 'freak'. Tod Browning's hugely influential 'Freaks' is its granddaddy (also the ancestor of Lynch's 'Elephant Man'), as Burton goes to great lengths to draw parallels between suburban life and horror movies. All these films attempt to simultaneously 'humanize' the monster whilst revealing the monstrosity of normative, non-disabled society. Edward may be part Frankenstein, part Freddy Kruger, but the townspeople living around him are themselves torn straight out of a John Waters or David Lynch ('Blue Velvet') freak-show, all regular people painted in such a light as to seem grotesque and hideous. Even their surroundings are freakish, 'normal' towns and homes exhibiting a plethora of kitschy artifacts (1950s interior decorating and costuming) and garish colour schemes. Burton also goes to lengths to highlight the clockwork routines of the townsfolk; their stifling conformity and machine-like normative lives. Meanwhile, everyone treats Edward's existence as a disability or a correctable medical condition, recommending various doctors or quick-fix solutions to 'rectify' his 'incomplete state'. Unsurprisingly, regular folk only grow to value Edward when he 'makes himself a tool' and 'starts working' (grooming dogs, trimming hedges, barbecuing, cutting hair). Difference doesn't matter, so long as you conform to homoeconomicus, becoming a functional and productive worker within society.The film's villains are heavy-handed and its romance rushed, but this is nevertheless one of Burton's better films. It was released in 1990, before Burton became a brand-name, typecast and spokesperson for all that is emo. Today Burton's a bit of a joke; an ageing goth rocker, or freakish blend of Botox and black mascara, marketed as a morbid outsider yet fully ingrained in Hollywood. The whole Goth image doesn't work past 35, Tim.8.5/10 - Worth two viewings.",Null,1,2,2 July 2012
Silver Linings Playbook," Conventional fairy tale masquerading as edgy drama
","David O. Russell's 'Silver Linings Playbook' stars Bradley Cooper as Pat Solitano, a middle aged man with bipolar disorder. Recently released from a mental health facility, Pat's determined to win back his estranged wife. These hopes are undermined by Pat's many violent, angry outbursts.Pat's delusions – his wife wants nothing to do with him – are mirrored to several other characters in the film. Pat's father, for example, is deeply superstitious, and a young woman, played by Jennifer Lawrence, proves unable to accept the death of her husband. The film ends with a dance competition. Lawrence and Cooper have no chance at winning, but enter the competition riding on a cloud of optimism, hope and faith. They lose, but place high enough to win a monetary bet which affirms the superstitions of Cooper's father. The film's point? Man should remain relentlessly optimistic in the face of adversity and be constantly open to silver linings, the faint signs of which invariably line all events. Sounds familiar? It's 'Girl Interrupted' with added testosterone.'Silver Linings' message is positively easy when your script is built upon clichés and contrivances. Cooper's yet another sad-sack middle aged man who's essentially cured through sex with a conveniently placed, ultra hot young woman. This is self-help through love and copulation, a feel-gooder fairy tale in which men are saved from themselves by the embrace of a good woman who understands their pain. Lawrence's character, meanwhile, is a giant emo fantasy; a sultry wounded girl with black mascara, more curves than a Monte Carlo racetrack, and who copes with grief by humping everyone in her office. 'There's always going to be a part of me that's sloppy and dirty,' Lawrence says. But we don't believe her. She's sex on legs, Russell lingering on her tight leotards, designer pout and ample luggage.Indeed, 'Silver Linings Playbook' will henceforth probably be known as the film which put Jennifer Lawrence's butt on the map. Which map? Probably the map of Middle Earth. Lawrence's booty is so precious, it looks like her butt was forged by Sauron himself. And not only does Russell cast the 'official sexiest woman of 2012' in his film, but he casts actor Bradley Cooper as well, a bronze Adonis twice voted the sexiest man on the planet. That's a whole lotta sexiness for one film. You half expect these two to break out into a suburban rap battle, Cooper free-styling 'Baby Got Back', Lawrence 'My Humps'. What's that Cooper, you like big butts, you cannot lie? Congratulations, ima cure your mental illness with my humps, my humps, my sexy lady lumps. This some deep drama right here.'Playbook's' all about curing depression and mental illness through dancing and having lots of implied sex, but there's no 'curing' going on in the film, only deflections upon deflections. The neuroses of Cooper's father are reaffirmed, Cooper and Lawrence merely replace their spouses and one local friend continues to drown his corporate miseries in designer furniture and material purchases.At its best, the film works well as a screwball comedy. Cooper and Lawrence hide blossoming attraction with mutual resentment and much verbal sparring, but this witty banter doesn't last long. Meanwhile Russell's script leaves little room for nuance. Nothing is concealed, and there's little for the audience to do other than just watch these people crawl their way to inevitable redemption. Elsewhere the film's aesthetic echoes Russell's work on 'The Fighter', fractured, choppy and angry – a constant stream of emotional fireworks - and so mirroring Cooper's own state-of-mind.In the end, it's Robert De Niro's Pat Sr. who leaves the biggest impression. De Niro doesn't act particularly well here, and his character's not particularly well written, but because several of his subplots were removed (to push the film toward a lighter, more fairy tale ending), his character, whose latent hostilities are meant to provide a rationale for his son's troubles, retains an ambiguity which somehow makes him more rounded, mysterious and human.Incidentally, Russell's underrated 'I Heart Huckabees' featured a hero who rejects the idea of meaningful coincidence. This is the flip-side to 'Playbook', which advocates a kind of fake-it-till-you-make-it optimism. In 'Huckabees', our hero then suffers an existential crisis, stops trying to help others (he's an activist, like Russell was) and collapses into hedonism. He then rejects this in favour for a Zen-like state of ego-lessness and 'pure being', a state which he, of course, cannot maintain. The film ends with our hero reconciling at least four philosophical positions into a whole new life code. This film, Russell's best, was bashed by critics and shunned by audiences. Ever since then he's become a somewhat generic film-maker, albeit one now showered in Oscars and accolades.7/10 – Worth one viewing. 'Playbook's' soundtrack contains 'Girl From the North Country', arguably Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash's best recorded collaboration.",Null,2,5,23 February 2013
Ender's Game," Kid commits genocide, feels kinda bad about it
","'Wars cannot be good or glorious. Nor can they be justified as a means of achieving peace or anything else of value. The reasons given for wars, before, during, and after them, are always false.' - David Swanson 'Actions are held to be good or bad, not on their own merits, but according to who does them.' - Orwell Author Orson Scott Card released 'Ender's Game' in 1985. The book finds Earth at war with a race of insectoid aliens. Desperate for survival, humanity grooms a troupe of children for leadership and combat. These children, best of whom is a kid called Ender Wiggins, take part in a highly specialised training programme designed to nurture aggression, intellect and adaptability. Later Ender annihilates the alien home-wold and afterwards feels a little guilty. The message: genocide is cool as hell but also very bad.'Ender's Game' was immensely popular, but also received much criticism from other science fiction authors. Two of the more famous critiques were Elaine Radford's 'Sympathy for the Superman' and John Kessel's 'Creating the Innocent Killer: Intention and Morality'. Both papers are available online, and both essentially accuse the book of engaging in the Nuremberg Defence. That is, Ender is essentially a mass murderer who plays the victim card, claims that his actions are 'not his fault' and who insists that he was 'just following orders'. Card, according to Kessel, would have us believe that morality is based on intention, that the ends justify the means, and that the rightness or wrongness of an act depends on the actor's motives, not the act itself or even the result.To sell Ender's genocide (or xenocide), Card thus has to engage in a number of cheats. Ender, for example, has to be portrayed as a cute kid, an innocent underdog who is perpetually abused by others. This makes Ender's triumphs all the more sweet (and allows us to partake in guilt free vengeance). Every dubious action Ender commits, like the killing of a classmate and the wiping out of aliens, then has to be 'unknown to Ender'. He, for example, was unaware that a classmate he attacked died (and it wasn't 'his fault' anyway) and was unaware that his genocide was 'real' and not a mere computer simulation. Ender's hands are thus clean. His murders are always unintentional and not his fault. The convenient result is a character who exterminates an entire race and yet remains fundamentally innocent.In Card's defence, his novel (or sequels) actually wrestles with Ender's guilt and engages with the way in which armies manipulate soldiers, keep them blind and essentially turn them into insidious tools through the withholding of facts. And what makes Card's book creepy is that he uses on his readers the very same double-speak and manipulation which governments and armies routinely use on populaces. Card's enemies are demonized as 'irrational, crazy, fanatical bugs', for example, and violence is seen to be 'a necessary evil', a White Man's Burden which is admittedly horrible but must 'nevertheless be undertaken'. Likewise, wars – which historically are never waged in defence or to stop some 'future atrocity' - are sold by Card as being 'necessary to prevent mankind's annihilation'. The decks are stacked, then, for the reader to accept Ender as somewhat innocent.The funny thing about Card, though, is that he is no longer viewed as a 'sophisticated writer', but a fanatical nut-case. This has prompted many to reassess 'Game' as being covertly fascist rather than ironic/sophisticated. Indeed, today Card is a raving homophobe (he thinks gays are the products of accidents, choice and molestation), closet racist, fundamentalist Mormon, hater of legalised gay marriage (the old 'slippery slope' argument: legalising gay marriage leads to polygamy, bestiality and the collapse of civilisation!) and believer in 'liberal conspiracies which are ruining society'. The constant naked, sexualised kids, child erotica, homo-erotica and sadism in Card's novels, as well as their religious preaching, are likewise now increasingly viewed as being creepy. Most Card books feature some form of child abuse, rape and view kids as being as pure or as smart/mature/willing as adults, leading some to view Card himself as an abuse victim or shame-filled, in-the-closet homosexual or worse. In the space of a decade, 'Ender's Game' has thus gone (unfairly?) from cool space opera to Mein Kampf. Its Nazi-like themes of eugenics, genocide and perpetual war are no longer viewed as being presented for condemnation or satire, but 'necessary evils'.'Ender's Game' was directed by Gavin Hood, whose previous films ('Wolverine', 'Rendition') likewise dealt with military pawns questioning their indoctrination and complicity. The film replicates all the contradictions of its novel, at once salivating over psychopathy and condemning it. The film contains a number of exciting, unique, brilliantly directed sequences, two involving a zero-gravity game, the third involving an attack on an alien planet. Elsewhere it contains yet another ridiculous Ben Kingsley role/accent, and a number of logic holes (why train kids? Why does their training consist merely of zero gravity laser tag?), the biggest being the notion that genius kids wouldn't see through lies and reach a moral decision long before joining the military (Ender KNEW he would have to annihilate the aliens). Unlike most of Hood's previous films, which are aesthetically incompetent, 'Game' is slick, immaculately composed and scored.The film continues a contemporary trend of feminizing war. Here we see cute kids playing war games (and girls and Arabs and other minorities; war: now progressive!) behind terminals, echoing the US military's shift to unmanned vehicles, remote weapons and drones. Author Corey Mead would document this shift in his book 'War Play'. Indeed, the military industrial complex has always been intertwined with the video game industry; in the 1980s, when it was found that soldiers wouldn't aim for the head during combat, video games were used to train them to instinctively go for head-shots.7.9/10 – See Menno Meyjes' Hitler movie, 'Max'.",Null,11,27,27 October 2013
The White Ribbon," The Inevitability Of Blowback
","Another excellent film by Haneke. Some points...1. Haneke's 'Cache' used a mystery plot as a scaffold to examine the 1961 police massacre of Algerian protesters, an event which he then used as a symbol for the growing unease between France and Arabic minorities, and by extension, the West's mounting paranoia towards Arabs and Islam.2. Haneke claims that 'The White Ribbon' is about 'the origins of every type of terrorism, be it of political or religious nature.' This is an important statement, as it provides a guide as to how Haneke intends this film to be viewed.3. The film takes place in an agricultural village in pre-World War 1 Germany, in which most of the locals work for an aristocratic land baron. Other characters include the local doctor, pastor, teacher, farmers and their respective women/wives/lovers/children.4. The film is structured around a string of horrific crimes that befall the citizens of the village. But this is not a 'whodunit mystery film'. Instead, like Antonioni's 'Blow Up' and 'The Adventure', Haneke's mystery is never resolved, the crimes being used to make a series of far larger statements.5. This film will appeal to a very limited audience. Like Tarr, Kubrick, Antonioni, Jancso, Wajda and Egoyan, Haneke is a cold, sometimes intellectual, director, who voids his films of narrative crutches and forces his audience to study every minute detail on screen. Like these directors, he uses a variety of distancing techniques, designed to instill an air of quiet contemplation.6. In true Haneke fashion, the film begins with a confession of artifice, the narrator plainly stating that he is not quite sure whether his story is true or false. Of course the film is far less self-reflexive than 'Cache', 'Funny Games' and 'Benny's Video', mostly because of its period setting.7. With its stark black and white cinematography, the film works as a counterpoint to Dreyer's 'Ordet' and Spielberg's 'Schindler's List', a film which Haneke regards as 'exploitative'.8. Haneke's Brechtian distancing effects at times feel gimmicky. Consider two scenes, one in which a boy is whipped by his father and another in which a man sits over a bed, his face obscured by a wall. These feel less like genuine attempts at alienation than impotent 'copies of distancing effects'.9. All the crimes which take place in this film form an intricate web of 'causes' and 'effects'. The village is a very morbid place, every relationship and interaction poisoned and perverse. Haneke takes aim at the way religion represses people sexually and emotionally, the way it bolsters a social hierarchy in which women are oppressed and mistreated and in which children lay prostrate to an abusive patriarchy which fetishizes masculinity and patriarchal values. He portrays an authoritarian world in which the divide between the rich and the poor is impenetrable, everyone subservient to someone else. This is a dark world in which values become evil the moment there are applied as a social rule, in which jealousies lead to violence and injustices and inequalities lead to various terrorist actions.10. Haneke has made German, French and English language films. Has any other director so effortlessly hopped from one language to the next?11. Haneke says his film is not about fascism, but we see clues in 'The White Ribbon' as to how these German children of 1911 will later become either Nazis, Nazi supporters or men and women violently opposed to fascism. The seeds of a macabre future are being sown here.12. The last scene of the film is a simple shot in which all the villagers gather and sit down within a church. The image then very slowly fades to black. This shot is intended to mirror a cinema audience, the seated villagers being a carefully composed reflection of the film's audience members. Haneke's point: recognise yourself.13. Note that the 2 child victims in the film (the Baron's boy and the handicapped child) are not subjected to the harsh social structures which affect everyone else in the village. In some ways, they are jealously punished for the very freedoms they possess. Note too that whilst all the adult women are subservient and dutiful, trapped in an abusive system, the female children possess an outsiders view which allows them to question and rebel against the very system that entraps their mothers.14. Many have complained that none of the crimes are resolved, but with a little detective work the diligent viewer can make educated guesses as to who performed each of the crimes and needle out their various motivations.15. Late in the film a caged bird is killed, symbolising the refusal of the 'terrorists' to become 'domesticated' or 'subservient'. The owner of the bird then replaces it with another bird which he initially promised to set free. The point: man has abandoned his true parental responsibilities (to nurture and guide that which was born wild) in favour for possession and control. The captive will not be set free, lest he violently breaks away or the captor willingly lets him go.16. Note the characters whispering in the final shot. Dark futures are being planned here. Note too the final conversation between the pastor and the teacher. This is a battle between 'truth' and 'curiosity' vs 'willful delusion' and 'false beliefs'. The pastor lies to himself in the service up upholding the status quo. 17. Will time be kind to Haneke? He's a great director, but he needs to marry his intellect to stronger visuals.8.9/10 – A bit too joyless, misanthropic and heavy-handed, but what else should we expect from a director nicknamed 'The Ice King'? Nevertheless, the film has a powerful message, and the relationship between its narrator (a teacher) and a young girl is beautiful, respectful and optimistic. Of course, their age difference and her vulnerability suggests that even their romance is borne of dark opportunity.",Null,59,90,17 November 2009
Being John Malkovich," Being Charlie Kaufman
","'It's not that there are no great writers, it's that there are no great readers any more.' - Gore Vidal Written by Charlie Kaufman and directed by Spike Jonze, 'Being John Malkovich' revolves around a lowly puppeteer (played by John Cusack) who discovers a portal which allows him to 'enter' Hollywood actor John Malkovich. Once in the portal, Cusack is not only able to see and feel what Malkovich experiences (throughout the film Malkovich is portrayed as being weak willed and uncertain), but control all of Malkovich's bodily actions, completely submitting the actor to the puppeteer's will.So what we have here is a more meta version of Hitchcock's 'Vertigo' or Pixar's 'Ratatouille', Cusack the artist/director who uses Malkovich to kickstart his own career going. While the various characters who enter the portal see only 'memories' of Malkovich's personal history, a kind of deliberately one-dimensional and comical psychoanalysis session in which the 'Freudian' and 'Self-defining' moments from Malkovich's past are revisited (Malkovich frets about have seen his parents having sex as a child), Cusack is uninterested in the 'Being' or 'Self' of Malkovich, or even 'being' Malkovich. He's concerned only about controlling the actor.Significantly, when Cusack possesses Malkovich the 'real Malkovich' disappears entirely and is defined instead by Cusack's memories and actions. Recall Nietzsche's writings in 'Beyond Good and Evil': 'identity' is merely based on a kind of hierarchy of dominant and less dominant power drives, our individuality based on how we prioritise our prevailing drives and how we respond to intrinsic and extrinsic motivations. In other words, Malkovich loses 'Being' when possessed, while the bumbling Cusack gains 'Being' when actualising his own drives through Malkovich. i.e, the artist's ego often needs a surrogate.Like Kaufman's 'Synecdoche, New York', 'Adaptation' and 'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind', all the artists in this film thus long not only for control (only creative types are able to control Malkovich for extended periods) but for immortality through art. In this regard, one character called Dr Lester wishes to achieve immortality by literally possessing host bodies whilst Cusack wishes to use Malkovich to gain fame and validation.Late in the film, Cusack's damaged ego is contrasted to Malkovich's who, when he enters the portal and therefore himself, sees only a kind of self-centred world populated by hordes of Malkovich characters. This scene literalizes the egos of the actor and writer/director. Everyone's the centre of their own universe, but the puppeteer/director's ego-world collapses without a puppet for the audience to watch, and the puppet/actor's ego-world degenerates into movie-star narcissism if he has no other personalities/puppets to embody or possess. In other words, the ego is always a projection.The film can be read as a comment on contemporary celebrity culture, everyone in the film wanting to 'enter' and 'be' a celebrity, soaking up their 15 minutes of fame. But Kaufman goes to lengths to stress how banal Malkovich's 'celebrity' life really is, modern media and peep-show reality TV removing the mystery and glamour of the famous.The film seems more interested, though, in being a self-conscious and more specific analogy for the relationship between spectator and screen. Using POV shots, both the audience and various characters who pay to enter the portal literally 'embody' Malkovich. One rather obese customer even gives his weight as a reason for wanting to become John Malkovich, the point being that cinema allows moviegoers to identify with someone or something they are not: successful, handsome, famous etc.For the audience, this identification is a passive one. But for Cusack, passivity is not enough. He wants control. In this way, like 'Adaptation', 'Synecdoche, New York' and 'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind', 'Being John Malkovich' functions as a sort of art manifesto. Because of his creativity, and because he is an artist, Cusack is able to surpass the brevity of the Malkovich experience and actually accomplish something. The point: artists influence actions and choices, the masses are passive voyeurs, consumers or eavesdroppers 'in' the artist's brain-space, and the tragedy of the artist is not only that he must often transgress moral boundaries, but that he is dead without an audience or medium.At its best, though, the film touches upon man's obsession with validation. Whether it be the 'customers' who enter the portal to escape their own lives, or Cusack and Malkovich wishing to be the centre of their own stage, everyone in this film has a narcissistic desire to be the centre of the universe. This horror is mirrored to several characters who all desire to return to a previous stage in their development in which they do not seek validation from others and in which they are unaware of their own gender (what Lacan called the division between 'I' and 'me'). In this regard, two characters called Maxine and Lotte embrace their homosexuality and Cusack becomes trapped in a baby. In each case these characters have stopped living 'through the eyes of others', a form of ego death similar to that experienced by Philip Seymour Hoffman at the end of 'Synecdoche, New York'.8.5/10 – Too quirky and surreal to generate profundity or drama. The film's zaniness allows it to touch upon more ideas than similar 'puppet movies' like 'Vertigo' and 'Ratatouille', but this very zaniness dilutes any long lasting impact.Worth two viewings. Makes a good companion piece to Lynch's 'Inland Empire'.",Null,2,3,15 October 2010
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Maxims and madmen
","Directed by Grant Heslov, and based on a Jon Ronson book by the same name, 'The Men Who Stare At Goats' stars Ewan McGregor as a journalist who travels to Kuwait and then Iraq during the 2003 Iraq War.'Goats' is typically read as either a comedy or a piece of investigative journalism. What it also is, though, is a very calculated political statement. It's plot is essentially this: after the Vietnam War, a series of US soldiers lose faith in the United States and begin to see it as a violent, callous nation. They thus promptly become hippies, pacifists and New Age activists. Banding together, they then form the First Earth Battalion, a military unit which fights with 'love' and for 'peace'. The Batalion's attempts to undermine the US military-industrial-complex from within, however, fail completely; the military co-opts and perverts everything with its own overarching ethos.Significantly, the Battalion's soldiers, who are a team of bizarre psychic warriors, are named after the Jedi knights from George Lucas' 'Star Wars'. Like that franchise's heroes (one of which Ewan McGergor also played), they then find themselves having to make an ethical choice; choose between their 'dark' and 'light' sides. The film then ends with various Jedi feeling guilty for 'killing goats', 'animals' which Ronson turns into a symbol for any and all civilians and soldiers killed and tortured by the US war machine. The Jedi thus choose to 'set the goats' free, a moral act which goes punished.'The Men Who Stare At Goats' stars Jeff Bridges as Bill Django, a character lovingly modelled on Bridges' now-iconic Jeffrey Lebowski. The film's soundtrack ('I See You', 'More Than a Feeling', 'I had a Dream', 'Wishing and Hoping') encapsulates a very 1960s desire for social change, a yearning which the film's climax both satiates and is sceptical of. Some have found Heslov's characters too cartoonish (the film purports to be based on a true story), but his hippies are merely the logical flip side to a military-industrial-complex that is over-funded, wholly absurd and spiritually vacuous. 'Goats' was Heslov's feature length debut.8/10 – Worth one viewing.",Null,2,3,12 November 2013
Collateral," Hold Fast
","'We can do nothing against gravity.' – Sonny (Miami Vice) Taking place almost entirely within the cramped confines of a taxicab, Michael Mann's 'Collateral' stars Jamie Foxx as Max Durocher, a cab driver who, in typical Mann fashion, has given his life entirely over to his job. Dreams and aspirations remain, largely in the form of idyllic photographs and half thought out desires to kick-start a business in the Maldives, but gravity holds Foxx fast. The job has become his identity, Mann's characters all requiring a certain one-dimensionality to stay afloat in the flux.In a series of low-key, but beautifully atmospheric shots, Mann watches as Max ferries people back and forth across the city. He's burnt out, living for nothing, but must keep moving. 'A make believe, a simple existential haven, a retreat where the vita activa is banished,' author Olivier Mongin writes in 'La Condition Urbaine', referring to the 'urban underside where man's heart now lives'. In Max's case, this 'make believe' is an idyllic photograph taped to his cab mirror, which he periodically uses to zone out from the world, but which we know can never provide solace. The human has dematerialised into the heart of an urban universe governed by speed and constant motion, and like the exhausted package carriers of Olivier Assayas' ('Boarding Gate', 'Summer Hours', 'Demonlover') urban landscapes, Max can only abide or extricate himself for brief moments, as Sonny does in 'Miami Vice', jetting off in a speed boat to the very islands Max naively dreams of.Max is mirrored to two other characters, both of whom enter his cab. The first is a high profile prosecutor, played by Jada Pinckett Smith. The second is a robotic hit-man, played by an awfuly miscast Tom Cruise. Both exist on either end of a court-case, Smith looking to take down a drug cartel, Cruise hired to keep the cartel alive. Both are also associated with briefcases, smart suits and ice cool greys, the cool chic of business executives mirrored to amoral hit men, both exuding a compulsive professional pride which Max, who demonstrates himself to be a hot hand on the wheel and a master of LA's roads, himself shares. Driver, passenger, employer, employee, prosecutor, defendant...they've all got one another hostage, all collateral, their bodies property under ownership until repayment of some debt which perhaps remains infinite.Max and Cruise talk: 'A guy gets on the MTA here in LA and dies... Think anybody will notice?' The grandfather of the film's existential musings is Nicholas Ray's 'On Dangerous Ground', where burnt out cops navigate an impersonal city populated by indifference. Mann replaces the hellish urbanas of Ray, De Toth, Huston and Hawks, though, with their modern equivalents. The film opens at an airport, thousands trapped between destinations, and will spend its running time fixated on people going everywhere but getting nowhere. As Deleuze says, we now live in a control society in which 'you never finish anything'.Transience has been a constant theme in Mann's filmography ('You were born in Portugal but got your tan in Miami') so it's no surprise that 'Collateral' always seems to be moving. The world today is defined by 'non places' in which 'transit points and temporary abodes proliferate under luxurious or inhuman conditions...everywhere a bus stop to somewhere else,' Anthropologist Marc Auge says. But for all its motion, 'Collateral', is also one of the few Mann films to end with a certain hokey rootedness.'Vice' was about the inability of human connections to be forged in transit, never mind the formation of a stable Self in a global system which now demands incessant masks and collapsible identities, the flux insisting that man become a creature of transience and a tool of functional anonymity. In 'Collateral', likewise, it is Max's flexibility, his ability to break free and cease being a carrier, which allows him to defeat the Cruise character, whose professional rigidity - his routine/programmed need to fire a double tap to the chest and one shot to the head – results in his downfall.'Improvise, adapt to the environment, Darwin, I Ching, whatever man, roll with it,' Cruise says throughout the film, but his very death is the result of a failure to adapt (in dying, Cruise saves Max, instigating the driver's own transformation). The film then ends with Foxx and Jada Smith walking off into the night like a traumatised (married) couple. Their bonds will be tested in 'Vice', where the film's central black couple, again led by Foxx, struggles to fight gravity while others collapse all around them.The film is shot in gorgeous digital, Mann's unique nighttime photography punctuated by red braking lights, bleeding fluorescents and the murky glow of midnight LA. Mann replaces the old-school noir aesthetic – see 'Crime Wave' and 'The Naked City' - with something more modern, lyrical and jazz-inflected, his compositions often unbalanced, with objects and characters spilling off the frame.On the negative side, Mann, like Edward Hopper, romanticises alienation, dressing it up in slick Armanis and champagne lights, the modern condition rendered dangerously beautiful, glamorous and always against a background of wealth and resources. Of course these noir thrillers have always maintained a certain romanticism - the noir hero a knight heroically battling against the black - but such romance only helps to create and maintain a trendy, psychic distance.After a masterful first half, the film runs into more problems. The film's existential musings are sophomoric (early 21C existential chic), Mann is unsure whether or not to commit fully to a cat and mouse subplot involving police detectives, his film climaxes with two generic set pieces (cf 'Carlito's Way'), and while Foxx and Smith are excellent, Cruise is incompetent. You sensed De Niro's mind at work in 'Heat'. Here, Cruise just uses energy to mask his own superficiality.8.5/10 – Ambiance and auteurial flourishes elevate flawed genre piece.",Null,2,6,10 February 2011
Cross of Iron," I will show you where the Iron Crosses grow!
","Directed by Sam Peckinpah, 'Cross of Iron' stars James Coburn as Corporal Steiner, a German officer who leads a ragged band of soldiers against Russian forces during WW2. Set during the Soviet's Caucasus operations, which forced the German Wehrmacht to retreat in late 1943, the film is typical of Peckinpah: lots of squibs, slow motion deaths, cross-cutting and wistful machismo.Though praised by Orson Welles, and though it contains 2 or 3 good sequences during its final act, 'Cross' is a thin, routine war film. Peckinpah can't compete with the macho poetry of Sam Fuller, the film's moments of sentimentality/pathos are wholly generic (a kid dies, men are betrayed etc), its battles are repetitive, and the film hilariously continues the 'Steiner cliché'. This is a cliché, common in films and novels, in which we're asked to sympathise with a cool, rebellious, skilled, anti-authoritarian, deadly-but-kind German soldier who's literally always called Steiner.'Cross of Iron' contains a subplot which watches as Steiner, played by the always likable James Coburn, locks horns with an aristocratic Captain who betrays Steiner and his men in favour for meaningless accolades. Their relationship is offered as being representative of Germany during WW2. The German people, in other words, were led astray by selfish, inept leaders who marched a country headlong toward its death.'Cross of Iron' is oft praised for being 'about the German perspective'. While this is true to some extent, the film does little to challenge mainstream preconceptions toward WW2. You might say a braver film would have portrayed 'Allied' forces behaving as the Wehrmacht does here. Indeed, the Allies killed (through designed starvation and forced labour) more Germans in the five peace time years following WW2 than died during the entire European theatre. Which is not to say that WW2 films should pick sides, but rather that one should recognise that Axis Imperialism was formally no different to Allied Imperialism during this period (indeed, British Imperialism and desires to preserve a kind of monachist feudalism, led directly to WW2). 'Cross of Iron', meanwhile, merely reinforces your typical, reductive view of WW2.6/10 – Worth one viewing.",Null,3,6,7 April 2013
Ratatouille," The Artist's Journey
","Like 'The Incredibles', Brad Bird's earlier film, 'Ratatouille' celebrates the passionate, sometimes aggressive, pursuit of excellence. But while 'The Incredibles' dealt with superheroes pushing aside mediocrity and embracing their powers, 'Ratatouille' paints a lowly rat as a budding artist who must, in the quest for greatness, rise above those around him.The plot, a thinly disguised rift of Plato's 'Ion' (in which Socrates and Ion discuss everything from art to art criticism), unfolds in an unpretentious but profound manner. Rats (ie humans) are dirty, uncivilised, pack animals. They eat garbage, live in filth and are generally stupid. But Remy is different. He dreams, he reads, he dares to experience different tastes. In short, he's an imaginative little rat and completely out of place amongst his barbaric brothers! And so Remy leaves his family behind and embarks on a quest to become an artist. But like all great men, Remy first needs a mentor. In this case, his mentor is a dead chef by the name of Gusteau. Gusteau is Remy's hero, his role model, and so Remy shall live his rodent life by Gusteau's ideals! Of course, being a rat, Remy can't accomplish anything on his own. To rectify this he enlists the help of Linguini, a bumbling kid who lacks ambition, drive and direction. By living in Linguini's hat and 'pulling his strings' - like a film director takes control of his crew, or a puppeteer controls a puppet - Remy uses Linguini to create and make art, which the film equates with fine French cuisine.The film is so determined to examine art's function on the collective and the collective's role in the creation of art, that later in the film Remy's family comes to the rescue and likewise helps him create. Though they do not understand his artistic view the world, though they do not respond as he does to fine art and sophisticated food, they nevertheless love Remy enough to band together and help him create and fulfil his dreams.And so Bird stresses the communal aspect of creation. No artist, especially a filmmaker, no matter how independent he views himself to be, can accomplish greatness without help. And though a budding artist must (somewhat naively) break away from his family, at times ridiculing their lack of understanding, Remy can not realise his dreams without their love and support.It's interesting to note that Remy has no mother in the film. His family is all male. Historically, most mothers embrace their son's artistic desires. It's the practical father figure which the artist must overcome and prove himself to. What's sweet is that Remy shrugs his father aside, dares to be independent, but then needs his father to accomplish his dreams. Brad Bird, and many film-makers, likewise started off with sceptical family support and funding.Eventually Remy rallies a band of artists together (one character called Colette makes a point to label each of the chefs as artists and bandits). These are not cooks, they're rebels and outlaws! Of course none of these artists want to dream or take risks. Like Remy's dad, they've become stagnated. They follow Gusteaus recipes by the letter, not daring to step out of the box and create for themselves. But Remy is different. He has a vision! He has that creative spark! 'Change is nature, Dad,' Remy says to his father, 'we can influence when we decide to!' But Remy's father doesn't understand. He thinks his son is a wide-eyed dreamer. But when Dad sees little Remy commanding a kitchen full of humans like a maverick film-director, a smile creeps across his face. He understands his son, sees the strength in him, and promptly rallies behind the kid.The film's message is summed up best during a final-act monologue. Not everyone can become a great artist, but a great artist can come from anywhere. To be a great artist, one must be willing to fight for change. And so Remy lifted Linguini and his tribe of rats out of the gutter. He believed in himself and they believed in him, and together they all prospered.Ultimately, 'Rattatouille' is one of PIXAR's most mature films, thanks largely to Brad Bird's simple yet sophisticated scriptwriting. The film advocates creative independence, yet stresses the importance of community. It celebrates the artist, but destroys the artist's condescending and pretentious view of 'non artists' as 'simpletons'. It praises high art and refined tastes, but sings hymns of praise to the simple pleasures of the common man.Furthermore, the film examines the role of the artist and the importance of those who support, finance, inspire, and critique him. It touches upon the artist's ability to inspire the heard through his own actions and how the power of the one and the needs the many inter-mesh. The film has several cute relationships, but director Brad Bird is smart enough to recognise their darker underpinnings. There are symbiotic relationships here every bit as dark as Hitchcock's 'Vertigo'.Finally, the film ends with a beautiful monologue by an egotistical art critic and is packed with both gorgeous virtual camera work, and romantic architecture, the Parisian landscape rendered in loving detail. As CGI allows animators to play with space, refine their shots and fine tune their virtual landscapes, there are scenes here which push camera work and composition to perfection. Here, every shot is perfect. Every camera move, intricate and precise. The long tracking shot which follows Remy as he navigates the catacombs of Paris is particularly beautiful.10/10 – A smart film and a beautiful love letter to artists. Visually, the film is also divine. Pixar created realistic CGI plastic with 'Toy Story', hair and wind effects with 'Monsters Inc', water effects with 'Nemo', metal and reflections with 'Cars' and now here, with 'Ratatouille', they tackle food and architecture. What next will they try? Air and vacuum?Worth multiple viewings.",Null,4,6,20 February 2008
Bad Teacher," Too tame and poorly acted to be funny
","Bad acting and bad screen-writing ruin 'Bad Teacher', an unfunny comedy which tries and fails to parrot the gross-out jokes of Billy Bob Thornton's 'Bad Santa'. Mega-stars Cameron Diaz and Justin Timberlake are our leads, but they have no gift for comedy. Most of their jokes fall flat.The film's plot, in which a foul mouthed, money and body obsessed teacher learns that money and image aren't everything, is both inconsequential and predictable. Most interesting about the film is the way Diaz's character, a 39 year old slob every bit as rude, vile and sex obsessed as Thornton's bad Santa, elicits no sympathy. Why are we uncomfortable with openly 'loose', vulgar, hard-drinking, beautiful, demented, sex crazed women (Cameron's raunchiness was toned down because male test audience members were 'turned off' by her character's swearing, particularly her use of the 'c' word, usages of which were subsequently cut), but find such attributes in a male lovable and endearing? Use a less attractive, slobby actress for Diaz's role and suddenly you'd have a hit movie; put a sex bomb in there, and suddenly brains are scrambled.Incidentally, on IMDb, female voters rate this film higher than males, suggesting that there is some kind of cathartic identification going on here. Meanwhile, men squirm. 4/10 - Worth no viewings.",Null,7,14,15 July 2011
The Amazing Spider-Man," True men don't hyphenate
","Fearing the loss of very specific property rights, Sony Pictures rushed out 'The Amazing Spiderman', a retelling of the origins of a Marvel superhero by the same name. Those familiar with Sam Raimi's recent Spiderman trilogy (or Marvel's Spiderman lore) will find little new here, but the film, directed by Mark Weber, nevertheless moves well. Knowing that its audience has very strong negative preconceptions ('A Spidey reboot, so soon!?') it rushes through familiar plot-beats and tries to veer in original directions when possible.Still, Weber's film is different only in areas which don't matter: the backgrounds of Spiderman's parents are altered, our hero's love interest is changed and Weber tries to shake things up by having our hero reveal his identity early to both his bosomy girlfriend and her father, a police officer whose last act death swiftly makes his entire character absolutely pointless. The film's less personal than Raimi's, more anonymously directed, its action sequences aren't as classily framed, is less bloated, and expectantly degenerates into big budget CGI fisticuffs, this time with our hero trading blows with a computer generated man-crocodile. The film has one good scene in which Spidey constructs an underground spiderweb to 'detect' subtle micro-movements.This incarnation of Spiderman is played by Andrew Garfield. Like Tobey Maguire, Sony's previous Spiderman, Garfiend possesses a mix of geekiness and athletic sexiness. As today's interactivity-indoctrinated net-wired audiences are tired of CGI, and spectacle itself is largely dead, it's the film's soap opera moments which work best. But why invest in Spidey-soap when there's a two-to-three year gap between each blockbuster? And why invest when every Marvel franchise, both on-screen and in print, has scuttled continuity and ultimately betrayed its audience? Nobody cares about Raimi's Spiderman 1 and 2 because 3 was god-awful. Meanwhile the X-men franchise was contaminated the moment ultra-hack Brett Ratner was given the reigns. All these spandex franchises are treated as being disposable.Incidentally, Spiderman is spelt and trademarked as 'Spider-man', unlike Batman, Superman and Iron Man, all of whom lack a hyphen. This supposedly was done to distinguish Spider-man from Superman. Superman, meanwhile, originally had few super powers, but writers began pulling random powers out of his ass in the 1950s to differentiate him from other super heroes. So to distinguish himself Supes gets laser vision, super-speed, super hearing etc, whilst Spidey gets a meagre hyphen. Marvel's so cheap.7.5/10 - Worth one viewing.",Null,0,4,30 August 2012
Aliens," In the pipe, five by five
","'Hey Vasquez, have you ever been mistaken for a man?' – Pvt Hudson The first 'Alien' movie was essentially about a giant alien penis trying to impregnate a woman. Here, MOTHER (a spaceship's maternal computer) and ASH (the paternal cyborg) lovingly conspire to introduce a mysterious alien to the Nostromo, a commercial space-rig. The duo's plan is to have the alien impregnate the Nostromo's passengers, at which point the creature's seed can be safely transported back to earth, where it will be researched and developed into a biological weapon. The film ends with crew-mate Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) vulnerable and in her panties, having survived intergalactic rape and a Playboy magazine down the throat.James Cameron's sequel, 'ALIENS', likewise has 'feminist' pretensions. Ripley is awakened from her suspended animation (the film is framed as a nightmarish dream), only to be blackmailed by corporate types (her future's ruling patriarchy) and coerced into returning to LV426, the planet where she first encountered the aliens. Once she arrives on planet, Ripley has to do three things: rescue and protect Newt (her surrogate daughter), fend off impregnation and destroy the Feminine Other (Alien Queen).At first glance the film looks like a testosterone filled male action movie, but look closer and its clunky feminism is all over the place. All the males are either emasculated or ineffectual. Apone, the tough-as-nails Marine Captain, is wiped out in the first battle. Gorman, the Lieutenant, is useless and spends most of the movie unconscious. Hudson, despite his hilarious macho-ramblings, quickly reveals himself to be a giant cry-baby and Paul Reiser, the corporate weasel, is less representative of Hegemonic Masculinity than he is a snivelling coward. Even Bishop, the male cyborg, gets his crotch torn off. The most masculine marine is Vasquez, a tough Mexican woman who has bigger guns than any other marine. The only male character given sympathy is Hicks (Michael Biehn), but even he ends up taking orders from Ripley.While the first film portrayed Ripley as a damsel in distress, Cameron portrays her as a tough warrior, albeit maternal enough to care for her surrogate child. She kicks butt, but smiles romantically when Hicks gives her a bracelet. It's your classic Warrior/Goddess dichotomy.But feminism through a male's eyes isn't feminism at all. That Ripley has to battle at all means that conflict exists where none should. Though Cameron no doubt sees his finale as a giant intergalactic cat fight, two women facing off to defend their offspring in a man-less world, the Alien Mother represents a very masculine feminism; one based solely on reproduction and violent protection of its young.H R Geiger, the designer of the original alien, has described his art as being about the 'fear of messy sexuality'. No surprise then that the 'Alien franchise' is awash with tiny men walking down vaginal tunnels, periodically attacked by face huggers (flying uteruses) and phallic aliens. But what we have with the Alien Queen is a fear of the Feminine. Fear and awe of the vagina and repulsion toward reproduction.In the film's final battle, Ripley is forced to take a stand against that in which, for most women, lay their power: procreation. Her main goal is to prevent impregnation, for her and for Newt. In this regard, she must fight against the essential state of the female, motherhood. And so once again, Ripley is asked to turn away from the feminine, to deny another aspect of herself that both she and the Alien Mother share. The hidden ideology of the film, the rejection of the feminine, is apparent once again.The irony of the final battle is that for Ripley to conquer the Feminine she must master technology (guns, elevators, power loaders etc). Both films are guilty of perpetuating the notion of technology being chiefly male in origin (phallic weaponry and spacecraft) whereas biological processes are the domain of the female. Watch how the marines snicker when Ripley reveals her adeptness with a power loader, or when Hudson mocks Vasquez for carrying a gun. Women apparently are not supposed to be able to operate heavy machinery. Even hundreds of years into the future, technology is still the realm of the male. 'Woman-as-tool-user' is still considered anomalous.This dichotomy goes all the way back to Descartes' notion of objectivity in which men, with so-called 'rational' minds, in order to discuss the natural world, were bound to think of themselves as 'outside' the realm of the physical. This placed rational thought in the same realm as the masculine and the irrational with the feminine.The film's attitude toward the Alien Mother shows how pervasive the rational male/irrational female dichotomy has been since the Scientific Revolution. The Alien Mother can be thought of as nature 'unhinged' and out of control, akin to how Francis Bacon depicted nature and the natural world in his writings. Bacon believed that, outside of a strong masculinizing influence, Nature tends toward Chaos and the creation of violent monstrosities. The Alien Mother embodies this feminized 'state' of nature, a 'state' which the new, macho-Ripley must herself renounce.So while, with its Vietnam overtones, 'Aliens' is unconsciously part of the 'war-as-destruction-of-the-feminine' trend of the 80s (Casualties of War, Heaven and Earth etc), portraying the Feminine as the debased victim of incompetent male oafs, it also has a more dubious underside. Indeed, Bacon's outlook, along with Descartes', became both a mainstay in the development of scientific thought in the 17th Century and in the establishment of a biological rationale for gender bias and sexism that continues to this day.8.9/10 – Influenced by Heinlein's 'Starship Troopers' (and a shameless rip off of 'Them!', of which it even borrows its entire climax), 'Aliens' is the perfect action film for a certain demographic. With its brilliant use of solid effects, rear screen projection and an unforgettable final duel, the film wows us with its relentless hardware and technique.",Null,10,19,1 February 2009
Dallas Buyers Club," I prefer to die with my boots on
","A conventional biographical drama, Jean-Marc Vallee's 'Dallas Buyers Club' stars Matthew McConaughey as Ron Woodroof, a heterosexual but homophobic man living in 1980s America. When he is diagnosed with AIDS, a disease then stigmatised as being a 'gay illness', Ron is subjected to the very abuses he once hurled toward homosexuals.'Dallas Buyers Club's' second act watches as Ron struggles to get his hands on pharmaceutical drugs which may help his condition. As the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has banned such drugs, Ron procures them through illegal channels. Eventually he begins smuggling unapproved drugs to other patients with AIDS. In doing so, he prolongs the lives of many.'Dallas Buyers Club' is primarily interested in mapping Ron's transition from prejudice to tolerance. Like the original 'Planet of the Apes' franchise, which gave chauvinistic white racists a taste of their own medicine, 'Club' takes a homophobic and possibly racist rodeo cowboy – your quintessential Reaganite – and pushes him toward 'compassion'. In this regard, Ron strikes up a relationship with a transsexual called Rayon (Jared Leto). Though well-meaning, Rayon's character simply exists as a disposable plaything to foster the growth of heteronormatives. He's the fatally doomed queer character who's sacrificed so that the straight, white protagonist can find a sense of purpose (the film doesn't understand that transsexuals aren't the same as cisgender gays).And so via Rayon, Ron shifts from skirt-chasing bigot to compassionate crusader. To make this shift he must first become anarcho-capitalist extraordinaire, a shift which epitomises the film's unabashedly American values; work hard, start a business, earn a cool million and you too can be an Oskar Schindler. HIV can't stop the American Dream.Obvious, cloying, and mistaking excess for 'good acting', 'Dallas Buyer's Club' is at its best when it's demonstrating the sickening levels of hatred homosexuals habitually deal with. It also hints upon the xenophobically inhumane calculations of the decade's public health system, in which racial and sexual differences became synonymous with abnormalities and illness. The film also captures well the various modes of self-care that individuals infected with AIDS sought out in the early days of the pandemic, a time when treatments were expensive or non-existent. During this period 'buyers clubs' - underground economies that proved to be more reliable than the exclusive corridors of government-funded clinical trials – became a necessary alternative for surviving AIDS. Though deemed 'illegal', they'd become a symbol for progressive social movements, movements which flew in the face of the FDA and Big Pharma. The film co-stars an out-of-her-depth Jennifer Garner.7/10 – Worth one viewing. See 'The Children's Hour', 'Puncture' (2011) and 'How To Survive a Plague'.",Null,0,3,14 January 2015
The Exorcist," Playtime with Pazuzu
","Mary Russell published 'The Sparrow' in 1996. The novel opens with Jesuit priests intercepting a message from an alien planet. This message consists of beautiful singing, which the priests interpret as the holy songs of religious aliens. Believing that God wishes them to make first contact with these aliens, the priests hop aboard a spaceship and fly to the alien planet. Once there, the aliens torture the priests, rape them, break their bones and reveal themselves to be both cannibals and serial abusers. The priests also learn that the songs they intercepted were a form of alien pornography.'The Sparrow' used gore and sensationalism to make a simple point: either the Jesuit priests misinterpreted signals and God doesn't exist, or God exists and he is a vile monster capable of unimaginable horrors. William Friedkin's 'The Exorcist', based on a novel by William Blatty, does the opposite. Here a little girl is subjected to horrible torture at the hands of a devilish creature, only to be eventually saved by faith in God.Released in 1973, 'The Exorcist' became one of the decade's most profitable pieces of backlash cinema. The film puts agnostics, atheists, science, medicine, knowledge, universities, libraries, liberals, hippies, female sexuality, drugs, single woman, feminists, rebelling children and swearing on one hand, and the church, men, Christ, traditional values and clerical paternalism on the other. The film's reactionary stance on the generation gap - and the civil rights movements of the 1960s - becomes apparent early on, when mother Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) is shown working on 'Crash Course', a celluloid tale of campus revolt and student riots.But most of 'The Exorcist' centres on the plight of Regan (Linda Blair), Chris' daughter. Months away from becoming a teenager, Regan's possessed by Pazuzu, a creepy demon. This demon causes Regan to swear, spit, attack others, masturbate and slander Christ. Chris believes she can cure her daughter – she's a strong, independent woman after all – but Pazuzu proves to be too powerful. Enter father Damien Karras (Greek for 'conqueror of darkness'), a troubled priest played by Jason Miller. Because his mother died, Karras is questioning whether or not God exists. Regan's possession settles his doubts. The film climaxes with Karras sacrificing himself, Christ-like, so that Regan may be free of her demons. A recruitment film for the Catholic Church, the film led to a massive increase in church attendance.'The Exorcist' co-stars Max von Sydow as a priest who mentors Karrass. Max von Sydow, of course, starred in a number of Ingmar Bergman's films, Bergman being a director renowned for numerous films which deal with God, faith and existential crises. One of Bergman's masterpieces, 'Cries and Whispers', itself resembles 'The Exorcist'. Released in 1972, 'Whispers' watches as a dying woman is confined to her bed. Around her, atheists and believers wrestle with various moral and/or philosophical problems.But Friedkin is no Bergman. Though packed with religious iconography, his film has little to say about religion, suffering, God or disbelief. Friedkin's God is itself neither punitive or loving, and instead reduced to a kind of sports team mascot, the film more interested in violent slugging matches between Team Good and Team Evil. A form of spiritual blackmail, the film asks you to reconsider which Team you're on - the heroes or the monsters – lest you too be condemned to hellish suffering. That the heroes here are Catholic priests fighting valiantly to stop child abuse is an irony lost on Friedkin.The 1960s and 1970s saw European neorealism making its way to Hollywood. Once there, the movement became almost immediately perverted, now married to special effects, shock tactics, gratuitous violence, gore and sensationalism. 'Realism' was increasingly important only insofar as it sold a heightened form of fantasy. We see this in 'The Exorcist', what would ordinarily be a Bergmanesque chamber piece turned into a war-zone, heads spinning, vomit spewing and children torn to shreds. 'The Exorcist's' bludgeoning tactics would pave the way for every sensory-overloading quasi-religious picture from 'Saving Private Ryan' to 'The Passion of the Christ'; spiritual blackmail with state-of-the-art gore.Though a film about crises of faith, 'The Exorcist' is largely devoid of spiritual or psychological introspection. This is largely because William Blatty's a bit of a nut (he's currently suing Georgetown University for not being Catholic enough, and for being too pro-choice and pro-contraception). Friedkin's aesthetic, though, is mostly masterful. This is a film of creepy spaces, chilling blues, disturbing images, nauseating ideas and grotesque faces. Though its shock tactics are largely crass (pulverizing a cute girl), and though it's almost half a century old, 'The Exorcists' primal sights and sounds are likely to torment even contemporary audiences raised in, or familiar with, Judeo-Christian culture.6/10 – See 'Heart of Glass' (1976) and 'Cries and Whispers' (1972).",Null,3,5,5 March 2015
Goon," Drain Bammage
","'Goon' stars Seann William Scott as Doug Glatt, a dimwitted bouncer who manages to make his way onto a local hockey team. His role? He's an enforcer, a violent position which requires him to get into bloody fist fights with opposing players. Offering respite from these scenes of violence is a hastily sketched romance between Doug and Eva, played by Alison Phill. She's a hockey fan who, like Doug, views herself as damaged goods.Though the film's messages - 'don't be ashamed of who you are or what you do', 'always love your teammates' etc – are saccharine, 'Goon's' overall tone is one of hyper-violence. Much of the film consists of Glatt being punched in the face or cracking skulls. Seann William Scott, so good in roles which require him to be an egotistical maverick, is given little to work with here. He's simple and childlike and not much fun, though this also makes the film somewhat interesting.Some of 'Goon's' skating scenes are well shot, but its original premise (a hockey movie about a hockey player who can't play hockey) quickly gives way to sports movie clichés. The film's swearing, which aims to be vulgarly funny, isn't inventive enough. Elsewhere director Michael Dowse lays on some heavy Christ symbolism. He think's he's making the next 'Raging Bull'.7.5/10 – Starts well, goes nowhere. Worth one viewing.",Null,1,1,21 November 2012
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Pryde and Prejudice
","'And if you tolerate this, your children will be next.' - Nicky WireHomosapiens are bigoted jerks in 'X-Men: Days of Future Past'. Fearful of difference, and so seeking to annihilate all with genetic mutations, mankind initiates a plan to capture and kill all deviants. Assisting in this goal is the Sentinel Project, a fleet of robots designed (ironically) by a physically handicapped dwarf named Trask (Peter Dinklage). Fighting for peace, understanding and tolerance is Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart). Fighting for mutant dominance is Magneto (Ian McKellan), a mutant whose hate has been forged by both the Holocaust and years of anti-mutie sentiment. 'Days of Future Past' was directed by Bryan Singer, a homosexual.'Future Past' opens in the near future. On a dark, claustrophobic, fake-looking sound-stage, a rag-tag group of mutants battle robotic Sentinels. Those looking for the lumbering, gargoyle-faced Sentinels of the X-men comics will be disappointed. Singer's art departments have created quick-moving, liquid-metal beasts. No longer slow, monstrous and towering over whole buildings, these new Sentinels are mostly derivative, unimaginative and small. Singer has replaced monstrous Easter Island statues with high-tech ballerinas.'Future Past' then branches off into two story lines. In one, set in the early 1970s, our heroes attempt to prevent Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) from unwittingly sparking a war between humans and mutants. In another, set in the 21st century (and reminiscent of the overwhelming Sentinal attack in 'Matrix 3'), a band of mutants attempt to hold back a horde of Sentinels. These future war sequences are mostly disappointing. Where the X-men comics portrayed this future as an expansive, rubble strewn battlefield (reminiscent of the war-torn future of James Cameron's 'Terminator' movies), Bryan Singer gives us small, cheap sets and kung-fu robots.Singer's 1970s storyline plays better. Here we meet Quicksilver (Evan Peters), who's granted a playful action sequence which almost rivals Singer at his past best. More poor set design follows (an unconvincing Vietnam, train-station, Pentagon etc), and yet another Magneto prison break, before Singer climaxes with an audacious set-piece in which Magneto cleverly cages the White House. This sequence expertly blends spectacle and emotion - Singer conveys well Mystique's bitterness, her self-hatred, as well as Xavier's overflowing love and compassion - but ultimately boils down to a very old cliché: a character grappling with whether or not to pull a trigger.The 'X-Men' franchise has been one of the most poorly planned franchises in cinema history. No episode flows coherently into the next, each episode feels stand-alone and hastily cobbled together, and each film spends all its time setting up things that promise to happen but never do. The franchise has very little continuity, very little carries over from one film to the next, and those characters who do heavily reappear (Wolverine, Magneto, Xavier) tend to merely go through the same motions. There is no progression. Ever. 'Days of Future Past' epitomises this 'refusal to move' by literally resetting and negating whole chunks of its own franchise.Such poor planning is annoying, because few superhero brands have as much potential (and real world relevance) as the 'X-Men'. A great writer could do wonderful things with Magneto and Xavier, the former a freedom fighter turned fascist (and whose villainy is understandable, complex and at times even justified), the latter a tortured idealist, but Singer's writers are mostly hacks. The moral gravity that these two characters broach is never properly exploited. Put Xavier and Magneto over a chessboard and the sparks will fly naturally, sans CGI, but Singer's writers are rarely up to the task.Some have complained that 'Future Past' messily jumps from past to future. But a bigger problem is the scatter-shot nature of the entire filmed franchise. The series perhaps deserved a writer who slowly, meticulously and incrementally sketches the 'X-Men' mythology, starting from the birth of the first mutant, to the formation of Xavier's school for outcasts, to perhaps an entire episode focusing on man on mutant genocide/persecution. Then, and only then, after he has experienced the second Holocaust of his lifetime, work towards Magneto's meltdown, his bloody victory over humanity, and finally mankind's last ditch effort to create Sentinels. Too linear? Too traditional? Maybe, but it might have upped the stakes. Currently, nothing matters in the 'X-men' franchise. Ironically, the franchise's scatter-shot, never-ending style perfectly echoes the nature of comic-books, in which characters are continuously and flippantly rebooted, resurrected and re-imagined.'Future Past' co-stars James McAvoy, who is excellent, and Michael Fassbender, who isn't given much to do. Bryan Singer's direction is fine, but can't touch his work on 'X1' and 'X2'. Bizarrely for a film set in the early 1970s, 'Future Past' features Tasers, complex robots and advanced genetic manipulation.7/10 – Worth two viewings. See Menno Meyjes' 'Max'.",Null,0,3,27 May 2014
Gandhi," 'Repent, Harlequin!' said the Ticktockman
","Richard Attenborough's 'Gandhi' charts the life of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, the political and spiritual figure who led a non-violent resistance movement against British Colonial rule in India. The film touches upon all the now famous cornerstones of Gandhi's life. We watch Gandhi being educated in Britain, follow his life as a provincial lawyer, and observe his work in South Africa. It is here, in 1893, that he began to represent indentured Indian labourers, emerging as a voice of conscience and a representative of those subjected to racial discrimination.The film then watches as Gandhi returns to India in 1915. Here he seeks to ignite a 'moral reformation' which renders the British occupation - responsible for almost 1.8 billion deaths over a roughly 200 year period - defunct. Gandhi's strategies for non-violent civil disobedience (satyagraha) initially appear impractical, but they soon begin drawing support. In 1920, under Gandhi's leadership, local Congress was reorganised and given the explicit goal of seeking self governance. Gandhi then urged the Indian people to boycott British education institutions, courts and products, to resign from government employment, to refuse to pay taxes, and to forsake British titles and honours; full spectrum resistance. Gandhi's party was then transformed from an elite organisation to one of mass national appeal. In his writings Gandhi would express his belief that 'radical non violence ultimately brings one's oppressor around to one's own side'. This was true to some extent, as Attenborough ably shows. On the other hand, it was really WW2, many violent Indian protests and the sheer contradictions of capitalism which made the Empire collapse. The British Raj was itself but the outcome of the nationalization or 'bailing out' of failing private financial cartels. In other words, Gandhi simply struck when the system was crumbling anyway.But Attenborough doesn't care. Instead he offers your typical Gandhi tale: against the Goliath of the modern, imperial super-state, it was the diminutive Gandhi who stood up, David-like, against its might. He showed the modern world that people should never be overlooked. He paralysed Britain, thwarting its imperial ambitions, revealing the limits of its power by undermining its economic self-sufficiency through coordinated, mass campaigns of non-violent non-cooperation. This, some say, was also the path that in the end 'defeated' the even more muscular Soviet Union. We also see the emergence, during this very same period, of Gandhi's more violent alter ego, Mao Tse-Tung, whose revolutionary violence was equally effective in winning independence from his more brutal foes, both the imperial Japanese and the industrial Nationalists.'Gandhi' contains a last-act subplot in which Gandhi rejects the proposal for the partitioning India and the 'creation' of Pakistan. But of course it was Gandhi who first signed onto the proposal. He was a thoroughly caste-oriented Hindu, offering only moral friendship to Muslims, who shrewdly wanted political power too. When Pakistan and India split, you then had much bloodshed, many massacres and long-lasting tensions. Blaming this on Gandhi, though, is perhaps unfair. The British Empire tirelessly pushed for the splitting of India; all Empires practise divide and conquer tactics, especially when 'granting independence' to their ex-colonies. The goal is destabilisation, fragmentation and the continual plundering of these nations by proxy.'Gandhi's' pure Hollywood, so other complexities are ignored. The irony of Gandhi 'freeing' Indians in South Africa, for example, whilst being outwardly racist to Africans is neglected (in 1906 he'd actively participate in the war against blacks). The caste system - where society is arranged on a four level hierarchy based on skin colour - is itself the bedrock of Hinduism, the darker skinned relegated to the lower levels. None of this is in Attenborough's film. One other irony is that Gandhi emerged at a unique historic moment just as the Age of Empire began its rapid post-War decline, beginning its de-colonial contraction from an era marked by a global land grab to a more insular and self-governing age. But how much did the effectiveness of Gandhi's channelling of 'latent energy into massive non-violent expression' depend directly on violent expression, namely Hitler, WW2's toil on the British Empire and massive bloodshed in Europe? Attenborough's film is well shot, paced, epic and engrossing, but also ultimately shameless hagiography, with a little Oscar baiting and David Lean pretensions sprinkled about. Attenborough, an actor himself, is very much a man or surfaces, direct statements and the literal. What you see is what you get.The film stars Ben Kingsley as Gandhi, whom Attenborough elevates to sainthood by mercilessly stripping away all psychology or inner life. Kingsley's fitting or wildly miscast (a white guy as Gandhi?) depending on what you smoke. Attenborough also errs in seeing the independence struggle solely as a battle between British colonialists and the Indian nationalist leadership. This is an elitist history that suppresses the voices and actions of the subaltern, the Indian peasantry, who were highly engaged in fighting colonial rule. Both the British and Indian elites wrongly viewed the subaltern as being pre-political and regressive.Today India has adopted Western-styled economic reforms. She is now one of the largest economies in the world (as she once was pre the arrival of the British). This has not abated massive rises in poverty, income inequality, environmental damage, exploitation and malnutrition. Over half of India's population now lives below the poverty line, and she contains more poor people than all of sub-Saharan Africa. Attenborough directed 'Cry Freedom' in 1987, a preachy film about apartheid.8/10 – Good, but overly reverential, one-note, holy and white.

Ocean's Eleven," Soderbergh's Squad
","The 'Ocean's 11' franchise started in 1960 with Lewis Milestone's 'Ocean's 11', a glossy heist thriller which saw a gang of thieves pulling a daring operation in which several Las Vegas casinos are simultaneously robbed. Milestone was a bit of an auteur, known for several fairly good war films, but his 'Ocean's 11' remains an anonymously directed affair. Instead, crooner and mega-star Frank Sinatra seems to be the one pulling all the strings, playing the titular role of heist-master Danny Ocean within the film, and the star and money-man calling the shots outside the film. The production was reportedly wrapped around Sinatra's lengthy stays in Las Vegas, where he performed various concerts at up-scale casinos, hotels and theatres.While Milestone's 'Ocean's 11' made ridiculous amounts of money back in 1960 – everyone wanted to see its big name cast: Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr, Peter Lawford and Angie Dickinson – today it's a hugely dull movie, with large chunks of exposition, unnecessary filler and a heist that's been bettered by countless heist films released both before and after. With notions as to what is and isn't 'cool' constantly changing, 'Ocean's 11' also looks completely neutered, its 'smooth', 'relaxed' and 'cool' cast now positively lifeless. Half a century later, only Sinatra comes off looking well, though precisely because of him the film plays like one of those bad crime movies by modern African American rappers, designed to show off the star's 'riches', 'bling', 'money', 'rule breaking', 'flashy accessories' and 'bad boy criminality' (Sinatra had close ties with the criminal underworld – both the Italian mafia and US government). It's a white bread version of such mega-celebrity egotism. Milestone's best scenes? A colourful Saul Bass opening and a wordless ending shot, much imitated by Tarantino, in which our suited gang of heroes walk down a pavement. Everything between these scenes can be missed.Steven Soderbergh would release a remake of 'Ocean's 11' in 2001. It's a much better film, featuring a cast of photogenic mega stars (Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Matt Damon, Elliot Gould etc), smooth operators, bad boys and likable character actors. 'I owe you for the thing with the guy in the place,' is the line which gets the plot rolling, a slice of dialogue which epitomises the film's comically nonchalant attitude. If Milestone's film strove to be cool, Soderbergh goes for a kind of meta-cool, our cast both too cool for cool and playing uncool with coolness, mega stars Brad Pitt always chomping down on food, Matt Damon bumbling with style and George Clooney perpetually basking in his own silly magnificence. As the heist movie is intrinsically formulaic – first act: assemble the 'samurai', second act: plan the heist, third act: escape or get captured – Soderbergh indulges in a kind of postmodern devil-may-care attitude. Meanwhile, the film's aesthetic is retro cool, with European/French touches, glossy locales, eye popping lights, sparkling surfaces/bulbs, lush cinematography, romantic editing/music, liquidy shapes and a camera that salivates over its suave actors, smooth villains and expensive locales. It's all about the money.Soderbergh describes his 'Ocean's 11' as a 'big wind up toy', and while its designed to be 'just entertainment', it does fit in with a number of the director's 'heavier' films ('King of the Hill', 'Che', 'Traffic', 'Eric Brockovich', 'The Girlfriend Experience'), which have focused on economic inequality, economic depressions, Marxist revolutionaries and violent corporate muscle. Indeed, the casinos where Soderbergh's heists take place, the Bellagio and several other mega-casinos on the LA Strip, were built in the 1990s by entrepreneurs and corporate raiders like Steve Wynn (the real life model of Benedict, the film's villain, played sexily by Andy Garcia) with junk bonds and help from organised crime lords. With its art galleries and upscale restaurants, the Bellagio was then part of a diversification strategy in LA to earn profits from non-gaming sources. Yet the appeal of all these amenities, like gambling itself, is fuelled by a drive to offer consumers escape from a reality of diminished opportunities for upward mobility (within an American economy of diminishing wages, outsourcing and continuous lay-offs). Within a postindustrial, globalized economy, gambling, and even crime, increasingly appears to offer the best way, in the words of Jackson Lears, 'to get ahead in a world where work no longer seems reliable'. Indeed, each of the film's robbers comes with some indication that they embody the disaffection created by the increasing division of American society into 'haves' and 'have nots', whether it be a criminal past, lack of work, or entrapment in a job they find to be unrewarding. Even the bank-roller behind the heist, a former casino owner named Reuben Tishkoff (smoothly played by Elliout Gould), wants revenge against a new economy in which corporate moguls like Benedict can use their financial muscle to push him out. On the flip side, such readings are contradicted by the film's need to work as a big budget wish-fulfilment fantasy, and the fact that the crime genre has always portrayed the criminal as Soderbergh does here: cinema's lovable criminals may live on the outside, but they're still perfect conformists, chasing money in their own way because of capitalism's failings.Soderbergh would release a sequel, 'Oceans 12', some years later. This one takes the form of a 'con movie', its narrative bending giddily in all directions, mercilessly toying with both convention and audience expectations. The film wasn't well received, despite being as good as its predecessor, which led to Soderbergh releasing the dull, and far safer, 'Oceans 13' in 2007. The villain's name is literally 'Bank' (Al Pacino) in this outing, but the film is mostly dumb.8.5/10 – Some overlooked modern heist films: Mamet's 'Heist' and Neil Jordan's 'The Good Thief', a remake of Melville's genre defining 'Bob The Gambler'.",Null,1,2,20 February 2012
Pearl Harbor," War Porn
","Most war films delight in playing the victim card. Typically you're coerced into siding with a small group of beleaguered common folk who are forced by an unjust History into a position in which they must valiantly fight back against overwhelming and superior odds. In each case victimhood is conjured up and used as a ploy to justify victimisation. Godard called this Hollywood's 'stage wagon' mentality, referring to old westerns which typically pitted outnumbered gangs of cowboys against hordes of Indians.Michael Bay's 'Pearl Harbour' spends its first hour on a corny love triangle. Its second hour is essentially an extended action sequence in which the Japanese Navy decimates Pearl Harbour and interrupts the gooey domestic normalcy of the first hour. Its third hour, of course, is an extended action sequence in which Americans bomb the hell out of Japan. It's WWII as 'Rocky III'; a poor, innocent, out-of-shape America has to get its butt kicked before it gets 'the eye of the tiger' back. A big-budget cartoon - Spielberg and Cameron are the chief influences - the film bolsters all the usual WW2 myths. That Axis imperialism was a reaction to Allied imperialism is ignored. That much money was coming to Germany from 'isolationist' countries is similarly omitted. As is the fact that wealthy factions in the US and UK supported Hitler up until 1938, as he was merrily crushing unions, anti-capitalists and communists. That many 'allies' supported Hitler's taking 'back' of Rhineland, Saarland, Austria, Czechoslovakia, West Prussia and Danzig is also whitewashed. Nevermind the fact that German's later expansions were formally no different to other Empires at the time. Indeed, as the US genocidally spread like a virus throughout the Caribbean, Philippines and Latin America, an equally psychotic Great Britain was ravaging India, the Middle East and Africa. Hitler himself justified his actions by likening Germany's land-grabs to Britain's slave trade. Hitler's allegiances to economist Gottfried Feder, and his defaulting on loans to outside banking cartels, proved even more irksome for the status quo. Cue Western blockades, some implemented as early as 1933. Meanwhile the US was busy sucking up to buddies China and Russia, the former carved up by the UK, US and France, who kept it locked in exploitative trade deals which explicitly excluded Japan. Japan – a once isolationist country forcibly opened up by US gunboats in the 1850s for 'market reforms', thereby setting it upon a path of Imperialism - thus moved into Manchuria, where it replaced dynastic dictators whom the Chinese themselves hated. Russia, China and the US freaked out. Wanting to expand into South East Asia and the Philippines, and wanting to protect Chinese assets and cosy up to Russia, the US began covertly and overtly attacking Japan. They put in place a series of embargoes, oil blockades, asset freezes and banking lock-downs, slowly strangling the country. Spooked, Japan began to back down. It offered to apply in China the principle of non-discriminatory trade relations on the condition that the Americans did the same in their own 'acquired' territories in Latin America. The US told them to shut the hell up. The common view is that America then suffered an unprovoked attack at Pearl Harbour, but few officials believed this at the time. 'America forced the attack on Pearl Harbor. It is a travesty on history to say that America-was forced into war,' Captain Oliver Lyttelton would say. And Captain Russell Grenfell: 'It is beyond doubt that Roosevelt wanted to get his country into the war, but for political reasons was most anxious to insure that the first act of hostility came from the other side; for which reason he caused increasing pressure to be put on the Japanese, to a point that no self-respecting nation could endure without resort to arms.' Later the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal would come to the conclusion that the US provoked the war with Japan. With the US and Japan now at war, Hitler declared war on the US. The US never intended to enter the European theatre outright, but Hitler was gambling that by declaring war, Japan would come to his aid and attack Russia with their Northern Forces. Japan didn't. They left Hitler hanging. So the US is dragged into Europe, Russia crushes Germany, China pushes Japan back and the US inadvertently comes out on top, holding this position for roughly a century. So essentially you have one huge, childish scuffle over colonies, minerals and cash. Germany and Japan didn't have colonies and wanted some, the US, England and France had many and wanted to keep them. No sooner was the war over, did the West turn their backs on once-allies China and Russia. The conquered Japan and Germany were themselves brought into the economic circles of the West and quickly turned against the sequestered Russians and Chinese.Forget good/bad binaries. Everyone was the 'bad guy', everyone fought for old fashioned bounty, on all sides it was the poor who suffered at the expense of the rich, it was the big nations who indebted and bullied the small into violence, nobody had a clue what was going on, everyone read the future outcomes of their own actions incorrectly (the US expected to have big post war economic interests/assets in China; China shut them off) and every action sprung a myriad of unforeseen reactions. Some lessons learnt: disrespecting the wants/needs of other nations (gains) leads to violent blow-back (losses), egos and pride bulldoze all attempts at cooperation/conversation, what we mistake as progress is but the accumulation of time, death and thought (progress is itself always loss, comes at a price), and the best way to topple a dictator is to either do nothing or to act wholly altruistically. WW2 is generally portrayed an an anomaly of a war, different to say, Vietnam and Iraq, but was largely the same thing.2/10 - Worth no viewings.",Null,14,25,14 November 2012
Duck You Sucker," The 'Lucas and Leone' effect
","With the first 'Star Wars' trilogy, creator George Lucas borrowed from Leone, Kurosawa, Ford, Tolkien etc and created one of the best slices of pop art, a bouncy myth (at once futuristic, medieval and topical - ie Vietnam), which resembled the kind of postmodern comic book that the 'Kill Bill' movies would beat like a dead horse decades later.Fast forward some years and Lucas decides to revisit the universe of 'Star Wars'. He wants to create a prequel trilogy. Problem is, he's a different guy now. He's grown and matured. End result, he decides to give us a Greek Tragedy rather than a Hero's Journey. The heavy, darker side of the myth.And so the Taliban-like rebels of the first trilogy are replaced and contrasted by showing us the evil workings of the American Empire. And yes, the prequels are overtly anti-American. In this context we can almost read the destruction of the Death Star as a 9/11 event.George Bush, I mean Senator Palpatine, comes into power, assumes executive control and promptly wipes out the Jedi (who are stand ins for America's exoticized enemies). The democratic Old Republic then gradually dissolves into a far reaching Imperial state, whilst the beauty of their spaceships, the artistry of their cruisers and the elegant designs of their cities (as shown in the prequels) is slowly replaced with the cold, bland, mechanical or bureaucratic look of the Empire (originals). Free thought and individuality is then removed (clones/stormtroopers) and the Imperial Empire is born.Note also how the logical, scientific approach to the Force (medichlorians - a play on the word mitochondria) present in the Old Republic, gives way to the mythical religions and rationalisations of the Force in the originals. The Prequels are the 'age of Reason', populated by thinkers, scientists and agnostics. But when society crumbles, the age of mystics (of hope and religion) is reborn.How does something founded on beautiful ideals (The Old Republic/America) become so evil? Lucas hits the nail on the head throughout the prequels. Politicians and people ignoring the plight of small nations and species. Large Trade Guilds exploiting and bullying the weak (notice that the enemy is merely a conglomerate of super-businesses, traders and corporate monopolies). Power is centralised. The media is blacked out or fed lies. Arms deals are conducted in proxy (Afghanistan, Lebanon, Vietnam, Iraq are all proxy wars) and everyone not of your religion (Lucas' Empire is comprised of stuck up Brits) is swept aside.Today, the American Empire has military bases in virtually every country in the world. No other country has this privilege. It also has the CIA, not only a body which is completely unchallenged and unanswerable to anyone but the President, but one which has become quite adept at instigating coups and installing puppet leaders in foreign countries.Anyway, despite all the interesting thematic stuff present in the prequels, they're all hokey failures. Lucas fell into the trap that a lot of authors fall into. Authors often develop a series of books which become successful and connect with an audience. But great artists don't like to repeat themselves. So as the author progresses and grows as an artist, the tone and content of his series changes. Eventually the reader no longer identifies with or likes the way the characters (or author's voice) has changed. Audiences want familiarity. Artists want to experiment, to challenge perceptions...but they love their fan-base too. So in an attempt to win back the reader, the author then reverts back to his simple minded, fun storytelling, while subversively inserting 'intelligence' into the thing. The result is a strange mix which again doesn't go down well with the reader.Because of his financial success with the originals, Lucas is one of the few directors to have a 'series' of his own. His evolution as an artist is exactly as described as above. His prequels are an odd mix of old George and New George, of adult smarts and teen fun.Of course the second problem is that an 'adventure serial' just can't hold the weighty themes and Greek myth overtones that he wants to insert. The prequels had to be far darker (like the Godfather trilogy) in both tone and style, less roller coaster and kiddie oriented, for his story to work dramatically. My point with all of this is that Sergio Leone went through the same artistic evolution. He started out making a group of fun, cartoonish pop westerns, and then transcended the genre with his masterpiece, 'The Good The Bad and The Ugly'. But no one took him seriously. No one would finance his 'serious projects'. So throughout the rest of his career he gives us over-long, somber pictures which try to be both fun and light, while also being political, Marxist, historical and important. This results in a weird cocktail of flawed movies peppered with greatness. Of movies at once childish but longing for an adult sensibility.It's also interesting to compare Leone to John Ford. Ford's 'action westerns' became dated and stupid the moment Leone started his 'Dollars trilogy'. Leone then went on to emulate Ford with 'Once Upon a time in the West', a melancholic pastiche of countless other westerns which uncomfortably jumps from somber meditation to comic book spaghetti. Meanwhile, Ford had dropped the 'action western' and started making meaningful, subversive westerns (Liberty Valance) of his own.8/10- A masterpiece with a bit of an identity crisis. It has it's flaws, but I'd argue (I can't due to IMDb word limits) that it's better than both 'Once Upon A Time In America' and 'Once Upon A Time In The West', both of which are suffused with nostalgia, yearning for the tropes and images of the western and gangster movies of Leone's childhood. They're Tarantino territory: films about films.",Null,6,11,15 September 2007
No Strings Attached," May cause other side effects
","'No Strings Attached' is a terrible film. Thematically, and very superficially, it resembles 'gender cinema' of the 1960s (eg 'Love With The Proper Stranger', 'The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie', 'Shampoo' etc), in which supposedly 'feminist' female characters free themselves from the shackles of patriarchy to become, quite ironically, emancipated, one dimensional, 'no strings attached' sex objects for men, before realising that, actually, polyamory is overrated and nothing beats good old fashioned monogamous family values. These 'liberation movements', and films, didn't really change anything, so much as they opened up the female workforce for exploitation (feminism always ignored class in favour for gender discrimination and sexist oppression). With twice as many employable people on the market, wages then went down.The film stars Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman. Kutcher's films are all about his giant ego and smug, pretty-boy body obsessions. Here, a thoroughly pleased Portman ('Watch me, love me, celebrate the wonders of my gym') matches Kutcher's narcissism blow for blow, the actress celebrating her newfound womanhood and bodily confidence by constantly thrusting her boyish frame in our faces like she's desperately auditioning for a bored paedophile.4/10 – Worth no viewings.",Null,0,2,25 February 2011

","Ben Stiller directs and stars in 'Tropical Thunder', an unfunny comedy which undertakes the pointless task of parodying poker-faced Vietnam and Reagan era war films ('Platoon', 'Hamburger Hill', 'Rambo', 'Commando' etc), most of which have already been rendered unintentionally silly by time.The only member of Stiller's cast to elicit giggles is actor Robert Downey Junior, who has fun playing an Australian method actor tasked with becoming an African American grunt (most of the jokes in the film are similarly self-reflexive). The rule for comedies is, the higher the budget and the more prevalent the special effects, the lamer the comedy. Few super expensive comedies break this law.Meanwhile, mega-star Tom Cruise has a bit part as a balding, fat man. Like all the 'comedy' in the film, it's a one note joke which aims low and overstays its welcome. Bizarrely, the film is guilty of exactly that which it parodies, Stiller's film far too long-winded, too preoccupied with plot, cinematography, star personas and special effects.3/10 â€“ Worth no viewing.",Null,1,3,28 July 2011

Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," OMG, Epic Fail. LOL, GG, I Rage Quit
","'You feel chilled because you have no character. You're a depressing assemblage of pop culture influences and cancelled emotions, driven by the sputtering engine of only the most banal form of capitalism. You spend your life feeling as if you're perpetually on the brink of being obsolete — whether it's labour market obsolescence or cultural unhipness. And it's all catching up with you. You live and die by the development cycle. You're glamorised drosophila flies, with the company regulating your life cycles at whim. If it isn't a budget-driven eighteen-month video game production schedule, it's a five-year hardware obsolescence schedule. Every five years you have to throw away everything you know and learn a whole new set of hardware and software specs, relegating what was once critical to our lives to the cosmic slag heap.' - Douglas Coupland Cultural theorists see postmodernism as a vacuous trap of circular references. It is the product of a heavily globalized, multinational dominated economy, which carries the multinational media industry as one of its main branches. As such, postmodernism stresses a 'blip time' aesthetic, one of amnesia and schizophrenia, in which the omnipresence of media merges all discourse into an undifferentiated whole. With this media saturation comes a form of 'historical amnesia', in which contextualisation becomes increasingly impossible.One of the chief characteristics of postmodernism is a kind of all encompassing fragmentation or 'liberative incoherence' ('F**k it, just surf the wave man!'). This includes the fragmentation of time into a series of perpetual presents, the rootlessness of the modern experience, the destruction of the family unit, the abolishment of the Sovereign Self (the trauma of which, ironically, leads to a rise in both narcissism and a quest for 'individuality'), the complete reordering of society and technology toward vast networks, nodes, conduits, transit points and non places, and the general atomization and pixelation of every aspect of our world. Philosopher Jean Francois Lyotard also identifies several other shifts. That of a move away from art which addresses symptom/causes and toward instead pure desire, a shift away from metaphysics toward pure irony, determinacy toward indeterminacy, and transcendence toward immanence.In addition to this, the postmodern subject, or what is presumably left of subject-hood, seems to be mainly the personality constructed by and for technological capital, described by the Marxist literary theorist Terry Eagleton as a 'dispersed, de-centred network of libidinal attachments, emptied of ethical substance and psychical interiority, the ephemeral function of this or that act of consumption, media experience, sexual relationship, trend or fashion.' And of course with postmodernism, even alienation dissolves, for there is now no longer a subject to be alienated. Contemporary fragmentation and powerlessness could hardly be heralded more completely, or existing anger and disaffection more thoroughly ignored.The Internet, interactive video games and the personal computer are themselves resolutely postmodern in the way they bring the outside, fragmented world into our lives whether we want it or not, each fostering the provision of a kind of ephemeral, and therefore unstable, experience. While this is going on, humanity itself starts to become an ephemeral substrate perpetually in the service of a long-lasting 'transcendent level'. Just as the cells of your body, which are short lived, are in the service of a body which lives longer, so too is the human subject the substrate of a technology/civilisation on a transcendent level (a singular, social super-organism). Or in technological terms, the human is now a node, always on and always attuned but never quite fully conscious of the network (what is known as CPA – continual partial attention).But it is not that the world (or the chaos of postmodernity) is turning us into machines, as some grimly foretell, but that we desire to be the machines that we have created in our image. That we are already cyborgs, making the world in our image.Humans have always been fascinated with the cyborg. The cyborg, of course, is itself inherently postmodern, by its nature drawn from a number of sources: art, science, medicine etc. And just as we create and draw toward ourselves ever more complex machines, machines which represent the hardware of human existence, so to we express through these machines a collective consciousness - the software of human existence - a consciousness increasingly garlbled and eclectic.What does this all have to do with 'Scott Pilgrim vs The World'? Essentially, 'Pilgrim' represents the worst of our f**ked up, glass-eyed cyborg future. The film is populated by machines; one-dimensional non-entities. Significantly, these machines do not work, belong to splintered families and are never supervised. They are self-excited circuits, perpetually playing, pleasuring themselves or fighting cool video game battles. The emotional range of these machines is completely bipolar; they're either suicidally depressed or riding technology's drug-like highs. Likewise, they live in a jazzy, supermediated, hyper-reality. A reality which mercilessly absorbs everything from Manga, to video games, to Kung Fu movies, to romantic comedies, to 'Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind'. Born in digital graffiti, in which every image is augmented, the cast themselves cannot distinguish between reality, video games, past, present, sleep, dreams and waking states. It is all a blur. Time itself overlaps, our characters continually unaware of where they are, what time it is and what 'plane' they are currently occupying. Unsurprisingly, the film's characters are mostly neutered, whiny, but sex obsessed kids, shooting dialogue back and forth like binary code. This is speech as economy; too much talk is wasted energy. Everything's been said anyway. The film is relentlessly dehumanising, its subconscious admittance that there is no human, no soul, no self, to destroy, cosily grafted onto a 'message movie' plot in which our hero learns Self Respect. And that is the paradox of the post-human, for he destroys himself in the name of his own liberation.7/10 – Formulaic behind its fireworks.

The Dirty Dozen," It's judgement day, sinners!
","Robert Aldrich directs 'The Dirty Dozen', an intentionally morbid and sadistic war film which attempts to run WW2 era combat iconography through a certain Vietnam Era prism.And so in Aldrich's hands, Allied soldiers become a band of murderers, rapists, racists, criminals and thugs, who outsmart their foes with underhanded methods and embark on a mission to ruthlessly slaughter both unarmed Nazis and German civilians, all of whom are caged within a European château. At its best, the film forces you to reassess typical WW2 'boys adventures' ('The Great Escape', 'Where Eagles Dare', 'The Guns of Navarone' etc), with several uncomfortable passages involving a near-demonic Telly Savales and the cold slaughter of German officials. But despite its typical early 60's 'anti establishment', 'anti military', 'anti government', 'anti religion', 'pseudo nihilistic', 'anti everything' stance, and its vein of anarchic, oddball humour, 'The Dirty Dozen' ultimately functions along the same lines as more conservative WW2 adventures. Our criminal heroes are too handsome, too endearing, we too heavily identify with them, and their last act slaughter becomes a moment of redemption rather than condemnation. In short, like his later war film, 'Too Late The Hero', the mythology Aldrich hopes to desanctify here remains sanctified.'The Dirty Dozen's' held up better than most of its big budget 'men on a mission' siblings. Actors Lee Marvin, Charles Bronson, Ernest Borgine and John Cassavetes in particular do nothing but dispense memorable moments. Still, the film's ultimate worth boils down to how much irony you attribute to Aldrich's macho bloodiness and glorification of war crimes. 8/10 – Worth one viewing.

Gone with the Wind," Much Ado About Nothing
","Though named after the ephemeral qualities of breeze, 'Gone With The Wind' moves like a lead balloon. The plot? Vivien Leigh plays Scarlett O'Hara, a strong willed Southern belle who's forced to flee her lavish plantation come the outbreak of the American Civil War.Scarlett embodies the South's indefatigable spirit, the film watching as she remains strong and steadfast in the face of war, hardship and much adversity. People and loved ones die, Scarlett marries and widows a lot, but nothing will dent her optimism. 'As God is my witness, they're not going to lick me!' she proclaims. 'I'm going to live through this, and when it's all over, I'll never be hungry again!' You go girl.Much of the film watches as Scarlett lusts for Ashley Wilkes, a man who embodies the South's honour, codes and subsequent defeat. With Ashley's passing goes the ideal of the American South, a better time which finds itself 'gone with the wind', passing into history and so oblivion. Insidious? Audiences at the time didn't think so. Nevertheless, this is a racist, wholly ahistorical film which abounds with stereotypes, which panders to the South, which nostalgically pines for and glorifies the Confederate cause, and which suggests that the Union brutalised an idyllic, simple, gallant and peaceful world. In keeping with such historical re-imaginings, the film portrays white women as perpetually elegant and menfolk as noble and dashing. Black slaves, of course, are dutiful, content, clearly incapable of an independent existence, dopey and easily duped (none of the three main black characters have real names). White Southerners, meanwhile, are portrayed as defending traditional values, the issue of slavery is ignored and the Ku Klux Klan - called a mere 'political group' in the film – is portrayed as an organisation of fine Southern gentlemen formed to protect white women. Elsewhere the usual Lost Cause myths are espoused, the Confederacy's motives noble and its leaders exemplars of old-fashioned chivalry who are unfortunately defeated by violent, scheming Unionists. The point is not that the film 'takes the wrong side' - the North was as bad, if not worse, than the South – but that the film is just plain stupid.Officially 'Gone With the Wind' was directed by Victor Fleming. Unofficially, directors George Cukor, Sam Wood and William Cameron Menzies directed huge chunks. Producer David O. Selznick was the film's driving force, though, the man overseeing the production with customary gusto.Scarlett is typically hailed as a feminist icon and a character who boosted hopes during America's Great Depression and Dust Bowl years. But while strong willed, she's also manipulative, is forever stealing other women's men and occasionally loves being bullied and raped by dapper rich dudes. Ayn Rand in a hoop skirt, it's hard to get behind a wealthy white woman who's pretty much oblivious to the suffering of everyone else around her. Indeed, Orson Welles would famously bash 'Gone With the Wind', stating that Selznick was a 'fool to mistake the picture for art'. Robert Altman would call the film 'total ****'. Malcom X would tell the story of how the film's sanitised outlook made him feel like 'crying and crawling under a rug'. Hilariously, Nazi Germany would ban the film. The Soviet Union would also try to ban the film for being dumb crap. Selznick would later say they hated it because the film was 'too classy'. But you know how communists are. They hate class.Like most artists who make dubious or outright racist films, Selznick spent much time espousing 'Wind's' virtues. When black organisations threatened to boycott the film, he launched a massive PR campaign and explained that he would have black activists and Harvard professors working on the picture to 'ensure that it's not racist'. Worried that ticket sales might fall, he then tasked civil rights activist Walter White with ensuring that 'the Negro position is greatly improved in the picture' such that it is demonstrated 'that we have the greatest friendship toward them and their cause.' Nevertheless, after the film's release, various black organisations signed an article stating that 'we consider this work to be a glorification of the old rotten system of slavery, propaganda for race hatred and bigotry', comments which spurred Selznick to launch another PR campaign in which he proclaimed himself 'a persecuted minority who also identifies with the black plight' and in which he proudly noted the benefits of his film, which 'undoubtledly provided many acting roles for blacks'.Such back and forth bickering is typically brushed aside today. People were simply less enlightened then, it is said. And besides, there is nothing as bad here as, say, 'Birth of a Nation's' fried chicken scenes. But this misses the point. People weren't dumb in the 1930s, and 'Wind's' worse elements are found even in our contemporary, enlightened age. Just look at the environment in which 'Wind' was briefly re-released in 2009; 'The Blind Side' was winning Oscars and America's bestselling book was a self-help guide to help kids get into heaven. In a similar way, 'Wind's' not about going, or impermanence, but covertly about something else: about things staying the same, about a reactionary longing for the past, and the preserving of dubious traits and/or institutions we, like Selznick, beautify with glitz.Aesthetically, 'Wind' looks amazing, with gorgeous cinematography, rich, evocative colours, beautiful browns, vibrant reds, gorgeous textures, strong camera work, opulent sets and one impressively composed scene after the next. On the flip side, it's a dumb, stiff, impersonal and ponderous melodrama. More paint-by-numbers colouring book than art, the film is the quintessential Hollywood product; the grand-mother of all event movies (the film's premiere led to several statewide holidays). Totally kitschy, its influence would remain strong even a century after it's release ('The Color Purple', 'Titanic', 'Cold Mountain', 'Australia', 'Far Away', 'Heaven and Earth' etc) 3/10 – Worth one viewing",Null,13,29,9 June 2013
No Country for Old Men," No Country for The Big Lebowski
","'Lebowski' began with a tumbleweed blowing across a desert. It went where the wind took it, its fate entirely dependent on how the breeze blows. The essence of film noir is in this idea of cosmic (in)determinism, our everyman heroes trapped in a noir plot, buffeted by chance, hopelessly battling against a conspiratorial, wholly indifferent universe.With 'Lebowski' the Coens transplanted noir fate to the life of a lazy bum. Whilst someone like Sarah Connor battles fate in 'The Terminator', or Bogart battles his way out of a cosmically convoluted plot in 'The Big Sleep', Jeffery Lebowski was content to simply lets it all wash over him. All these variables, they don't bother him. He's a tumbleweed in a noir web, practising inaction, pacifism and happy acceptance. In short, he's just too damn lazy to care about the events revolving all around him. The Dude just abides. 'No Country' also begins with a barren dessert, and also rehashes themes found in virtually every Coen flick. Here, a guy called Llewelyn Moss stumbles across a bag of money. He takes it, leaving behind a bleeding gang member. Later that night he feels guilty and decides to take a bottle of water out to the wounded man. Ironically, it's this act of kindness which gets Moss in trouble. The rest of the film is one long cat and mouse chase sequence, akin to 'The Terminator', in which Moss runs from a psychopathic killer called Chigurh. Like 'The Terminator', Chigurh symbolises the inevitability of death (or rather, the cold, indifferent weight of the universe). Death being that one fate which we are all resigned to. Observe how Chigurh kills his prey with a cattle gun, urging them to 'be still' whilst he blows off their heads. This is mirrored to Moss firing at antelope with his hunting rifle, urging them to 'be still' before he shoots. Both hunter and hunted are killers, but only one is successful. Moss misses his antelope. The notion of a cattle gun also dehumanises Chigurh's prey. To Chigurh, Man is a mere animal which he has no moral qualms slaughtering.The film ends with a Sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) no longer wanting to be part of this ugly world of men. To do so, he says, would put his soul at hazard. His answer is to retire. To stop trying, a defeatist stance which runs across the Coen's filmography (Barton Fink mocks socially conscious artists, all their films express the futility of planning and 'A Serious Man' finds futility even in serious thought etc). A clock ticks away during this scene. The clock is a cinematic symbol long linked with death (it's also present when Chigurh kills the wife). And yet, though the clock is present throughout the scene, a green tree looms over the Sheriff's shoulder. This symbolic Tree of Life appeared earlier in the film as a dead Mexican's other tree of choice. Dual choices appear throughout the film. Two options, two rooms, two trees etc.The Sheriff's then articulates two dreams. The first dream is 'all about money'. That dream is the film we've just witnessed, and conveys the Sheriff's belief that he's failed as a law enforcer. The second dream is about his father lighting a fire in the night to starve off the cold. This is symbolic of man fending off nature by providing his own light.'No Country' is a slick and stylish film, with enough mysticism to make it feel grand, but at it's core it's no different to any other noir essays on determinism. The Coens have their Sheriff do the same thing as every tragic noir hero, embracing defeatism and giving up trying. While 'The Lebowski' was an original take on noir, 'No Country' seems content to just wallow in the bleakness. Which is fine. But it makes you frustrated that the Coens don't do or try something more. Thematically the film comes across as no more than Clint Eastwood's 'High Plains Drifter' or 'PaleRider', so what we're responding to is, as always, only that Coen brothers style.Compare this to some modern neo-noirs like 'Femme Fatale' and the 'Terminator' movies, both of which actively challenge this idea of noir fate (though both are still mostly formalist games rather than genuine, socially progressive noirs). Yes, man is subject to chance, but De Palma's film argues that art empowers man, imbuing him with godhood, whilst Cameron's argues that the future can be dependent on us, that man can conquer his own mistakes (genetic, technological etc).So the problem with 'No Country' is that it isn't sincere as a film dealing with the bleakness. It's a kind of trite existentialism. The Coens are never sincere as artists and only clever as stylists. Here they don't really deal with the darkness, it is merely an excuse to serve up Gothic violence.Incidentally, 'No Country's' climax presents the flip-side to 'Fargo's'. Both Jerry Lundegaard and Llewelyn Moss meet their dooms at a motel. At this point the Coens ditch their elegant cameras and go for shaky, pseudo-documentary realism. Afterwards, in both films, a Sheriff comments on the 'darkness' of the world. In 'Fargo', Frances McDormand comments on Jerry's doom, whilst here, Tommy Lee Jones comments on Moss' death. Frances ultimately has a very positive, snuggly view of the world, whilst Tommy has a more negative, fatalistic view. Significantly, Frances character, like all successful Coen heroes, is a bit of a short sighted idiot. Throughout the Coen's filmography, it's the Forrest Gumps of the world who escape Chigurh. 8/10 â€“ Slick, stylish, superficial.",Null,9,15,18 January 2008
District 9," Black Hawk Down
","'It's got action. Big action. But in some ways it's also my anti-war film.' – James Cameron Released the same year as James Cameron's 'Avatar', 'District 9' essentially tells the same tale on a smaller budget. Like 'Avatar', we watch as a young man 'becomes an alien', learns to empathise with these 'strange creatures' and then helps them battle a greedy corporation bent on exploiting their technology. Unlike Cameron's film, however, 'District 9' is a bit more grungy in its approach, director Neill Blomkamp using faux documentary footage, shaky cameras, interview segments and a selfish hero, all of which help to keep 'District's' copious clichés somewhat fresh.Unfortunately, the film's second half quickly degenerates into a mindless shoot-em-up. What started off as an interesting sci-fi parable, quickly becomes an action movie reliant on chase scenes and an anime inspired robot-suit battle which – despite trumping Cameron's similar robot-suit battle at the end of 'Avatar' – still feels too much like a video game.Many have complained that the film makes allusions to Apartheid in South Africa (the aliens become slum dwelling blacks, ostracised by the whites), only to then abandon any real world context by having the 'blacks' defeat the whites and then escape to their Mother Ship. But should this surprise us? 'Avatar's' blue skinned 'native American Indians' may have been slaughtered in real life, but in Cameron's film they likewise valiantly defeat their enemies.The truth is, this is a common narrative arc in Hollywood. All these films are racial fantasies which resolve themselves in similar ways, cinema allowing us to exorcise our demons by helping the 'rebels' defeat the 'empire' and win. Those 'ugly foreigners' may die in real life, but on screen we always help our little buddies triumph. How cute.Indeed, with its airborne snipers, armoured convoys, circling helicopters and dirty shanty towns, 'District 9' is best compared to Ridley Scott's 'Black Hawk Down' (itself just one successor to old Cowboy vs Indian westerns) a film in which white soldiers mercilessly gun down a horde of slum dwelling, gun toting Africans because they 'left a buddy behind'. But with 'District 9', the situation is reversed. The revenge fantasy is granted and the 'left behind' aliens are allowed to destroy the white man before catching a ride back home.And while 'socially conscious' 'war movies' like 'Avatar' and 'District' pander to fantasy, 'straight' war movies simply portray the fantasy from the opposite perspective. Whether it be 'Platoon', 'Private Ryan', 'Zulu' or 'Black Hawk Down', the white man is always allowed to callously gun down hordes of aliens because our sorrow is always directed internally. We weep when our brothers in uniform die, because violence sucks when it happens to us. Very rarely do war films build to a climax in which one is positioned to mourn, or even consider, the loss of the Other.So while films like 'Avatar' and 'District 9' pretend to be 'socially relevant', they really just pander to the flip-side of the usual Hollywood formula. The Camerons, Costners and Blomkamps of the world want to mourn the slaughter of blacks, Indians, Vietnamese and intergalactic aliens, whilst simultaneously demonizing the might of military and corporate muscle, whilst the Stone's, Spielberg's and Scott's of the world want to romanticise our boys and bask in the nostalgic glow of brothers dying bravely in combat like blood splattered Christs, whilst simultaneously exalting the 'never leave a brother behind' ethos of benevolent leaders. There is some truth in both approaches, perhaps, but too often these formulae resolve themselves by resorting to comfortable traditions and wish fulfilment. At least 'District 9' 'updates' some of these problems by having the ally of the aliens be a nerdy bastard who couldn't give a crap about helping the underdogs. Perhaps this is the future: I recognise your problem, but will only help you if it helps mine. Or to put it in 'Avatar' terms: I see you, but don't give a f**k.The real cutting edge of these themes can probably be found in such odd 'war films' as Godard's 'Our Music', in which the anger is precisely that it may be impossible for modern cinema – because of various factors which Godard catalogues like a raging professor - to actually give a hoot about the alien Other on screen (anti-establishment cinema is now a product sold by the status quo- think a smug politician like Al Gore telling us about climate change, or think 'Full Metal Jacket', where a marine's anti-establishmentarianism is shown to itself be the seed of all working ideology). But it will be decades until such trends filter into the mainstream.Aesthetically the film is fast and manic, though also thin. This is unsurprising. Old school Spectacle is dead. This is the age of information overload, of narrative excess, which is perhaps why the first act of 'District 9', which bombards us with information, mixed points of views, documentary footage and interviews, feels the most spontaneous, exciting and energetic.The film's climax hints at a sequel, but its hard to see where Blomkamp can take this material without going where 'Alien Nation' went decades earlier. Perhaps the victimised aliens come back and wreck vengeance on Earthlings? Maybe a white hero stands up for all little guys, not just aliens? 'Defiance' meets 'Inglorious Basterds' with aliens? Blomkamp is so behind the times he might just do one of these.7.9/10 - Worth one viewing.",Null,3,5,14 February 2010
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," The films of Jesse James
","There have been numerous films about Jesse James, most notably Sam Fuller's 'I Shot Jesse James', Nick Ray's 'The True Story of Jesse James', Kaufman's 'The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid', Hill's 'The Long Riders' and Dominik's 'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford'.Being the most recent, Dominik's film gets all the attention, but Kaufman's and Hill's deserve just as much notice. Though released in the 1970s, Kaufman's film must be watched through the lens of his astronaut epic, 'The Right Stuff', both films offering an absurdist take on progress and frontier pushing. Here, Jesse is a confused charlatan and the gang's criminality is seen as being outdated in the face of banking cartels, protection rackets and business scams. In this new world, the business man is the new criminal, violence now taking the form of organised sports, rail barons and profit margins. 'How much you think that'll fetch?' one man remarks, as he tries to figure out whether he can make more profits selling earrings in pairs or singles. Stuffed dolls are similarly traded for money, whilst steam engines and horseless buggies are treated as, not a form of technological progress, but a form of capitalist spectacle which pushes Jesse and his gang further and further into extinction. Indeed, it is a steam piano constructed to attract people to a bank, which ultimately gets Jesse's gang killed.The gang itself is split into two groups. Those who follow Cole Younger and those who follow Jesse James. Jesse embodies a kind of no-nonsense criminal psychopathy, stealing and killing and forever unable to live up to his romantic myth (he pretends to receive messages from God, but nobody believes him). Cole, in contrast, tries to play the game by the banks' rules, using guile, cunning and elaborate schemes. Significantly, Cole's plan backfires and he dies, whilst the lawless Jesse, a product of a different age, rides comically off into the sunset. Like Altman's 'Thieves Like Us', the film subversively portrays its gangs, not as noble Robin Hoods stealing from corporate fat cats, but part of the same all inclusive racket.Walter Hill's 'The Long Riders' is a different sort of beast altogether. This is a fast paced action movie, the 'legendary moments' in the life of Jesse James downplayed in favour for ambiance and texture. Town dances, chirping crickets, women being pushed on swings, touching romantic relationships with whores...this is film which serves up a certain air of melancholy, before launching into a series of staggeringly violent action set pieces. Hill's gangsters are not wild-eyed maniacs but disenfranchised criminals looking to score easy cash so that they can retire to some country paradise. In other words, it's a Michael Mann macho poem with the violence of Walter Hill's mentor, Sam Peckinpah, grafted on.Hill's film also revolves around a cat and mouse feud between Jesse and the Pinkerton Detective Agency, a group of lawmen working for the banks and railroads. In an effort to humanise the gang, the film paints these lawmen as murderous brutes who kill innocents and set homes ablaze. These, of course, are narrative tactics used to convince us that Jesse and his boys are innocent of any wrong doings and that they were merely provoked by violent authorities. Andrew Dominik's 'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford', in contrast, is implicitly about celebrity. Here, Jesse's gang are mythologized through legend and media exposure, and it is this which curses them. Jesse himself is killed, not by Robert Ford, but by celebrity itself. The film is thus about, not only looking, but being looked down upon, looked up at, and having perceptions projected upon you. Jesse's death, in which looking at a picture literally kills him, encapsulates all these themes. It is Jesse's own gaze, his aloof attitude toward Ford, which causes Ford's worshipful stare to be corrupted, but more importantly, co-oped by Pinkerton. Here, celebrity and mythology bulldoze truths, and court death by assuming a kind of superiority. Of course death, rather than debunking myths, tends to reinforce them further.But while all three films go off on their own interesting tangents, they make a mistake which has been around since Henry Fonda's 1939 film, 'Jesse James'. These films ignore history and turn Jesse in a superstar, a Robin Hood, a pretty boy rogue, when this image was wholly invented by John Edwards, a racist and pro Confederate journalist who wanted to create a heroic figure to help rally people against the Union.At the time, the state of Missouri belonged to the Confederates, whereas the state of Kansas was held by the Union. The two states fought each other fiercely, killing civilians, burning houses and committing various other war crimes. Jesse James, following in his brother's footsteps, joined the Confederates, fought with them for several years and then left the army to form a robbery gang with several soldiers. They hit trains and banks and kept the loot, but because banks and railroads were symbols of the Union States (who were forcing farmers, civilians etc to buy Federal dollars), it became easy for Confederate supporters to turn Jesse into a kind of rebel figure.Jesse then began to milk this image, selling himself as an altruistic warrior who fought evil Yankee rail barons for Southern honour. In reality, far from being the last hurrah of the Confederate cause, Jesse was a cold hearted guy who fought for the preservation of slavery, robbed trains dressed as the KKK and kept all the loot for him and his gang. Of course none of the Jesse James films deal with this, even Dominik's, which is specifically about the allure and falsity of celebrity.8/10 - Pitt is amazing, but this is Malick lite.",Null,2,3,13 May 2010
Remember the Titans," Hail to the Zel
","Boaz Yakin's 'Remember the Titans' stars Denzel Washington as Herman Boone, an African American coach who attempts to form a racially diverse football team at a high school in Northern Virginia. As it's 1971, and racial prejudices run rampant, Boone encounters various set-backs.No points for guessing how 'Titans' unfolds. Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and Walt Disney Pictures, this is a hokey, sentimental, formulaic film, in which every emotion is accompanied by violins and in which every point is communicated via sledgehammer.Still, 'Titans' means well, and Denzel Washington is always watchable. Combining the nobility/sanctimony of Sidney Poitier, and the ghetto-street-cred of a young Eddie Murphy, Washington's always been a kind of post-racial distillation of everything African American. More than this, though, he's always oozed movie-star charisma. Give Denzel a monologue, rant or meaty bit of dialogue, and he'll dazzle you some thespian pyrotechnics, before hitting you with that patented laugh and bouncing off with his iconic walk, one arm dead at his side. If 'Remember the Titans' is tolerable, it's solely because of the Zel.6.9/10 – Worth one viewing.",Null,0,1,23 December 2014
Batman Begins," We've got a lot to teach you, Cassius Green
","'Take up the White Man's Burden, and reap his old reward; the blame of those ye better, the hate of those ye guard.' - Rudyard Kipling Chris Nolan's 'Batman Begins' tells the tale of Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale), a billionaire industrialist and weapons manufacturer who becomes a masked vigilante. The film's the most conventional outing in Nolan's Batman trilogy, the least pretentious and the least overtly fascist. It also has the coolest action sequences in the franchise, including a night-time car chase across the streets and rooftops of Gotham City.The film's first half offers a by-the-numbers origins tale. It then pits Bale's Wayne against Ra's al Ghul, a vaguely Arabic, quasi-Oriental bogeyman who leads the League of Shadows, a terrorist group which hopes to destroy Gotham City, which it views as being a 'cesspit of corruption'.From here the film launches into your usual White Man's Burden narrative: are you too weak, Ra's al Ghul poses to Wayne, too frightened, to do what is Necessary? Do you have the gall to break the law and actually act? Turns out Wayne does, as he promptly turns himself into a figure of impersonal Justice. He will break the Law, he will accept the Blame, but only for the Greater Good. You know, like every other fawned over psycho in world history who cooks up a 'few eggs must be broken in order to defend civilisation' narrative. In each case, the 'hero' righteously takes on a little 'blame' and 'sin' in order to prevent others from getting their hands dirty. In graciously accepting villainhood, he also sheepishly expects adulation.This Batman film doesn't have all the renditions, wire-tappings, mass surveillance, illegal torturing and extra-judicial stuff seen in Nolan's other Bat flicks, and it's less in love with the spectacle of reactionary counter-revolution (the later films are so fascist, Wayne practically invents a device to end world poverty/scarcity, but then mothballs it because crazy Green loving eco-terrorists might turn it into a bomb!). It does, however, have a subplot about Bruce Wayne's father, Thomas Wayne. He's the archetypal good capitalist, who turns his back on Wayne Industries in favour of medicine, science, and cooking up projects which will lift the post-Fordist Gotham out of social disintegration. Al Ghul and his Middle Eastern/Oriental ninja terrorists wants to destroy Gotham, Daddy Wayne wants to heal it. Here, finance capitalism is offered as a problem which will be solved by the return of re-personalised capital; by enlightened despots and humane industrialists. In this regard, Thomas creates a massive public transport system which he hopes will 'bring the city together' during times of economic depression and which will 'lift the masses out of the slums'. It is this rail system which Al Ghul hopes to destroy. Terrorists, apparently, hate privately financed public transportation.The film also contains a second sub-plot with a super-villain called The Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy). He uses hallucinogenic drugs to drive people into fear. Wayne's Batman identity is offered as the flip-side to this: Wayne creates a devilish bat persona with the hopes of both driving dissidents into fear, and vanquishing his own fears. Like Nolan's 'Inception' and 'The Prestige', there's thus an obsession with putting on shows, performances and spectacular sleight-of-hands in order to misdirect and control people/populaces. The act of being Batman is ultimately an elaborate theatrical production.Still, what the film's 'incepting' into your brain is total junk. 'Some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money,' characters state in the later films. 'They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned, or negotiated with. They just want to watch the world burn!' Pandering to the idiots-guide-to-terrorists, all three films ultimately promote the same straw-man: outside of late-capitalist civilisation is something irrational, chaotic, lawless and terrorist. We know there are a lot of problems with the existing system, the film says, but hey, revolutions are worse. There be some crazy dudes out there. Historically, these 'crazy dudes' used to be straw-man revolutionaries, Robin Hoods, Marxists, communists and 'radicals' (even Einstein, Edison, Ghandi, Chaplin, Lennon, Wells and Orwell were labelled 'dissidents' for being 'socialist'), today they're 'terrorists' and 'Islamofascists'. Sure Gotham isn't paradise, but it's better than 'their paradise'. The violence within (the masses) and without (Bane! Al Ghul!) must thus be contained. If this means investing in secret police forces or spandex heroes with monopolies on violence, so be it. Such thinking has led to the liquidation (and demonizing) of every egalitarian movement across Latin America, the Caribbean, Europe, Asia and the Middle East, the financing and promotion of fascist despots as a 'better alternative' to social change, the annihilation of billions across the world (from Indonesia to Ecuador and back again) and the support of hundreds of brutal militias and dictators over the last century alone (from Bao Dai to El Sadat). In real life, Gotham loves nothing better than supporting Tsars, monarchs and, if push comes to shove, crazy super villains (Barre, Saddam, Castaneda, Hitler, etc). And in each case, the Batman narrative (better some black ops, extra-judicial jiggy than letting Them win! Right?) is used to sell such actions to the public, though actual facts tells us something else: Power creates, passively or actively, bogeyman super-villains, oft to squelch change, and then later uses them to both justify its own use of force and denounce contestation to the status-quo. All the Batman films go to extreme efforts to distort and evade the consequences of their own parables. Unlike the Michael Mann inspired cityscapes seen in the franchise's later instalments, the Gotham City of 'Batman Begins' mixes the medieval with the ultra-contemporary; part Gothic, part German Expressionism, part cyberpunk, part favela slum, part future Megalopolis. Like all of Nolan's Bat flicks, 'Begins' insists upon being taken seriously, but then feigns naiveté ('it's just popcorn!') when taken seriously. The film co-stars Morgan Freeman as a wise white man and Katie Holmes as Two Face. 7.5/10 - Worth two viewings.",Null,2,2,22 July 2013

Wreck-It Ralph," How's the Night Life on Cissalda?
","'I'm not bad. I'm just drawn that way.' - Jessica Rabbit 'Wreck-It Ralph' is a dull and unimaginative animated comedy by Walt Disney Studios. The film finds John C. Reilly voicing Ralph, a muscular character trapped in a computer game's villain's role. Desiring to be a hero, Ralph embarks on a quest to find a silver medallion, a quest which sees him both battling an evil video game overlord and helping a young computer programme who exists as an unwanted glitch.'Wreck-It Ralph' hit theatres the same week that Disney sealed the deal to acquire LucasFilm and its Star Wars franchise (it absorbed Pixar and chunks of Marvel as well), moves which are indicative of the company's love affair with recognisable brands. 'Wreck It Ralph' is itself a giant game of spot-the-brand. Like 'Toy Story', which bought the licenses of numerous classic toys for the purpose of populating its virtual world (and 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' before it), 'Ralph' is packed with both authorised video game crossovers and nods to modern and old-school computer games. There are allusions to 8-bit games of the 1980s, the sprites of the 1990s and the more 'advanced' first person shooters of today. Pac Man makes an appearance, the cast of Street Fighter, Ralph is modelled on Donkey Kong, one game world resembles the conflicts between StarCraft's Space Marines and Zerg, and an extended set piece plays like Mario Kart on glucose.Unfortunately the film is witless, totally unfunny, none of its homages are particularly clever, its visuals look drab next to other recent Disney animated features ('Tangled', 'Bolt'), its big car chase sequence feels like a low rent version of 'Cars', or even 'Phantom Menace's' pod-race on a budget, and the film's virtual computer worlds are all unimaginative. One virtual world, called Sugar Rush and populated by Bratz doll lookalikes, resembles a cross between Diet Coke and My Little Pony equestrian vomit, only more epileptic.

Bridesmaids," Gals poop in sinks, feminists applaud
","'They're closing up girl land, some say its a shame. It used to be busy, then nobody came.' - Shirley Jones Written by and starring Kristen Wiig, 'Bridesmaids' is a supposedly 'ground-breaking' and 'revolutionary' comedy which 'charts new territory' by being simultaneously 'feminist', 'funny' and 'raunchy'. The film was produced by Judd Apatow, who specialises in R-rated, sex-obsessed 'bromance' movies.The film is mostly generic. Wiig plays Lillian, a woman stuck in a formulaic plot in which she is desperate to 'find mister right', 'get married' and be her best friend's best bridesmaid. The film also sports a weird sub-plot about 'baking'; Lilian's cake store falls apart and goes bust when her partner leaves her, but things go well for her again when she meets a new man who likes her cakes and likes her baking. It's a new type of feminism, see. Being a woman sucks, unless your in the kitchen and cooking for your man.The film's characters are mostly stock, either bickering women, jewellers, cooks, butch chicks, frigid ladies, workaholic moms or sex obsessed gals who are desperate to get married to rich men and live happy lives. Penises and nuptial hyper-consumption are the epitome of fulfilment.The film is praised for 'being about women just hanging out', but that is itself the point of the whole romantic comedy, chick-flick genre (the plot here is your typical Kate Hudson, Jennifer Aniston, Sandra Bullock 'girl meets boy', 'girl loses boy', 'girl reclaims boy' formula). The late 1970s and 80s were themselves dedicated to the 'woman's picture', most of the best ones of which raised the flag for ovaries and sisterhood without seeming idiotic. Nevermind the screen sirens of the 1940s and 50s (Hepburn, Stanwyck, Bacall et all), trail blazing rock-chicks and comediennes of decades past, or current work by Almodovar, Holofcener, Champion and Claire Dennis, just four contemporary filmmakers who deal well with women.So why exactly is 'Bridesmaids' ground-breaking? Perhaps because the film – like 'Sex and the City', the previous highest grossing R rated 'female comedy', and 'Bad Teacher', a total flop - makes it okay for women and girls of all ages to act like foul-mouthed jocks at a frat party, which is ironic, because your typical bromance buddy movies makes it okay for rowdy guys to act like sensitive women. That, supposedly, is progress: everyone can be anything any time. Total equality. Gals can be both raunchy poop-joke making princesses, and guys can be macho beer chugging momma's boys. This is a very postmodern take on gender; if all gender is performance, if all gender is programmed by externals, then there is nothing intrinsically 'feminine' and 'female'. It is all an act, gender endlessly mutable and malleable.This kind of thinking goes back, at least in the mainstream, to Judith Butler's 'Gender Trouble', an influential book. For Butler, the mistake of feminism was in asserting that 'women' were a solid group with fixed, common characterises and interests. This notion, she said, 'performed an unwitting regulation and reification of gender relations' which 'reinforced a binary view of gender relations in which humans are divided into two clear cut groups'. Feminism therefore closed options down. Feminists rejected the idea that biology is destiny ('women are not intrinsically inferior to men'), but then developed an account of patriarchy which conveyed, either consciously or unconsciously, that masculine and feminine genders were either biologically coded or that masculine and feminine genders would inevitably be built by culture upon 'male' and 'female' bodies. Butler opposed this. For her, gender isn't a fixed attribute, but should be seen as a fluid variable which shifts and changes in different contexts and at different times. As she famously said, 'gender is a performance, it's what you do at particular times, rather than a universal who you are.' From here on, gender began to be thought of as a kind of reiterated acting, one that simulates the effect of a static or 'normal' gender while obscuring the contradiction and instability of any single person's gender 'act'. This effect produces what we can consider to be 'true gender'. 'True gender' is thus a 'fake' narrative that is sustained by the implied, collective agreement to perform, produce, and sustain discrete and polar genders. Today this 'social agreement' simply offers more leeway such that everyone's essentially 'pansexual', gals just one of the guys and vice versa.This kind of stance, according to biological essentialists, is total crap. One just has to look at transsexuals and homosexuals – for whom sexual preference (but not necessarily gender behaviour) is not a choice, for whom Butler's stance is an insult – to see that gender (not sex) has biological foundations. Whatever the truth (gender identity is most-likely somewhere between the hard-lined stance of essentialists and the nuances of Butler, though leaning heavier in Butler's direction) both stances are pessimistic. In both cases identity is built on the invasion of the 'self' by the gestures of others, who, by referring to other others, are already social beings. The individual's will, and the individual performance, is always subject to the dominant discourse of an Other(s). Meanwhile, it is precisely because men and women think of 'themselves' as independent, fully autonomous, individual subjects, that the Other is created and therefor conflict arises. 'Bridesmaids' is feminist insofar as it rejects a certain type of essentialism, but hardly liberative insofar as it ignores larger forces working on bodies.Beyond this the film sports funny and touching performances by Melissa McCarthy and Chris O'Dowd, and works whenever they're on screen. Everything else is handled ineptly by director Paul Feig. For all its raunchiness, what the film conveys to modern women regarding expectations toward friendship, courtship and marriage is mostly conservative and depressing.5/10 – Worth one viewing.

Before Sunset," Linklater brings a tired genre to life
","This is a review of 'Before Sunrise', 'Before Sunset' and 'Before Midnight', three films by Richard Linklater.Released in 1995, 'Before Sunrise' finds Ethan Hawke playing Jesse, a young American who's travelling across Europe. On his way to Vienna he meets Celine (Julie Delpy), a young woman on her way to Paris. From the moment out duo lock eyes, they're drawn to each other. They share a meal, savouring the conversation more than the food, and when they arrive in Vienna, Jesse persuades Celine to keep him company wandering the streets. Thus begins an unforgettable screen romance.Like most of Linklater's films, 'Sunrise' is both dialogue heavy and boils down to a series of discussions or ruminations on life. Our duo talk incessantly, touching upon subjects which range from language and reincarnation to sexuality and religion. Some of it is cringe-worthy, but for the most part Linklater's dialogue rings true. His banter is casual, natural, lacking in artifice, and we at times feel like voyeurs, eavesdropping on the sort of 'unimportant' dialogue that most films shy away from. But the film is sexy as well. Celine and Jesse crackle with electricity, and Linklater pays great attention to subtle shifts in body language. There's one scene where Jesse restrains himself from brushing away a stray lock of Celine's hair, and another wonderful moment in a music listening booth where our duo nervously avoid eye contact. Elsewhere the film indulges in numerous long takes, Linklater's gliding camera making the most of some gorgeous European locales, as he dips in and out of romantic alcoves and cosy spaces. Linklater's long steadicam takes lend 'Sunrise' an 'energy' and intimacy that many of his other films lack.Released in 2004, Linklater's 'Before Sunset' is a sequel to 1995's 'Sunrise'. Equally good, the film joins Celine and Jesse almost a decade later. Speaking to both the mind and the heart, it finds our duo still obsessed with the night they first met, fell in love, and then somehow forgot to exchange contact details. This time around Jesse is in Paris to promote his new novel (he's now a writer), and it is Celine who tracks him down. Our couple then embark on an 80 minute chat, the fact that Jesse must leave on an afternoon flight tightening like a hang-man's noose around their conversations. The film then ends with a sequence which packs an emotional wallop.Hawke and Delpy so easily re-inhabit these characters, you have to wonder how much they're based on themselves. Simultaneously dopey and intelligent, their conversations cycle through hilarity, pain and misery. On the downside, both characters are obviously the product of an artist; Celine and Jesse are a couple of unashamed hipsters.Once again Linklater utilises long, uninterrupted takes, his gliding camera capturing vast chunks of banter and beautiful Parisian architecture. A few gentle flashbacks give glimpses of the original film, but we don't really need them. This story stands on its own as a second chance to change fate. And as is typical of Linklater, cinema's chief slacker-philosopher (at least since the death of Hal Ashby), Linklater has his film abstract several profound human truths, placing them all in a series of dialogue driven vignettes. In a way, Jesse and Celine become everyone and everything, and at times represent more than themselves.Released in 2013, 'Before Mightnight' finds Jesse and Celine as a committed couple. It's been eight years since we last saw them, and they now live in Europe with twin girls of their own. Unsurprisingly, the puppy-love of the first two films has given way to middle-aged weariness, parental responsibility, regret and pragmatism. The film is somber, even pessimistic, and Linklater cleverly introduces several other characters who represent life and love at different stages, most notably an elderly writer and a young couple who conjure up images of Jesse and Celine's own romance almost two decades ago. If 'Sunset' and 'Sunrise' evoked Eric Rohmer, or Bresson's 'Four Nights of a Dreamer', 'Midnight' recalls Abbas Kiarostami and Rossellini's 'Journey to Italy'. Again dialogue heavy, and again reliant on long takes, the film is colder, harder and more caustic than its predecessors. Our couple now view everything with scepticism, and seem to exude a mood of grim acceptance and resignation. Most of the film's conversation revolve around death, career disappointment, transience, the world ending or technology's negative influences; the rants of a dying generation. At one point Celine even paints a dour image of the future, in which society devolves into 'masturbation and death'. In another, Jesse insists that man is '99 percent automated' and even goes so far as to denounce the concept of self-hood. Other conversations mock the way men measure accomplishments, and of course male obsessions with the phallus. Elsewhere an elderly man explains that couples are 'never one person, always two'. Unlike its predecessors, 'Midnight's' sceptical of romance and even soul-mates. After a wholly contrived argument in a hotel room, a forced segment designed to set up another sequel, our duo then seem to patch up their problems, though you nevertheless suspect that this relationship has reached its end. Expect a possible fourth film to be about loneliness or separation.Early in 'Midnight', Jesse reveals to us characters in his new book. One character lives in an unending, wondrous present (the very behaviour that brought Jesse and Celine together so many years ago), whilst another views all experiences as being 'second hand'. Jesse later talks about being 'lost in perception' and introduces us to the 'patron saint of eyesight', moments which exemplify Celie and Jesse's own anxieties. Both fantasise about different, better futures, and both are unsure of their partner's role in this desired world.9/10 – Whilst as good as its predecessor, 'Sunset' may rub people the wrong way. The idea of successful, self-reflexive, middle class hipsters incessantly yapping, will prove irksome to many.",Null,15,18,26 September 2007
Zulu," The Original Black Hawk Down
","Killing the 'savage' in order to rescue him from his own savagery (and then playing the inconvenienced victim), is a tactic which 'great nations' have exhibited throughout history. From India, to China, to Africa, to Germany, to Vietnam and now to Iraq, national victimhood has always provided the moral basis for retaliation and power accumulation.Observe the sob stories that followed 9/11 (and the subsequent roll out of enormous amounts of hardware), or the way the British Empire turned the Sepoy Rebellion and the Siege of Khartoum into extreme symbols of the White Man's Burden. Time and time again, the slaughter of thousands is rationalized as, not only an act of kindness, but a noble burden which Empires virtuously carry on their shoulders.Think also Ridley Scott's 'Black Hawk Down', in which a group of outnumbered Americans fend off a horde of Africans. The film is a mighty misrepresentation of what happened in Somalia, turning the white man, once again, into a noble everyman, violently betrayed by the very savages he pretends to civilise and defend.In 1992, George Bush senior announced that America had come to do 'God's work' in Somalia, a nation devastated by clan warfare and famine. Unfortunately, in Pentagon speak, 'God's Work' means bombing nations to hell, the US government arming clan chiefs and warlords in a deliberate attempt to destabilise the region. The US has been doing this for a long time, backing the Somali dictator Siad Barre in 1978 and pitting him against the Ethiopians, all as a means of reclaiming the south east portion of Somalia and its vast reserves of natural gas. Between 1978 and 1988 the Americans lent (or caused the International Moneratary Fund to lend) around 3 billion dollars to Barre, most of which went to arms and led to untold amounts of bloodshed.As is typical, when their puppet dictators get too powerful, the West then backs their dictator's enemies. Cue Washington's backing of the Ethiopians, coaxing them into taking Somalia from the very Somalians they once pitted against Ethiopia (the same scenario played out, as it has done in countless other countries, in Iraq, the US arming Hussein against Iran and then supporting Kuwait against Saddam before finally blitzing Saddam themselves). This little 2 year long war eventually failed, and the Ethiopians backed out. With no conflicts to justify their presence in the area, the US then seized upon the buzzwords 'Somalian pirates' and 'war on terror' as an excuse to beef up their military presence in the region.Through these buzzwords, the US justified their support of yet more Somali warlords, pitting them against a group called the Islamic Courts Union, despite the fact that the ICU is not an Al-Qaeda affiliate or a terrorist organisation. In fact, the ICU was a relatively honest administration which not only brought a level of peace and stability to Somalia that hadn't been seen for nearly two decades, but was also succeeding in unifying the country and creating some semblance of nationhood.But of course the US doesn't want this. 30 per cent of America's oil will come from Africa over the next ten years. It's therefore no surprise that the CIA engages in a covert war which recruits warlords (the very same warlords who pass oil laws in America's favour) and urges them to hunt and kidnap Islamic militants, secretly imprisoning them on offshore warships which illegally double as floating prisons.At the same time, many European, US and Asian shipping firms signed dumping deals with Somalia's puppet leaders, allowing them to use the Somali coast as a cheap toxic dumping ground. This practise became widespread as the country descended into civil war, and still continues. This toxic waste has been responsible for all manners of deaths and illnesses, such that a formal complaint was sent to the United Nations. Of course the UN did nothing. In 2006 Somali fishermen then complained to the UN that armed foreign fishing fleets were using the breakdown of the state to plunder their fish stocks and intimidate fishermen. Despite repeated requests, the UN refused to act. Meanwhile the warships of global powers that patrol the strategically important Gulf of Aden did not sink or seize any vessels dumping toxic chemicals off the coast.So angry Somalis, whose waters were being poisoned and whose livelihoods were threatened, took matters into their own hands. Fishermen began to arm themselves and attempted to act as unofficial coastguards, some of which became the 'Somali pirates', the new terrorist bogeyman of the seas.The origins of piracy in Somalia are therefore linked to the lack of a functioning central government and is considerably different to the media's portrayal. It is the pirates who are the victims of attacks on their territorial waters by corporate polluters and fleets.What does this have to do with 'Zulu'? 'Black Hawk' is simply the 'Zulu' of our times, both films ignoring everything in favour for romantic battles in which outnumbered white men bravely gun down hordes of savage blacks. The Somalis in 'Black Hawk Down' speak only to condemn themselves. They display no emotions other than greed and the lust for blood. Their appearances are accompanied by sinister Arab techno, while the US forces are trailed by violins, oboes and vocals inspired by Enya. The white troops display horrific wounds and clutch family photos while all around them, Somalis drop like flies, dispensable and unmourned. Put helicopters in 'Zulu', and it's the same film. The white man's 'peacekeeping burdens' updated for the digital age.7/10 - In all these films (Zulu, Private Ryan, We Were Soldiers, Black Hawk Down etc), truth is revoked in favour for pride, heroism, courage and a glorification of warfare. They promote both a racist perspectives and a dangerous public tolerance for militarism. Note - Ridley Scott loves this film so much he used its Zulu war chant during the opening battle of 'Gladiator'.",Null,10,22,10 July 2010
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," World's shortest man climbs world's tallest building
","Directed by Brad Bird, 'Mission Impossible 4: Ghost Protocol' stars Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt, a pint-sized secret agent who struggles to stop a nuclear detonation. Unlike previous films in the franchise, Bird plays things for laughs, his film opening with a funny sequence in which Cruise breaks out of a Serbian prison to the tune of Dean Martin's 'Ain't That a Kick In The Head'. Moments later, Cruise is infiltrating the Kremlin using a funny holo-projector and a GIANT MOUSTACHE. Why? Why the hell not.Incredulously, Cruise is then blamed for blowing up the Kremlin. This, naturally, leads to Cruise journeying to Dubai. Here he climbs the Burj Khalifa (the world's tallest building) and is menaced by both a GIANT SANDSTORM and a MISCHIEVOUS GLOVE. After much commotion, Cruise journeys to India, where he infiltrates a hotel using MAGNETS. Afterwards, he fights the film's chief villain within a futuristic car park comprised of....moving platforms? Yes. Moving platforms.Brad Bird's directed a number of animated films for Pixar Studios, all of which have traces of screwball. His 'Ghost Protocol' is itself part action movie, part screwball comedy, the film filled with gadgets which comically break down, action sequences which resemble vaudeville routines, and funny jabs at both Cruise's age (he's 50), and the absurd situations Cruise's character is called upon to resolve.Aesthetically, 'Protocol' resembles Bird's animation work. The film is slick, well lit, classically shot and framed. And unlike most modern action movies (Nolan, Abrams etc), Bird's tone is playful, his action sequences make spatial sense, are immaculately composed, and his shots tend to flow with a certain classy style resemblant of a Hitchcock, De Palma or Spielberg. The film's tongue-in-cheek tone, combined with its formalism, itself resembles a number of Hitchcock pictures, most notably 'To Catch A Thief' and 'North by Northwest'. On the downside, the hyper-control afforded by CGI means that Bird's live action work here can't quite match the aesthetic highs and kinetic rushes of his animated features.Thematically, 'Ghost Protocol' is fairly anonymous, though the film's nuclear plot strongly recalls the atomic paranoia of Bird's 'Iron Giant' (Bird's films all take place within a retro fantasy land). Its climax, featuring moving platforms, also resembles a number of Bird's Pixar action sequences. It's the film's Burj Khalifa sequence, however, which really elevates things. As handsomely directed as De Palma's CIA heist in 'Mission Impossible 1', Bird's Burj Khalifa sequence carefully juggles suspense, comedy and clean lines. Remarkably, the scene was shot on location, without stunt doubles and with Cruise really scaling the sides of the Burj Khalifa. Whilst De Palma tops his CIA heist with an audacious EuroTunnel sequence, however, Bird's film struggles to climax. 'Ghost Protacal' co-stars Simon Pegg and Paul Patton as a token biracial.8.5/10 – One of the better action movies in recent years. See 'The Next Three Days'.

Revolutionary Road," Frank, April, Bill, Alice and Padraig
","Frank and April Wheeler live in Revolutionary Road, a Connecticut suburb. April is a failed artist, and so lives at home taking care of her children. Frank is a businessman, and works at a dead end city job. Both are disillusioned, finding little substance in the daily grind of life.From here on the film merely rehashes themes fully covered by Antonioni half a century ago. Frank and April see their dissatisfaction, firstly, as sexual unfulfillment, and secondly, as a product of their environment. In an attempt to find happiness, Frank thus has a meaningless affair with a young woman whilst April has sex with a friend and later a baby with her husband. But no, such fleeting moments of biological bliss cannot quench what is really an existential problem. And so when Frank and April decide to move to France, echoing the countless characters in Antonioni's filmography who run away, we know that the couple are merely pursuing an empty fantasy. Man's greatest flaw is his incessant belief that some external change can bring about an internal state of bliss.The sickness that Frank and April feel was long diagnosed by Nietzsche, when he noted that western civilisation was fast moving in the direction of the Last Man, a listless creature with no great passion or commitment. Unable to dream, tired of life, he takes no risks, seeking only comfort, tolerance and security.Today, First World countries find it increasingly difficult even to imagine a public or universal cause for which one would be ready to sacrifice one's life. Indeed, the split between First and Third World runs increasingly along the lines of an opposition between leading a long, satisfying life full of material and cultural wealth, and dedicating one's life to some transcendent cause. This is the antagonism between what Nietzsche called passive and active nihilism. We in the West are the Last Men, immersed in stupid daily pleasures whilst Eastern radicals are ready to risk everything, engaged in nihilistic struggle up to the point of self-destruction. What is gradually disappearing in this opposition between those who are 'in', the Last Men who dwell in gated communities, and those who are 'out', are the good old middle classes. The 'middle class' is a luxury capitalism can no longer afford.One of the successors of Antonioni's 'malaise movies' is Kubrick's 'Eyes Wide Shut', a film which expands on the post-modern malaise found in all those existential films of the past 2 decades (American Beauty, Fight Club, The Ice Storm, Blue Velvet, Safe, Fear and Loating, Being John Malkovich, Revolutionary Road, In the Bedroom, Little Children etc) by tackling the class and power relationships around its disillusioned couple. Though it also centres on a couple, one a failed artist (Alice) and the other a doctor (Bill), Kubrick's film probes beneath the fantasy image, giving his characters a context which these films typical lack.On the surface, 'Eyes' looks at the dark side of sexual liberation: the full commodification of sexuality, the sterility of a universe dominated by the superego order to enjoy, the collapse of religion and tradition, the worship of pleasure and youth and the prospect of a future totalised by scientific rationality and joylessness. In this world, love cannot flourish without sex; simultaneously, however, love is impossible because of sex. Sex, which proliferates as the epitome of late capitalism's dominance, has permanently stained human relationships. Sex is thus, as Derrida states, simultaneously the condition of the possibility and the impossibility of love. It is both nothing and everything.But more importantly, 'Eyes' is concerned with power, ownership and money and the way they connect with the issues of identity, intimacy and sexuality raised by films like 'Revolutionary Road'. Indeed, Bill's relationship with a mysterious power figure called Ziegler is at as pivotal in Kubrick's film as his relationship with his wife. Ziegler represents patriarchy, the symbolic order, yet he is also something of a Sadean libertine. He is both the Father who says No (guarantor of the symbolic order) and the Father who enjoys (wrecker of the symbolic).You might thus say that films like 'Revolutionary Road', which reduce their problems to domestic disputes, serve only to cut psychology loose from everything else. It's a type of hermetic, anti-social, ahistorical version of psychology, assuming that the whole cosmos is important only in relation to the conscious white male subject, which, incidentally, is exactly the sleepwalking egocentric complacency Bill begins 'Eyes Wide Shut' so conspicuously cocooned in.Few other films of the past decade (another is Lynch's Mulholland Dr) successfully attempt to open out domestic melodrama into the wider context of power, privilege, and patriarchy, and 'Revolutionary Road' is no different, never developing beyond the complacent mindset of smugly moralising Hollywood liberalism.Indeed, while Frank keeps his wife at home and out of a job, Bill wants nothing less than to block out female desire entirely. 'Women aren't like that,' he says, hence his attraction to prostitutes and masked women. As sex workers they resume the assigned place of women in his libidinal economy: they are passive recipients of male desire, not, as Alice has so terrifyingly revealed herself to be, agents of their own desire. And of course, it is the frightening realisation that he is himself an 'object' exploited in another's 'desire', that leads to Bill retreating to fantasy; fantasy being the very banal reality that Frank and April live in.And so it is the flight into the ordinary, the domestic, the apparently well-constituted identity, that represents escape for The Last Man, but more importantly, it is power and capital, that (he believes) facilitates the actualisation of his dreams.6/10 – Outdated 60's existentialism. Mendes strikes me as the new Anthony Minghella (both theatre directors). Mendes hides behind his cinematographers, and though his images are always clean and precisely composed, one senses no real visual imagination.",Null,15,21,23 March 2009
Lawrence of Arabia," I Like My Epics Gay
","'It's no wonder that nearly all the great founders of religion came out of the desert. It makes you feel terribly small, and also, in a strange way, quite big.' – David LeanSome brief points...1. Of all of David Lean's films, 'Lawrence of Arabia' is perhaps his most beautiful. Here's a director who waited months for the perfect sunset, who spent hours composing every shot. 2. Virtually every other sequence in 'Lawrence of Arabia' is logistical nightmare, Lean having to frame grand compositions, choreograph huge crowds, build vast sets and manage hordes of animals.3. Lean's 'Attack on Aqaba' sequence is staggering. Lean built an entire town, with over 300 buildings, all for a single unbroken shot which tracks an army as it swarms a coastal city. When Lean's camera finally draws to a halt, revealing the Mediterranean Sea and Aqaba's massive coastal cannons, we can't help but gasp.4. A super influential film. You look at 'Lawrence' today and you see bits of 'Star Wars', 'Close Encounters', '2001: A Space Odyssey', 'Indiana Jones', 'Kingdom of Heaven' etc, all over the place. The film contributed hugely to our cinematic vocabulary.5. Unusual for a film this size, there was no second unit photography. Lean shot everything himself, too much of a perfectionist to abdicate duty.6. Though it attempts to convey the intricacies of imperialistic politics and touches upon racial difference and homosexuality, the film's sense of geography and politics are a bit muddled, and its portrayal of Thomas Lawrence hardly factual. Indeed, because of people like Lawrence, and various other events, both before and after the infamous Sykes-Picot agreement, the Middle East was carved up and artificially divided for the very purpose of destabilisation and proxy rule. The problems of this period extend to our era.7. In his biography, Lean states: 'I think the whole of this creativity is sex. There's no two ways about it. And if you want to go and make a good movie, the fact of it is that sex is terribly important. If you want to make a good movie, get yourself a new, wonderful woman and that movie will be fifty, if not seventy, percent better than it would have been if she hadn't existed. It lights everything up. You see, I think lack of energy and tiredness is sexual failure.'8. In a way, the film's also about Lean himself, and the way the alienation of Lawrence's homosexuality mirrors that of the artist. Lean was born to strict Quaker parents who banned him from going to the cinema. In response, he developed a fondness for the desert and a passion for exotic locales (on screen and off). 'Lawrence of Arabia' itself almost plays as a kind of autobiography, a story about a man/director who travels to the desert, falls in love with its people, gains wealthy financing, has a grand vision and realises his dreams by managing, inspiring and directing thousands of men. In a way, the film is less about Lawrence the man than it is about creativity as a kind of libidinal drive; a sort of big budget take on Freudian sublimation, creative energy stemming directly from the libido.9. Watching the film again, its amazing how preoccupied it is with personal identity and sexuality. The film opens with a scene which demonstrates that 'nobody really knew who Lawrence was' and that any effort to 'sketch' him on screen is 'an exercise in futility'. Later in the film a man ominously shouts 'Who Are You?' when he sees Lawrence, and all throughout the film Lawrence is seen to be extremely conflicted, unsure how to act, how to dress, unsure of his very place in the world. Is he Arabic? Is he British? Is he masculine? Is he feminine? Which culture does he most identify with? Why has he turned his back on his country?10. Of course Peter O'Toole portrays Lawrence as a very effeminate man. He's homosexual, sexually repressed and sexually conflicted. This is a guy who's psyche is so damaged by being rejected and alienated that his ego compensates by writing its own history, by creating an image of himself as an 'epic hero', the 'perfect man' who conquers nations and rallies thousands behind him. Watch how he admits to being sexually aroused by guns and sadomasochism, but reacts violently when a foreign General makes homosexual advances toward him. It's almost as though Lawrence's entire 'hero persona' simply extends from this timid guy's desire to assert his own sexuality.11. The film is suffused with sexual innuendos and homosexual jabs, ranging from subtle lines ('That's not the kind of man I am!') to more blatant signals (Lawrence dancing alone, obsessed with shaving etc).12. Interesting too is the way Lean and screenwriter Robert Bolt turn Lawrence's masochism into a kind of psycho-sexual anti-war statement. After taking part in a massacre, Lawrence slowly turns his back on his masters. 'War is the villain of the piece,' screenwriter Robert Bolt would say years later, 'for it takes this fine and hardy man and turns his own best qualities against him, filling him with revulsion for himself.' 13. The film is often praised for its visuals, but few mention how innovative Lean's sound design is. Lean uses the wind as music, makes excellent use of ambient or incidental noises and uses bubbles of silence to create some extraordinary moments of tension. He creates a wonderful aural tapestry.8.5/10 – This may be the gayest epic of all time.",Null,11,18,19 November 2009
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Wild Things Deux
","'Filmmakers like Spielberg actually pride themselves on 'telling a good story' in this children's-book sense of the phrase. The great works of literature — Huckleberry Finn, Paradise Lost, Shakespeare's plays — are not reducible to their plots. Only hacks like O. Henry and Christie confused narrative art with 'telling a good story' in Spielberg's sense.' - Peter Greenaway'Making a sequel to anything is just a cheap carny trick.' - Steven Spielberg (1978)All the 'Jurassic Park' movies waste a great premise and squander brilliant special effects. Whilst Michael Crichton updated Arthur Conan Doyle's 'The Lost World' (Doyle's 'Lost World' has been in the public domain for many years, allowing both Crichton and Spielberg to utilise its title without paying license fees) by turning Doyle's 1912 dino-quest into a techno-thriller about the confrontation between a mechanistic and indeterministic universe, Spielberg simply opts to go for empty bubble gumThe result is a 73 million dollar movie which doesn't make much sense. A dinosaur rampaging through a city? Why not! A black teen acrobat? Who cares! A T-Rex eating passengers on a cramped ship? F**k the laws of physics!But in a way, the shameless stupidity of the whole thing is quite endearing. Yes, there are many interesting things you could do with this franchise, but Spielberg doesn't care. He's serving up Harryhausen with pixels, banking on the fact that his audience is too young to remember 'King Kong', 'The Lost Continent', Irwin Allen's 'The Lost World', 'Godzilla', 'The Lost Continent', 'The Valley of Gwangi', 'Reptilicus', 'When Dinosaurs Ruled The Earth', 'Gorgo', 'The Giant Claw', 'Gamera', 'Planet of the Dinosaurs', 'Behemoth', 'The Beast from 20,000 fathoms' and countless other scifi/dino films that played on TV when he was a kid.Like 'Indiana Jones' and 'Close Encounters', this is thus a resurrection of 50s junk and pulp adventure, jazzed up by modern technology and funded by a budget that dwarfs the gross domestic earnings of Cuba. Cue a couple iconic, beautifully crafted action sequences – a Velociraptor attack in the grass, a couple wrangling sessions, a T-Rex encounter in the rain, a King Kongian ship which leads to a Godzillian city brawl – and you have a nice little homage.Only it's not little. This beast moves with the baggage of transnational corporation. Toy tie-ins, lunch boxes, a plot hastily constructed to sucker an audience....the film isn't an 'amusement park ride' trying to pass itself off as a 'film', it's a piece of corporate cynicism passing itself off as an 'amusement park ride'. Thematically the film is also several levels dumber than its predecessor, which was itself several levels dumber than both Crighton novels. Themes of parental love and conservationism are all that's present, the former handled better elsewhere in Spielberg's filmography, the later hypocritical considering Dreamworks plans to pave over wetlands to build a studio. At times the film seems to want to contrast the empathy of its merry band of scientists with a big-game hunter who seeks only to take down a T-Rex (effectively reversing the themes in the original 'Jurassic Park', dinosaur becoming unhinged science, lowly man with rifle being man's primal urge to survive), but unfortunately he's dispatched early on. Wouldn't you love to see a film revolving around him? Still, at his best, Spielberg serves as a conduit to a certain brand of 50's fantasy. Instead of King Kong ascending up the Empire State Building or the climax of 'Gorgo', in which icons of the British Empire fall before a monster's maternal rampage, Spielberg gives us a T-Rex stomping through a neon-lit gas station. Those films brought fantastical dreams to the city, Spielberg brings them to the suburbs.7.9/10 – 'War of the Worlds' has rendered most of Spielberg's previous action scenes obsolete, but there are still a couple great sequences here. One nevertheless wishes for more imagination. All Spielberg's films are retro-remakes, and aside from the solid state effects of 'The Beast from 20,000 fathoms' or 'The Valley of Gwangia' being replaced with digital models, there's nothing new here.Worth two viewings.",Null,0,1,10 May 2010
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Hulk Smash!
","Fans burnt by George Lucas' 'Phantom Menace' found solace in Ang Lee's cosily straightforward 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon'. The film was greeted with a shrug in China (it was a flop), a country desensitised to wuxia tales, but Westerners loved it. Probably because 'Tiger' is basically 'Star Wars', with its own assortment of bounty-hunters, Jedis, Sith Lords, princesses, rogues, warriors, villains, henchmen, Yodas, fairy tale romances, teachers, masters, apprentices, chosen ones and much vague talk of destiny, fate and 'light' and 'dark' sides. When he's not indulging in super choreographed action sequences, Lee's aesthetic is also very Lucasy, which is to say, very John Ford, very David Lean, very Kurosawa, with clean lines, big open spaces, and simple but careful shot selection. What's strange is the film's budget. The film looks like it has the budget of one of those big, state backed Chinese or Stalinist productions, but 'Crouching' was made for about fifteen million dollars. Lee gets a lot of mileage out of his budget.Martial arts fans abhor 'Tiger'. It's too geared to western tastes, too watered down, and China's been churning out similar wuxia for decades. Why should this one get all the credit? But Lee does put his own spin on the material. His film is more sensual, poetic, graceful, romantic, has a mysterious beauty, and is more delicate than is typical of the genre. His female characters are also given a bigger role than is customary and his action at times seems more like expressive dance.Repression, restrictions, strict moral codes and self-control are an obsession with Lee. With 'Hulk' we had a scientist who struggles to curb his anger, his 'Taking Woodstock', 'Wedding Banquet' and 'Brokeback Mountain' revolved around characters repressing their homosexuality, while 'Sense and Sensibility', 'Lust Caution', 'Ice Storm' and 'Woodstock' again all hinged on either repression, free expression or the inhibiting of desire. In 'Crouching's' case – the title itself refers to 'one who has hidden, suppressed talents' - we have a stifled three-way love between characters called Mu Bai, Shu Lien and Jen Yu, all of whom are prohibited from desire by strict moral/social codes, feudal customs and warrior traditions.The rejection of these codes is perhaps why the film was shunned by China (and is so popular with western women). Chinese mythology, Taoist philosophy and the hokey 'mysticism' of Asian martian arts films (akin to 'Star Wars'' 'The Force'), all stress an esoteric mode of detachment, a form of denial characteristic of Eastern thought in which the world is seen to be illusory and detached cogitation is seen to be the path to enlightenment. Lee, in contrast, is trading in a more genteel, Western sensibility; a kind of romantic humanism where one is called to ditch Eastern stoicism and embrace the 'reality' and 'meaning' of human attachments in this life. This tug-of-war is epitomised by a trio of conversations located in each of the film's three acts. In the first, characters called Mu Bai and Shu Lien, who we learn have long had feelings for each another but have denied these feelings to pursue the demands of a Wudan warrior lifestyle, discuss the fact that Mu Bai, when meditating, reaches not 'the bliss of enlightenment' but 'a place of endless sorrow'. For Mu Bai, passions cannot be extinguished and only serve to increase the pull of desire. Mu Bai's conflict – the way clinging to personal affection is contrary to his Wudan ways of detachment – can be found even in Lucas' 'Star Wars' prequels, only there Lucas has some monastic ninja kid literally moan about the way his calling prevents him from losing his virginity ('Me want make sexy time but Yoda say no! Wah Wah Wah!').The second conversation occurs at the film's midpoint, when Mu Bai and Shu Lien finally touch. 'Shu Lien,' he recoils, 'the things we touch have no permanence. My master would say there is nothing we can hold onto in this world. Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real.' Shu Lien then brushes aside his Taoism with direct, naive realism: 'Not everything is an illusion. My hand is real.' It's in the third conversation that the film breaks away from your typical martial arts movie mysticism and repudiates Wudan philosophy. Here, Mu Bai is dying and Shu Lien urges him to meditate: 'Free yourself of this world. Let your soul rise to eternity. Do not waste your breath on me.' 'I have already wasted my life,' Mu Bai responds. 'I would rather be a ghost drifting by your side, as a condemned soul, than enter heaven without you.' Contrast this with the countless marital arts movies, or even the 'Star Wars' franchise, which end with the ghostly spirits of dead warriors, monks and masters hovering contently over the living. Mu Bai is given no supernatural reprieve, no higher plane of existence. He just dies. The film then ends with the recounting of a mountain legend in which a young woman must paradoxically 'float away and never return' if she wishes to 'return'. The whole film hinges on a similar paradox: acting on a desire one desires not to have. It's the paradox of Buddhism: continually desiring to eliminate desire, whereby satiating desire is impossible and it is ultimately desire which blocks the road to desirelessness. This is contrasted with a more Western hedonism, where the hedonist attempts the cessation of desire by 'giving in' to them all.Beyond all this, the film resembles the works of King Hu, Ozu and Ichikawa, the latter two only insofar as it contrasts straitjacketed older generations, and their societal obligations, with oppositional, younger generations. The film's ending suggests that a character called Jen sacrifices her life/love so that Mu Bai and Shu Lien may finally be together.8.5/10 – Worth two viewings.",Null,13,18,8 May 2012
Mr. Nobody," The Cosmic Orphan
","Directed by Jaco Van Dormael, 'Mr Nobody' stars Jared Leto as an elderly man who reminisces about his past life. The film's big gimmick, however, is this: Leto's character is able to see what his life would have been like had he made different choices as a child, teenager and adult. Dormael's film thus contains several overlapping narratives, in which we witness as each of Jared's 'lifetimes' unfold.Dormael's film pretends to be about chaos, chance, choice and indeterminism, but ultimately does something else. His film, at times overtly, at times covertly, believes in fate, true love, right choices and the comfortable closure afforded by destiny. His film panders to the ego, and bows down to man's ability to choose, make rational decisions and be self-directed. It is a paean to free-agency, and almost every aesthetic and narrative choice either intentionally or unintentionally undermines the more horrific aspects of existentialism. Indeed, though the film pretends to be about a mankind suffocated by the sheer weight of possibility, the actual 'options' presented to Leto are small-minded, and mostly have to do with sex.Resolutely postmodern, 'Mr Nobody' is comprised of a series of self-contained, busily directed vignettes, most of which are evocative of similar and better films. As the film's realities and time-lines shift, so to does Dormael's style. Bizarrely for a film about 'complexity', each time-line is comprised of a fairly simple, generic story, each with many overly dramatic moments (lots of explosions and deaths). To make matters worse, Leto's character (called Nemo, Latin for 'no man') is always aware that he is 'experiencing a different time-line', which leads to our hero looking perpetually confused. Better to have each time-line completely separate from the other, with no 'bleeding' between each of the film's multiple universes.Indeterminism, incidentally, is the bedrock of film noir. Influenced by the birth of 20th century existentialism, early noirs traditionally watched as poor schmucks were yanked about by a conspiratorial cosmos, poked and prodded like puppets on string. A noir like Kubrick's 'The Killing', for example, which utilises a fractured narrative somewhat similar to 'Mr Nobody's', is exclusively about a character who attempts to control his life, only to see it veer off into surprising and unsuspecting directions. Each of his actions have a billiard-ball effect, each choice inciting a causal chain of reactions. Kubrick's hero, exasperated by the universe's law of derailment, eventually gives up with an 'Eh, what's the point?'. Dormael's climax espouses the opposite.5/10 – Worth one viewing.",Null,2,5,4 December 2013
Bolt," Lasseter goes to Disney
","'The Truman Show' meets 'Toy Story', 'Bolt' is a fun animated film about a dog who, believing himself to be a superhero, goes on a quest to rescue his owner from exploitative Hollywood pencil pushers. It's a fast paced, fun little flick, more entertaining than Pixar's 'Up', but lacking the sense of adventure and wonder that made 'Toy Story' so memorable.This project was started by Disney, but then taken over by Pixar chiefs who reworked the story to better fit the 'Pixar Formula', which is really just Campbell's 'Hero's Journey' (some hero leaves his protective environment and discovers a bigger world outside his familiar surroundings) with a Pixar twist. That twist is, the hero chooses to return to the smaller world after learning some message of personal growth or societal revolution. Here the message template is 'Finding Nemo', the dog learning that he can survive out there in the real world (ocean) and be a hero without having to rely on movie special effects (daddy). It's corny moralising, probably even damaging, but it affects audiences on a primal level all the same.7.9/10 – More fun than 'Up', though I can't see this holding up with repeated viewings.",Null,0,2,16 April 2010
Frozen," That's no blizzard. That's my sister.
","'Any woman who chooses to behave like a full human being should be warned that the armies of the status quo will treat her as something of a dirty joke. She will need her sisterhood.' - Gloria Steinem An animated feature by Walt Disney Studios, 'Frozen' stars Idina Menzel as Elsa, a young queen who hides the fact that she possesses cryokinetic powers. Ashamed of who she is, and filled with self-loathing, Elsa spends her life in isolation. Worried about Elsa is Princess Anna (Kristen Bell), Elsa's younger sister.'Frozen's' second act finds Elsa's secret being revealed to the citizens of her kingdom. With her secret out, Elsa promptly embraces who she is, the once timid girl becoming a sexy and assertive spokesperson for raging cryo-femininity. Owning her identity, and singing 'Let it Go' with lungs like trumpets, Elsa begins to strut her stuff like a MTV diva. You go girl!Disney typically offers a rather puritanical, sexist and classist take on romance. In 'Frozen', however, these conventions are toyed with and then rejected. We the audience are manipulated into expecting a conventional prince-saves-damsel-in-distress climax, only to get something a bit different. In the end, it is the 'true love' which exists between sisters, women and girls that rescues our cast from loneliness and doom. The film doesn't reject men, or heteronomative love, but presents sororal love on equal or greater terms. Like most recent Walt Disney Features, 'Frozen' thinks children are stupid. The film is aggressively manic, believes its audience has short attention spans, holds no shot for longer than a few moments, and lacks even an once of thematic, visual or emotional subtlety. 'Frozen's' camera moves fast, characters are incessantly yapping and patience is presented as the ultimate vice. Graceless, frenetic and reluctant to let any scene breathe, the film doesn't so much talk down to kids, as treat them as easily distracted morons. Why, Disney? Why fill a film with gorgeous spaces, places and compositions, only to hack at each with an editor's knife?Disney has made a number of quasi-feminist works ('Brave' and 'Mulan' in particular). 'Frozen' itself works as a broad allegory for the acceptance of everything from homosexuality to femininity to personal idiosyncrasies. These admirable traits, however, are increasingly diluted by Elsa's behaviour. In the world of 'Frozen', 'being true to yourself' and 'unleashing your personality' ultimately means becoming a skinny white chick who lives in a castle and dances like a fashion model/pop-star. The film doesn't usher the isolated, alienated and insecure out of their shells, it tells them to step out only if they look like Taylor Swift. Elsewhere 'Frozen' continues Disney's creepy infatuation with dead parents, feudalism, divine rights, absolute rule and monarchy. Hayao Miyazaki animated 'Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind' in 1984. Despite a talented, brave and at times insecure girl at its centre, the film didn't feel any need to get on a soap-box or self-reflexively flash its 'feminist' credentials. Simply interested in good characters, Miyazaki treats the 'tenets' of feminism as being implicitly understood. Virtually all of Miyazaki's subsequent films, and those produced by his animation studio ('Only Yesterday', 'From Up on Poppy Hill', 'The Secret World of Arrietty'), feature similar portrayals of girls or women. Disney, in contrast, cannot help but turn each of its modern female characters into a blatant mission statement. Disney's modern women/girls aren't characters so much as they are a neurotic mega-corporation's attempts at penance. Inspired by Hans Christian Andersen, the film was written and co-directed by Jennifer Lee. 7.9/10 – Better recent animated films: Chomet's 'The Illusionist', Hosoda's 'The Girl Who Leapt Through Time', 'Summer Wars', 'Only Yesterday', 'The Secret World of Arrietty', Oshii's 'The Sky Crawlers', 'From Up on Poppy Hill' and Yeon Sang-ho's 'The King of Pigs'.

2012," Zillion dollar globe smash
","'There is one spectacle grander than the sea, that is the sky; there is one spectacle grander than the sky, that is the interior of the soul.' –Victor Hugo Roland Emmerich directs '2012', a loose remake of 'When Worlds Collide' and his own disaster flicks, 'The Day After Tomorrow', '10,000 BC', 'Godzilla' and 'Independence Day' (whole chunks of this film are stolen from 'Independence Day').The film is interesting for at least seven reasons. Firstly, it's strange to see a quirky actor like John Cusack in a fairly straight-faced action hero role. Secondly, despite the copious amounts of CGI on display, this is old school carnage, Emmerich having no time for the shaky cams and pseudo documentary stances of Spielberg's 'War Of The Worlds', Bay's 'Transformer' movies or fare like 'Cloverfield' and 'The Mist'. Call it by-the-books 'end of the world classicism' and you'd be right, but also a dick.The third interesting thing is the film's subtle spiritual and political vein. Emmerich adopts a strange anti-Christian, anti-Catholicism, anti-Western, pro-Eastern, pro-Buddhist, pro-African/'cradle-of-life' tone, and jettisons his usual fondness for America's military and political prowess in favour for a world in which Western figureheads are all religious fanatics and selfish idiots and the Chinese are the new global superpower, fairly righteous, technologically advanced and with an economy robust enough to save the planet. Of course we shouldn't be surprised by this. Bad artists shift with the winds of change, great artists are so far ahead you don't see them making waves.The fourth interesting thing about the film is its sheer hypocrisy. This is a film which urges us to cherish human life but which treats life supremely cold-heartedly, Emmerich knocking off characters and killing millions, not only for our amusement, but without any emotional weight or visible moral concern. The way a Russian woman is killed in the final act, and then swiftly forgotten, is the kind of thing a better director would turn into satire, or use to make a critical point, but for Emmerich she's just another special effect to be used and discarded.The fifth interesting thing is the way the film continues Emmerich's fondness for naming films after dates. 'Independence Day', '2012, 'The Day After Tomorrow'...the guy's filmography is a calendar on steroids.The sixth interesting thing about the film is the way '2012' relentlessly taps into the noir universe. This is disaster movie meets Philip Marlowe (the hero is a writer – pay attention to the books in the film), the film's predestined cataclysm mercilessly bearing down on mankind. Nature's the ultimate femme fatale, always hungry and always in heat.The seventh interesting thing is the sheer banality of the film's CGI. Modern lust's for spectacle can no longer be satisfied. It is not only that spectacle is dead - and soon the concept of the 'spectator' itself - but that audiences are increasingly aware that spectacle can provide nothing. There's a blankness, a flatness, an emptiness, to today's spectacle. It is dead, soulless. But this soulnessness is not a new thing, but a shift in awareness, a realisation that today's spectacular fabric of 1s and 0s can quench nothing, nor can the solid state sfx of the past. Like an old man clinging to his youth by pathetically indulging in flashy sports cars, the exponentially bigger and glossier explosions of these films, everything from 'Avatar' to '2012', cover up something truly pitiable. Emmerich destroys the world and no one bats an eyelid. Why should they? Able to plug into simulational, interactive console carnage, New Man's too wired to be fazed. But interactive communities don't bridge the gap, they slice it up and multiply it. There it is..now its gonethen it's back. Triangle. Square. Circle. Enter. Space. No Esc.7.5/10 – If we don't compare it to Spielberg's 'War of the Worlds', in which calculated calamity is served with superiority, '2012' offers fairly good popcorn entertainment. Still, Emmerich's films tend to age badly. Will Smith helps 'Independence Day' hold up today, but even that film's SFX now look strangely quaint.Worth two viewings.

Across the Universe," Breakfast on Pluto
","'Across the Universe' is a fairly unique, visually inventive film. Some initial thoughts...1. This film attempts to encapsulate the 60s (the Vietnam war, drugs, draftees, sexual liberation, hippies and other topical issues) by splicing karaoke versions of the Beatles songs onto a fairly clichéd love story.2. The Beatles weren't about topicality. Why use them? They were a safe band compared to many of the other musicians of the era.3. Neil Jordan's 'Breakfast on Pluto', which uses pop music to interpret Irish history, did this stuff in a much more personal manner. See also Todd Haynes's 'Velvet Goldmine' and Ken Russell's 'Tommy'.4. The film uses various codes of the 1960s - passion, activism, idealism, disenfranchisement and rebellion - as a kind of operatic Iraq War allegory, the hopelessness of the Vietnam War seeping into the Middle East four decades later, precisely because the psychedelic landscape of the film has been bulldozed and replaced with, not only disinterest and apathy, but (why not?) bubble gum pop.5. The film's cast is made up to subtly resemble famous figures of the era (Hendrix, Joplin, McCartney). Other references (the Beatles' rooftop concert, Hendrix's formation of The Experience, Joplin's break up from Big Brother and the Holding Company) are far more esoteric, and will likely go over the heads of most audience members.6. Why does a film that celebrates rebellion stick so faithfully to the standard 'boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy wins girl' storyline? 7. The songs are mostly flat, lacking any sort of magic. And yet..'Across the Universe' is such a visually audacious film, director Julie Taylor (exstatic at being given this budget) treating us to an orgy of zany camera work and super choreographed sequences. Almost every shot positions our eye in an interesting place, exploiting space and architecture in a variety of clever ways. The film's love story is also fairly sweet, and a bit unorthodox in the way it focuses on the beauty of the male lead (most of these romances are directed by men).7.9/10 - Worth one viewing.",Null,3,4,19 December 2009
The Mist," Shawshank debunked
","'I have nothing against religion...but religion cross-pollinates with politics. In both cases there's always somebody standing by to say, 'we have the answer.' - Stephen King We've seen this type of film before, but it does several interesting things which I found refreshing. Firstly, it's a direct assault on all those Christian fundamentalists who salivate over Darabont's earlier film, 'The Shawshank Redemption'. Secondly, it's a pretty interesting study of mob dynamics. Thirdly, it works as a nice counterpoint to Spielberg's 'War of the Worlds'.Following 9/11, we had a slew of films which tried to be 'socially relevant' by dealing with themes of 'terrorism' and 'fear'. America was under attack by some faceless enemy and so Hollywood directors responded by smuggling little socio-political themes into what would otherwise be brainless popcorn flicks.Spielberg's last few films offer perhaps the simplest way to observe this trend. 'Saving Private Ryan' was a loud and thoughtless film which served only to regenerate ugly pro-nationalist ideology. America is good. The enemy is bad. Die for the motherland.'Minority Report' was Spielberg's justification of the Patriot Act. You may wiretap our phones and spy on our lives, so long as you're righteous and moral. Then with 'War of the Worlds' Spielberg painted America as being the victims of technologically advanced 'sleeper cell terrorists', the aliens embedded within our own home soils, ready and waiting to strike. Finally there was 'Munich', Spielberg's big 'let's forget about the past and all get along'.In Hollywood, Spielberg (because of his phenomenal shooting speed) is usually 2 years ahead of the curve. So when he hit us with 'War of the Worlds' in 2005, it took a further 2 years for other artists to create terror allegories of their own. 'No Country for Old Men', 'In the Valley of Elah', 'Cloverfield', 'The Mist', 'Dark Knight', 'Lions for Lambs', 'Michael Clayton' etc etc. All these films tried to be serious by injecting faint 9/11 subtext. Most will age badly because they're so short sighted.'The Mist' is basically an R rated 'War of the Worlds'. Both films begin with a mysterious and violent lightning storm, involve strange creatures attacking a family unit, and end with a 'shocking' scene involving a son. Darabont includes several nods to Spielberg's film: giant tripod like creatures, rolling clouds of dust/mist, family vans, ominous alien horns, military convoys etc.But while both films have a similar structure, both artists have completely different interests. Spielberg loves building action sequences. Darabont, in contrast, loves dialogue and characters. While 'The Mist's' action sequences and CGI effects are pretty inept, the human interactions are quite riveting. For Darabont, human beings can be as bad or worse than the alien nightmares that hunt them. He's interested in mob dynamics and how human beings regress and organise themselves under extreme stress.Darabont also rights the wrong at the end of Spielberg's film. While Spielberg couldn't resist bringing Tom Cruise's son back to life, Darabont has his hero shoot his own son dead. Better to die to a family bullet than at the hands of the enemy.With this killing, 'The Mist' presents the flip-side of Darabont's earlier film, 'The Shawshank Redemption'. 'Shawshank' was about maintaining hope in the face of adversity. 'The Mist' is about the consequences of losing hope.In 'Shawshank', Tim Robbins begins to despair, but slowly regains faith. In 'Mist', the hero loses all hope and kills his family in order to ease their suffering. After their death, he learns that they would have been saved had they remained hopeful just several minutes longer.Tim Robbin's has become a sort of a poster-boy for Christian fundamentalists, who see his trials in 'Shawshank' as a kind of Christian suffering. He's persecuted, but faithfully absorbs his worldly punishment. He knows that if he waits just a bit longer, he'll be freed from prison and rewarded for his faith. In 'The Mist', the main 'evil' in the film is a crazy woman (Marcia Gay Harden) who uses fear as a religious tool. If the townsfolk have faith in her, she says, they will be freed from the evil monsters. Ironically, at the end of the film, this crazy woman is shown to be right. The townsfolk who obey her, ultimately survive.But Darabont's point is that hope is a natural thing and should not be prostituted to religion. Religious hope requires prerequisites (ie following a murderous, crazy lady). So the film presents two scenarios, and labels them both wrong. Following the crazy lady is wrong (patriotism/religious indoctrination) and giving up all hope is wrong (defeatism/suicide). Thus, Darabont is drawing us toward the third option. The townsfolk would have survived, had they simply stayed quietly in the store, like Tim Robbins, silently hopeful. But Darabont isn't only preaching hopeful inaction. He preaches hopeful action as well, by inserting a symbolic mother figure who bravely steps out into the Mist, hoping to find her child. Significantly, everyone in the group refused to help this mother. She stands alone, and thus has the strongest faith. At the end of the film, we see her with her child.The fact that Christians have protested this film and shown great disappointment in the way the Marcia Gay Hayden character was treated, just goes to show how successful Darabont was in countering their false reading of 'The Shawshank Redemption'.8/10 - Shot on a low budget using a cheap TV crew, 'The Mist' works as a cross between 'Dawn of the Dead' and 'War of the Worlds'. Yes, the CGI 'action sequences' are crap, but the human drama is pretty effective. PS- the film needs to be watched in black and white, as originally intended. It's far more effective when viewed this way.Worth two viewings.",Null,3,7,24 August 2008
The Elephant Man," The Killing of the Unicorn
","In 1980, Playboy Playmate Dorothy Stratten was killed by Paul Snider, a Canadian pimp. Snider tortured and disfigured Dorothy's body, before shooting her in the face with a shotgun. Prior to her death, film director Peter Bogdanovich had planned to marry Stratten. As a tribute to his dead lover he published 'The Killing of the Unicorn', a book in which he holds not just Snider responsible for Dorothy's death, but the entire Playboy empire, and states that, far from a dopey sex object, Dorothy was an intelligent and scholarly woman who had a fondness for the biography of John Merrick, otherwise known as The Elephant Man.Bogdanovich believed that Dorothy identified with Merrick precisely because they were both judged primarily on externals: Dorothy as a one dimensional sex object, Merrick as a hideous beast. Both their inner selves were buried beneath society's perceptions of their physicality.It is this event which lead to Bogdanovich directing 'Mask', a film about a boy called Rocky Dennis. Rocky suffered from a sclerotic bone disorder, an ailment which caused severe deformations of his skull. Like David Lynch's 'The Elephant Man', Bogdanovich's film thus attempts to portray the inner beauty of a character who is hideous on the outside.But what makes 'Mask' important is that Bogdanovich has inserted into his film all the historical episodes that were missing from Lynch's. Merrick's desire to visit a home for the blind, a real-life subplot missing from 'The Elephant Man', is turned into Rocky's budding sexuality and romance with a blind girl. Lynch's omittance of Merrick's father (a man who abandoned Merrick due to the ordeal of raising such an ill boy), becomes the caring but often absent father of 'Mask'. Similarly, while the 'outcasts' of Elephant Man were all nasty circus owners and ridiculously caricatural thugs, Bogdanovich surrounds Rocky with gangs of bikers and drug users who, because they are outcasts themselves, are able to identify, empathise and care for Rocky.The result is that, through these reversals, Rocky Dennis slowly emerges as a believable three-dimensional character, whilst Lynch's John Merrick never develops beyond a superficial object designed to illicit our pity. Scene after scene, like Jesus in Mel Gibson's 'The Passion of The Christ', we watch as Merrick is abused by cartoonish villains who exist solely to beat him up. Such bullying is the cheapest way to garner pity.Taunted by crowds at a train station, abused by his circus owner, and constantly harassed by a lecherous mob of ugly lower class rascals, 'The Elephant Man' amounts to nothing more than one of those slick advertisements by UNICEF or PETA. Look at these starving Somalian children, why not donate a dollar? Look at those abused and abandoned pets, why not offer your support? Look at John Merrick being beaten, why not shed a tear? While Rocky goes out into the world every day, struggling to survive, Merrick is an entirely passive character, hidden in a hospital room. While Rocky uses wit, humour and perseverance to overcome his handicaps, Merrick seems to magically acquire his intellectual and artistic abilities from nowhere. In short, Rocky actively schemes to obtain a life whilst Merrick is entirely passive, always accepting gifts and donations from others. Rocky is a fighter, Merrick is a charity case who just wants to be tolerated for who he is.But the true connection between all men is one of empathy born of mutual suffering, rather than a compassion born of freedom from the virtual hold of an absolute Other. Why then are so many problems perceived as problems of intolerance and not as problems of inequality, exploitation and injustice? Why is the proposed remedy always tolerance and sympathy, rather than emancipation, political struggle, even armed struggle? Tolerance, by definition, builds walls between people. The act of tolerating is itself an act of admittance that there is some difference, some wrongness, present, which is why modern life is increasingly compartmentalised. In contrast, compassion borne of mutual struggle is an act of deep connection. Of tearing down walls.Actual universality is not the feeling that, above all differences, different people share the same basic values, rather, actual universality appears as the experience of negativity, of the inadequacy of a particular identity. A better formula would thus be: in spite of our differences, we can identify the basic antagonism or antagonistic struggle in which we are both caught, so let us share our intolerance and join forces in the same struggle.By removing the personal struggle, Lynch has turned Merrick into a unicorn: a beautiful myth. Lynch overstates Merrick's inner beauty, treating him as a metaphysical object (he memorises the Bible, builds model cathedrals, is polite, well spoken and absorbed into heaven when he dies), refusing to show how he thinks, how he copes, what motivates him or why he behaves the way he does. Merrick is a one-dimensional character, almost like Jesus, floating through the film, absorbing the sins of all the nasty humans and then dying. The real 'Elephant Man' committed suicide. Why reduce all these interesting existential struggles down to run ins with gangs of ugly thugs? The differences between 'Mask' and 'Man' can best be seen in how the 'caretakers' are treated in each film. Rocky is cared for by his mother, a woman who is viewed as a slut, druggie and whore by both family and society, but who is revealed to be beautiful through her struggles. In contrast, see how Lynch has Hopkins identify with the gangs and circus owners who prey on Merrick; one film mythologizes, the other demythologises.7.5/10 - Pure sentimentalism. Despite its beautiful cinematography 'The Elephant Man' is a predictable film which telegraphs its intentions, emotions and plot at every turn. It's a middlebrow 'it's what's inside that counts' message movie with nothing narrative-wise to separate it from similar fare like 'The Mighty' or 'Simon Birch'. Watch 'The Wild Child' or Bogdanovich's 'Mask' instead.",Null,7,12,9 March 2009
The Bourne Legacy," The Sin Eaters
","'At the root of Bond is something neo-fascistic and totally materialist.' - John Le Carre The Bourne franchise stars Matt Damon as Jason Bourne, a kind of anti-James Bond who, though a secret agent trained by the CIA, finds himself turning his back on his murderous past and waging a clandestine war against Treadstone, a Black-Ops arm of the US military.As action movies go, 'The Bourne Identity' is stronger than most. The best of its franchise, 'Identity' features a number of low-key and inventive action sequences, most of which involve our hero using brains rather than brawn. Bourne's quick thinking, unpredictable and stays several steps ahead of his pursuers, the opposite of Bond, who's always playing catch up.The film's sequels, 'The Bourne Supremacy' and 'The Bourne Ultimatum', merely rehash the franchise's first film, emulating its 'running man' plot and attempting to mimic its action sequences, blow for blow. What was once fresh quickly becomes stale, and Bourne's 'ingenious' battle tactics now rarely surprise. Still, both films contain a number of subplots which aren't usually found in Western action movies. Here Bourne, once a state sanctioned assassin, tracks down the victims of his past and attempts to atone for his sins. Elsewhere he colludes with whistle-blowers and left-wing newspapers (The Guardian, itself slowly dying in real life), attempting to expose a CIA which routinely engages in off-the-grid criminal activities (in real life, they'd brazenly assassinate the leaders of, or engender coups in, Congo, Morocco, Jamaica, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Mozambique, Guyana etc). This is a far cry from James Bond ('Goldfinger', we recall, opens with Bond blowing up the oil supplies of Latin American revolutionaries). Bond's the Imperialist's, misogynistic foot-soldier, Bourne's a disillusioned grunt in an age of Bradley Manning, Jullian Assange and John Kiriakou, which of course makes him a threat. As journalist Kevin Gosztola observed, 'To this day, the only CIA officer to go to jail for torture is now officially an officer who blew the lid on torture and who never tortured anybody.' Bourne is himself both whistle-blower and action hero. A John Rambo for liberals, his journey is one from forgetfulness and a kind of cultural amnesia, to direct confrontation. He attempts to expose and remember, whilst the CIA attempts to cover up and silence. This aligns the franchise with 1970s political conspiracy thrillers; the State is the enemy, and Bourne's a loaded weapon aimed at his own former employer. Indeed, when pitted against foreign agents, Bond repeatedly says 'my argument is not with you'. Unlike Bond, a relic of the Cold War, Bourne's decidedly post-Cold War. Bond's always had a very rigid sense of self-identity ('The name's Bond. James Bond.'). Bourne, though, doesn't remember his name, his past, his identity, and carries a satchel full of passports with faces he doesn't recognise. The locales our globe-trotting hero visits are similarly blurred and indistinguishable; everywhere looks the same. Bourne's both representative of a culture that doesn't really know what it stands for, and one which can't morally reconcile its post and pre amnesic identities.Whilst a 'liberal action film' is some kind of contradiction (the inevitable glorification and aesthetizisation of violence etc), the Bourne franchise nevertheless does atypical things. Women are consistently the film's moral guardians, Bourne symbolically turns books and pens into action weapons, the series goes out of its way to portray water boarding as an abhorrent act which leads to utter dehumanisation (water and water-boarding, continual motifs in the franchise, led to the very creation of Bourne) and Bourne himself is explicitly obsessed with 'what represents me?' (and by extension, America). While Bond's your typical spy hero designed to bolster faith in crown, country and offshore escapades, the Bourne franchise ultimately deals with Bourne accepting the responsibility for his own moral corruption; he chose to be Jason Bourne. He is culpable.No surprise then that Doug Liman, who directed 'Identity', has a father who was chief counsel for the senate in the Iran-Contra Affair. And Paul Greengrass, director of 'Supremacy' and 'Ultimatum', is himself a left-leaning Cambridge graduate and political documentary filmmaker.The most interesting of the franchise, 'The Bourne Legacy' was released in 2012. It starred Jeremy Renner as Aaron Cross, another Black-Ops CIA agent. The film again rehashes the Bourne formula – Cross is pursued by the CIA, who again want him silenced – but also does a number of interesting, new things. It's explicitly concerned, for example, with issues of collusion and participation. How can organisms like Bourne and Bond exist, if not for the complicity of whole swathes of society? In 'Legacy's' case, Cross maps a network of globe-spanning factory workers, scientists, politicians, engineers, all of whom contribute to the workings of an illegal CIA project. Fascism, then, depends on a complex mix of unconscious complicity, ignorance, compartmentalisation, collusion, separation, disavowal and outright secrecy. When the CIA project – Operation Outcome – is exposed, it then quickly evaporates, like shadow exposed to light. Members are hunted down, agents are 'suicided', and scientists are reassigned or murdered. Such murders recall countless historical events. Regimes, from Ancient Rome to even 21st century democratic states, tend to squelch intellectuals when fearful of exposure.As an action movie 'Legacy' is weak. A stupid last act and many moments derivative of its predecessors undermine its fairly serious first hour. The film contains sequences involving Predator Drones, now the weapon of choice for the US military when it comes to naked war crimes. Recent legislation essentially makes it 'legal' for such drones to assassinate brown and black skinned people. Accidentally killed civilian targets are then ipso-facto reclassified as 'terrorists', 'insurgents' or, as has happened several times, simply 'animals' (dogs or cows). Of course Bourne and Bond are themselves drones. But while Bourne wants escape, Bond's the kind of guy sent to silence him.8.5/10 - Worth one viewing.",Null,4,8,22 March 2013
School of Rock," And that's a magic number
","'I service society by rocking.' – Jack Black'School of Rock' is a crowd pleasing family movie in which a lazy bum (Jack Black) impersonates a substitute teacher, sneaks into a school and teaches music to a class of quirky fifth graders. Realizing that the students actually have musical potential, the bum signs them up to a Battle of the Bands music competition, the winner of which will win 20,000 dollars.For a film which encourages us to 'rebel like rockers' and 'stick it to the man', this film is ridiculously formulaic and about as 'anti-establishment' as a box of Oreos. The obstacles are clichéd, the characters are paper thin and the climax, in which the students lose the battle but win both our hearts and the cheers of a crowd, is straight out of, not only 'Rocky' and 'Sister Act', but every high-school and teen movie on the planet.And yet...the film has deservedly become a classic of sorts. Jack Black has never been better, his manic antics, Jack Nicholson eyebrows and musical talents put to good effect. The cast of kids is similarly infectious, Joan Cussak is cute, the soundtrack is catchy and director Richard Linklater, always reliable, manages to side-step most clichés in favour for subtle character moments and a healthy respect for both the powers of music and the educational ideals which are often lost in the pursuit of examination success.Mostly, though, the film is rather unique in that it gets its laughs without resorting to vulgarity, gross out humour (except for a stereotypical gay kid) or desperate antics. Rarely does a film aim for the 9 to 40 age group and pull things off. Now raise your goblet of rock and lift a toast to those who rock!8/10 – Some funny dialogue and antics by Jack Black, but mostly its the gentle direction of Richard Linklater which lifts this production. Watch how Black's other 'music vehicle', 'Tenacious D In the Pick of Destiny', failed completely with a hack director at the helm.Worth multiple viewings.",Null,3,5,20 May 2010
Kick-Ass," Tool up, honey bunny
","'Remember how, back in 1990, if you used a cellphone in public you looked like a total a**hole? We're all a**holes now.' – Douglas CouplandAsses get their asses kicked by asses in 'Kick-Ass', a film by director Matthew Vaughn. An attempt to take your routine super hero origins formula and push it into hipper, more 'offensive' territory, the film is nevertheless wholly tame, trying so hard to be shocking and transgressive that it's almost cute and docile. Like a puppy. Like most postmodern films, 'Kick-Ass' trades entirely in irony. You don't watch the film, so much as your neurons and synapses light up after spotting incongruities. Isn't it ironic that a 10 year old girl is killing adults? Isn't it ironic that gun savvy kids are in a R rated movie? Cue endorphins. Most super hero movies are power fantasies. 'Kick-Ass' is thus appropriately structured as both the masturbatory fantasies of a dweeby virgin who fondles himself in front of his computer screen, and the dying dreams of a comic book junkie. In other words, the kid's the audience. In this way, like most postmodern, self reflexive films, 'Kick-Ass' manages to pointlessly mock exactly what it is (think 'Sucker Punch'), exemplifying what Robert Pfaller calls 'interpassivity', performing our indictments for us whilst allowing us to consume with impunity.Some have condemned Vaughn's film for sexualising a ten year old girl, but the film's fan-boys brush off such ridiculous notions. She's just an empowered gal. You know? Like Wonder Woman, but without the always displayed boobs. In truth, violence always has a sexual element and vice versa. Today, most interactive gaming terminology – gaming now being the modern equivalent of violent action movies of yesteryear – utilises jargon rife with blatant sexual connotations (teabagging, raped!, owned!, hardcore mode, f****t, etc). Domination, possessiveness, sex, submission, bullets, perforations, superheroes, guns, little girls, Kleenex. They all overlap. Fanboys disagree? They threaten to ***k you up? Offer to prepare the lipstick and lube while they think of a better choice of words.'Kick-Ass' is praised for its mental action scenes and total bad-ass badassery. Ironically, most of these action scenes – especially 'Kick-Ass's' climax – are derived from Luc Besson's 'Leon', another film about prepubescent hit girls, Lolita complexes and big, gun-toting men. Also an influence is 'Kite', an X-rated mid 90s film with underage hit-girls who routinely get raped. The film was banned for being child pornography, which led to it being edited and re-released. Today 'Kick-ass' looks like 'Kite' with less balls, which is ironic, considering all these films are essentially about the insecurities of castrated little fan-boys.5/10 – Worth one viewing.",Null,3,9,22 May 2011
The Man Who Would Be King," Not gods – Englishmen! The next best thing!
","'I think it's one of the greatest adventure stories ever written!' – John Huston (on Rudyard Kipling's short story, 'The Man Who Would Be King') A glorious tall tale by director John Huston, 'The Man Who Would Be King' stars Michael Caine and Sean Connery as Peachy and Danny, a pair of ex-British Army Sergeants. Realizing that 19th century Imperialism is not designed to benefit the lowly foot-soldiers who enact the policies and mandates of the Empire, Peachy and Danny decide to become 'private Imperialists'; they resolve to conquer territory for their own personal gain.Huston made many films about rugged adventurers and affable scoundrels. Few of his rapscallions, though, are as much fun as Peachy and Danny who, in typical John Huston fashion, are seeking fame, fortune and adventures in exotic faraway lands. 'We're not little men,' they say with a smirk, 'and there's nothing we're afraid of!' Fittingly, Huston's film is structured as a 'tale within a tale', our heroes recounting a story to Rudyard Kipling (Christopher Plummer), the legendary writer upon whose novel the film is based. This technique allows Huston to adopt a very farcical tone: we're always aware that 'The Man Who Would be King' is a very TALL TALE, falsified and made larger than life by both the narrator (Michael Caine) and the man who in turn narrates the narrator's narration to us (Rudyard Kipling/John Huston).The film thus unfolds like a ridiculously embellished adventure, our heroes travelling over mountains, through Afghanistan and into the desert nation of Kafiristan. Their journey is absolutely preposterous ('Nobody's done that before!' Kipling growls in the film), but it's only the beginning.Once in Kafiristan, Danny and Peachy defeat a local army, conquer a castle, raise a militia and proceed to conquer yet more territory. By the film's end, our duo has an entire monastery believing that Danny's an ancient god and so deserving of their riches, women and adulation.Of course, like Huston's 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre', the good times eventually come crashing down. If 'King's' first half offers camaraderie, wit, and funny banter, its second half offers madness, egomania and eventually defeat; the natives of Kafiristan figure out that our rogues are con-artists, and promptly kick their butts out of Afghanistan. But even this defeat is taken with good cheer by our two rascals. They really are an infectious bunch.All adventurers need a side kick, and so Huston provides an ex-Burkha soldier called Billy Fish (Saeed Jaffery), a funny guy who serves as the interpreter and friend of our rogues. Fish spouts a ridiculous accent – a merger of British and Indian – and is constantly spewing an array of silly one liners.It's not all fun and games, though. Though the film can be enjoyed as a bouncy adventure, it can equally be viewed as a story of two men battling convention, naysayers and nature, as a comment on colonialism, as a psychological parable about greed and ambition and as a study of religion and the role it plays in certain cultures (as well as the way the very same faith which enables heroes to move mountains can quickly and easily lead to self delusion).Like many of Kipling's works, the film also critiques White Imperialism. This was, after-all, an Empire which stretched across the planet and which would be directly and indirectly responsible for billions of deaths. In Huston's hands, Danny and Peachy thus become a metaphor for the Empire's arrogance, brashly conquering territory, promoting itself as a saviour/god, misunderstanding customs, acting racist and pitting one tribe against the next, all in an attempt to wrestle away more wealth and control. Furthermore, the fact that our heroes are exposed as frauds and chased out of Kafiristan, strongly resembles the various revolutions that rocketed across the British Empire during the decade in which Kipling's tale was written (late 1880s). ie - the Empire came, saw, conquered, and then deservedly got kicked out of town.What's remarkable, though, is how sophisticated 'The Man Who Would be King' is compared to other similar films of the era. One must remember, the 1950s-70s were packed with films which attempted to rehabilitate the Age of Empire, and which attempted to white-wash and glorify British Imperialism ('Khartoum', 'Zulu', 'King of the Khyber Rifles', 'The Planter's Wife', 'Safari', 'North West Frontier', 'East of Sudan' etc). Countering these films were 'serious' directors like David Lean, Satyajit Ray, and straight-faced fare like 'Gandhi' and 'Guns at Batasi'. Huston, though, has made an anti-Imperialist adventure with the bounce of a 1930s-50s Imperialist lark. He pulls this off thanks largely to Michael Caine's performance and a subtly tongue-in-cheek script.8.9/10 – One of Huston's greatest films. See Pontecorvo's 'Burn', Herzog's 'Wrath of God', 'Goodbye Uncle Tom', 'Passage to India', 'Full Metal Jacket' and 'The Quiet American'. Worth two viewings.",Null,7,12,14 July 2010
Gran Torino," He ain't heavy, he's my brother
","In 1974 Don Siegel directed 'The Shootist', a film about an ageing gunslinger (John Wayne) who befriends a family, realises that he's dying of prostate cancer, becomes a mentor to a young boy and finally dies in a gunfight.Siegel made several films with Clint Eastwood, leading Eastwood to dedicate his 1992 western (Unforgiven) to his old mentor. Flash forward 3 decades and Eastwood releases 'Grand Torino', a virtual remake of 'The Shootist' and 'The Karate Kid'.Here Clint plays Walt Kowalski, a Korean War Veteran who lives in the suburbs of Michigan. Walt is a racist old man who hates his Hmong neighbours, insults his Catholic priest, can't stand his sons and moans about having killed Koreans during the war.The first half of 'Gran Torino' consists of cartoonish gangs harassing vulnerable little girls as they walk home from school. This provides ample opportunities for Walt to leap to the rescue on his surrogate horse, a battered pickup truck. Sillier still is when a young boy (Thao) is bullied by his cousin (Spider) and then harassed throughout the film for refusing to join their gang. Why would any gang want such a nerdy kid? Why would Spider abuse his own cousin? How could such a refusal possibly warrant a drive by shooting, and the other acts of violence portrayed in this film? From here on the film becomes a rehash of 'The Karate Kid', Walt becoming the wise mentor who helps Thao toughen up and become a man. He takes the kid under his wings, teaching him how to speak American, talk to girls, spew racist slurs, do manly yard work and wield a hammer. But Clint's view of masculinity is intentionally satirical, as it's in Walt's bonding sessions with the women next door than he truly becomes a man.Unfortunately those pesky gang members continue to harass poor Thao. After a violent drive by shooting, Walt decides to call the cops, but apparently this is a breech of the Hmong Code of Silence. As the local Hmong take care of their own affairs and resent the assistance of the cops, it is left to Clint to clean up the streets.The film ends with Clint provoking the gangsters into committing cold-blooded murder. Clint's sacrifice thus magically shatters the Hmong Code of Silence, causing the local Asian community to report the gangsters to the police. Such a U-turn is implausible, even by Hollywood standards, and serves only to give Clint a redemptive, Christ-like ending.And so Walt Kowalski, racist, bad father, murderer of Korean soldiers, gives his life to save an Asian family, thereby earning his redemption. It's all rather clichéd, 'Gran Torino' another in a long line of post 9/11 blame-taking movies. Films like 'Changing Lanes', 'House of Sand and Fog', 'The Visitor', 'Babel', 'Little Children', 'Crossing Over', 'The Interpreter', 'Monster's Ball', 'The Terminal', 'Towelhead' etc all hoped to counter American myopia, suggesting that Americans are not 'all alone' or 'the centre of the world'. These films ooze guilt, are shameful of spoilt Generation Xers who squander inherited luxury and seek to align the white middle class with the marginalized Other.Far more interesting is the film's critique of masculinity. Michigan was once wealthy and held the flagship factory of Henry Ford, but today is the site of some of the worst poverty in the US. Walt's love for his Gran Torino and the fact that he was once an automotive worker, implies that the fate of Walt and the dying of the industry are intertwined. Though he belongs to a traditionally masculine age (which is slowly withering and dying around him), Walt is impotent when it comes to dealing with his family. He's basically tough on the outside but weak (literally bleeding) on the inside. In contrast, the Hmongs are immigrants who are vulnerable on the outside, whilst at home they have the strength and solidarity that comes from their family unity and traditional values.To articulate this point, watch how Eastwood treats the two houses in the film. Walt's is spotless on the outside but withered on the inside, whilst the Hmongs' house is a mess on the outside, but packed with an abundance of joy on the inside.Walt's over-the-top racism and masculinity is an anachronism that hasn't helped him leave his dying neighbourhood, understand his children, religion, properly articulate his emotions, or even tell his son that he's dying. It is in connecting with the Hmong and sacrificing himself, that he is able to evolve.So the movie walks an interesting line between self-parody and social consciousness, managing to also paint a neat little battle between classic union labour and global capital, a system that has eliminated the American working class, killed off labour unions, and outsourced all jobs to foreigners. But as one character explains to Walt, though the Hmong fought on the American side during the Vietnam War, they were promptly abandoned when the war ended. All ethnicities (Asian and American) are thus equal fodder for exploitation. The Hmong and Walt were used and exploited by American imperialist interests, a fact which Walt ultimately learns. His attitudes toward race and his practise of 'patriotism' are therefore products of manipulation. It is in the system's interest to promote racism and intolerance because then the Walk Kowalskis of the world can go fight wars and happily justify it all away with a little racist indoctrination.7.9/10 – The film doesn't stray far enough from what Siegel did in 'The Shootist'. Both films feature an ageing tough guy who is urged by a strong woman to break his solitude and mentor a boy who is being drawn into a life of violence. Both films also feature a key scene in a barber shop where our hero 'cleans up' and prepares himself for his sacrificial death, along with a sympathetic doctor, priest, tragic ending and countless other similar sequences.Worth two viewings.",Null,6,11,31 January 2009
The Hurt Locker," Hell is for Heroes
","'It's a video game of a movie. In some ways, The Hurt Locker is a 21st century 'Triumph of the Will.' – Marilyn Young (historian) There has been a spate of Iraq-war themed films recently ('In the Valley of Ellah', 'Redacted', 'Rendition', 'Lions To Lambs', 'Battle for Haditha' etc), most of which have been either shunned by audiences or mauled by critics. Of these films, 'The Hurt Locker' seems to be the one have to hit the right notes with both groups.Revolving around a bomb disposal unit in Iraq, the film is constructed around 6 Hitchcockian sequences. We watch as our heroes cruise from one set piece to the next, racing against time as they attempt to diffuse a series of bombs. Will the bomb explode? Will they die? Will they cut the red wire in time? These are the questions the film asks.Like most war movies, the film's sole aim is thus to titillate. To string together a series of action sequences where the survival of our heroes is the audience's only concern. The film's lead trooper – a self-destructive maverick reminiscent of Mel Gibson character in the 'Lethal Weapon' series – is himself the kind of unfeeling hero common in cop movies. He navigates the hellhole of Iraq, without any care in the world. He's surrounded by scum, but he loves his job. It's the only thing that gives him a buzz.Macho-director Kathryn Bigelow specialises in these kind of films. Her previous flicks – 'Near Dark', 'Blue Steel', 'Strange Days', 'K-19', 'Point Break' etc – all deal with adrenaline junkies in one form or another. She sees herself as a rare breed: a woman who makes subversive high-voltage action movies. But having Patrick Swayze wax poetic about peace and Buddhism after he violently robs a bank in 'Point Break' isn't subversive or illuminating. It's just hypocritical.'The Hurt Locker' functions on the same level. In a Kubrickian move, the film acknowledges the seduction of violence, the words 'War is a drug' stencilled in big white letters immediately after the title credits fade. Bigelow deftly fuses references to pornography, homo-eroticism and the phallus, with moments of nail-biting violence. The message is clear: war is sexy. Men love it. It tastes good. Feel the tension. Isn't it addictive? But war is not sexy – technology (and by extension, cinema) is. A formation of fighter jets is beautiful in much the same way a formation of birds is beautiful. There is elegance in design, beauty in the sleekness of weapons and the phallic curves of bombs and guns. But war itself isn't sexy. Corpses, mutilated children, bullet ridden bodies, blood and guts and psychological trauma...these aren't sexy.Bigelow acknowledges that violence always has a sexual underside, but then pushes the violence away in favour for sexy action scenes. It's like 'Requiem of a Dream' with the highs and no lows. It's like fetishizing a gun being fired and then avoiding the corpse it results in.7/10 – 'The Hurt Locker' is eerily similar to Don Siegel's 'Hell is For Heroes' and P. Leacock's 'The War Lover', two other films about alienated war-junkie whose addiction to violence pushes them over the edge. There are also numerous similarities to Aldrich's 'Ten Seconds To Hell', also about a bomb squad.(Many have praised the film for not having any political motive, but this isn't true. The film is uninterested in why the US forces are in Iraq disarming bombs, ignores the fact that, in the larger historical context, they are the ones who are dropping all the bombs, and is content to portray the Iraqis as MacGuffins who exist solely to make bombs. Disavowal is politics at its most pure. Isn't it disturbing that, after six years of ignored Iraq War movies, this kind of flick is ultimately what resonates with critics and audiences?)

The Longest Day," Zanuck invades Europe
","'No matter what political reasons are given for war, the underlying reason is always economic.' - A. Taylor Before Steven Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan' collected all WW2 clichés and dressed them up in money, shaky-cam and faux black and white cinematography, producer and movie mogul Darryl F. Zanuck did the same with 'The Longest Day', an expensive mega-production which hoped to capture the 'spectacle, horror and sacrifice of Allied soldiers' during WW2 and D-Day.Younger audiences raised on kill-a-second video games and indoctrinated in 'Private Ryan's' sexy shaky-cam carnage will no doubt find Zanuck's production tame ('Where's the blood, man? I want more squibs!'), but virtually every sequence in 'Private Ryan' is done here equally well, and at times better, though Zanuck's agenda is ultimately the same as Spielberg's: a celebration of movie technology, spectacle, action and glamour in the guise of deceitful notions of 'humanism', 'brotherhood', 'humanity', 'heroism', 'honour', 'sacrifice', 'pride' and 'country'. And as Zanuck's films runs for almost 3 hours, scenes you've seen in other old B or A list WW2 movies pop up as well.Though 'The Longest Day' was directed by over five directors, its real auteur is Zanuck and so it manages to maintain a consistent tone and voice throughout. Most of it is aestheticized slaughter, though, war lovingly recreated, documentary style, for no reason other than to recreate, faithfully, war, documentary style. The idea here is that the images speak for themselves, but of course this is never the end result. It's less salacious and exploitative than 'Ryan', but the ultimate effect is the same. And so we smile as a haggard John Wayne (draft dodger and armchair war-hawk) kills Germans and squirm as a brave Robert Mitchum guns his way up a beach. Sean Connery and Richard Burton's square jaws makes us proud, Henry Fonda's gentleness touches our hearts and we marvel at scene after scene of exciting, righteous murder, in which wrong-footed Germans (the film even makes a point about their shoes being on their wrong feet) are lovingly perforated. People die? Yeah, but we're dodging bullets by proxy, baby. Meanwhile, the truths of world wars 1 and 2 are brushed aside, thinking is admonished, myths and cosy iconography are reheated, and all history, nuances, complexity, ambiguities, politics and context are ignored.Still, some of the film's moments are haunting. Zanuck's smoke shrouded cliffs and beaches are ghostly, haunting even, shots of corpses hanging from parachutes stuck in trees achieve a kind of macabre surrealism, and one long helicopter take into Ouistreham, in which a disembodied camera tracks a platoon as it guns its way across a river, over a bridge, into a town and then up a building, is special, echoing the floating cameras of Jancso's 'The Red and the White' and Rosselini's 'Garibaldi'. There are other good moments, like one in which a group of nuns glide serenely through a gun fight, the nightmarish burning of St Mere Eglise, the film's overall look of grey, concrete and cement, and Zanuck's protracted beach landing (contrary to 'Private Ryan', the landings weren't frenetic blood baths; the beaches were too big, forces separate and progress slow). The film's final shot, a helmet on a beach, would be re-textured with the final shot of Malick's 'The Thin Red Line', a germinating coconut on a beach, death sprouting life. The sheer scope and scale of Zanuck's film is also overwhelming (his battlefield sets are spectacularly expansive, but not as turgidly so as other epics), and the film's production design is impressive. Again though, it's all technique.Ironically, 'The Longest Day' was part of a group of war films released between 1965 and 1977 ('A Bridge Too Far', 'Tora! Tora! Tora!', 'The Battle of Britain', 'Battle of the Bulge', 'Cross of Iron', 'Patton', '633 Squadron' etc) which promised to broaden the scope of previous war films by focusing on as wide a cross section of the military as possible. In these films, generals, soldiers, sergeants, medics, lieutenants, Army personnel, Navy personnel, Airforce personnel, nurses, doctors, civilians etc, all came together in a kind of narrative cocktail, the entire military body working together to achieve some goal.Unlike the platoon genre, these 'heirarchal films' thus aimed to portray war on a far larger canvas. They promised to offer audiences the 'spectacle of history', viewers being granted a nuts and bolts recreation of some historical event in which the entire hierarchy of the military machine took part.Significantly, the event being recreated often revolved around some grand disaster: Pearl Harbour being attacked, Britain being blitzed, D-day going awry, the German advance in the Battle of the Bulge etc. These are all films in which noble Allies bravely fight against all odds (against an overwhelming, savage, superior foe), only to eventually emerge with a kind of bittersweet victory. These films thus display contempt and reverence in equal measure.The last film in this cycle was 'A Bridge Too Far' (1977), by which time audiences were tired of WW2. At this point a series of cathartic Vietnam films were realised, culminating in the angry sermons of 'Rambo' and 'Platoon'. But covertly, all these films succumb to the Cult of the Military. The Cult which says that Freedom isn't free, and that the cost of freedom is blood which must be periodically sacrificed on the altar of Liberty by the military clergy. This kind of thinking tends to believe that we only have freedom because we are allowed it by the state, to whom we should therefore be devoted, obedient, unquestioning and grateful. Of course Zanuck's films were often propagandistic, from his Bible movies, to his Lincolm movie to his 'The House of Rothschild's'. He'd turn his hands to Pearl Harbour later.7.9/10 - Simple war porn with impressive choreography, vast sets and careful set design. Worth one viewing.",Null,1,2,28 August 2011
Slap Shot," Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim
","'Gay men are guardians of the masculine impulse. What is anonymous sex in a dark alleyway but a homage to male freedom?' ― Camille PagliaRelease 'Slap Shot' in any other decade and it would feel like a vulgar comedy cynically put together by a marketing committee. Release in the 1970s, though, and it'll feels like some kind of social statement. With F bombs.Directed by George Roy Hill, 'Slap Shot' stars Paul Newman as Reggie Dunlop, an ageing hockey coach based in the steel town of Charlestown. With the closing of local steel mills, money has become scarce. To make matters worse, the owners of the Charlestown Chiefs, Reggie's team, are thinking of liquidating the club. Reggie's plan, to keep his team and his boys marketable, is to resort to violent sensationalism. He re-brands the Chiefs into a band of barbarians on ice. The public love it.Despite being set in the macho world of sports, 'Slap Shot' was written by a woman, Nancy Dowd. She has the film develop two parallel strands. One focuses on various women who find men to be emasculated, boorish and immature. These women, most of whom reject traditional femininity and are perpetually dressed in dour clothes, are unfulfilled by men and even go so far as to turn to lesbian relationships. The men put up with this. The times are changing, they rationalise.The other half of the film deals with the arena of sport being appropriated and perverted by Big Business. Whores in skates, our band of foul-mouthed performers cater to the baser impulses of spectators. Always playing with toys, and childishly homophobic, they're also incapable of mature relationships with women. There's an infantalizing and emasculating quality to both sport and business, Dowd argues, our heroes essentially castrated and so feminized, regardless of their foul mouthed, macho tirades. Dowd's women, meanwhile, are masculinized, made courser, more cynical and harder by the market. Indeed, it is Reggie who insists upon turning women 'back into women', taking them to beauty parlours in an attempt to restore old modes of masculinity and femininity.Reggie is further shocked when he confronts the fact that the Charlestown Chiefs are owned by a svelte businesswoman, a woman who has so little regard for the bloodsport that hockey has become, that she refuses to let her own children watch games. Reggie fumes. He's deemed a pathetic product by the very people who profit from his antics.The film ends with a Princeton educated player, Ned Braden (Michael Ontkean), staging a little protest. Throughout the film, Braden refuses to sell-out for the sake of the box office; he refuses to fight. During the film's climactic game, Braden then goes further and stages a strip-routine. 'Make him stop! That's disgusting,' rivals yell. The act not only makes a mockery of boardroom and bleacher violence, but the machismo of audiences, owners and players, all of whom deem violence less obscene than innocence and nudity. Ironically, Braden's wife, for the first time in the film, is here given feminine clothes, and it is an act of violence committed by the oppositional team which swiftly leads to the now-pacifist Chiefs winning their final game.The 1970s saw a number of gritty, foul-mouthed sports movies ('The Longest Yard', 'Bad News Bears' etc). 'Slap Shot' was one of the last in this wave. Interestingly, Hill has the film end with a husband and wife splitting. She's a successful businesswoman who skips town, he's left alone in the rubble of Charlestown. The film's signature song is Maxine Nightingale's 'Right Back Where We Started From', the song's lyrics ('it's alright, and it's coming along, we got to get right back to where we started from') perhaps speaking, amongst other things, to a masculinity which dreams of one day reasserting itself.7.9/10 – See 'Bull Durham'.

The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Animal Instincts
","Like all films in its franchise, 'Twilight: New Moon' is about sex, celibacy and the art of respectfully losing your virginity....to vampires and werewolves. In this instalment we have Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart), a young woman on the cusp of adulthood, bleeding in front of a group of vampires. Overwhelmed by a desire to consume, these vampires lustfully lunge at Bella. They're stopped by Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson), a gentlemanly alpha-vamp who orders all vampires to stay well clear of Bella. Edward leaves as well.As a girl must deliberate before she consummates, passion must wait. Bella thus spends 'Moon's' second half in a state of depression, missing the men, vampires and outright rapists who once pined for her tantalising body. Pretty soon she's channelling her pent up sexual energy into various thrill seeking activities, hanging around dangerous locations and topless bad boys. They want her, she wants them, but are they right for her? Who to choose? With so many penises in the world, poor Bella faces an existential crisis! Also facing an existential crisis is Edward. When false news that Bella has died reaches him, Edward resolves to commit suicide, a gesture which speaks to his all consuming love for her. Of course when news of Edward's faithfulness reaches back to Bella, she ends her philandering. She knows, finally, which man is right for her. 'I want to protect you,' Edward says, wrapping the petite Bella in his gigantic shoulders, 'you're the reason I stay alive'. Bella melts. The couple propose and plan a wedding.It's easy to laugh at the Twilight saga's themes of courtly love and its attempts at rekindling the chaste, romantic fantasies of yesteryear. But in an age when the sweetest thing you can tell a girl is 'I haven't needed pornography since I met you', the puritanism of the Twilight Saga is almost endearing.7/10 – See Stewart in the underrated 'The Yellow Handkerchief' (2008).",Null,1,4,16 September 2014
Patton," Theatres of War
","'The myths of World War II have warped our view of how we look at things today. The twisted memory of it encourages the men of my generation to be willing, almost eager, to use military force anywhere in the world.' – Admiral Gene LaRoque'Magnificent! Compared to war, all other forms of human endeavour shrink to insignificance. God help me, I do love it so!' - General George Patton Underrated director Franklin J. Schaffner turns in more good work with 'Patton'. It's a grand biography of US Army General George Patton, filled with Schaffner's customarily excellent photography, though philosophically things are a bit dubious. Blame screenwriter Francis Ford Coppoa for this.As is now well known, 'Patton' follows General Patton from the moment he takes charge of the demoralised American II Corps in North Africa, to his march into Germany itself. The film massively overstates Patton's influence on the war, ignores the real causes of the war and the Imperialistic equivalencies between all parties involved, but that's to be expected of a film which panders to American egos. Interestingly, 'Patton' is explicitly about performance. The movie opens with Patton on stage, features a Patton who believes himself to be 'performing' the reincarnated 'role' of past warriors, features military tactics which rely on decoys and deception (ie more performance acting), treats Patton's life as a predestined concert show and the world as a grand stage, sports a soundtrack that is literally composed of resurrected echoes of the past, shows generals as being preoccupied with public perception and nurturing their media personalities, portrays war as being one big performance in which victory is simply a means of becoming a top celebrity, and is filled with characters who are obsessed with 'the proper conduct' and the 'right way to perform' or 'carry oneself'. Add to this the fact that the historical Patton was himself an erudite and intelligent man who only adopted a false persona of machismo and bluster and you have a film which is entirely about both performance and the egos which fuel wars (see Kaufman's 'The Right Stuff').This, incidentally, is why actor George C Scott, who plays General George Patton in the film, was interested in the project, though he'd ultimately be unhappy with the film's final product. He'd go so far as to turn down the Oscar he won for his role, disgusted by the film's popularity.Odd for a war movie, 'Patton' is interested in the logistics of war, the scale of the war effort, the size of the US military machine and of course the expansiveness of Europe itself. Watch how Schaffner stresses the lengths of supply lines, the distances covered by tanks and convoys, the vast number of different generals operating in tandem etc. You really get the sense of a huge and multifaceted war machine rumbling across Europe. No other film does this better.Also interesting is this: the film was cynically designed (and Coppola admits this himself) to appeal to both right and left wingers, to war hawks and pacifists. The entire film is thus constructed in such a way as to allow audience members to praise or rebuke General Patton, depending on their own political dispositions. Or at least that's what was intended. In actuality, Scott seduces you with his hard-on for war and conquest. So though the script sets up an ending in which we're given the false choice of viewing Patton as either a necessary relic or an unnecessary relic who 'walks off into the horizon of history', the reality is that Patton will never go away. He'll aways be resurrected, whole nations always on the brink of saddling up to the next Patton, hungry to suckle on his testosterone soaked teats. Indeed, the majority of Coppola's films evoke the seductive lure of megalomania, a trait he shares with Oliver Stone, both directors often undermining what they believe the messages of their films to be. Incidentally, 'Patton' was part of a group of war films released between 1965 and 1977 ('Bridge Too Far', 'Tora! Tora! Tora!', 'The Longest Day', 'Midway', 'Battle of Britain', 'Battle of the Bulge', 'Patton', '633 Squadron' etc), all of which tried to broaden the scope of previous war films by focusing on as wide a cross section of military personnel as possible. Unlike the platoon genre, these 'hierarchal films' aimed to portray war on a far larger canvas. They promised to offer audiences the 'spectacle of history', viewers being granted a nuts and bolts recreation of some historical event in which the entire hierarchy of the military machine took part. Significantly, the event being recreated often revolved around some grand disaster (Pearl Harbour, the Blitz, D Day etc). These are all films in which noble Allies bravely fight against all odds (against an overwhelming, savage, superior foe), only to eventually emerge with a kind of bittersweet victory. These films thus display contempt and reverence in equal measure. This is a contradiction which infects most war films. On the one hand, these treatments predict a pessimistic, even tragic outcome and outlook, whilst on the other they want to curry the favour of audiences, a procedure that predicts an optimistic, even a celebratory outcome/outlook. Celebratory vs Tragedy: it is in this fashion that most war films veer pathologically between antiwar statement and gung-ho propaganda. Covertly such art succumbs to the Cult of the Military. The Cult which says that Freedom isn't free, and that the cost of freedom is blood which must periodically be sacrificed on the altar of Liberty by the military clergy.Perhaps the last film in this cycle was 'A Bridge Too Far' (1977), by which time audiences were tired of WW2. At this point a series of cathartic Vietnam films were realised, which had about as little to do with Vietnam as the WW2 films before them had to do with WW2.7.9/10 - Worth one viewing.",Null,6,9,15 September 2010
The Illusionist," Hark, ye charlatan!
","Neil Burger's 'The Illusionist' stars Edward Norton as a Eisenheim, a master magician who falls in love with Jessica Biel's Duchess Sophie von Teschen. Their romance irks the Austrian Crown Prince, who wishes to eliminate Eisenberg, but who fears to do so because the young magician is immensely popular with the masses. The Crown Prince thus sets loose his head of security, played by Paul Giamatti, to investigate Eisenheim and develop a method of tactically dispatching the magician. Eisenheim, meanwhile, wages an unconventional war on the Prince.For most of its running time this is a stylish, unique film. Burger bathes each frame with sepia light, his cinematography rich and moody, resembling a room full of half-lit candles, each frame dim around the edges, like old footage torn from a dying projector. His depiction of 1900 Vienna is similarly cosy, with his cast of suited gentlemen, top-hats, horse-drawn carriages, cobblestones and lovely Viennese, Baroque architecture. Combine with a score by Philip Glass and you have a unique form of Romanticism; Visconti opulence meets a Hollywood sensibility.There are other nifty things scattered about. We're initially unsure whether Eisenheim's magic tricks are supernatural miracles or simply very good cons, Edward Norton's performance (is he villain or desperate lover?) is riveting and Burger's balcony shots of Eisenheim's performances preserve the integrity of turn-of-the-century spectacle. Eisenheim's illusions – hushed, riveting, almost paranormal – are themselves design to conjure up the work of cinema's great illusionist, George Melies, who around the same period was dazzling minds with his blend of magic and early movie-making.Mostly, though, the film is interesting for its war between state – the Crown Prince and Emperor Franz Joseph I – and its lowly magician. Eisenheim, who the masses believe to be a genuine sorcerer, essentially begins to have his own cult, a populist army which he uses to defend himself against the Prince, who of course seeks his death. Through his shows, Eisenheim then begins to overtly attack the Prince, accusing him or murder, treason and conspiracy. This subplot recalls everything from early religious blood cults (even Jesus himself, who supposedly, like Eisenheim, was originally a carpenter), which the Romans, Jews and Greeks feared to tamper with lest they instigate populist uprisings, or historical figures and/or groups like Maximilien de Robespierre, the Jacobin Club etc, some of which were responsible for the French Revolution. Eisenheim isn't just a magician, he's, in the eyes of the state, a pervert and subversive.Unfortunately 'The Illusionist' begins to collapse as it progresses. The film gets smaller and smaller and all the interesting possibilities it affords are shut down, until it climaxes with a final act revelation in which 'all is explained'. By its end, 'The Illusionist' is just a Hollywood con movie, with a routine 'flashback/revelation' climax that was itself in vogue at the time of its release ('Usual Suspects', 'Signs', 'Sixth Sense', 'The Village', 'The Others' etc etc). The film missteps further in explaining Eisenheim's magic (a better director would have left the possibility open for the supernatural) whilst paradoxically not explaining it enough (if you're going to rule out the paranormal, then explain these incredulous tricks properly). Meanwhile Jessica Biel's too athletic and muscular for her role and the Crown Prince, played by Rufus Sewell, eventually turns into just another pantomime villain. The film's period details (admirable considering its small budget) themselves get smaller and less enticing as we progress; Burger doesn't explore his sets, his streets, his castles and can't convey any spatial, architectural or environmental 'sense' outside Eisenheim's theatre halls.Incidentally, the Crown Prince here is based on the real, hotly debated death of Archduke Rudolf Joseph, which led to Archduke Franz Ferdinand becoming the heir to the throne of Austria. Ferdinand's assassination in 1914 was one of the chief ripples which helped trigger World War I. So Eisenheim's love affair had a bigger legacy: he plunged Europe into war and effectively changed the whole Western World. The film ignores all this.Many compare 'The Illusionist' to 'The Prestige' and complain that the former's 'magic sequences' are incredulous and/or a cop-out because they utilise CGI. 'The Prestiege', of course, was about two rival magicians who each found a different means of creating 'the greatest trick ever'. One creates the illusion of teleportation by simply using a twin and enduring some physical pain, the other goes through an elaborate plan which uses science, Tesla coils, clones and replicas which he must then murder. The idea is that the second magician perverts 'magic'. His teleportation is literal, a feat of science. The first magician utilizes a more noble form of misdirection, his planning and penance akin to the medieval craftsman's sacrifices to his art. In 'The Illusionist' Eisenheim is akin to the first magician, but his magic is treated as being spiritual; he's more witch or sorcerer.Burger's use of CGI, especially on second viewing, appropriately conveys the feeling that Eisenheim's magic is far beyond the possibilities of 1900s magic. We are deceived, and the effect on us is the same as it would have been on audiences of the time. The problem is not the CGI, but Burger's later, literal revelation that Eisenheim had no powers. Meanwhile Burger has himself said that the film's climax is 'not what really happened'. It's just one character's (and ours?) perception and willingness to believe that Eisenheim escaped and that his lover is alive. 'That's one way to do it,' Eisenheim says of his magic, but we never see conclusive prove that 'this is how it was'.Incidentally, Burger's previous movie was a pseudo-documentary which fabricated an interview with JFK's assassin. All the magical tricks in 'The Illusionist' - no matter how incredulous they seem here - were performed and invented in the 1800s by magicians like Henry Dircks and Jean Robert-Houdin.8/10 – Similar films: Bergman's 'The Magician' and Malle's 'Thief of Paris'.

The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Pure Kitsch
","This is a terrible film, almost unwatchable with its greeting card dialogue, its Hallmark cinematography, its goofy moralising, its nauseating music. But what's worse about the film is this: it pretends to be about a man who is constantly 'out of sync' with the world (he ages in reverse) and who learns that love can transcend both time and the gradual deterioration of the human body, but in reality it does the complete opposite.A film like this should show us how the mind and heart can defy the limitations of the flesh, but instead it shows us human being who are defined entirely by their bodies. Observe how the film never celebrates the fact that Brad Pitt, now in a youthful body, possess the wisdom of a seventy year old man. Instead of finding value in knowledge, the film focuses on the dissonance between Pitt's beauty and the wrinkles of his lover's forehead. This is a film which celebrates youth and outer appearances, which mourns the losses of the flesh, the deterioration of Botox injected skin, the greying of hair, the ugliness of old age, the passage of time, and instead celebrates healthy bones, good knees and the sexy face of Brad Pitt. Pitt's youth is what we're instructed to long for, not Benjamin Button's wisdom.The body is just the vehicle for the far more valuable thoughts and feelings it contains, but this film is more interested in pandering to the usual Hollywood fantasies.4/10 - If Tom Hanks from 'Forrest Gump' met Will Smith from 'The Legend of Bagger Vance' and used the horse from 'Seabiscuit' as a surrogate womb to carry their artificially inseminated baby, then that baby would be Benjamin Button. Which is not to say that all four films are nauseating examples of kitsch, egotistical vehicles for their stars to take part in hokey modern fables, no, quite the opposite, for Benjamin Button is literally the lovechild of a retard, a black man and an overachieving horse.Worth no viewings",Null,3,5,24 November 2009
Transformers," The Citizen Kane of camera shake
","Michael Bay directs 'Transformers', a film which takes the reactive camera work of Spielberg's 'War of the Worlds' and lathers it in feces. Spielberg's thinking at the time was that CGI special effects are no longer special. You now have to mask your CGI so as to give your film a sense of realism or even menace. This is nothing new, most 'good special effects' subvert their own 'specialness', playing themselves down.But 'Transformers' milks this trend to death. Bay's camera is constantly ducking, diving, hiding from CGI, catching fleeting glimpses of action and never seeing anything coherently. People complain that none of his robots are clearly framed. That none have distinct or memorable features. That they're all poorly and unimaginatively conceived. But what's the point when Bay's camera doesn't intended to watch them in the first place? Combine this scatter-shot camera-work with Bays scatter-shot storytelling and you have one pretty stupid movie.Spielberg's 'War of the Worlds' was released in 2005, and now here in 2007 we have an onslaught of similarly shot Spielbergian crap. The 2 year gap between 'War of the Worlds (a Spielberg directed alien invasion movie; brilliantly shot, if you ignore all the xenophobic, 'terrorists living under our cities' 9/11 baiting) and stuff like 'Transformers' (a Spielberg produced alien invasion movie that uses your eyeballs as a toilet) is what I call the Hollywood/Spielberg gap.Currently this gap is 2 years. The previous record was the three year period between 'Black Hawk Down' and 'Saving Private Ryan'. I doubt the gap can get any smaller, as it takes roughly a year to get a big budget film out of pre-production.In the market place, rival companies likewise have a similar gap between products, commodities reverse engineered, trends capitalised upon, rebuilt and renamed. Spielberg makes big money so people copy. And of course Bay's essentially Spielberg on speed, pushing the former's set-piece cinema to post-narrative hell. Bay's the ugly bridge between post-cinema and the blip-time of cyberspace, offering up the schizoid incoherence of mass-multiplayer mayhem to a giddy public too high and self excited to string together a thought. A Spielberg for alpha males, Bay's hated largely because his demographic doesn't pound defensive buttons on keyboards or get their geek out on digital forums. While Spielberg appeals to the quiet, introspective, curious, cautious, fantasy loving mommas boy, Bay appeals to the testosterone fuelled jock and his woman who just wants a quick testosterone fix and just want to see crap blow up good. Unsurprisingly, Bay's films make BILLIONS of dollars and are seen by millions of people REPEATEDLY. Interestingly, Bay's most feminine film (THE ISLAND) raked in no money. 4/10 - Boring despite its rapid-fire aesthetic. The best thing you can say about guys like Bay and Emmerich are that their films don't ever pretend to be anything other than wreckage, which makes them far less harmful than the world's Spielbergs and Camerons. See the original, animated 'Transformers The Movie' instead, which, believe it or not, starred Orson Welles and Leonard Nimoy.",Null,10,20,10 September 2007
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," Like a less pretentious WALL-E
","'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs' is a fun, fast and funny animated comedy which revolves around a young scientist who invents a machine which causes food to rain from the skies. Like Pixar's 'Wall-E', the film points fingers at Western over-consumption, greed and consumer capitalism, and the effect this lifestyle of decadence has on the environment.Unlike 'Wall-E', however, the film is not preachy, its metaphors disguised with wild antics and much mayhem. Consider one scene in which a fat Mayor sails on a giant slice of toast, and then begins to eat the toast until his 'boat' sinks. It's a metaphor for man irrationally consuming his way to disaster, but it's played for laughs and lasts no more than a couple seconds. The film is filled with such 'visual messages', but never feels didactic.This being an animated film, 'Meatballs' utilises a virtual camera which possesses a sense of freedom and energy which conventional films lack. For this reason, these films are always worth keeping up with.In terms of flaws, like most of these animated films, the picture is far too busy, never letting any scene or character breathe. Still, the mayhem is in service of something worthwhile. In marrying a tale of 'being yourself' with 'mega consumption', this flick, perhaps unintentionally, taps into French philosopher Bernard Stiegler's writings, in which he argues - take a deep breath - that 'the techniques used to create consumer behaviour amount to the destruction of psychic and collective individuation, and that the diversion of libidinal energy toward the consumption of consumer products results in an addictive cycle, leading to hyper-consumption, the exhaustion of desire, and the reign of symbolic misery'. Despite its air of outward juvenility, that's the message this whacky film is trying to convey.Incidentally, 'Meatballs' was made by Sony Pictures Animation, late comers into the world of CGI features. Pixar led the way and then came DreamWorks, now Sony is hoping to cash in on this billion dollar global market by using the formulae of both studios. They've only made three films thus far, 'Surf's Up' and 'Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs' being the best two.7.9/10 â€“ Environmentalism is in vogue. But is it a coincidence that the Chinese character for 'crisis' is a combination of the characters for 'danger' and 'opportunity'? Worth one viewing.",Null,2,4,5 October 2010
Kelly's Heroes," Drinking wine, eating cheese, and catching some rays, you know?
","Director Brian Hutton was responsible for two classic action movies, 'Where Eagles Dare', released in 1968, and 'Kelly's Heroes', released in 1970. Both were old fashioned adventure movies, both were set in WW2, both filtered a past conflict through a Vietnam Era prism and both were packed to the brim with wild chases, humour, tension and lots of beautiful scenery.'Kelly's Heroes' was originally intended as an anti-war satire, but was severely reedited by studios until it resembled a more straightforward action movie. Made the same year as 'MASH' (which also featured Donald Sutherland as a hippie), Eastwood and Hutton envisioned the film as an anarchic satire, Vietnam era anti establishment spread thickly across the more prim and proper battlefields of World War 2.'Heroes'' final cut retains some of this irreverence, but most of its playful cynicism now resides solely in Oddball (played by Donald Sutherland), a tank driving hippie who spouts such lines as 'Why don't you knock it off with them negative waves, baby?' and 'Why don't you say something righteous and hopeful for a change?'. He's a fun character (and a nice contrast to Eastwood's stoic persona), who helps imbue Hutton's film with some 'flower power' playfulness. Yet despite its goofy plot (our heroes fight their way across France in an attempt to rob a German bank) and marijuana fuelled soundtrack, Hutton also bathes his film in lots of detail. A siege on a town plays out like the end of 'Saving Private Ryan', and several skirmishes are filled with tension. 'Kelly's Heroes' may be a counterculture comedy, but it nevertheless works tremendously well as a conventional war movie.Arguably better than 'Kelly's Heroes' - though perhaps less interesting - is 'Where Eagles Dare', an epic adventure movie based on an Alistair Mclean's novel. Filmed in Austria, the film looks great, filled with snow capped mountains, perilous cable carts, a cool German castle and even a babe called Heidi. Hutton's direction would prove hugely influential, many of his scenes lifted by Tarantino and George Lucas, and several of his sequences re-staged as levels in modern video games.Of course the film will seem a bit dated to modern audiences weened on fast edits, taunt action and CGI. Hutton's rear projection work in particular now stands out like a sore thumb. But Clint Eastwood is always cool, and those who like casual violence will find several scenes in which Clint mows down stairwells full of Germans to be shockingly laid back. Clint isn't just unphased when dishing out violence, he's positively relaxed.The 1960s and early 1970s saw a number of 'boys own' adventure movies being released ('Dirty Dozen', 'Guns of Navarone', 'The Great Escape' etc). Films like these used war, not to express any moral or patriotic sentiment, but as vehicles for action, aimed primarily at the young 'modern' audiences of the Vietnam era. These films may have done nothing but dished out casual violence and reduced WW2 to a series of heroic adventures, (Huston did this stuff right with 'The Man Who Would Be King'), but nevertheless surpassed the next wave (Indiana Jones, Star Wars etc) of similar flicks because they, arguably, retained a certain adult sensibility. A sensibility that would be completely eroded come the 1980s.8/10 - See Pontecorvo's 'Burn!'.",Null,4,6,17 April 2008
Casualties of War," Full Metal Jacket 2
","De Palma's heroes often fail to rescue women from their ill fated destinies. In his blood soaked worlds, women are objectified and then cast aside, often killed by phallic tools (drills) or manly instruments (shaving blades). The high school rituals in 'Carrie', the low budget exploitation films in 'Blow Out', the porn flicks in 'Body Double' and 'Black Dahlia', all portray women as tokens of capitalist exchange. In 'Obsession' this exchange revolves around international business, in 'Blow Out' and 'Snake Eyes' it revolves around national politics, in 'Scarface' it revolves around organised crime and in 'Dahlia' it revolves around Hollywood.Critics have used this to label De Palma as a masochist who hates women. It took Pauline Kael, who championed De Palma as a feminist director who targets, not women, but rather, the patriarchal order, to lay the foundation for a slew of feminist writers embracing De Palma's films.'Casualties' replaces Kubrick's metaphorical rape of a female sniper with the literal rape of a Vietnamese civilian (called Oahn). Both director's treat war as the defiling of the Feminine Other, though Kubrick goes one step further and internalises it ('death of the Feminine equals loss of self' becomes a Kubrickean dismissal of Jung: 'there is no self'). In 'Casualties of War', the rape is thus not only a single incident, but symbolic of a larger patriarchy threatened by national and racial difference.Tellingly, the film opens with a train drawing to a halt. Only women and 2 black men leave the carriage. They've been dispatched and so we zoom in on Erickson (played by M. Fox), who sleeps against a window. His head occupies the right of the frame whilst the left of the frame is distant and out of focus. This right-left composition will be repeated throughout the film, firstly when a black trooper (called Brownie) is killed, secondly when Sean Penn recounts Brownie's death and thirdly when Oahn is killed. These deep focus shots work as a moment of contrast, recollection and mourning. In the first, we see Fox in the foreground, asleep and oblivious to his surroundings. In the second, we see Brownie dying in the foreground, while Vietcong hide in the background. In the third, we see the reverse. Oahn is stabbed to death in the background, while Fox fires at Vietcong in the foreground.De Palma also uses the notion of vertical space to separate each portion of the film. The first act is subterranean, Fox linked to underground tunnels. The second act is above ground, De Palma stressing dry, flat landscapes. In contrast, the third act takes place on a series of hills, whilst the fourth act takes place on a high-rise bridge. The tall bridge and the underground tunnel frame the rape story. We watch as Fox ascends further and further into hell.De Palma uses the first act of the film to set up genre conventions. Here, Sean Penn is the hero. He rescues Erickson, kills the savage Vietnamese animals and prances about like John Wayne, spewing tips and wisdom of the jungle. The fast talking black guy, the noble sergeant, the new recruit, the dirty Vietnamese...all these genre conventions are quickly set up, only to be reversed twenty minutes later.Sean Penn, in his first piece of meta-acting, plays his character as a cross between John Wayne and De Niro's Vietnamese psycho from De Palma's 'Hi Mom!'. After the death of Brownie, he chooses to take his men to the local brothel. They plan to hook up with some whores and vent their anger, but learn that the village is off limits, as the Vietcong troops are busy visiting the whore houses themselves. This drives Penn mad. 'Charlie is getting my pussy!' he yells. What follows is the group's attempt to win back and conquer the Feminine Other. They want 'her', simply because the enemy has 'her'. To have 'her' is to deny the enemy.The scenes in which Oahn is dragged from her village and later raped are some of the most powerful moments in De Palma's filmography. When her battered face is revealed, it's hard not to cry. Later, De Palma cross-cuts Oahn's death with a POV shot down the scope of an American rifle. The point is clear: every shot fired, in every war, is a knife in Oahn's chest (in Vietnamese, Oahn means 'injustice').De Palma is a smart guy and he knows that making an anti-war film means making one in which the audience gets no visceral kick out of violence. Like Kubrick or Jancso, his violence has a dry detachment. And like 'Come and See', it's often subjective and stretched to operatic lengths. This morbid tone is largely why the film has failed to capture audiences. Man wants the excitement and primal bloodlust of a 'Platoon', 'Black Hawk Down', or 'Saving Private Ryan', most of these films functioning as 'war porn', a form of catharsis or gratification (violence always has a sexual element). The existential disappointments of a 'Casualties of War' or a 'Come and See' are unsettling and no fun at all.After Oahn's death, we watch as Fox tries to get the 'bad apples' jailed. Significantly, this portion of the 'dream' begins with Fox 'waking up' back in camp. With the release of De Palma's 'Redacted', this much derided final act now seems only more powerful, allowing us to empathise with the gang of rapists, to balk at their harsh sentences, even as we despise their actions. Fox then wakes up a final time, sees Oahn leaving the train and notices that she's left her scarf behind. He rushes after her. We briefly recall Oahn's mother handing her daughter a scarf prior to her being kidnapped. The camera then cranes upwards, taking Fox to one final level. The credits roll.8.9/10 - Masterpiece.

Event Horizon," Hellraiser
","'Event Horizon' is a scattershot horror movie which plays like a cross between 'Alien' and 'Hellraiser'. The idea here is that a spaceship breeches the event horizon of a black hole, 'travels to hell', and is then spat back out into real space. A rescue party is then sent to ascertain what happened to the ship. They board the ship, realise that the ship's been to hell, and are assaulted and possessed by various demonic forces.The film's quality is all over the place, but it has at least four very unique visuals, and a couple hellish (and very imaginative) designs. The film was notoriously chopped down after being shown to test audiences. 40 minutes were lost, most of which were packed with various devilish creatures, designs and surreal/nightmarish special effects shots.

Big Hero 6," How to Train Your Robot
","An animated feature by Walt Disney Studios, 'Big Hero 6' revolves around 14 year old Hiro Hamada, a vaguely Japanese robotics prodigy whose inventions are stolen by a mysterious masked man. With the help of a medical robot called Baymax, Hiro attempts to solve this crime. Assisting him are a band of super-scientists, each armed with high-tech gizmos.Wholly derivative, 'Big Hero 6' plays like an amalgamation of every animated feature released over the past ten years. Almost every character is a wisecracking, manically animated attempt at 'cool', family members die on cue, villains are predictably revealed and the film's last act rolls out the usual heroic sacrifices and false deaths. Throw in obligatory 'flying sequences', 'musical montages', 'canned sentimentality', generic 'action sequences' and several moments done better in other recent animated features ('Megamind', 'Summer Wars', 'Iron Giant', 'The Incredibles' etc), and you have a film almost entirely devoid of imagination.Computer animated features allow for a level of hyper-control almost impossible in conventional films. Every ray of light, every colour, every camera movement, can be fine tuned with machine precision. Despite this, the virtual choreography of 'Big Hero 6' is mostly unimpressive. The film's aesthetic – manic, overly busy, graceless, no scene allowed to breathe – is itself annoying; like listening to a sugar-addicted 5 year old yell for 90 minutes.

Mulholland Drive," Welcome to the Desert of the Real: Part 3
","'There is no band. It is all a tape recording.' – Mulholland DriveBaudrillard writes of the three historical orders of appearance, where images and signs change their relationships to reality in western culture. He calls these the 1st, 2nd and 3rd order simulacrums.The 1st order simulacra took place between the Renaissance and Industrial Revolution. This was the counterfeit period, where signs reflected and then perverted a basic reality, art essentially imitating life. The 2nd order simulacra took place during the Industrial age. This was a period of mass reproduction. Signs were mass-produced and began to signify themselves as symbols of money and power. They marked the absence of a basic reality and gradually began to bear less relation to their origins. The 3rd order simulacra is our current phase. Signs now bear no relationship to any reality. Reality has disintegrated, signs now having no meaning whatsoever due to a liquidation of referentials.Films like 'The Truman Show', 'Dark City' and 'The Matrix' remain locked at the level of the first order of simulacra, naively believing that there exists a 'real world' behind the simulation. In contrast, films like 'Existenz', 'Eyes Wide Shut', 'A History of Violence' and 'Mulholland Drive' are acutely aware that we no longer live in the age of spectacle. Spectacle subjected us to images, now we ourselves become participatory images.Most view 'Mulholland Drive' as being cleanly divided into two halves: the first half being a young actress's fantasy, the second half being the dark reality of both Hollywood and herself. But look closely and 'Mulholland Drive's' fantasy is always positioned on the same level as its reality. What Lynch is intuitively recognising is that reality is already hyper-real, always somebody else's dreams and desires. There is now no meaningful distinction between the two; between The City of Dreams and our desires, fantasy and cyberspace states.In this regard, 'Mulholland Drive' shares much with Kubrick's 'Eyes Wide shut', both films being fairly accurate depictions of Lacanian Desire (ie Desire=Lack=Real, and it is only in the dream that we come close to a real awakening), the difference being that Kubrick uses the 'logic' of 'interrupted dreams' (constant interruptions, telephone calls, narrative short-circuiting etc), whilst 'Mulholland Drive' is entirely constructed in the 'language of dreams'. Lynch's film is a free-floating anxiety dream, with constant temporal collapses and radically changing identities, whilst Kubrick's is more architectural and formal.Both films also utilize fractured narratives, fantasy logic and generate an extreme sense of mystery, confusion and horror (ironically, in attentive viewers), which provokes an investigative impulse, their audiences forced to apply a rational or analytic approach for purposes of coherently re-integrating the puzzling narratives, whether in order to re-assert control over the anxiety that the films provoke, or worse, to finally safely dismiss it all as exclusively a 'dream'.But the comparisons don't end there. Both films also have a sequence which serves to 'demystify' the audience and dreamer. In Kubrick's film, Sydney Pollack, over a pool table, attempts to bring Tom Cruise 'up to date' with reality, telling him that it was 'all a performance' and 'staged just for him'. Likewise, The Real of Lynch's film is not Naomi Watt's supposedly waking world, but the shadowy 'movie house' of Club Silencio. It is in Club Silencio that Lynch has a magician demonstrate that his 'singers' are all lip syncing to a 'pre recorded soundtrack', a 'performance deliberately staged' for their audience. The representation is always accepted as real, even when the audience has been demystified. And there is another 'Mulholland' theme that has significant resonance with 'Eyes': the forever elusive patriarchal powers in a capitalist society. A line repeated throughout the film by powerful people is 'THIS IS THE GIRL!', its significance changing with each utterance. Like Kubrick, Lynch paints a deeply disturbing portrait of women in the hands of and at the mercy of, unscrupulous patriarchy (as well as its also dis-empowering effects on men).So both directors position their stories - Kubrick's part-dream-fable of repressed marital infidelity and Lynch's dream-fable of doomed lesbian love - within a representation of society as a closed hierarchical, authoritarian system in which the ultimate source of power remains forever hidden behind a series of ominous representatives. But it is Club Silencio that makes 'Mulholland Drive' interesting. Writing of the Club, Kpunk says 'There is nothing less misleading in cinema's history of illusion than Lynch's scene in Club Silencio. What we are seeing and hearing - the film itself - is a recording and nothing but. On the most banal level, this is the Real which the magic of cinema must conceal. Yet the scene haunts for reasons other than this. It challenges us to recognize that our own lives, the roles we perform (as people, as actors), are themselves recordings, scripted by forces outside the self and whose 'substance' turns out to be itself nothing more than a mass of influences.'In the end, 'Mulholland Drive' is not only a story about a few characters' lost sense of Self but about the fractured identity of Hollywood. Memories of Hollywood (and our culturally overloaded postmodern world) are stored in a massive array of film footage, newspapers, images, memories, books, revivals, reconstructions and remakes. The language of 'Mulholland Drive' thrives on this meta-language. This postmodern pastiche of signs and references turns the film itself into a simulated narrative of sorts. We are able to immerse ourselves in the film precisely because of our brains, the simulacrum existing in our minds as much as it does in Hollywood, the place were such minds meet and melt. And the only escape from the tyranny of eternal performance - from the white noise of sights and sounds - comes in fulfilment of 'Mulholland Drive's' final utterance: Silencio .9/10 – After the abrasive 'Wild at Heart', Lynch reestablished himself as a master director with both 'Straight Story' and 'Mulholland Drive'.",Null,9,15,11 May 2009
Brave," I'm Merida, and I'll be shooting for my own hand
","'Why do so few writers of heroic or epic fantasy ever deal with the fundamental quandary of their novels...that so many of them take place in cultures that are rigid, hierarchical, stratified, and in essence oppressive? What is so appealing about feudalism, that so many citizens like ours love reading about and picturing life under hereditary lords?' - David Brin Released in 2012 by Pixar Animation Studios, 'Brave' attempts to subvert and overturn the clichés and values promulgated by many Walt Disney features. As it was directed by a woman - Brenda Chapman - and features a plucky heroine in the lead role, the film has also garnered a reputation as a 'feminist tract'.Set in the Scottish highlands, 'Brave' tells the tale of princess Merida, a fiery red-head with a fondness for bows, arrows and asserting her individuality. Not bound by traditional gender roles, Merida angers her mother, Queen Elinor. Elinor wants Merida to be your traditional Disney Princess – reserved, feminine and infatuated with men, wealth and 'acting proper' - but Merida refuses to comply. She's a tom-boy, in love with sweat, grime and the rough-and-tumble ways of her boisterous father. Merida, in short, is your typical post-modern, 21st century woman. The world's her oyster. Anything goes.'Do you ever bother to ask what I want?' Merida yells at her mother. 'No! You walk around trying to make me be like you! Well, I'm not going to be like you! I'd rather die than be like you!' Queen Elinor recoils in horror. Her little princess refuses to be a princess! When Queen Elinor is transformed into a bear by a mysterious witch, Elinor is forced to question her parochial assumptions. She learns to appreciate the 'manly' and 'wild' ways traditionally ascribed to men and to see the value in a kind of beastly masculinity. Merida, meanwhile, learns the opposite. She learns to appreciate traditionally feminine traits, and learns to accept the responsibilities of womanhood. She even relies upon a traditional feminine skill - needlework rather than a bow - to save everyone during the film's climax. During this climax, in which 'Brave' reconciles the masculine (daughter) with the feminine (mother), Merida essentially reforms feudal Scotland. She agrees to submit to tradition, but only if she is also granted certain 'equal rights'. Think of her as a young Gloria Steinem.Though it means well, 'Brave' can't escape the insidious clutches of Walt Disney. Chapman, Pixar's first female director, was fired and replaced by Mark Andrews, and the film's tale of female empowerment, as it unfolds within the context of a feudal monarchy, feels creepy. In 'Brave', Girl Power amounts to choosing your man, toys, living in a castle and ruling over the poor men and women slaving below you. As the sources of hierarchal power and inequality are not questioned, and as sexism always works hand-in-hand with class oppression, Merida's emancipation is hollow.'Brave's' first half is as good as Pixar at its best. It's funny, fast, beautifully animated, and Merida makes for a cool hero. Merida's transgressive clashes with her mother and father are also wonderfully dramatic; think Jane Austen soaked in nitroglycerin. Unfortunately 'Brave' quickly degenerates into clichés . The film's witches, magic, and giant bears seem below Pixar, Chapman's symbolism is too obvious, her script too often recalls Disney's 'Mulan', and a subplot about a mad son who loses his soul (and father's kingdom) because he 'refused to obey monarchs' undermines the film's scepticism of parents, status quos and tradition.7/10 – Other good, recent animated films: Chomet's 'The Illusionist', Hosoda's 'The Girl Who Leapt Through Time', 'The Secret World of Arrietty', Oshii's 'The Sky Crawlers', 'Only Yesterday', 'From Up on Poppy Hill', Satoshi Kon's 'Paprika' and Yeon Sang-ho's 'The King of Pigs'.

Guardians of the Galaxy," Can't be cool and witty, designed by committee
","'You're off the artistic roll call forever. You're another shill. Everything you say is suspect and every word that comes out of your mouth is now like a turd falling into my drink.' - Bill HicksMarvel Studios has repeatedly hired 'quirky' directors in an attempt to elevate the quality of their blockbusters. Based on their postmodern superhero flicks ('Kick-Ass' and 'Chronicle'), for example, Matthew Vaughn and Josh Trask were hired to direct 'First Class' and 'The Fantastic Four'. Based on his supposed 'reinvigoration' of the romance genre with '500 Days of Summer, Mac Webb was similarly given several 'Spider-Man' movies. Shane Black and Joss Whedon, postmodern nerd-kings who specialise in narrative irreverence, were likewise tasked with 'spicing up' 'Iron Man 3' and 'The Avengers'. The rest of the Studio's catalogue is filled with pictures by such 'prestigeous' guys as Ang Lee, Sam Raimi, James Mangold, Bryan Singer and Kenneth Branagh. In most cases, the demands of the Marvel brand suck these films dry of anything interesting. Though engineered to be 'edgy', these films mostly have the effect of neutering their supposed auteurs. James Gunn directed 'Super' in 2010, another postmodern - and supposedly 'irreverent' - superhero movie. Gunn was given the helm of 'Guardians of the Galaxy' in 2012. Like most Marvel features, the result is a zillion dollar cartoon made by machines. You can almost see the boxes being ticked.'Galaxy' opens with a child being abducted from his dying mother. This kid grows to become Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), an intergalactic space thief. The film's opening action sequence – lifted from 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' - finds Quill stealing a gonad shaped MacGuffin. As this MacGuffin houses an INFINITY STONE! which grants AWESOME POWERS! to whosoever wields it, it is pursued by seemingly everyone in the universe. They want it. Quill has it.'Galaxy' then introduces us to Rocket (a genetically engineered Racoon), Groot (Chewbacca with chlorophyll) and Gamora (warrior-eyecandy). All three are attempting to get their hands on the INIFINITY STONE! The film also contains a dull subplot involving a BIG BAD VILLAIN who wears a cape, spews dull bad-guy dialogue, wields a hammer and flies around in a giant spaceship attempting to destroy planets. Why? Because he's a bad guy.'Galaxy' is less superhero movie than space-opera. 'Star Wars' without the novelty value, 'Serenity'/'Firefly' without the cleverness, 'Futurama'/'Fifth Element' without the irreverence, it mostly bludgeons you with money. Gunn's idea of 'wit' is to play 1980s pop over sequences. Elsewhere he thinks a grunting tree and a talking raccoon alone constitute 'wittiness', as though the duo's mere presence somehow turns bad writing original.Our hero, Peter Quill, is himself a weird bag of juxtapositions. Quill's supposedly a space rascal, a lovable archetype in the vein of Han Solo or Mal Reynolds. But this 'resourceful underdog' archetype doesn't work if he's also an insanely muscular, man-child. We the audience are never sure if Quill is clever, dashing, lazy, disciplined, funny, strong, weak, stupid, a virgin, a stud, naive, a rogue or an idiot on steroids. Han Solo was consistent. Quill's Flash Gordon with a Ken doll's IQ.'Galaxy's' best sequences involve Quill and his buddies escaping from an orbital prison. It also contains one good running gag in which Rocket tricks people into stealing body parts. The rest of Gunn's film – its 'heroic sacrifices', its 'A New Hope' inspired climax, its CGI dogfights and endless fisticuffs – unfolds as per formula. Co-starring John C. Riley, Zoe Saldana, Benecio Del Toro and Glenn Close.6/10 – Worth one viewing.",Null,10,18,16 December 2014
The Last Emperor," Imago
","'A successful parasite is one that is not recognised by its host, one that can make its host work for it without appearing as a burden. Such is the ruling class in a capitalist society.' - J. Read.The 1800s. China is ruled by various emperors and warlords. Exerting their will upon these rulers are the Great Powers (France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, Austria-Hungary, the United Kingdom and the United States), who accord themselves special privileges, immunities and extraterritorial rights. They carve China up between themselves.Tired of imperialistic powers exploiting their country, countless rebellions spring up. Some target foreigners, others challenge the Emperors, who are Manchurian and so perceived as invaders. Soon, Chinese nationalism is on the rise. This leads to The Boxer Rebellion (1899), in which proto-nationalists dare to take on imperialists. The Great Powers respond by sending in their fleets and troops. The rebellion is crushed.The next major upheaval occurs in 1911, with the Xinhai Revolution. Here China's last Imperial dynasty - the Qing dynasty - is kicked out, and the Republic of China established. Far from a homogeneous class movement, this Revolution is propelled by various disparate groups. In many regions it is spearheaded by the landed gentry, stockholders and the upper middle classes, who oppose the ways in which their assets are being sold to foreign banks (mega banks in Britain, Germany, France, Denmark, even the nefarious J.P. Morgan) by the Emperor in an effort to pay off China's escalating debts. The Revolution ends in 1912 with the abdication of Aisin-Gioro Puyi, China's six-year old 'Last Emperor'. In an instant, 2000 years of Imperial rule comes to an end. The Kuomintang (the KMT or Nationalist Party) henceforth assumes control of China, though many regions remain under the rule of regional warlords. The Kuomintang spends the next decade wrestling control away from these warlords.Today, most historians steer clear of the word 'feudalism'. Social scientists likewise deem 'feudalism' a vague or meaningless term. Socio-economic relations under dynastic rule were more complex than is typically thought, they argue, and there is very little that firmly distinguishes contemporary capitalism from the reality of 'actual feudal life'.Such a lack of meaningful distinction is something which the Chinese swiftly come to realise. Royals had been kicked out, but elites, often with ties to the very same foreign powers who brokered deals with the emperors, still skewed things in their favour. And so China swiftly descends into Civil War, forces loyal to the Kuomintang-led government on one hand - supported by hundreds of thousands of troops from America, England and other European powers - and forces loyal to the Communist Party of China on the other. The war began in 1927 and paused briefly whilst both parties put aside their differences to counter the Japanese invasion of China. The Civil War resumed in 1946, after hostilities with Japan had ended. The Civil War then ended in 1950 with the communists victorious and the leadership of the Kuomintang fleeing to Taiwan, where today they still claim to be the legitimate government of China.In 1949, communist leader Mao Zedong ushered in a new China – the People's Republic of China – with its capital in Beijing. Chaos, disorganisation and confusion followed. Millions would die of starvation and due to the ensuing lawlessness. Slowly, however, the communists began to pull things together. Hundreds of millions of peasants were given land, women's rights were advanced, living standards rose, foreign powers were booted, literacy rates skyrocketed, health-care and education were extended to the working masses, and ordinary people were involved for the first time in the political process, and even encouraged (in theory) to continually challenge the revolutionary government. Over time, the more radical tenets of communism would be reversed by market reformists within the communist party, eventually giving rise to modern China; a state-capitalist juggernaut.Bernardo Bertolucci directed 'The Last Emperor' in 1987. A lavish biopic, the film watches as Emperor Puyi, a young child, cute and innocent, loses all official powers and is barricaded in The Forbidden City. Here Puyi lives a privileged but isolated existence, banned by the Kuomintang from ever leaving his expansive palace. He receives private tuition, is married and dreams of reclaiming his throne.Overlong and hampered by its fidelity to history, 'Emperor' is nevertheless a lush, spectacular and oft interesting film. It was inspired by the epics of Luchino Visconti, a Marxist whose films were preoccupied with the effects of revolutions on the upper classes. Bertolucci is himself a Marxist. But where Visconti observed as dynasties fade and wither after various social 'reconfigurations', Bertolucci does the opposite, his emperors desperately clinging to power.The Latin root of 'radical' is 'to strike at the root' or to 'target the source'. As such, Bertolucci portrays Puyi as a kind of weed or seed that keeps re-germinating once conditions are right. This ideological contaminant, or parasite, may go into hibernation, may appear to be safely quarantined, it may even appear to be extinct, harmless, cute or benign. But as Bertolucci shows, it craves power and always tries to re-establish itself. Puyi cannot help but infect, infest and grow.And so 'Emperor's' second half watches as Puyi becomes an adult. He becomes increasingly possessive, treats even free men as his underlings, and eventually forges alliances with the rulers of Japan, who support his puppet reign in Manchuko. The film ends with Puyi removing a cricket from his throne. It's an implausible scene – the cricket is decades old, having been given to Puyi during his coronation – but symbolically apt. Associated with growth and harvesting in Chinese mythology, the cricket speaks to the survival of Puyi's brand of power. Like a resilient Hydra, heads may roll, but the beast lives on. Fittingly the cricket is passed to a devout Red Guard, suggesting where exactly China's parasites now reside.8/10 – See 'The Damned' (1969).",Null,1,2,29 March 2015

The Adjustment Bureau," Solar Lottery
","'Is love the ultimate affirmation of free will, or its negation?' - Anson ShupeBased on 'The Adjustment Team', a 1954 short story by Philip K. Dick, George Nolfi's 'The Adjustment Bureau' stars Matt Damon as a Congressman who has a chance encounter with Elise, a beautiful young woman. Damon, it later turns out, is being groomed by an agency called The Adjustment Bureau. A cross between angelic beings, deities, extraterrestrials and Rene Magritte paintings, the members of the Bureau are essentially puppet-masters who control mankind. Led by a mysterious, god-like figure called The Chairman, the Bureau manipulates various real world variables such that they have knock-on, future effects. Their goal? For Damon to fulfil his dream of becoming the future President of the United States. To accomplish this they must prevent Elise and Damon falling in love.In the original short story, Dick turns the question of human agency into a real corporate agency – The Adjustment Bureau. The Bureau then essentially becomes a metaphor for investigating various then-novel ideas relating to hard and soft free-will, determinism, indeterminism, predestination, existentialism and cause-and-effect. The idea is that human beings have much less free-will than they typically imagine, and that a myriad of invisible entities, or invisible variables – social, external, environmental, biological, neurological, genetic, cultural, language etc – are responsible for our actions, thoughts and who we are. Indeed, many recent experiments are starting to show that a large number of human activities, actions, thought processes etc are preconscious; they occur before we consciously decide to do them. Later Dick stories would push this further. The Self, what you think of as a free, independent controlling agent, would be reconfigured altogether; it becomes both Other and Nothing, a phenomenal self model (an accidental byproduct of an interplay between the senses and consciousness) whose content is not innate but impersonally programmed by extrinsic sources. The self, what you think as You, is a relatively recently 'built' neurocomputational model - not a soul or mental or coherent essence - which mistakes itself for an uncaused causer capable of initiating causal chains. Today many neuroscientists are quite happy to cast away the notion of freewill, the Sovereigh Self and believe in something very much like Dick's 'Adjustment Team'. Entities do control us, they're just not literal sentient beings. To Eastern religions, this is hardly radical. Indeed, the major religions of both the East and the West can be seen as a response to the Self. Very broadly speaking, Western monotheistic religions assert the existence of a God whose authority, strength, demands and wisdom keep the Self concrete, whereas Eastern religions try to weaken these ideas, and stresses a kind of depersonalisation, or collapsing of all barriers. One side's ego boosting (you're real, you matter, God's given you the ability to choose, a preoccupation with acquisition etc), one seeks ego death (the self as illusion, a preoccupation with letting go, self as illusionary artifact of the mind, no independent bodies, only interconnected matter etc).George Nolfi is a Christian, however, and has constructed 'The Adjustment Beaurea' to reflect a very conservative, traditionally Christian slant. So in his hands The Chairman covertly becomes a stand-in for God and Damon is vaguely emblematic of various Biblical tenets. Damon has no choice, no free will, is a lowly animal, until he 'disobeys god's plan' and 'chooses love', which is then revealed to have been 'the plan all along'. Like a good Christian, Damon questions whether his will is better than god's plan and asks how can he be responsible if all is predestined by God. The final message is what some old Christian philosophers called the 'axiom of authentic love'. God's plan in the film is for Damon to freely choose between loving another and fulfilling his dreams of becoming the President.While this may make a reasonably competent action thriller, philosophically it's mostly stupid (continuous rewrites have left the film thematically incoherent). In the real world there is no plan, there is no god, the lack of a plan doesn't necessarily mean man now has free will (one can have no free will precisely because they are buffeted by arbitrary variables) and the notion that 'choosing love' signifies 'free choice' ignores the fact that there are few things less free than 'romantic love'. Today many studies are starting to show that in issues of love, learning, choices, actions etc, your brain/body makes decisions long before you consciously know it, man acting before he becomes conscious of making the decision to act. In effect, we are so programmed that we can't even conceive of just how programmed we are. This is not to say that there is 'no such thing as free will', but there are nuances and factors involved that completely contradict Nolfi's false binary. Nolfi puts 'Damon freely choosing to love Elise' on one side, and 'Damon forced to obey a rigid plan' on the other, but 'choosing to love Elise' is exactly as 'unfree' as 'obeying the plan', and real world 'plan's' are both as whimsically arbitrary yet as rigidly coded as this act of love. What the film wants you to believe in is a very Christian, Western version of Man as a wholly autonomous, free agents who is 'allowed by God to be free' but only so that he may 'choose between good or bad'. It's not quite the Biblical blackmail tale of the New Testament, but is almost.5/10 - Worth one viewing.",Null,2,5,17 January 2013
World Trade Center," Passive Victimhood
","'The resolve of our great nation is being tested, but make no mistake, we will show the world we will pass the test.' - George W BushPost 9/11 cinema seemed to witness an increase in at least three types of films: those that portrayed families under siege by faceless terrorists ('War of the Worlds', 'Mist', 'Cloverfield' etc), those which attempted to appeal to the heroism, courage and duty that large scale national catastrophes elicit ('United 93', 'World Trade Centre', 'Spider Man', 'Ladder 49' etc) and those which openly attacked US foreign policy ('Lions for Lambs', 'Syrianna', 'Redacted', 'Rendition', 'In the Valley of Ellah' etc).Of these films, Paul Greengrass's 'United 93' and Oliver Stone's 'World Trade Centre' were two of the first to directly address the events of September the 11th. Both focus on the actual disaster, both attempt to be gritty and realistic, both focus on ordinary Americans and both pretend to avoid sensationalism.But what ideology do these films serve? Observe, for example, how both films seem to focus on exceptions to the norm. Of the four kidnapped planes, 'United 93' focuses on the only one which failed to reach its target. Similarly, 'WTC' tells the story of the only 2 members of the Port Authority Police Force who made it out of the WTC rubble alive. In terms of historicism, these films mimic Spielberg's 'Schindler's List' and 'Private Ryan', two other faux-realistic films about exceptions (the Jews who survived, the son who lived etc) which turned violent carnage into personal triumph for the purpose of national regeneration.In 'United 93', we have the passengers of a hijacked plane knowing they're about to die. They thus decide to storm the pilot's cabin and bring their plane down before it hits its target. They, apparently, make a sacrifice so that others may live 'free'. This notion of national duty and personal sacrifice is mimicked in 'WTC'. The effect is that both films mythologise 9/11 as a moment of American triumph, rather than a national failing. 'United' deals with American heroism in the skies and 'WTC' deals with American heroism on the land. Both serve to rebuild national identity: ie, we are a nation of victims, attacked by irrational 'savages'. If we hope to prevail, it is our duty to respond with heroism, solidarity and self-sacrifice, the very 'United' of the film's title.In his writings, Jacques Ellul examines the workings of Judeo Christian myths. He says that post WW2 political propaganda will increasingly appeal to both feelings of guilt and sorrow. Soldiers, firemen and citizens will become dead Christs, their suffering mythologised and used as emotional tools to, unintentionally or not, draw the support of the public. As the end of 'Private Ryan' proclaims - a film which rapes pre-WW2 history as expertly as this current crop of Gulf War 2 films distorts post-WW2 history - we must 'earn this', because 'they' went through 'hell for you'. And so we pin ribbons on our heroes and build altars to our everyman Christs, praising them for protecting us from 'evil'. But the truth is we owe our uniformed Christs absolutely nothing.By focusing their narratives on 'exceptions to the rule', these films serve the purpose of preventing us from asking truly important questions. They avoid any context, political or otherwise, and are content to simply focus on ordinary people being affected by the sudden and violent intrusion of History. But it is a History without a Cause. It is History without Context. It is History without Meaning or Motive. That the majority of the hijackers belonged to a repressive country and puppet state armed and backed by the United States is ignored. That - as social scientists like Robert Page and others demonstrate in their analyses of all major terrorist acts over the past half century - terrorism is never religiously motivated but always designed for reasons of autonomy or national liberation, is likewise ignored.The result of such things are three fold. Firstly, such art helps to bolster a virtual threat; an invisible, spectral enemy. The covert message of such mythology is that this omniscient threat of Terror legitimises our obscene measures of self-defence.The second result of such art is to convey a sense of national victimhood. Such victimhood is itself a contradictory force. It provides us with the moral basis for retaliation and power accumulation...and yet such a power can only be acquired once one feigns weakness. Thirdly, in the guise of apoliticism, such art engenders a very specific type of passivity and acceptance. When the monster attacks, one just does one's duty. Such a reaction is automatic, even sacrificial, because trust (and a righteous belief in one's self, one's government etc) is understood.Bizarrely, both films also exude strange, almost spiritual overtones. Terrorists are portrayed as angels of death, spectral enemies who sweep down from the heavens, and the directors also refuse to show planes actually crashing into buildings. To confront the actual crash almost seems too painful, too sacrilegious. 2/10 - Worth no viewings.",Null,1,5,2 November 2008
Black Hawk Down," War porn in the guise of brotherly honour
","The Enlightenment introduced a new version of honour, based on the idea of war as a rule-bound, principled undertaking. This illusion was somewhat shattered in WW1, when millions were mowed down on the mechanised killing fields. It quickly became clear that national honour was nothing more than a deceptive veneer over organised bloodshed. As such, Hollywood's first few war films were largely pacifist.Then came the so called Good War. In 1942 'Sergeant York' was released, a filmed biography of the Tennessee rifleman who by killing 23 Germans became the most decorated American soldier in history. The film recast WW1 as a reasonable national enterprise, not a deranged slaughterhouse. 'York' can be viewed as the first movie to foster public support for America's entry into World War II by dramatising a new, democratised ideal of honour.While Democracy was seen to be right and good, war itself was believed to be morally wrong, its causes connected with the aggressiveness natural to authoritarian regimes. Thus, over time, the idea took root that the only just war was a war in defence of democracy. This became the formula for almost all war movies made between 1942 and 1945. Under the guidance of the War Office, most of these films played up the skill and heroism of the ordinary GI, and played down the carnage of battle. This formula lasted into the post-war era because it was effective at promoting the democratic ideal of honour. Like its predecessors, this ideal posits a link between virtue and victory. Nevermind that the 'enemy' fights as valiantly as 'you' or that these wars are all fought for old fashioned colonialist reasons. No, on the level of myth it's deemed important to show the 'sons of democracy' fighting more valiantly than the Other. In 1949 Hollywood released about eight war films that did just this.In the 1950s we had a few anti war films ('Pork Chop Hill', 'Paths of Glory' etc'), most of which challenged notions of 'sacrifice', 'nobility' and even 'free choice'. Specious notions of 'honor' now could no longer be rationalised. Henceforth soldiers no longer died for country, they died for their comrades. They acted out of loyalty and fear of dishonouring the unit. The 1960s and 1970s saw the elimination of virtually all film industry controls over violent content in movies. Along with the fall of the Hays Office, this development made it possible to depict combat more graphically than ever before. The technical challenge of rendering the ultimate action sequence became an obsession.Yet the 1970s also saw a growing realisation that Vietnam veterans were taking heat. So along with the challenge of making war look gorier came the challenge of making vets look nobler. The two goals were reconciled by amplifying violence and reducing war to nothing larger than the ethos of buddies helping buddies (ie- Bands of Brothers).This ethos now dominates almost all war movies, with rare exceptions. If American war films are wandering back into dangerous, propagandistic and gore-glorifying territory, it is not because they're getting good at simulating the spectacle of combat. It's because, in an effort to avoid political controversy - apoliticism itself being a firm political stance which engenders only more violence - they offer underdeveloped plots and characters to serve an outdated and dysfunctional definition of honour. Meanwhile 'Black Hawk Down', one of Ridley Scott's dumbest film, is content to again rehash your typical fascist tale of victimised, out-gunned white men battling heroically, gloriously, against a savage horde. A remake of 'Private Ryan' and 'Zulu', Scott updates the White Man's Burden, everyman grunts subjecting themselves to toil in order to save the savage from himself. Unsurprisingly, Scott's Somali victims speak only to condemn themselves, displaying no emotions other than greed and the lust for blood. Their appearances are accompanied by sinister Arab techno, while the US forces are trailed by violins, oboes and vocals inspired by Enya. White troops display horrific wounds and clutch family photos, Somalis drop like flies, dispensable and unmourned.Of course the film is a mighty misrepresentation of what happened in Somalia. In 1992, George Bush senior announced that America had come to do 'God's work' in Somalia. Unfortunately, in Pentagon speak, 'God's Work' means bombing nations to hell, Washington arming clan chiefs and warlords in a deliberate attempt to destabilise the region (largely for Conoco, Amoco, Chevron and Phillips). The US has been doing this for a long time, backing the brutal Somali dictator Siad Barre in 1978 and pitting him against Ethiopia, before arming Ethiopia and using it as a proxy force against Somalia. Through the IMF, the US loaned over three million dollars to both sides, most of which went to arms and led to untold amounts of bloodshed. The West, of course, has a history of backing puppet dictators and then backing their dictator's enemies when these puppet's get too big for their boots (eg -Saddam Hussein pitted against Iran and Kuwait armed against Saddam, before Saddam was taken down directly by the US). With no conflicts to justify their presence in the area, the US then seized upon the buzzwords 'Somalian pirates' (the pirates are directly caused by Western mega-corps dumping toxins and destroying local fishery populations) and 'war on terror' as an excuse to intensify their overt/covert actions in the region. Through these buzzwords, the US - while the UN unconscionably stands by - justified their support of yet more warlords, pitting them against the democratically elected Islamic Courts Union, an organisation which has brought some level of peace, unity, stability and some semblance of nationhood to Somalia.But of course the West doesn't want this. 30 per cent of America's oil will come from Africa over the next ten years. American hegemony depends on Africa remaining unstable and run by puppets willing to prevent the nationalising of minerals, resources or crack down on law-dodging mega-corps.2/10 - Sexy evil.",Null,18,34,18 September 2008
Rudy," Five foot nothing
","David Anspaugh's 'Rudy' charts the life of Daniel 'Rudy' Ruettiger (Sean Astin), a young man who harbours dreams of playing football for the esteemed University of Notre Dame.A thin but at times unconventional sports flick, 'Rudy's' big gimmick is this: Rudy is a tiny guy. How tiny? Real tiny. For all his tenacity, poor Rudy simply isn't cut out for playing ball. Indeeed, Rudy's never even granted the climactic 'happy ending' which many sports dramas target. Instead, Rudy's last act 'victory' merely amounts to him being granted a few paltry seconds on a football field.Sports movies usually trade in 'inspirational' messages. 'Rudy' does this as well, but manages to blend cynicism with sentimentality. You sense this is not director David Anspaugh's intention; he's simply looking for formulaic uplift. The film co-stars Jon Favreau. Sean Astin does well with a tricky role.7.5/10 – Worth one viewing.",Null,0,2,24 May 2014
Prisoners," Wolverine blows rape whistle, fanboys weep
","'Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference. Amen.' - Reinhold NiebuhrDennis Villeneuve directs 'Prisoners'. The film opens on Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), a tough survivalist who recounts the Lord's prayer whilst hunting for deer. 'Your kingdom come, your will be done,' he murmurs, before watching as a bullet kills his prey.Villeneuve quickly sketches Dover as a conservative Christian, survivalist, carpenter and master of his own fate. Dover hates relinquishing control, hates waiting and, more importantly, likes to take matters into his own hands. Villeneuve then clashes Dover's obstinacy with the song 'Man from Galilee', a Christian hymn about a man with 'sightless eyes' who doesn't 'trust in God', who refuses to wait for God's 'will to be done', and who refuses to 'cry for help'. Dover's first name, Keller, itself recalls Helen Keller, famously deaf and blind. Dover will eventually be revealed to be similarly deaf and blind. Early in 'Prisoners', Dover's daughter Anna is abducted. Joy, his neighbour's daughter, is similarly missing. Both are the victims of Holly (Melissa Leo), a serial killers who has abducted over sixteen kids. Why? After the death of her son, Holly came to blame Christ for ruining her life. Wishing to spread misery, she thus kidnaps, drugs and kills the kids of devout believers. She aims to instigate existential crises and a total disbelief in God. Dover, of course, believes in God wholeheartedly, but doesn't ACT as though he does. Developing this theme is a subplot in which Jake Gyllenhaal plays Loki, the detective tasked with finding the two missing girls. Trusting his own private hands and his own narrow perspective, Dover refuses to have faith in Loki. Significantly, Loki is named after the Norse God of mischief and chaos, and has crucifixes tattooed to his knuckles. He's perhaps emblematic of a 'higher', 'mysterious' order, and perhaps also a natural 'disorder', which the blustery, knuckle-headed Dover refuses to rely or call upon. 'Prisoners' ends with several revelations. A man found dead under the basement of a priest is revealed to be Holly's husband, a pair of young suspects (Bob Taylor and Alex Jones) are revealed to be victims of Holly, and references to mazes prove to be allusions to methods used by Holly to psychologically torture her victims. More importantly, it is revealed that had Loki or Dover done absolutely nothing throughout the film, Joy would have escaped and revealed the identity of her kidnappers anyway. Whether this is 'God's plan' or 'sheer coincidence' is left up to the viewer, though the film does suggest that it views Dover's neighbours, the Birches (steadfast like hardwood birch?), as 'true Christians'. Joy escapes, in a sense, because her parents are unwavering in their faith. Alternatively, Joy's escape represents a sense of randomness or sheer capriciousness which the militant Dover refuses to acknowledge.Regardless, Villeneuve packs his film with odd bits of symbolism. Loki's constant blinking, for example, echoes the blinking flashlight which illuminates a priest's cellar and also Dover's sputtering flashlight, which reveals both a 'cellar' and the 'rape whistle' he once gave daughter Anna. Elsewhere both Holly's husband (also a serial killer) and Dover find themselves trapped underground and judged for their sins, but only Dover repents and escapes; he symbolically blows an emergency whistle, crying for help and so finally relinquishing control to a higher authority. 'Prisoners' is handsomely directed by Dennis Villeneuve. The film is immaculately lit, beautifully framed, engrossing, but also unintentionally silly in places (Why would Holly let two of her victims roam free?). The film's middle act contains an extended sequence in which Dover captures and tortures a young man whom he believes to be his daughter's kidnapper, a subplot about belief which is too quickly dropped and which never convincingly seeps into or impacts the rest of the film's drama.Interestingly, without this subplot, the film's philosophical point would have been exposed as a sham: Dover is absolutely right to do anything he can to find Anna, we only chastise him because he descends into criminality. In most situations, it is silly to bow in the face of a supposed 'higher power', be it God or indeterminism. The film preaches passivity, inaction and faith (in God or destiny), a stance which relies upon a very specific straw-man: the belief that the opposite is irrational, dangerous or immoral.Beyond this, the film's aesthetic recalls 'Seven' and Joon-ho Bong's 'Memories of Murder'. It's themes recall 'The Pledge', Dumont's 'Humanite' and 'X-Files: I Want To Believe', all more substantial crime films which touch upon similar themes. It's climax resembles 'Spoorloos', also with burials and daughters kidnapped. As comparison, see 'The Next Three Days' and 'The Limits of Controll', the former about a man who successfully wrestles control away from 'God'. 7.5/10 – Worth one viewing.",Null,2,4,13 January 2014
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Behold, the world's largest conveyor belt
","'People stopped being people in 1913. That was the year Henry Ford put his cars on rollers and made his workers adopt the speed of the assembly line. At first, workers rebelled. They quit in droves. Now we plug right into repetitive motions of a hundred kinds.' - Jeffrey Eugenides Produced by Marvel Studios (now a subsidiary of the Walt Disney Company), 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' is a gazillion dollar superhero movie. Most of the film consists of dull, unimaginative action sequences in which powerful 'good warriors' battle powerful 'bad warriors'. These action sequences - which have no sense of style, tempo and which are totally devoid of tension - are rolled out like crude, Pavlovian commands; the chemical rushes cynically demanded by corporate candy factories.Breaking up the monotony of these monotonous actions sequences are equally monotonous and equally mechanical scenes in which our heroes 'talk', 'reveal their personalities' and 'share their feelings'. These scenes exist, not because Marvel Studios has any interest in drama, characters or continuity, but because 'films are supposed to have these scenes'. In the Marvel universe, nothing really matters. The individual plots and over-arching plot lines of Marvel's films don't matter. Characters don't matter. These things are only present to present the illusion of storytelling. They are filler. The constituents of a factory assembly line whose sole goal is the procurement of money.You can't have a Marvel Movie without a super-villain. This time around our villain's a Really Bad Guy who wants to do Really Bad Stuff and who ironically pokes fun at Conventional Movie Villain Dialgoue whilst actually totally adhering to clichés. This villain (spoiler?) is defeated. Along the way, the film 'comically' delivers its obligatory 'one swear word', but not before a room full of lawyers and marketing executives run up the data, salivate over pie-charts and double check with global ratings boards.Marvel Studios has a history of roping in 'irreverent' and 'edgy' directors. Afterall, you can't sell cookie cuttered dough to zombies without pretending it's the work of a rebel. As such, 'Age of Ultron' was directed by Joss Whedon, a geek-king with a flair for zany dialogue. But like Tarantinospeak, Woody Allenspeak, Mametspeak and Coenspeak, Joss Whedonspeak is now officially annoying. Indeed, everyone in Whedon's 'Ultron' now sports the same voice. Every character, be they villain, hero, co-star, robot or computer, is an ironic, sarcastic, wisecracking master of zany one liners. This orgy of flippancy, non-sequiturs and 'cool dialogue' reeks of desperation; cool stops being cool when everyone speaks cool.Watching most Marvel Movies is a bit like being forced to watch a pornographic movie for a full two hours past the point of ejaculation. 'Ultron' in particular bludgeons you with bludgeoning. It's filled with CGI muscle-men pounding and stomping, blowing up buildings and tossing cars back and forth, and then doing it again, and again and again and again, and then again in the sequels and then again on the directors' cuts, and then again in the reboots, and then again in the reboots' sequels and then again and again. And then a few more times. And then again and again.Today, Marvel Studios now rolls like one of the world's largest conveyor belts; factory film-making as the epitome of the self-perpetuating capitalist machine, repackaging and marketing to every inch of the world. Art subservient to product cycles, product obsolescence and schizoid brains. And all the while, the Studio keeps expanding, pushing their movies in the summer, their TV shows in the fall/winter, and their streaming shows in the spring before the cycle is repeated all over again. With the new mantra of #ItsAllConnected - ironic, considering no Marvel show/series meaningfully connects to another - Marvel moves like the cinematic equivalent of malware. And now that Disney's acquired the 'Star Wars' franchise, we can expect it to similarly start squeezing new 'Star Wars' movies out of its mechanical orifices like diseased clockwork.Incidentally, like most recent Marvel movies, 'Age of Ultron's' chief villain is essentially a Western defence contract run amok. So we have another 'anti violence', 'anti military' Marvel film which gets its kicks from violence, mass murder and the flattering of whole cities. Lazily written and acted, the film finds actor Mark Ruffalo continuing to be excellent, soulful and layered. He plays the Hulk, a property damage loving green dude with magical pants.3/10 – What was Ultron's age anyway? Was that dude even legal? Worth no viewings.",Null,101,173,5 March 2016
The Dark Knight," Operation Enduring Freedom
","'Work in the shadows. A lot of what needs to be done here will have to be done quietly, without any discussion, using any means at our disposal to achieve our objective.' – Dick Cheney'The more powerful the class, the more it claims not to exist, and its power is employed above all to enforce this claim.' - Guy DebordChris Nolan's 'Dark Knight' stars Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne, a millionaire weapons contractor who moonlights as Batman, a powerful superhero who beats up terrorists. Politically, some critics believe the film to be advocating the suspension of democracy in a time of terror. Others see it as endorsing scepticism of a leader's claims to free reign during a 'state of emergency' (which is often the leader's own creation).The truth is, the film presents the usual two-party, false binary present year after election year. Batman and politician Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) represent the opposite poles of so-called democratic politics. Batman, operating outside the law to protect the defenceless people of Gotham City, represents your typical Bush/Cheney/Nixon cryptofascist, rationalising what he does (torture, law breaking etc) for the 'good of the homeland'. Kipling called this the 'white man's burden'; men rationalise their evil as a noble and necessary burden which must be righteously carried so as to spare others the load. Dent, meanwhile, along with one Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), are idealistic, by-the-books types. Both learn to be 'pragmatic' and collaborate with vigilantes (Batman), if only to take down bad guys. Batman, Dent thinks, has become a necessity.The film really tips its ideological hand during its Greek-tragedy final hour. Dawes, the most liberal of all the 'good guys', dies at the hands of a terrorist called Joker (Heath Ledger), whilst the pragmatist Dent, scarred in war, abandons his ideals and embraces the Joker's ethos of chaos. In other words, we must accept the cold embrace of Batman if we want to be secure. Dent's law abiding idealism doesn't work. It's two faced and is merely a mask for chaos and disorder.The Joker, with his Al-Qaeda like video recordings, his constant attacks on 'women and children' and his advocacy of terrorism and chaos, is a figure who stands propagandistically for 'America's enemies'. IE- America's enemies are not an oppressed and exploited, diverse and divided group trying with futility to resist in various ways, but rather, they are a fundamentally irrational, monstrous, chaotic and lawless cult of death. Thus, the Joker offers only the wild, amoral, killing life beyond the protective (and expansionist) borders of 'democracy' (aka corporatist imperialism).The moral is as old, and as conservative, as Hobbes. The film says we can live in a wild, murderous wasteland OR a lawless, authoritarian police state. It doesn't matter which of these options the film presents as more appealing or fun, all that matters is that no other options present themselves. This false binary, rife with straw-men, is the complete opposite to something like 'Hellboy 2', where our superheroes retire once they realise that the government for which they've been working ultimately opposes the difference and diversity they represent. Compared to 'Dark Knight', this is genuinely radical.Late in the film, Joker places a massive bet on the assumption that most people are as viciously indifferent to other human beings as he is. The Batman's counter-bet is that people are devoted to morals, order and authority. Batman wins, an act which serves not to celebrate Gothan's morality, but to legitimise the Dark Knight.The bad guys themselves are an assortment of freaks and ethnic minorities while the good guys are, with the exception of slave boy Morgan Freeman, uptight bourgeois white Americans. The most virtuous of them is the 'Great White Hope', Harvey Dent. Harvey, though his crusade against crime is on the legal side, secretly loves Batman's underground campaign of terror and Guantanamo Bay styled 'free reign'. In fact, Gotham police relies on Batman to break legs, smash faces, interrogate and torture on their behalf. And Batman, with enormous resources at his disposal, doesn't shirk from breaking international law to abduct a Chinese target or from erecting a colossal surveillance machine which makes Bush's extensive illegal wiretapping and water-boardings look lame. This subplot of the film is particularly insidious in light of the NSA's illegal PRISM, ECHELON and MUSCULAR surveillance programmes, ostensibly to 'stop terrorists', but really to aid big business, spying on financial ministers, charities, leftists etc. In short, Batman is bad simply because the state can't afford to be seen being bad. What's odd is that Batman's struggle is not a collective one. The few members of the public who do try to 'copycat' Batman's antics end up being butchered.To protect Gotham, Batman and the police eventually create serial lies and myths for public consumption. It's the 'noble lie' which the masses need to sustain their morale. In other words, leaders (Bush, Nixon etc) are self-righteously willing to be seen as immoral, under the understanding that you understand that what they do they do, Christ-like, for you. They protect us from Joker. Of course in the real world the nature of Joker is covered up, and Batman does nothing but enhance his own material wealth and power by way of the Joker's shocks to Gotham's system. And so the 'Knight' boils down to age old authoritarian motives: in order to have social stability you need a lie. The real hero of the film is actually the Joker, but the film's PG13 rating prevents it from dealing with this seriously. I'll take the Joker's anarchistic chaos over Batman's archaic commitment to corrupt systems of law and order any day. Not only that, Joker's psycho ramblings and burning towers of cash are infinitely more entertaining than Batman's Multi-million Dollar Extreme Warfare Batmobile.6/10 - Popcorn fascism. Despite a strong first half, 'Knight's' second half drowns in messily shot action and needless subplots. See 'Die Hard 3'.",Null,19,36,4 August 2008
The Greatest Game Ever Played," Read it, roll it, hole it
","Directed by Bill Paxton, 'The Greatest Game Ever Played' stars Shia LaBeouf as Francis Ouimet, the first amateur golfer to win the US Open.'Game' was produced by Walt Disney studios, and so is wholly generic. We get the usual inspirational messages ('dont give up on your dreams', 'be all you can be' etc), much forced sentimentality and the various well-worn clichés typical of underdog movies.Still, it's not all bad. 'Game' was directed by the lovable Bill Paxton ('Game over, man!'), who does well to delve into the class divides of early 20th century America. As he's an actor himself, Paxton also coaxes good performances from his cast, particularly LaBeouf and Elias Koteas. Their characters are broadly sketched, larger-than-life and almost mythological. Also impressive is the film's set design, with full scale turn-of-the-century towns, and some fine interior wood-work. Considering Paxton's never directed a big budget feature before, his direction in 'Game' is impressive, particularly his handling of architecture and wide spaces.7.9/10 – Worth one viewing.",Null,0,1,16 June 2014
Into the Wild," A Prairie Home Companion
","Sean Penn's 'Into The Wild' is perhaps best viewed as being part of a recent wave of eco-themed films ('Wall-E', 'Avatar', 'The Happening', 'An Inconvenient Truth', 'Grizzly Man', 'Dreamland', 'Day The Earth Stood Still', 'Antichrist', 'Day After Tomorrow', 'Happy Feet' etc). Most of these films urge their audiences to 'return to nature', 'retreat to some pastoral existence' or 'save the planet' (without looking at the systemic or economic forces which completely undermine or neutralise such wants).Interestingly, aside from 'Antichrist', 'Grizzly Man' and 'Into The Wild', nature in these films is always portrayed as being some kind of mystical, 'balanced' system. While mega-studios, quite ironically, advise us to harmonize with nature, 'smaller' directors (Penn, Herzog, Von Trier) seem to instead posit worlds in which nature is vile and base. Nature is still portrayed as being majestic and splendid, but is then associated with asphyxiation and choking, death and rot. The only harmony – as Werner Herzog once famously said – is that of overwhelming and collective murder. Murder, then, is the central theme of both 'Grizzly Man' and 'Into The Wild'. Like Sydney Pollack's 'Jerremiah Johnson', both films are about young men (Christopher McCandless in Penn's film, Timothy Treadwell in Herzog's) who cut themselves off from civilisation and venture off into the wilderness. Of course both Herzog and Penn initially romanticise their central characters' flights. They see beauty in this journey and a kind of crazy inner strength (McCandless rejects vapid materialism, 9 to 5 routines and sees the modern word as being a hindrance which atrophies humanity and conscience ). But both artists are also careful to counter this idealism with nature at its most violent. And so both films find their heroes 'leaving civilisation', but only because they've first suffered a total, psychological collapse. They now disbelieve in their Master Signifiers, in their Symbolic Orders, and see civilisation itself as being representative of that which is arbitrary and chaotic. Both films then end with the deaths of their central characters, McCandless killed by a lowly poisonous berry, Treadwell killed by a mighty grizzly bear. This is not romanticism: the impetus for our adventures is something sad and pathetic, even if they're absolutely right. Their problem is that they've diagnosed civilisation but idealised Nature, a fatal failing; mankind's history is a history of battling the wild outdoors. Respect Nature. Approach with caution.And so both Treadwell and McCandless are portrayed as being disenchanted idealists who cut themselves off from a world they no longer feel apart of, no longer trust, no longer believe in. But while Penn romanticises Christopher's idealistic dream of 'entering the wilderness', he is careful to counter this with nature at its most violent. Christopher hunts for food but recoils from maggots, Christopher attempts to cross a river, but nature's violent highways prove too powerful, Christopher forages for berries, but eats only poisonous weeds which ultimately kill him.The result is that Penn celebrates disenchantment and urges one to disconnect (mental breakdown, oft the precursor to wisdom), even as he warns that drifting too far is itself a form of suicide or self-destruction. Chris wants to cut himself off from mankind (the film opens with a quote from the Romantic Movement which advocates 'ostracizing oneself from humanity'), but also learns that 'Happiness Is Real Only When Shared' (the last dreams he has is of hugging his parents). And that's Penn's irony: it is the connections that Christopher makes with other people as he continues along on his journey which allowed him to survive in the wilderness for as long as he did. When towards the end of the film Christopher turns down an offer to live with an elderly man, he effectively gave up entirely on humanity. This total disconnection, this suicidal action, is ultimately what the film warns of.The kind of balance that the film longs for is thus similar to the teachings of Thoreau, who advocated finding a middle ground between rejecting and fully embracing the wilderness. The people Chris meets (and rejects) along his journey are thus in possession of the life he longs for.Elsewhere the film is about the enchantment of text and the romance of words. Krakauer wrote about Chris not only because Chris' journey was inspired by idealistic books (Chris takes literature rather than food with him) but because Chris was himself a writer and left behind numerous documents. What the film thus does is sets up a war between the word (fantasy) and the image (world). As each level of text is one step removed from reality, image eventually wins, the image of a berry and the failure to correctly read it being what ultimately kills Chris.Audiences typically view Chris as either a 'hero' or a 'jerk', but he's more a lost, fragile child. Having learnt that everything he knew about his parents and his own history was a lie, Chris began to distrust everything. Suddenly all truths were shattered. The only way for Christopher's mind to cope with this subjective destitution was to then enter a little fantasy world in which he's a 'noble adventurer'. As he loves meta-acting, Penn thus has actor Emile Hirsch play Christopher as a wounded guy playing the role of the very romantic hero he reads about in books.Elsewhere, like Kirk Douglas' 'Lonely Are The Brave', Penn contrast modern technology with primitivism. He stresses the artificiality of the caravans and abandoned buses which Christopher relies on to survive, and counterpoints Christopher's physical death with a near spiritual shot of a modern passenger jet. The film does not condemn modern technology, it recognises it as a necessity. The film then ends with Christopher's body seemingly 'transcending' into heaven. The film then rewinds, his body sucked into the ground, Penn's camera pulling back such that Christopher's corpse seems to be asphyxiated by Nature. 8.5/10 – Worth two viewings.",Null,9,10,21 February 2010
"Girl, Interrupted"," One flew over the cuckoo's nest
","'Take the life-lie away from the average man and you take away his life.' - Henrik Ibsen 1967. 18 year old Susanna Kaysen (Winona Ryder) checks herself into a Mental Hospital after attempting suicide. She is diagnosed with the vaguely titled 'Borderline Personality Disorder', a self destructive 'illness' which seems to spring from a complex cocktail of alienation, existential malaise, intelligence, despair, depression, misanthropy and a hyper-sensitive nervous system. Unlike average people, who hold cognitive biases in at least three key areas - viewing oneself in unrealistically positive terms, believing one has more control over their environment than they actually do, holding views about the future that are more positive than evidence can justify – Susanna's self-esteem is shattered because she is unwilling to entertain certain consoling delusions.At the Hospital Susanna meets Lisa Rowe (Angelina Jolie), an uncaring sociopath with a 'cold heart'. Lisa believes she will 'end up' as a 'cold hearted sociopath' if she continues to view the world as she does. Lisa thus redefines her depression as a form of self-absorption, narcissism and self-indulgence, identifies herself as 'the cause of her problem', exits the Hospital, decides to 'be happy', 'chooses life' and then learns to write 'all her bad feelings and observations in a book'. She then becomes a writer. The film was based on the memoirs of author Susanna Kaysen. It's narrative arc is a rights-of-passage many artists or creative types go through. It's what Saint John called a 'Dark Night of the Soul' or what Satre termed 'existential nausea'.Though one of the best 'big budget suicide movies', 'Girl, Interrupted' ultimately trivialise mental illness and continues a Hollywood trend (see 'Veronica Decides To Die' et al) of placing the blame of 'mental illnesses' solely on the individual. In such films, it is always the individual's duty to 'adapt to' or 'block out' problems. Individuals and society are dichotomized, and the environmental/socioeconomic/cultural/existential milieu in which the subject exists is ignored such that 'suicide' is reduced to a kind of biochemical glitch or issue of personal will power. In reality, though, there is no separation between the individual and society. Human beings become social with the appropriation of language, and it is language that constitutes us as subjects. 'Madness' is itself often a kind of discourse, an attempt at communication, and assuming that human beings can ever be 100 percent mentally healthy, self improvement is never possible without first calling a toxic society into question.Today, most mental disorders are still classified on the basis of symptoms because there are as yet no biological markers or tests for them. This is not to say that some mental illnesses aren't caused by genetic or biological 'defects', but that what often passes for mental illness is itself just a symptom of a larger social problem. Medicating the subject is often a form of denial or aversion, and simply results in further problems down the line. The mental health profession has also somehow missed out on various 'perspectives' prevalent now in philosophy, history, the social sciences, literature and art. Like the Church, it is in the business of forcing very specific 'realities' onto people. Label someone crazy – rationally speaking, Susanna is not wrong – and the subject suddenly is both crazy, and self-reinforces this craziness. Today psychiatry, a multi trillion dollar industry, is responsible for nearly 90 percent of all health care fraud in the United States.Angelina Jolie won an Academy Award for her performance. Like most Award winners, it's mostly a loud, flashy performance. Winona Ryder, always adorable, does better work here, conveying both fragility and a sense of resultant, overcompensated toughness. The film's title is genius: 'mental illness' halts life hard and fast, and often life only seems to re-start once the subject has conquered its demons. Such 'conquerings' often take the form of elaborate, psychological con-jobs. We see that here, Sussana 'believing' herself to be cured but then seeking out a profession that allows her to maintain physical and psychic distance from that which ills her.8/10 – Too Hollywood, too superficial, too playful (the hospital feels too much like a fun sorority), but Ryder endears with her frail frame and big Bambi eyes.

Toy Story," Falling With Style
","'I believe that a filmmaker's entire work is contained within his first film; not that it can all be foreseen, but that it can afterwards be verified.' – Francois Truffaut (The Films In My Life) Buzz Lightyear, a glossy action figure with a sexy sheen, is not a mere toy. He's a Space Ranger, tasked with protecting the universe from the evil Emperor Zurg! His life has meaning, he is unique, his existence has grand purpose! Woody, a dated cowboy doll, thinks otherwise. He was once a youthful and exuberant toy, the favourite plaything of his owner Andy, but years of existence have shown him the truth: everyone is just a toy, soon to be forgotten and discarded. No one is unique. There is no grand purpose. No universe to save. Better to be a realist, seeing the world without its fake plastic facade and tacky ipod veneer.Of course Buzz thinks Woody is just a crazy old timer. Doesn't Woody realise that Buzz is a genuine Space Ranger?! That he's a member of the Elite Universe Protection Unit! That he alone has information that reveals Emperor Zurg's weakness! That stupid fool! Naturally, we the audience identify with Woody. Buzz seems like an idiot, brainwashed and in desperate need of identity and purpose. The Elite Universe Protection Unit merely elevates believers into a position of exaggerated importance. This is an idle fantasy, an other-worldly hope adopted by those who can't face the dour reality that is the 'real world of toys'.Midway in the film, our heroes stumble across a horde of green alien toys. These aliens worship a giant claw, a mechanical God which they believe will descend and pluck the 'chosen ones', taking them to some kind of toy heaven. In reality, the claw chooses only deluded souls, and offers them to the devilish Cid Phillips, a sadistic child who mutilates toys. 'Nirvana is coming!' the aliens whisper, watching as the 'chosen ones' are airlifted to their deaths.Buzz Lightyear faces a similar scenario later in the film. Having witnessed a television commercial which advertises a vast range of Buzz Lightyear action figures, Buzz must confront the fact that he really is 'just an ordinary toy' who 'can not fly'. 'Flying' thus becomes a sort of Nietzschean metaphor, the ability to transcend the 'flesh' (in this case, injection moulded plastic) and become 'something more'.Buzz's first reaction upon seeing the commercial is to seek refuge in denial. 'I am not a toy!' he says to himself, before climbing to the top of a staircase. Seeking to validate himself by flying, by defying the laws of toy-dom, he takes a giant jump – a literal leap of faith – and of course falls promptly to the ground. He can't fly.Cue the fastest existential crisis ever seen in a children's film, Buzz Lightyear promptly falling into a deep depression, his faith completely destroyed. His entire existence was based on a lie, a social framework which indoctrinated him into believing that the fate of the whole universe depended on his actions. How can he continue living? Why do anything? What's the point? And more importantly, how the hell did this become a kid's franchise? It's like a demented cartoon by Philip K. Dick ('Do Plastic Toys Dream of Suicide Switches?').Then comes the message of the film. Woody tells Buzz that being a Space Ranger doesn't define who he is. His value, status and worth can only be found within the community of toys, on ground level, and not 'up in the skies'. There is no purpose beyond ground zero and our importance lies solely in our ability to bring good to those immediately around us.Buzz heeds Woody's words and quickly gets over his loss of faith. He stages a daring rescue mission, straps a rocket to his back and flies spectacularly in the air, his newfound love for the 'greater good of his family' quite literally giving him wings.In true Zarathustran fashion, Buzz becomes a pint sized Ubermensch figure, a superman who reaches for the sky but is then brought depressingly back down to Earth. If he would just lower his sights, Woody then says, Buzz would find enough reasons to live. Set free of the 'moral code' imprinted on him by his makers, Buzz thus adopts a new code which, though it puts limits upon him, negating some of his wild ambitions and reducing him, in an existential sense, to a chunk of plastic, still allows for a Nietzschean war cry. This cry, which Buzz yells every time he jumps across that dark abyss, sums up humanity best: 'To Infinity and Beyond!' 8.9/10 – With its revolutionary visuals, consistent humour, genuine sense of adventure, memorable characters, slick camera work and a couple action/adventure scenes worthy of George Lucas, 'Toy Story' is a milestone in cinema, and one of the most influential animated films since 'Snow White'.Most interesting, though, is in observing how Brad Bird reverses Lasseter's themes here with his first Pixar feature, 'The Incredibles'.

The Graduate," Here's to you, Mrs Robinson
","'The Graduate' stars Dustin Hoffman as Ben Braddock, a disillusioned young man who has recently graduated from college. Ben's parents - garish, insensitive and money hungry - have already carved out a future for him, but Ben resists, finding no value or purpose in their way of life. Eventually Ben enters a sexual relationship with Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), the wife of one of his father's colleagues. She's likewise a detached loner and explains that she was once an artist but traded this life in for an easy marriage to a rich lawyer. Mrs. Robinson recognises pieces of herself in Ben, and sees in him her own disillusionment. The two meet frequently for sex at a local Hotel.'The Graduate' was directed by Mike Nichols, who has a background in theatre. Perhaps because of this, the film demonstrates an eagerness to explore the possibilities of cinema. Virtually every shot in the film is filled with experimental compositions and neat tricks, Nichols visibly relishing being cast free from theatre houses and stage plays.Elsewhere Nichols reveals the psychology of his characters through clever techniques. Ben is often seen to be separated from large crowds, and Mrs Robinson is always shot in vast, empty buildings. Supporting characters likewise often talk about Ben in the third person, suggesting that he is out of sync with a world he deems domineering and callous. Lonely and confused, and hiding behind a false air of confidence, Ben's also associated with water, pools, scuba-gear and fish tanks, all symbols suggestive of suffocation and aimless drifting. Like Harold in Hal Ashby's 'Harold and Maude' - another similar classic of the period - Ben's parents give him a red sports car in an attempt to instill some confidence and direction. Rather than talk to him or address his problems, they seek material solutions. Ben drifts further away.Despite a great first hour, 'The Graduate' cops out in its last act. Ben eventually casts aside Mrs Robinson and begins to fall in love with her daughter. A love triangle thus develops. Mrs Robinson forbids her daughter from marrying Ben, and Ben, now with newfound purpose, is desperate to marry the daughter. The film henceforth turns Mrs Robinson into an evil witch, the daughter into a princess and Ben into her dashing rescuer. And so in an instant 'The Graduate' turns away from the interesting relationship between Mrs Robinson and Ben, damns all adults, and morphs into a shallow attack on the generation gap. Compare with 'Goodbye, Columbus', a similar film with a much braver finale.Aesthetically, 'The Graduate' is something special. Many of the clichÃ©s (visual or otherwise) found in today's drams and comedies originated here: the shy anti-hero, those helicopter shots of cars crossing bridges, the obligatory love triangle, the climactic wedding, the last minute run to the altar etc etc. For better or worse, the film is filled with techniques and conventions that have been digested and absorbed by five decades of cinema.7.9/10 - See 'Harold and Muade', 'Le Chinoise', 'Goodbye, Columbus' and 'Ghostworld'.",Null,1,3,9 October 2008
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Total Recall Revoked
","'Although retaining the terms 'schizoid' and 'schizophrenic' for the sane and psychotic positions respectively, I shall not, of course, be using these terms in their usual clinical psychiatric frame of reference, but phenomenologically and existentially.' - R. D. LaingThough praised for its 'complex plot', 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' serves up a rather simple tale about a once romantically linked couple who are inexorably drawn back together despite having their memories wiped by Lacuna Inc, a company which specialises in 'targeted memory erasure'.Most interesting about the film is the fact that it was directed by Michel Gondry. Gondry is a corporate advertisement (Levi Jeans, Smirnoff Vodka, Air France etc) and music video director, both of which are professions which require him to master short form rather than long form film-making, constantly shift aesthetic strategies without perfecting a singular style, bow to the fact that his TV work is caught in the blip-time perishability of consumer capitalism, and capture, hold and release his audience in as little time as possible.In other words, music videos and advertising not only epitomise the schizophrenia of the postmodern aesthetic, but require the artist himself to be schizoid - akin to the characters of this film - his identity in flux. No surprise then that Gondry's subsequent films ('Be Kind Rewind', 'The Science Of Sleep' etc) all spend their running times jumping from one half-finished reconstruction of a previous film/thought/memory/image to the next, their narratives all splintered or fractured. Like Gondry's 'Be Kind Rewind', a film in which a duo recreate scenes from their memories of past movies, 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is itself a series of short-form 'music videos' or 'advertisement-like' memory fragments, quirkily strung together.Indeed, philosophers like Frederic Jameson and Jean Baudrillard have long characterized postmodernity in terms of 'amnesia' or 'memory loss', aligning its ripples with clinical Schizophrenia, split personalities, temporal discontinuity and bipolar like emotional ground tones.But 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is not only about science and society accelerating forgetfulness in a kind of Alzheimer's ward for young adults, but the desire to preserve remembrances of events, or rather, re-engineer memories to conform them to one's world-view, which of course is the clinical description of the narcissist. Where the film differs from most postmodern films about 'memory' is that it couples its nostalgia to the understanding that memory is rarely about the past and always about the present.Beyond Gondry's TV commercial aesthetic you have Charlie Kaufman's screenplay. All of Kaufman's films revolve around a neurotic artist or self-pitying depressive who is undergoing some existential despair whilst being trapped in a narrative which takes the shape of a formalist game (often a self-referential meta-story or quirky surrealist fantasy in which the neurotic hero desires to obliterate himself). Here our hero is played by Jim Carrey, but his intellectual sad sack routine is identical to that of John Cusack in 'Being John Malkovich' and Nicholas Cage in 'Adaptation', two other films by Kaufman.Of course Kaufman's 'postmodern angst' is not unique to cinema. In the world of twentieth century paintings, for example, we have Pablo Picasso's fractured world of vacant-eyed, disjointed beings, Edward Hopper's flat landscapes populated by emotionally out-of-tune men and women, the predatory horror of Willem de Kooning, Salvador Dali's obliteration of objective reality, Warhol's smirking trivialisation of mechanical reproductions and Edvard Munch's 'The Scream', which seems to capture the horror of being a cipher in a world of hideously swirling near-formless shapes.The anxieties of all these artists stem from, or coincide with, the rise of philosophical theories of scepticism and irrationalism, a growing distrust in the cognitive faculties of perception and reason, the development of scientific theories such as evolution, entropy and uncertainty, the technological revolutions spurred by the combination of science and capitalism (which led to fears of dehumanisation) and the spread of liberalism and free markets (which in turn caused the political left and members of the artistic avant garde to view political development as a series of deep disappointments).Gradually these anxieties expanded such that art-work seemed to be about its own self-elimination, those who followed Picasso and Munch obsessed with reporting their depressed observations, retreating from the world and proceeding to strip away from art anything that they could. Many eliminated as much content as they could from their works, art becoming a self-contained study of dimension, colour, and composition or a game of self-reference and self-annihilation.This is the kind of cultural nihilism which many postmodernist film directors find themselves in today. Unlike existential directors of the past, everyone from art house folk (Dreyer, Bergman, Herzog, Bresson, Tarkovsky, Antioni, Wenders etc) to humble noir or Hollywood directors of the 40s and 50s (Nicholas Ray, John Huston etc), all of whom used the assumption of nihilism as the basis for the revaluation of all social values, postmodernists like Kaufman instead find themselves wallowing in the dead ends of their intellectual limits, locked into finding new and clever ways to playfully soliloquise over the vacuity of existence. Kaufman states this himself in 'Adaptation', likening this very artistic movement to an Ouroboros snake consuming its own head.7.9/10 – A trial run for Gondry's 'The Science Of Sleep', a more interesting film. Still, despite it's hackneyed message ('It's better to lose a lover than to have never loved at all'), some severe overacting by Jim Carey and Kate Winslet, and Gondry assaulting us with every annoying gimmick he picked up making corporate videos, this is a very likable film. Worth two viewings. Once for pleasure, once for pain.",Null,3,7,15 October 2010
Elysium," God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater
","'Above ground you have the Haves, pursuing pleasure, comfort and beauty. Below ground you have the Have-nots, the Workers who are continually adapting to the conditions of labour. Those predisposed toward misery and rebelliousness soon die, such that the survivors become as well adapted to the conditions of their underground life, and as happy in their way, as the Upper-worlders are to theirs.' ― H.G. Wells ('The Time Machine')Neill Blomkamp directs 'Elysium'. The plot? In the near future, the world is starkly divided between the rich and the poor. The rich live in an idyllic floating space station, complete with robot servants, spotless mansions and superb health-care. Fittingly, this station is dubbed 'Elysium', an allusion to the mythological segment of the afterlife reserved for the privileged relatives of Gods. The poor, meanwhile, live on planet earth, which has been reduced to an industrial wasteland rife with pollution, crime, unemployment and marauding gangs of criminals. The poor want to get to Elysium, the rich want to keep them out.Enter Max (Matt Damon), an ex-con who works at a factory. As employee safety is last on the minds of his bosses, Max is injured at his job and given mere hours to live. Ticked off, and mad as hell, Max straps himself into a robot-suit, jumps aboard a space-ship, lands on Elysium and gets himself some sweet free health-care. Along the way he kills mercenaries, bureaucrats and instigates a little social reformation; Elysium's health-care is now accessible to each and every human being. Elsewhere the film contains a little allegorical subplot; Max must 'die so others may live', a gesture which speaks to the film's message of self-sacrifice, altruism and old fashioned sharing.Every major past and present mode of societal organisation has been but a giant energy accumulation system. Such systems (feudalism, monarchism, chattel slavery, mercantile and late capitalism etc) hinge on the organisation and exploitation of labour, and primarily act in the interests of a minority which organises its state apparatus for the oppression of the majority. In each case, such systems are deemed 'natural' or 'moral' by the vast majority of human beings. Those who exist within such systems tend to engage in denial, disavowal or tend to remain oblivious as to the workings of the system. Or to quote CLR James, at no point in human history has the vast majority of the planet not been misguided or outright wrong about its overriding belief or organising systems. Eventually, of course, such systems are condemned, forcing them to mutate, though they never break away cleanly from that which came before (there now exists, for example, more slaves globally than at the height of the slave trade). Though set in the future, 'Elysium' offers but an extremely cartoonish version of our contemporary world. Today, roughly eighty percent of the planet lives on less than ten dollars a day, even in MEDCs like the United States over 76 percent of the populace lives paycheck to paycheck, in all countries full employment is inherently impossible (with a 5 to 15 percent rate being deemed a systemic 'ideal'), and even in the First World, having 10 to 20 percent of your population in poverty is unavoidable. This is all accepted as standard operating procedure. Whilst 'Elysium' is well intentioned, its little tale of worker revolt ('Metropolis', 'Viva Zapata', 'Bread and Roses' etc) is far too simplistic for our contemporary world. While Blomkamp's bashing bosses, today's cutting edge critiques of capitalism veer from neo-Marxian critiques (capitalism's many contradictions and cyclical tendencies) to ecological critiques (the absurdity of 'limitless growth') to thermodynamic critiques (the systemic inherency of exponential debt creation, poverty and 'value' destruction) to proponents of outright monetary reform (the absurdity of our contemporary central banking and interest-based currency creation systems). Scientists have even begun mapping the 'heat flows' of money, providing insights too complex to get into here. Suffice to say, most of these angles are ignored by classical and neo-classical economists, or pundits who focus on micro-economics over the macro. With the 'experts' so backwards, it's not surprising to find cinema's handling of these issues still firmly entrenched in the 1930s.Still, you want old-fashioned rich-people-bashing, you got it. Damon has always been drawn to 'liberal action heroes', but here he goes all out, sticking it to the One Percent with machine guns and hand grenades. Epitomising the superficiality of American liberalism, Damon then engages in a little financial redistribution. The welfare state, then, is offered as the only solution to the inanities of capitalism. Nevermind that, historically, such measures were implemented by the ruling class specifically to preserve capitalism, to prevent uprisings, to keep the game running, and that such 'well meaning redistributive policies' must be as unsustainable as the system they are embedded within. No, in 'Eylsium', food-stamps and Medicare save the day!As politics, 'Elysium' is dumb and heavy-handed. As a straightforward action movie, it's worse. Blomkamp's plot is unwieldy, bouncing from one MacGufin to the next, and his action scenes are derivative and lack even the mildest of thrills. Elsewhere, Damon's exo-suit is gratuitously shoehorned into Blomkamp's plot, and the film's villains are a dull trio. Jodie Foster costars in a role reminiscent of her work in 'Inside Man', a better popcorn flick about race and class in America.6/10 – Worth one viewing.

Taken," Dirty Harry has a Death Wish
","'They are Skopians, they are Albanians, we will make new clothes out of their skins!' - Greek Soldiers (chant, 2010)'Taken' would make an excellent satire. Imagine it as a delirious right wing fantasy about the dangers of exiting the protective arm of American exceptionalism, our hero an ex CIA agent who will stop at nothing to rescue his 17 year old daughter, who has recently been sold into white slavery.Daddy must therefore go rogue, slipping undercover one last time in order to save his little girl from the evils of both New Europe and a Muslim/Albanian cartel. As our film progresses, our hero will dispatch with bad guys with ruthless efficiency, using his billion dollar CIA training to totally dominate all who stand in his way. Think of him as Dick Cheney with a black belt in karate, Daddy unconcerned about anything other than his own daughter. Other young women have been captured by the Albanians? Let the foreign scum take care of their own. But who will play our Dick Cheney character? Well, why not Liam Neeson, Jedi Knight and merciful saviour of the Jews? He can add gravity and sadness to this role, a kinder, gentler version of Clint Eastwood, another actor who injected believability into reactionary and xenophobic pictures.How do we get audiences to take our film seriously? Simple. Flood all its trailers with statistics and facts about global immigration, human trafficking and sex crimes. Make the film seem important, topical and relevant, then treat your suckered audience to good ole West vs the World paranoia, super dad protecting his privilege from the barbarian horde whilst ignoring the very issues our marketing campaign feigned interest in.But why waste time and money making a satire of this film?

Chariots of Fire," Balboa in Breeches
","'Nazi art is both prurient and idealising. Its aesthetic (physical perfection, identity as a biological given etc) implies an ideal eroticism: sexuality converted into the magnetism of leaders and the joy of followers. The fascist ideal is to transform sexual energy into a 'spiritual' force; pinups who are both sanctimoniously asexual and (in a technical sense) pornographic, for they have the perfection of a fantasy.' - Susan Sontag Hugh Hudson directs 'Chariots of Fire'. The plot? Ben Cross plays Harold Abrahams, a Jewish student at Cambridge University. Harold faces anti-Semitic and class based persecution, but overcomes these through much hard work and tenacity. Eventually Harold becomes a star sprinter who wins a chance to participate in the upcoming, 1924 Olympic games, held in Paris. Alongside Harold is Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson), a devout Christian who sees running as a means of both exalting God and professing his faith. He too qualifies for the Olympic Games. On route to the event, Eric learns that his race will be taking place on the Sabbath. Not wishing to 'offend God', Eric refuses to run. The Prince of Wales contacts Eric and pleads with him to change his stance, but Eric remains steadfast. The world rallies behind Eric, celebrating his unwavering principles. Eric later signs up for a longer, 400 meter race, which takes place after the Sabbath. He unexpectedly wins. Harold likewise wins his race. We applaud our underdog heroes.A box-office smash and 'classic of British cinema', 'Chariots of Fire's' content and intent, subtext and text are in constant opposition. The film pretends to celebrate the downtrodden, the persecuted, the merit of ideals, personal beliefs and courage, but espouses Victorian values, religious fundamentalism and revolves around a couple of heroes who exist to curry the favour of a glorified patrician class.Unsurprisingly, 'Chariots' was released at a time when faith in the nation state was at a remarkable low. With millions unemployed, riots in the streets, deep financial recessions and a dwindling faith in British power/prestige, 'Chariots' rekindled a kind of manic patriotism; a fervent pride in all things Britannia. No matter that an arch conservative Prime Minister (Margaret Thatcher) was gearing up for a needless war with the Falklands (a royal Wedding occurred over the summer, boosting nationalist ecstasy), privatising away the country and kicking millions out of jobs. No, now was a time for the masses to feel good about themselves again, dig deep and hanker nostalgically for the Empire's past glories. The film's so sinisterly sexy you feel like wrapping yourself up in a Union Jack, running naked down Brighton Breach and dry-humping Lord Nelson's column all at once.So though presented as figures who 'revolt against the establishment', Harold and Eric do something completely else, championing elitism, competition and aristocratic national/religious traditions. The film pretends to be about an oppressive, class-ridden 1920s England, but hungers for elitism. Significantly, most of the film is bathed in xenophobic jeers, digs at other nationalities and French bashing. Elsewhere the director puts the worst anti-Semitic remarks in the mouths of disabled working-class veterans. Liddel and Abrahams may seem to revolt against a certain order (or triumph despite it), but they exemplify its traditions and values above anyone else in the film. In fact, Liddel is too conservative even for the aristocracy; he believes in God above country, a much more archaic allegiance. And however much Abrahams complains, he still desires more than anything to become part of the aristocracy he supposedly despises.Leni Riefenstahl, the poster girl for fascist art, released the visually spectacular 'Olympia' in 1938. 'Chariot's' own aesthetic appropriates the fascist chic of Riefenstahl's films/photographs, salivating over Ubermenschian bodies whilst oozing a Wagnerian physicality, mixed with a little romanticised 'Triumph of the Wills' styled muscle porn. This is designed to stir up the audience's basest, most knee-jerk nationalism (Thatcher would use the film to rally support for her Falkland War), but it's also positively riveting; like an art house 'Rocky' movie (complete with cranky old mentor and simple 'be all you can be/make your dreams come true' plot), only with less skin and more stiff upper lips. Much of the film consists of powerful slow motion shots of running men, hordes of chanting onlookers and pulsating muscles set to a now iconic Vangelis score. Vangelis' electro-synth orchestrals are the film's big stroke of genius, the composer's music oddly juxtaposed to the film's more primitive values/aesthetic (though some say Vangelis' Wagner inspired tunes are themselves retro).'Chariots' was based on a true story, but changed a number of subtle things in order to bolster its underdog tale. In real life Abrahams did not identify with Judaism, eventually became a Cacholic, was a boozer, was not a determined workaholic, had no aspirations toward winning a gold medal, his wealth ensured him a privileged position in English society and he did not have to struggle against prejudice to gain Cambridge admission. In Eric's case, he long knew his race was to be held on the Sabbath, no meetings with the Prince of Wales took place, and the international public were behind the Brits and booed the Americans, the reverse of what Hudson's film shows. And while the film portrays 1920s Britain as a hotbed of anti-Semitism, such feelings were consigned to a few areas of the establishment. It was Britain's rulers who hated Jews (not the working class), as it associated them with the Marxism with sought the destruction of class-exploitation and aristocracy. Elsewhere Parliament was mobilising plans to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine. Still, you want Wagnerian slow-motion shots of Vangelis sprinkled ubermensch goodness? 'Chariots of Fire' delivers. Balboa would be proud.7.9/10 – Worth one viewing.",Null,1,1,20 November 2012
Frank," What goes on inside the head, inside the head?
","Directed by Lenny Abrahamson, 'Frank' stars Michael Fassbender as Frank, a mysterious musician who always wears a papier-mache mask. In need of a keyboardist, Frank hires Jon (Domhnall Gleeson). The duo isolate themselves for several months, determined to put together an experimental album.Interesting, creepy and a little bit sad, 'Frank' sketches a broad portrait of today's music scene. This is a world in which gimmicks attract listeners, in which anything marginally odd is deemed revolutionary, in which bands remain unnoticed unless they pander to mainstream trends, in which talentless leeches saddle up to gravy trains, in which even the humblest men harbour dreams of celebrity, in which mental illness is misidentified as genius, in which physical and psychological disorders hinder artists as much as help them, and in which social media alters how music is consumed and promoted.Though populated by fine actors (Maggie Gyllenhaal and Scoot McNairy in particular), it is Michael Fassbender who steals the show. Though we rarely see his face, Fassbender imbues his character with a range of emotions, Frank oscillating from godlike superhuman to insecure man-child. In Frank's mask, Jon sees what he wants to see: a legend, a God, a pathway to celebrity. The truth, though, turns out to be far more disturbing.7.9/10 – To see this material done slightly better, see: 'Ghost World', 'Art School Confidential', 'The Devil and Daniel Johnston', 'Bound for Glory', 'Mister Lonely' and 'Exit Through the Gift Shop'.",Null,2,2,18 February 2015
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard
","The final film in the 'Twilight' franchise, 'Breaking Dawn 2' finds Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) doing exactly what she did in previous instalments: TRY TO DECIDE BETWEEN BEASTIALITY AND NECROPHILIA. The problem? Her hot werewolf love interest (Taylor Lautner, totally fine) is as hot as her hot vampire love interest (Robert Pattinson as a post lawsuit Michael Jackson).What's a girl to do? Easy. Have a baby with the vampire and let your newborn daughter hook up with the werewolf. Seriously. By the franchise's end, metro-sexual vampires - quiet, emotional and totally hairless - have triumphed over animalistic wolf men who, apparently, have to make do with child erotica. Who writes this stuff? Stephenie Meyer, apparently. A devout Mormon, Meyer's entire franchise plays out like a Mormon's guide to abstinence and 18th century domesticity. Women are frail, tend to traditional roles, family homes resemble isolated cult covens, sex before marriage (and vampire baby abortions) is really really bad and all men are kinky dudes who exist only to rip off their shirts and direct their barely controlled, lust-filled crotches at oh-so-innocent maids who want to get down and dirty, but only in the name of God, love, destiny and arranged marriage. A giant girl's fantasy, Meyer's entire franchise is about chaste, pubescent gals fretting about losing their virginity. Such romanticised abstinence is typical of teen fiction, but 'Twilight' then veers into new territory: it is men who become guardians of virginity and female 'purity'. Whilst both Meyer's boys and girls 'boil' and 'spontaneously combust' with roiling passion, it's ultimately guys who prevent sexual lust from turning into actual penetration. 'I don't want to hurt you,' sexy vampire Edward Cullen murmurs, fearful of leaving bruises on the porcelain white Bella. For Meyer, sex is dangerous, hurts, is wild, a fact which the innocent Bella doesn't know. And so Meyer has her male characters make it their priority to 'make things safe' before copulation can begin (and even then, sex promptly leads to Bella dying). In the world of Twilight, physical safety becomes a substitute for virginity which man, gallant, protects with zeal. It's the ultimate female fantasy: to be so smoking you bring all the hormonal boys to the yard, at which point you pick the one who most gallantly resists lurching at your bodice. For Bella, love and lust aren't enough. You must love her enough not to touch her...and then touch her so hard you kill her with manly prowess. Chastity and hedonism, all in one.

Invictus," Cool Runnings 2: Mandela Strikes Back
","Clint Eastwood rapes history with 'Invictus', a film which tells the story of newly elected South African President Nelson Mandela's attempts to use the 1995 Rugby World Cup to bring whites and blacks together in the wake of almost half a century of apartheid. Using a conventional fairy tale 'sporting movie' narrative, the film watches as the underdog SA rugby team beats opponent after opponent before finding themselves in the World Cup final against New Zealand. As the final game is played, blacks and whites join hands and watch with shared anticipation. By the time the final game is won, racial and economic divisions have dissolved before our eyes, SA brought to racial harmony via the decimation of foreigners on a playing field by Gladiator-like thugs. The film's message: colonialism deserves forgiveness and dismissal, never justice, 50 years of racial segregation, persecution and murder have be healed through 'sports' and 'democracy', and Mandela was a kindly old man who brought unity to a country. This, of course, is nonsense. Firstly, the film omits the embarrassing fact that the New Zealand team was poisoned, a fact which Mandela's former head of security, Rory Steyn, has recently publicly admitted. How much is victory worth when one hires an Eastern gambling syndicate to knock out one's opponent? Secondly, their is little to no racial harmony in SA. Mandela, upon release from prison, was unwittingly used as a puppet. He became the 'noble' face of new capitalism, yet another anti-authoritarian critic of old dictatorships who transformed into a 1980s-90s neoliberal ruler (Alfonsin (Argentina), Aquino (Philippines), Aristide (Haiti), Bhutto (Pakistan), Chiluba (Zambia), Dae Jung (South Korea), Havel (Czech Republic), Manley (Jamaica), Megawati (Indonesia), Mugabe (Zimbabwe), Museveni (Uganda), Nujoma (Namibia), Obasanjo (Nigeria), Ortega (Nicaragua), Rawlings (Ghana), Walesa (Poland), Yeltsin (Russia) etc). Under him, racial apartheid became class apartheid, SA sold off to foreign or local white multinationals, who kept the best land, mines, plants, financial institutions, who were pardoned for various crimes and were allowed to export vast quantities of capital. Such intra-elite economic deals, including the agreement to pay ridiculous debts accrued by the apartheid regime, worsened poverty, unemployment, inequality and exacerbated many racial, gender and geographical differences. SA is now the most violent country outside a war zone, with the highest recorded per capita murder rate in the world. So violent is the 'free' and 'democratic' South Africa, that the ANC – the African National Congress – imposed an official blackout on national crime statistics. Even when statistics are released, they are heavily doctored.With this instability, comes a flight of 'white locals'. Since 1994, more than a million whites and foreigners have left SA, mostly due to an increase in crime and social instability. The author of the book upon which 'Invictus' was based himself emigrated after being the victim of several crimes. Meanwhile, a subgroup of fat-cats - both white and black - blossoms, slowly pillaging the country, through both design and ineptitude. In other words, the film completely ignores apartheid's continued, and deep-rooted, effects on the self-determination of modern SA. There is no 'unity' or 'harmony'. There is no 'rainbow nation'. Apartheid level racial income inequalities still persist, whites are persecuted and blacks triply so, many dying at the hands of thugs paid to oversee black workers. Mandela would himself do a complete about turn on his 1990 pre-Presidence promise to nationalise resources, banks and monopoly industries. He went from a man whom Britain (MI5) and America (CIA) routinely tried to assassinate and eventually jailed, to a Western mascot. His wife would denounce him for betraying SA's blacks, allowing himself to be used by those in power to legitimise their post-apartheid manoeuvres.Bizarrely, 'Invictus' completely airbrushes white violence, but never black violence, which is always presented as a possibility and a threat. Likewise, racism and colonialism, for the whites, is never treated as being anything more than a lapse of judgement or unfortunate error. Elsewhere the film completely ignores one of the primary problems preventing 'unity' in SA today. How does one apply the principle of Government of the People, by the People, for the People, if 'The People' are divided (most of these divisions were specifically manufactured in the past for reasons of control), culturally, ethnically, linguistically, historically, economically and materially? The ANC's answer, like this film and the apartheid government before it, is to divide the country into a nation of blacks and whites, Us against Thems, Haves and Have Nots etc in order to further polarise the country's population along racial line for the purposes of engendering further political support.Eastwood portrays Mandela giving SA's rugby captain a poem by William Henley called 'Invictus'. In reality, the literature Mandela gave was 'The Man In The Arena', the title of a speech given by Teddy Roosevelt in Paris on April 23rd, 1910. Both pieces of writing are about self mastery, but with a very subtle difference, 'Invictus' being a work of unabashed optimism ('I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul.'), Roosevelt's being more downbeat: 'there is only error and shortcoming' and yet 'the credit belongs to the man who struggles in the arena for a worthy cause'. The film's switch from Roosevelt to Henley epitomises its preference for fantasy and blind-eye turning.The film stars actor Morgan Freeman as Nelson Mandela. It's a hagiographical portrait, Freeman portraying Mandela as a kindly old man who spews Yoda-like wisdom. The film also contains no references to the more militant backgrounds of Mandella, largely because white, middle class audiences are left confused and horrified by revolutionary violence. The point is not that Mandela was not a great man, but that 'Invictus' ignores why he was great, distorts why he wasn't into something 'great', and has very little bearing on reality. It is the Walt Disney version of history, shallow and dishonest. 4/10 – Worth one viewing.",Null,0,3,31 January 2011
Mission: Impossible," Exploding Bubblegum
","'Fashions fade, style is eternal.' - Yves Laurent Filled with super-slick visuals and impeccable compositions, this big-budget thriller looks better with each passing year. While the 90's action movies of Cameron, Spielberg, Donner, Harlin, the Wachowskis and the Scotts have started to lose their shine, De Palma's exercise in mainstream mayhem ages like fine wine (or maybe just good grape juice).It's all about style, of course. Gloriously wide compositions, extreme close ups, canted angles, split-diopters, whip-pans, point of view shots and four slick set pieces...watching this film is like attending a masterclass in camera movement.De Palma's not just good with surfaces, he's obsessed with them. Villains are dressed in 1950's PI/spy coats, the heist scenes outdo Dassin's 'Riffi' and Melville's 'Bob The Gambler', the film is shot in luxurious black and whites and all the while De Palma's camera glides from one perfect composition to the next. To get this kind of fluid camera work, this seamlessness, you'd have to turn to Pixar and their virtual cameras.Of course, the irony is that for a director so obsessed with achieving perfect images, De Palma is constantly reminding us how fallible images are. All his tics and themes are here, albeit in a condensed fashion: truth needing to be reassembled, the unreliability of the image, the camera that lies, voyeurs (the first shot is a close up of a digital screen), conspiracies, false identities, doppelgangers, the need to reconstruct the film's opening murder etc.The only thing missing are some operatic sex scenes, which were actually filmed but deleted when producer Tom Cruise, not wanting to chase away the teen audience, had all romantic scenes with super-lush French actress Emmanuelle Béart removed.Author James Ellroy (sometimes he feels like the only other person on the planet who actually loves De Palma's 'Black Dahlia') perfectly describes De Palma's style when commenting on the director's adaptation of his novel: 'De Palma's films circumscribe worlds of obsession. They are rigorously and suffocatingly formed. No outer world exists during their time frame. Colors flare oddly. Movement arrests you. You forfeit control and see only what he wants you to see. He manipulates you in the sole name of passion. He understands relinquishment. The film-goer needs to succumb. His films are authoritative. He controls response firmly. His hold tightens as his stories veer into chaos. He stands and falls, coheres and decoheres, succeeds and errs behind passion. He was the ideal artist to film The Black Dahlia.' Later he says: 'Bucky Bleichert is a fictional cop and a doppelganger/writer-filmmaker. He's the man writing out the great adventure of his life and the voyeur viewing sex with a camera. Bleichert is me. Bleichert is De Palma. He's standing outside momentous events. He's lost in scrutiny. He wants to control. He wants to capitulate. His inner life is near chaotic. He needs to impose external order to countermand his mental state. It's Homicide Investigation as Art. He needs to take malignancy and render it something his own.' And then: 'The Black Dahlia spins off the axis of De Palma and Hartnett. It's a three-mode constellation: thriller/noir/historical romance. The design is near-German Expressionist. It's L.A./it's not L.A./it's L.A. seen by Dahlia fiends in extremis. The film commands you to savour every scene and revel in your visual entrapment. This textual richness symbolises the Dahlia's hold on us. We can never look away. She won't let us.' 8/10 – While 'Casualties of War's' camera shifted stance with each vertical plane (underground, plateau, hill, bridge), here De Palma's camera changes stance when we jump from Prague to London to the Channel Crossing that links them. Complaints about silly plots and actors are valid but inconsequential. This is about De Palma's camera, Tom Cruise a prop that need only turn up and look appropriately intense.Worth three viewings.",Null,20,22,27 February 2010

Packed to the brim with allusions to Spielberg's films and personal life, the film revolves around a kid called Joe whose attempts to film a low budget movie are thwarted when a military train derails and releases a marauding alien into his sleepy, Ohio town.The film plays like a Spielberg show-reel. Its plot, iconography and setting recall 'Close Encounters' and 'ET', several of its action sequences recall 'War of the Worlds' and Spielberg's 'Jurassic Park' movies, its quiet suburbias and rural landscapes recall everything from 'Poltergeist' to 'Encounters' and its gang of little rascals allude to both Spielberg's youth as a kid-director and the junior adventurers of 'Goonies' and 'ET'. Then there's the film's giant train-crash set piece, a nod to Spielberg's love for the train wreck in 1952's 'The Greatest Show on Earth', a set piece which he'd himself recreate as a kid in his very first amateur movie.While Abrams also mimics Spielberg's cinematography, camera work and orchestrals, what links his film strongest to Spielberg's filmography is its central plot. Here, Joe's mother's death (and his distance from his father) echoes the real-life divorce of Spielberg's parents, a psychic scar which casts ripples on virtually all of Spielberg's pictures, with their absent fathers, separation anxieties and aching longings for daddies to 'phone home' and mommies to 'be good'. 'Phoning home' is also what Abram's alien hopes to do, the creature's plight echoing young Joe's, both alien monster and Ohio boy yearning to bury past scars, 'let go' and 'grow up'. The film's only moment which works occurs during its climax, in which little Joe lets go of a locket which contains a photograph of his mom. The metaphor is heavy-handed – he LITERALLY LETS HER GO – but the sweep of the scene works very well.What doesn't work is the rest of the film. Abrams can't frame a scene, move a camera, has no gift for action sequences, his script is obvious, his alien looks silly, his CGI is terrible, his kids swear too much, his plot is derivative, he overloads on Spielbergian camera work, his script is unsurprising and the film as a whole feels like a billion dollar fanboy movie. What's worse, the whole film is about moving forward and letting go of the past, and yet is supremely backward-looking, like a nostalgic necrophiliac preoccupied with unearthing and licking Spielberg's corpses.Interestingly, the film is set in 1979, literally between Spielberg's 'Encounters' and 'ET'. Those two films were themselves infused with a nostalgia for 1950s scifi B movies ('Invaders From Mars', 'The Day The Earth Stood Still', 'It Came From Outter Space', 'War of the Worlds', 'Them', 'The Thing', 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' 'Earth vs the Flying Saucers'), with their alien invasions, military jeeps, suburban/rural paranoia and little kid heroes. Spielberg's films were themselves packed with moments cribbed from these classics ('Jaws' literally uses the same score and scenes from 'Creature from the Black Lagoon'), but because only he and Lucas were repackaging these films in his era, they felt fresh. Today almost all Blockbusters borrow from the Spielberg model (ie are B movies or exploitation films with mega A movie budgets), so what's the point making a 'Super 8'? 6/10 – Worth one viewing.

Sinister," Don't worry, daddy. I'll make you famous again.
","'Sinister' stars Ethan Hawke as Ellison Oswalt, a writer who moves his wife and children into the home of a murdered family. Whilst investigating the aforementioned deaths, Oswalt discovers a box of home-movies. These movies detail the deaths of countless other families. Has Oswalt stumbled upon the work of a serial killer? Is this the work of a ritualistic cult? Is it something infinitely worse? Directed by Scott Derrickson, 'Sinister' works best as a straight-forward drama. But the film's interesting serial killer mystery, its riveting domestic feuds, and its 'The Shining' inspired take on an egotistical novelist's insecurities, are quickly abandoned.

Up," Bring Back Brad Bird
","The Walt Disney company released a series of somewhat 'groundbreaking' animated films between 1937 and 1942 ('Snow White', 'Pinocchio', 'Bambi', 'Dumbo' etc). Thereafter it degenerated into a purveyor of a formulaic, predictable and increasingly saccharine features. Over the decades it became nothing less than a cultural force, plucking stories from countries all over the world and then skewing them until they fit the 'Disney formula'. Eventually Disney seemed to have stopped making animated films altogether. Each new release was simply an addition to some already existent, homogeneous, 'Disney Land'. This is a land of fairy tales, princes and princesses, wicked stepmothers, dead parents, song and dance numbers, bumbling sidekicks, lots of anthropomorphic charm, the ubiquitous fear of separation and punishment, and some pretty despicable values relating to gender, monarchs and class. Eventually it got to the point where it didn't matter what Disney's films were about. All that mattered were that they conformed to the rules of 'Disney Land'. The stories, the characters, the customer expectations, the brand awareness, all coalesced to form a kind of bland corporate mission statement.Gradually the company began to shamelessly use its commitment to 'wholesome' entertainment to market an endless array of toys, gadgets and clothes to children. It all seemed quite innocuous, but beneath Disney's self-proclaimed role as an icon of culture, lies a powerful educational apparatus that provides ideologically loaded fantasies for children and adults alike. Fantasy, for Disney, has no basis in reality, no sense of real conflicts, struggles, motivations or social relations. Instead, 'fantasy' becomes a marketing device, a form of hype rooted solely in the logic of self-interest and buying. In the early 1990s, Disney received praise for films like 'The Lion King' and 'Beauty and The Beast'. The studio had re-found its form, some said. By the time Pixar Studios had established itself as a brand in the late 90s, however, Disney had once again lost its cool factor. Burnt by poor box-office returns, the company started making sequels to its more popular animations and began releasing them solely on DVD or TV. Much later they'd begin gobbling up outside mega-franchises (Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars etc).Pixar's evolution very much mirrors Disney's. After a string of somewhat revolutionary films, and Brad Bird's two fairly personal features, Pixar has begun a slow spiral into mediocrity, 'Cars', 'WALL-E' and 'Up' representing the company on a downward slope.'Up' is about an elderly man and young boy who travel to South America and have a series of adventures. It's a consistently funny film, but virtually every character here is contrived and understood entirely in one dimensional terms. An old man lost his wife, a wife lost her child, a young boy lost his father, a talking dog is bullied by other dogs, a giant bird is separated from its offspring...every single character seems cynically designed or calibrated to quickly illicit unearned sentiment. Pixar's last film, 'WALL-E', was no different, death (there are about 4 death scenes in that film), loneliness and loss rolled out like Pavlovian commands. See, 'WALL-E' is dead, why not shed a tear? See, the old man lost his wife, why not weep? Of course Pixar's films have always been sentimental, but they were sentimental in subtler or original ways. Think the smile which ends 'Monster's Inc', the food critic's flashback at the end of 'Rattatoille' or the brief shot of unhatched eggs in 'Finding Nemo'.Ignoring Pixar's emotional regression, its plots have also become increasingly generic. 'Up' in particular feels like a cocktail of bits and pieces plucked from 'Ice Age 3', 'The House of Small Cubes', 'The Red Balloon', 'Fitzcarraldo', 'King Kong' etc. For a film which features an airship called 'The Spirit of Adventure', the film is strangely cowardly, content to trade in stock characters and lazy chase scenes. Elsewhere the film champions adventure with one hand whilst exalting the return to Norman Rockwellesque normalcy; everyday life, we learn, is adventure enough. And those who go off on mighty exhibitions go insane anyway. This is very much the Pixar formula. Pixar's characters live in a small world, discover a bigger world outside of their familiar surroundings, and then retreat quickly back to the box. Beyond all this, 'Up' is Pixar's attempt to outright mimic Hayao Miyazaki (the director of 'Up' directed the English voice dubs of Miyazaki's 'Howl's Moving Castle', another film with old people in a moving house). Pixar/Disney chief John Lasseter has often cited Miyazaki as a key influence on Pixar, but Miyazaki's films have a subtlety and sense of auteurism that these latest Pixar offerings lack. Observe, for example, the gorgeous flying scenes in 'Kiki's Delivery Service', 'Nausica', 'Castle In the Sky' and 'Porcco Rosso'. In comparison, the 'flying' scenes in 'Up' are strangely inert. While previous Pixar films have exploited space to great effect, 'Up' is awash with flat compositions and ordinary camera work.Still, the film has some good moments, most of them occurring in 'Up's' first half. Here we're treated to several clever visuals, jokes and powerful montages, some of which seem cribbed from Kunio Kato's 'The House of Small Cubes' and Michael Apted's 'Up', the latter a noteworthy documentary series which chronicles the lives of several human beings, from cradle to grave. It's all very sad.7.9/10 - Worth one viewing. See 'From Up on Poppy Hill', 'The Girl who Leapt through Time' and 'The King of Pigs'.",Null,16,32,7 November 2009
The Hurricane," Love's gonna bust me out
","'Everybody knows the fight was fixed, the poor stay poor, the rich get rich. That's how it goes. Everybody knows.' - Leonard CohenNorman Jewison's 'The Hurricane' stars Denzel Washington as Ruben 'Hurricane' Carter, a middleweight boxing champ charged with triple murder. An all-white jury sentences Carter to life in prison. The film's second half watches as a group of Canadian activists struggle to get Carter released. The evidence used to indict him was manufactured, they claim, the African American Carter the target of racial persecution. 'The Hurricane' is cartoonish and simplistic, but boasts another infectious performance by Washington. The immaculately chiselled Deborah Kara Unger is also fine in a small role. The film was based on a real life incident, and its screenplay adapted from two books, one of which was Carter's own memoir. Over the decades, Carter's case would become a cause celebre; Muhammed Ali, Ellen Burstyn, Bob Dylan and a number of other figureheads would tout his innocence. Many believe the opposite. Regardless, law and legal systems have always been inherently racist and classist. To this date, studies estimate between five to ten thousand wrongful convictions in the US per year.

A Clockwork Orange," Yarbles! Great bolshy yarblockos to you!
","'The creative person is both more primitive and more cultivated, more destructive, a lot madder and a lot saner, than the average man.' – Frank Barron.'Repressive desublimation' was the term German philosopher Herbert Marcuse employed to describe the process whereby people unwittingly give over their liberties to tyrants in favour of material or sensual satisfactions. At first glance the term seems oxymoronic. Why? Because in Freudian psychology, 'sublimation' refers to the process whereby a natural human drive (eg sex) is transferred or 'sublimated' into a more socially acceptable form (eg film or music). 'Desublimation', however, posits the reverse. Here the subject's allowed unrestricted, direct access to their desires (eg porn, rape).By attaching the seemingly contradictory modifier of 'repressive', Marcuse thus challenges common sense to come to terms with the potentially repressive effects of desublimation. In other words, when the gratification of immediate material and sensual needs becomes the prevailing concern of men, then the ideals of freedom or even democracy have no chance.Marcuse's analysis of this problem is of course relevant to our own political culture today, in which policy decisions are increasingly founded upon an economic logic rather than that of freedom or the preservation of liberty. But this was the case even 50 years ago, when Marcuse travelled to the US, then the wealthiest, supposedly the most 'open' society in the world, and tried to warn people about what he called the 'encroaching totalitarianism of the capitalist Establishment' - the very regime under which the US had achieved its enviable position in the world. Marcuse believed that postmodern capitalism had 'internalised' Marxism (at least in its Stalinist deformation) and would increasingly resemble a perverse hybrid of Soviet-style totalitarianism and US-style consumerism. In this world, commodities, art and objects are not just a means of distraction, but the 'Ideology' itself.Of course no one took Marcuse seriously, but he expected this. 'Where is the repression in a society in which copies of the works of Plato, Hegel, Marx and Freud are available in the drugstore for anyone who cares to read them?' Marcuse asks in his book, 'One-Dimensional Man'. In other words, given that the resources of principled rational opposition are everywhere available, must one not presume that the absence of such opposition is indicative of the absence of any reason to question or oppose the status quo, even indeed of the actuality of freedom in the West? Marcuse's answer is that one must not so presume; to do so would be to confuse happiness with freedom, contentment with emancipation. The logic of repressive desublimation was then supposed to be Marcuse's critical response to this presumption. By allowing – even encouraging - certain forms of desublimation (freedom), Marcuse argues, systems actually distract attention from their oppressive and authoritarian character. On a more subtle and dangerous level, the availability of 'Plato in the drugstore' actually works to undermine the possibility of taking a critical stand against the repressive aspects of the society, firstly, because one simply becomes too comfortable to rock the boat, the logic of one's wallet overcoming one's rational judgement, and secondly, because the very availability of Plato in the drugstore operates as a vehicle for the retrenchment of the Establishment. Not only because the Establishment can say to its critics, 'You are free; could you get Plato in the drugstore elsewhere?', but more subtly and perversely, because in the mind of the subject, the fact of his immediate contentment precludes the possibility of taking Plato seriously.And this is what Marcuse means by his 'Clockwork' sounding 'One-Dimensional Society'. Any society that has not reached a state of perfection - and no society has - must necessarily be at least a 'two dimensional' society - a society in which the status quo and the ideal stand in conflict with each other. It is that conflict which generates change for the better. But in this clockwork society of ours, that second dimension – the utopian dimension - is increasingly vanishing.Art and philosophy (ie 'high culture') have traditionally been the guardians of this second, utopian dimension. In art, desire for utopia is sublimated into representations of utopia – either 'positively' (Bach, Mozart, Hegel), as more or less direct expressions of perfection or beauty, or 'negatively' (Brecht, Swift, Kubrick, Marx), as representations of the distance or difference or dissonance between the way things are and the way they ought to be.Today the 'aim' of 'philosophy' is not the sublimation of the utopian desire, but rather its desublimation - not art, but action; not philosophy, but revolution. But apart from the effective existence of this second dimension of thought, there is no basis in consciousness for a critical stand toward society, and therefore no basis for practical action. That is the problem of the one-dimensional or clockwork society. And you see that in this film: in Alex's postmodern world of rampant commodification, in which art and objects are now thoroughly impotent, Alex believes the only to be truly free is to transcend into ultra violence; freedom is equated with a specific creativity, a destructive re-energising of objects, performance and art. Or to quote Albert Camus: 'The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion'.And this is the dark irony of Marcuse's analysis of repressive desublimation. Today desublimation (rampant, unrestricted desires) is the norm and is indeed the practical result of our economic order; capitalism is devoted to the creation of desire (and the illusion of satiation). We might expect that this would be just what is wanted. But, as Marcuse shows, not all forms of desublimation are emancipatory. Some preclude the possibility of emancipation in subtle ways.10/10 – Worth multiple viewings.",Null,3,6,6 May 2010
Where Eagles Dare," The Clint Eastwood guide casually killing Nazis
","Director Brian Hutton was responsible for two classic action movies, 'Where Eagles Dare', released in 1968, and 'Kelly's Heroes', released in 1970. Both were old fashioned adventure movies, both were set in WW2, both filtered a past conflict through a Vietnam Era prism and both were packed to the brim with wild chases, humour, tension and lots of beautiful scenery.'Kelly's Heroes' was originally intended as an anti-war satire, but was severely reedited by studios until it resembled a more straightforward action movie. Made the same year as 'MASH' (which also featured Donald Sutherland as a hippie), Eastwood and Hutton envisioned the film as an anarchic satire, Vietnam era anti establishment spread thickly across the more prim and proper battlefields of World War 2.'Heroes'' final cut retains some of this irreverence, but most of its playful cynicism now resides solely in Oddball (played by Donald Sutherland), a tank driving hippie who spouts such lines as 'Why don't you knock it off with them negative waves, baby?' and 'Why don't you say something righteous and hopeful for a change?'. He's a fun character (and a nice contrast to Eastwood's stoic persona), who helps imbue Hutton's film with some 'flower power' playfulness. Yet despite its goofy plot (our heroes fight their way across France in an attempt to rob a German bank) and marijuana fuelled soundtrack, Hutton also bathes his film in lots of detail. A siege on a town plays out like the end of 'Saving Private Ryan', and several skirmishes are filled with tension. 'Kelly's Heroes' may be a counterculture comedy, but it nevertheless works tremendously well as a conventional war movie.Arguably better than 'Kelly's Heroes' - though perhaps less interesting - is 'Where Eagles Dare', an epic adventure movie based on an Alistair Mclean's novel. Filmed in Austria, the film looks great, filled with snow capped mountains, perilous cable carts, a cool German castle and even a babe called Heidi. Hutton's direction would prove hugely influential, many of his scenes lifted by Tarantino and George Lucas, and several of his sequences re-staged as levels in modern video games.Of course the film will seem a bit dated to modern audiences weened on fast edits, taunt action and CGI. Hutton's rear projection work in particular now stands out like a sore thumb. But Clint Eastwood is always cool, and those who like casual violence will find several scenes in which Clint mows down stairwells full of Germans to be shockingly laid back. Clint isn't just unphased when dishing out violence, he's positively relaxed.The 1960s and early 1970s saw a number of 'boys own' adventure movies being released ('Dirty Dozen', 'Guns of Navarone', 'The Great Escape' etc). Films like these used war, not to express any moral or patriotic sentiment, but as vehicles for action, aimed primarily at the young 'modern' audiences of the Vietnam era. These films may have done nothing but dished out casual violence and reduced WW2 to a series of heroic adventures, (Huston did this stuff right with 'The Man Who Would Be King'), but nevertheless surpassed the next wave (Indiana Jones, Star Wars etc) of similar flicks because they, arguably, retained a certain adult sensibility. A sensibility that would be completely eroded come the 1980s.8/10 - See Pontecorvo's 'Burn!'.",Null,7,9,13 August 2010
The Fly," A Brief History of Cronenberg
","In the late 60s, Canadian director David Cronenberg directed 'Stereo' and 'Crimes of the Future'. 'Stereo' took place in the hilariously named Academy of Erotic Enquiry whilst 'Crimes' took place in a dermatological clinic called The House of Skin. Both films simply consist of scientists observing groups of patients, Cronenberg's camera examining the effects of various experiments on human flesh. In 'Stereo', we watch as scientists create a race of super-humans who bond together in polymorphous sexual relationships. In 'Crimes', we watch as a plague caused by beauty products wipes out all sexually reproductive women. In an evolutionary response to their now defeminized world, some men grow reproductive organs outside their bodies, while others become paedophiles who prey on little girls.An obsession with youth, the sexualization of kids, the castration of modern man, the temporality of the flesh, the quest for beauty killing the sexually mature...are all pretty heavy themes for such a young film-maker.Understanding that his interests were far too esoteric for mainstream cinema, Cronenberg set out to make several low budget horror films. 'Shivers' and 'Rabid' are essentially about a mutant penis (Shivers) and vagina (Rabid) assaulting citizens and converting them into carnal beings. 'Shivers', which takes place in a giant building called 'The Starline Hotel', was seen by screenwriter Dan Obannon (a fellow Canadian) and would prove a huge influence on Ridley Scott's 'Alien'.Cronenberg then filmed 'Brood', a nice little horror flick which centres around a divorced couple. Here, scientists encourage man to manifest his emotions as physical symptoms. One patient develops lymphatic cancer as a manifestation of his self-hatred while another gives birth to mutated children who act our her violent emotions. Whatever the flaws of these pictures, they all contain a couple genuinely spooky scenes and a strong, singular vision.Cronenberg followed 'Brood' up with 'Scanners', a hastily written and filmed flick about an underground war between a cult of telepaths and the clinic which created them. With its shotgun battles, trench coats, night scenes and fast pace, the film plays like a schlocky version of James Cameron's (another Canadian) 'Terminator'.This is where the 'first phase' of Cronenberg's filmography ends. Up until this point all his films centred around subjects at the mercy of scientific experiments. As a result, they're all cold and impersonal films told from the perspective of the virus/contagion. Cronenberg's next six flicks, however, focus on the subject's personal struggles with their own self inflicted 'diseases'. And so we have 'Videodrome', 'The Dead Zone', 'The Fly', 'Dead Ringers', 'Naked Lunch' and 'M Butterfly', all character studies which empathise with the victim (or infected host) and introduce a sense of humanity previously unseen in Cronenberg's filmography.'Videodrome', the precursor to 'Existenz', is about the president of a sleazy television company who stumbles across a pirate TV station which broadcasts a zero-budget torture program (today the pirate footage now resembles Abu Ghraib). What follows is one of Cronenberg's greatest films, 'Videodrome' dealing with the escalation of plot-less sex and violence, a world in which the boundaries between reality and fantasy bleed, a provoking satire on media censorship and a Marshall McLuhan influenced merger between flesh and technology (media as bodily extensions, and the notion of discarnate man and virtual identities).After 'Videodrome' failed, cash-wise, Cronenberg sold out with 'The Dead Zone' and 'The Fly', two mainstream pictures which raked it quite a lot of cash. 'The Dead Zone' is a fairly shallow look at the life of a psychic man, whilst 'The Fly', despite a cute romantic tale at its core, is simply an excuse for Cronenberg to catalogue the disintegration of human flesh (and a Cartesian mind/body war in which the flesh wins).Then came one of Cronenberg's most assured flicks, a little seen masterpiece called 'Dead Ringers'. Beautifully shot by Peter Suschitzky (cinematographer on 'Empire Strikes Back'), 'Dead Ringers' centres on a pair of twin gynaecologists, one of whom falls in love with a woman who has a mutation which results in her having 3 vaginal openings. The film treats the twins as a single organism and the woman as a mutation which must be excised. She is rejected by the dominant twin's immune system, but is accepted by the weaker. This twin develops such a hunger for the mutation that he spirals into addiction when she is removed, resulting in the other twin having to develop special gynaecological tools to symbolically sever their connection. It's a weird but genuinely moving picture.Cronenberg then made 'Naked Lunch', a film about the hallucinogenic mind-space of author William Burroughs. Aesthetically the film is a failure, Lynch, 'A Scanner Darkly' and 'Fear and Loathing' covering similar psychedelic ground in a much more confident manner. 'M Butterfly', Cronenberg's next film, was equally muddled, allegorizing Imperial conquest as the domination and gender transformation of women.Cronenberg then entered his third and most confident phase, his pictures becoming icy cool and tightly structured. And so we have 'Crash', less a film about fetishes than the aggressive escalation of on screen sex and violence, the film's cast (who all play film-makers) engaging in accelerated acts of titillation, all hoping to bridge what desire's lack.Then came 'Spider', 'Existenz', 'History of Violence' and 'Eastern Promises', three masterful films which examined the elusive nature of reality, desire, depth-less simulations (West and East as genre/national simulation) and personal displacement (displacement from country, law, body and gender). These later films, grossly misunderstood, will be talked about in depth with later essays. Suffice to say, with his 'third phase', Cronenberg has learnt to masquerade Kubrickean levels of complexity within seemingly mainstream, genre pictures.6.9/10 – (M Butterfly, Dead Zone, Naked Lunch), 7/10 – (Rabid, Shivers), 7.9/10 – (The Fly, Scanners, The Brood), 8/10 – (Spider, Crash), 8.5 - (History of Violence, Dead Ringers), 8.9/10 – (Existenz, Videodrome), 9/10 - (Eastern Promises)",Null,1,2,3 September 2010
Groundhog Day," The Bill Murray guide to Buddhism
","Perhaps the closest thing to a modern Frank Capra movie, Harold Ramis' 'Groundhog Day' sees actor Bill Murray playing Phil Connors, an egocentric Pittsburgh TV weatherman who finds himself trapped in the small town of Punxsutawney, repeating the same day over and over again. Why Connors is forced to relive the same day isn't explained, but it is made clear that Connors was trapped in a cycle of repetition even before his never-ending day began. Projecting nothing but facile sarcasm, ironic self-awareness and aloof detachment, Connors is a thoroughly postmodern man, his life long filled with what he perceives to be pointless and mindless routine. But Connors is not a pessimist or self-centred, so much as he is super-aware, perpetually dejected and world-weary. For Connors, every day offers only what philosopher Francois Cusset called the 'dead end of postmodernity'. Enchantment is thoroughly dead and everything that will happen has already happened.When Connors wakes up to find that today is, and always will be, yesterday, he is forced into violently confronting the fact that postmodernism conceives of contemporary life as a spectacle before which the individual always sits powerless, and within which questions of the real are always problematized. To the postmodern subject, there is nowhere else, no other time or place, the subject a ghost-viewer in a movie that plays regardless of his volition.At first Connors uses this opportunity to engage in pranks, hedonism and deceit, concocting schemes to amass money and bed a beautiful woman, played by Andie McDowell, but gradually these games start to lose their appeal. After learning that all the material and sexual gratifications in the world are not spiritually sustaining, Connors grows suicidal. He takes his life several times, but still the curse continues. From here on the plot becomes a mixture of the myth of Sisyphus and Dickens' 'A Christmas Carol' (Bill Murray is essentially Ebenezer Scrooge), with a little Camus and Nietczhe thrown in. The film's existential avenues are best hinted at by a poem (The Lay of the Last Minstrel) by Sir Walter Scott, an excerpt of which Andie McDowell recites to Connors in a diner: 'Despite those titles, power, and pelf, The wretch, concentrated all in self, Living shall forfeit fair renown, And doubly dying, shall go down, To the vile dust from whence he sprung, Unwept, unhonoured, and unsung.'And so gradually Connors relinquishes the Self. Of course contemporary neuroscience has now thoroughly undermined the notion of a Sovereign Self, but director Harold Ramis is a Buddhist, and Buddhism has long denied the existence of a metaphysical self. Buddhist's call this 'Anatta', or 'not self', in which it is taught that all things perceived by the senses are not really 'I' or 'mine', and in which a line is drawn from the problem of personal identity to moral responsibility.A thoroughly changed man, Connors thus now begins to live each day to the fullest. No longer obsessed with 'moving on' or possessing Andie McDowell, he instead helps everyone, acts selflessly, without ego (paradoxically an egotistical, if not impossible act) and uses whatever spare time he has to engage in various artistic and intellectual refinements (piano, ice sculpting, poetry etc). To his co-workers, Connors now seems like a radically different person. He seems reborn. Unsurprisingly, at this moment of transformation, the temporal curse is broken and tomorrow finally comes, though Connors now refuses to move on and instead opts to stay in Punxsutawney.'Connors's transformation (which resembles the Buddhist Samsara cycle) goes against almost everything postmodernity teaches,' author Jonah Goldberg says. Connors doesn't find paradise or liberation by becoming more 'authentic' or 'individual', but by doing exactly the opposite. 'He learns to appreciate the crowd,' Goldberg says, 'the community, even the bourgeois hicks and their values[]and most of all by shedding his ironic detachment from the world.' Unsurprisingly radical economists view the film in different lights - man trapped in an sociocultural dead end unless he relinquishes greed, profit and egomania - but such readings are byproducts, rather than intended.The film is regarded as a family classic in the US, Canada and UK, and is routinely played around Christmas time, embraced by middle-class folk the same way Frank Capra's sentimental morality tales gradually became inextricable from the whole codified 'spirit of Christmas' and 'national image and values'. The film has a spiritual resonance, all denominations able to read what they wish into it, but its actor Bill Murray's trademark humour – aloof, sarcastic and detached – that really sells things. Audiences today don't buy the aww shucks performances of Capra's everyman (often Jimmy Stewart) heroes. Bill Murray's meta-detachment, however, they relate to in spades. 8.9/10 – While some may have liked a darker, creepier take on the story (Ramis and Murray had a falling out because the star wanted to take the story into darker territory - think about it, what would you get up to if there were no consequences to your actions?), 'Groundhog Day' is nevertheless a charming family film, and there aren't many of those.",Null,6,10,17 January 2011
Reservoir Dogs," Doctor, ain't there nothing' I can take?
","'Reservoir Dogs' ends with Harry Nilsson's 'Coconut' playing over the credits, a quirky song in which a woman 'puts the lime in the coconut and drinks 'em both up' before getting a bellyache and calling a doctor who tells her to 'put the lime in the coconut and drink 'em both up' which causes her to get a bellyache and call a doctor who tells her to 'put the lime in the coconut and drink 'em both up'.In other words, the 'cause' is the 'cure' is the 'cause' is the 'cure' is the 'cause'. But is the woman stupid for listening to the doctor or is the doctor wise in accelerating the problem until her sickness goes away (possibly because the idiot's bellyache eventually leads to death?).Regardless, Quinten Tarantino's 'Reservoir Dogs' finds a gang of foul mouthed low-lives trapped in a similar, inane loop. After a botched jewelry heist, a group of criminals gather in an abandoned warehouse where they try to ascertain who amongst them is an undercover cop. In other words, there's a poisonous lime in a group of coconut nut cases, and they're all busy trying to smoke him out.As arguments ensue, one of the gang members, whilst waiting on a doctor, begins to die slowly due to a bullet (ie belly ache) in the gut. Meanwhile, tensions escalate to such an extent that the men shoot one another to death. The wounded man with the bullet hole belly ache is then revealed to be the poisonous rat. Had the others let him die, they'd have been fine.So it's the 'lime in the coconut' scenario; uncovering the cause of the stomach ache equals finding the rat, finding the rat leads to stomach aches, stomach aches are cured by finding the rat, finding the rat leads to stomach aches...etc etc, until the patients all die. Cue the coconut song.Tarantino typically makes modern versions of 1970s exploitation films. But while 'Reservoir Dogs' has the seediness, cool posing, macho vulgarity and blood quota of 1970s exploitation cinema, its actual framework owes more to 1950s noir. In this regard it unfolds like a stage-play, is dialogue driven, possesses a bare aesthetic, sparse, stripped down sets, and ends with a fatalistic noir climax in which everyone dies.And while the film pulls from 70s blaxploitation, Hong Kong cool, Lam's 'City on Fire', Kubrick's 'The Killing', the original 'Oceans 11' (all those slow motion men in suit shots), and Peckinpah's blood operas, Tarantino's overall tone is much more playful. He's more akin to David Mamet, using freestyle dialogue to toy with conventions. What matters is not the content of the film, or even the characters, but the farcical playfulness of it all; the way it moves, skirts around expectations and then joyously self destructs. Today, with most artists now with an encyclopedic knowledge of cinema, such that they can, like Tarantino, spin entire tales out of bits and pieces in a matter of days, the challenge is to slow down and let go of the mix-tape. This kind of 'I can do this, but should I?' questioning is itself the core dilemma of Tarantino's 'Inglorious Basterds'.'Reservoir Dog's' bloodiness was deemed sensational back in the 90s, but that's largely because Hollywood's previous 15 years were dominated by a kind of sanitized, blockbuster violence ('Indiana Jones', 'Star Wars' etc). Many complain that the film relies too heavily on designer brutality, cool, gratuitous violence, and that its characters are simply pop culture chewing posers, but while that is true, the film is also unique in Tarantino's filmography ('Basterds' excluded) in that it actually plays like a warped morality tale. Shakespeare with guns, the film rejects any sanctimonious message, 'crime doesn't pay' or otherwise, and instead lets us eavesdrop on a bunch of psychopaths who, quite hypocritically, view themselves as professionals with ordinary jobs. Throughout the film our criminals thus view with scorn a psycho played by Michael Madsen. They're not like him, you see. They have ethics, codes, rules and professional courtesy. But when push comes to shove they nevertheless all degenerate into reservoir dogs, cruel, psychopathic and little more than petty hoodlums.Like most of Tarantino's films, 'Reservoir Dogs' is a film about film. Here the characters are all artifacts chewing on pop culture artifacts, except Tim Roth, who plays an undercover cop. While Keitel does a phony tough guy routine and Michael Madesen does a cheap Clint Eastwood, Tim Roth's the chameleon actor who infiltrates their school play and brings their curtain down. He even starts by killing their director.7.9/10 – Worth two viewings. See Mamet's films, some of which do this stuff better.",Null,5,7,14 April 2011
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," Hill of Beans
","'Burn down the London Theatre, burn down the big Empire.' - Roaring Lion ('Baboolala') Set in Ireland, England's oldest colony, Ken Loach's 'The Wind That Shakes the Barley' takes place during the decade following World War 1. One of Loach's more mainstream pictures, it won the Palme d'Or at Cannes.'Barley' opens in 1920, during a spirited hockey match. Two Irish teams are playing, both of whom are then 'assaulted' by the Blacks and Tans, the British paramilitary group tasked with 'maintaining law and order' within Ireland. This single incident sets up the trajectory of the entire film, which pits vying Irish factions against one another whilst a British enemy looks on.Loach then briskly sketches several big historical movements; Irish rebels are seen fighting for freedom from British rule. They succeed only in establishing the Irish Free State, a body which still falls under the dominion of the British Sovereignty. Dissatisfied with the conditions forced upon their 'free state', various Irish factions swiftly pop up. Some demand ratifications to the new English/Irish credos, whilst others opt not to prod the Empire, fearful of retaliation, rocking the boat or disrupting the status quo. These Irish factions spend much of the early and late 1920s fighting amongst themselves. Loach's film focuses on both these squabbles and the birth of the Irish Republican Army. His overall point, though, is that an independent, supposedly autonomous Ireland, is nothing without socialism. Independence leads but to increased nationalist ideology, and merely propagates capitalism's social relations. For Loach, an independent capitalist Ireland is not an independent Ireland at all, but one still held in bondage.The film revolves around two brothers, Teddy and Damien O'Donovan. Damien's you're typical Loachian working-class hero. Played by Cillian Murphy, he will not settle for the new treaties, wants some semblance of socialism, and refuses to have English bosses merely replaced by Irish bosses. Teddy, in contrast, is happy to settle for less. Damien abandons his brother and joins an Irish rebel faction which is then hunted by both the English and the new, quasi 'democratic' Ireland. Whilst Damien spends most of the film as your classic Loachian freedom fighter, he does not start out this way. It is his brother who is initially the radical. Damien, in contrast, is an intellectual type who only slowly comes to the conclusion that risking one's life for half measures is to risk one's life for nothing at all. He wants socialism or nothing, the mantra of many Marxists in the 1960s.Upon release, 'Barley' was destroyed by the right-wing, British press. Critics, who spend most of their time praising reactionary films, mauled it on political grounds. The film was likened to Nazi propaganda, the Times of London associated it with both Leni Riefenstahl and Hitler and various newspapers owned by Rupert Murdoch called it 'pro IRA', 'fascist' and 'poisonous', before admitting that they 'didn't see the film because one doesn't need to read Mein Kampf'. The question is not whether or not 'Barley' is fascist or not – it isn't – but why most widely praised art, and indeed most human beings, are not recognised as being either overtly or unconsciously fascist.'Barley' is often criticised for its portrayal of British forces as one dimensional brutalizers. It's a blunt, cartoonish portrayal, though the general caricature is somewhat correct. At the time, this thuggery extended all the way up to Lloyd George, the British Prime Minister. Using threats, bribes and lies he forced several treaty's upon Ireland, and promised 'immediate and terrible war' if the Irish didn't accept. As is often the case when Empire's propose to 'benevolently grant independence', the overall plan was to partition, destabilise, split nationalist forces and then wait for civil war.Upon release, Loach explicitly linked his film's tale of radicalism, occupation and warfare to the contemporary situation in Iraq. Bizarrely, Ireland, despite some public outcry, was fervently in support of the Iraq invasions; Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern would designate runways, troops and resources for these wars. Since the bogus Yugoslavian 'interventions', Ireland has itself become increasingly less 'neutral' and increasingly more a puppet of the EU, US and UK. Why has the country so quickly forgotten its own past? Capitalism has always ignored the injustices at its peripheries. Indeed, the bounties engendered by its peripheries are often precisely what support and placate the Empire's core. Or, to paraphrase Jacques Ranciere, 'Londoners didn't care about slavery because the colonies were made invisible and routinely shipped home sweet bacon'. The question is, when capitalism colonises everywhere, where does the periphery go?Despite being leftist agitprop, Loach's overall narrative arc is conventional. Hollywood loves films in which 'little guys' and 'rebels' go up against 'big guys' and 'Empires', though usually it finds ways to fudge things such that the 'big guy' - in the historical sense - is perceived as an underdog. Still, compared to pro-treaty Irish films like 'Michael Collins', Loach is right to oppose the limiting of Ireland's nationalist movements to the creation of a capitalist state. He is also right to turn the film into a dispute between classes and not nations. Unfortunately 'Barley' also possesses all of Loach's usual flaws. He can't quite capture the relationships between political and social tendencies in all their richness and complexities (neorealism is too limiting), and his reduction of class dynamics to 'workers' and 'landlords' is somewhat meaningless in a world in which tax money is symbiotically funnelled into the share portfolios of the very tax dodging companies which both bankrupt nations and provide amazing returns to the same. Questions of ownership are today far more complex, and society as a whole far more amorphous.8/10 - For better 'mainstream Loach', see 'Bread and Roses'.

How to Train Your Dragon," Up yours Up
","DreamWorks Animation responds to Pixar's 'Up' with 'How To Train Your Dragons'. The plot: in a mythical Viking kingdom, a young boy teaches his warmongering clan to put down their weapons and befriend dragons. To do this they must first....kill a giant dragon. It's one of many 'stop war, love nature' films currently in vogue, the Viking's, like various US administrations, utilizing a blend of fear, hate and tradition to justify much rape and pillaging. It is this way of life which our young hero hopes to change, but the film's last act dragon murder plays more like a case of 'we destroy you, we take your weapons, you forced into friendship' than a trans-species love affair. Now shut up and help me with this saddle.The film's plot strongly resembles 'Battle for Terra', another animated film which covers similar ground. Both are preferable to James Cameron's turgid 'Avatar'. They're light, funny and move fast. See Miyazaki for the inspiration of most eco-friendly animated films.As with most CGI or animated films, 'How to Train Your Dragon's' exhilarating moments are due largely to its free-wheeling, uninhibited, virtual camera work. The picture moves well, its virtual camera zipping along all axis, every minute detail and camera-move super precise. The levels of aesthetic control granted to the film-makers also allow 'Dragon's' virtual landscapes (and conceptual designs) to be super fine-tuned, resulting in a certain aesthetic rush. The film's silent moments are powerful and its flying sequences are subline, given even Miyazaki's air songs a run for his money. Unfortunately the film's plot is nothing but a string of clichés. It looks great, but it's a lightweight film.'How to Train Your Dragon's' score, by John Powell, has been praised, but again it can't touch either Korzeniowski's similar score for 'Battle of Terra' or Joe Hisaishi's scores for Miyazaki. But that's the DreamWork's motto: good enough is good enough.'How to Train Your Dragon's' film-makers (a committee, auteurism is largely dead) make one interesting choice: after the film's climax, our hero, a mere child, loses his leg. His leg is then replaced with a prosthetic limb. It's a shocking moment for an animated film; the horrible consequences of hate.Incidentally, 'How to Train Your Dragon' is part of a longstanding battle between Pixar and DreamWorks Pictures (founded by Spielberg, Katzenberg and Geffen in the mid 90s). With the surprise success of Pixar's 'Toy Story', DreamWorks set about discovering Pixar's next project. When their spies learnt of 'A Bugs Life', DreamWorks then rushed out the similarly themed 'Antz'.Next from Dreamworks came 'The Prince of Egypt' and 'The Road to El Dorado', two animated films designed to rip off Disney's 'Hercules' and 'Mulan'. Then came 'Sinbad', a knock off of Disney's 'Atlantis: The Lost Empire'.The battle continued with 'Shark Tale', Dreamworks' copy of 'Finding Nemo', 'Megamind' which copies 'The Increadibles', and 'Flushed Away', which mimics 'Ratatouille'. Meanwhile, DreamWorks' monster movie, 'Shrek', used a tale of monsters to poke fun at Disney, Pixar and Disney fairy tales, whilst Pixar's 'Monster's Inc' celebrates the portals, multidimensional windows and doorways of business magnate Steve Jobs' 'Apple Computers' (Jobs was chief executive of Pixar). No surprise then that the hero of 'How to Train Your Dragon' is called HiccUP, and that the film was the studio's response to Pixar's 'Up'. And so on and on it goes, corporate warfare and artistry dancing their intimate ballet.7.9/10 – Despite a somewhat clichéd plot, this is one of Dreamworks' best animations.

"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," The Sorrow and The Pity
","'The Law prohibits something that is perfectly fictitious in the order of desire or of the instincts, so as to persuade its subjects that they had the intention corresponding to this fiction' - Deleuze Pier Paolo Pasolini's 'Salo' takes the Marquis de Sade's 'The 120 Days of Sodom' and transposes it to Salo, the fascist Republic that Mussolini established in northern Italy. The film is divided into the canto-divisions of Dante's 'Inferno', a series of cycles which represent a slow, torturous descent into hell.Opening in 1944, the film watches as four dignitaries, who represent world aristocratic, ecclesiastical, judicial and economic powers, round up sixteen young men and women in a mansion near the village of Marzabotto. These 'detainees' are the 'resistance'; the sons and daughters of partisans, or partisans themselves. For 120 days they are subjected to physical and psychological abuse by the dignitaries, before being executed.The film's first canto consists of the detainees being made to sign a document, an act which echoes the formal ratification that established the Republic of Salo and marked the collaboration between Italian Fascists and Nazi Germany. The detainees are then paraded before a selection committee. Both an antechamber to hell and a slave market, they stand here as their naked bodies are examined. 'The reduction of a body to a thing through exploitation,' Pasolini says of the sequence, the prisoners commodified and paraded before a panel of 'Masters' who are desperately searching for 'ideal candidates'. The Masters (see Pasolini's 'Pigsty') are themselves caricatural figureheads: a duke, a bishop, a magistrate and a banker; all figures of power.The detainees are then indoctrinated into a system of 'new' rituals and laws. Links are made between slave, servant and worker relationships, before the film proceeds to the 'The Circle of Manias'. Here, in 'The Hall of Orgies', pornographic stories are told, which become increasingly explicit as the Masters' desires escalate. Desire then provokes will, the Masters acting out their power fantasies on their slaves. As the fantasies intensify - in an attempt to outpace desensitization - so does the sadism directed toward the slaves.Parallels are then drawn between orated fantasies and cinema; the masters tell stories to elicit the consent of the slaves, whilst Passolini aligns audience narcissism to that of the Masters. The mansion then reveals itself as a place where pleasure and reality principles clash, fantasy forever attempting to overcome reality. As the masters' desires are enforceable by law, their tyranny manifests itself as a psychosis whereby desire is erased and replaced with pure intention. This then leads to the final circle: The Circle Of Death. Here, threatened by an Allied invasion, the Masters spur themselves toward the peak of fulfilment, killing and sodomising in an attempt to block out the 'reality' outside their mansion. Their hope, the death drive writ large, is to be overwhelmed by desire and so transcend reality (the final section of Dante's poem is itself 'Paradise'). This morphs into an unconscious lust for death - the cathartic end point of all desire - a suicidal, self-destructive psychosis which is being simultaneously enacted throughout the culture in the form of war.Significantly, the Masters are always portrayed as being simultaneously 'out of control' and 'in control'. As everyone in the mansion can be either sodomite or sodomised, it is only 'speech' which grants one power; the slaves don't talk. Only the fascists speak, and only they have desires. The film's sex is itself totally masculinized, industrialised, and focuses on the anus, scatology, homosexual fetishes and masculine domination. Pasolini was himself homosexual, and his approach to filming sex is largely why the film remains disturbing for heterosexual audiences. While many supposedly 'shocking films' become titillative with time, Pasolini's refuses to be appropriated. Like 'Night Porter' and 'The Damned' (note, all directed by gays or women), Pasolini takes the fascist aesthetic, which is inherently obsessed with servitude/mastery/control/submission and an ego-maniacal glorification of death, and exposes its unconscious currents.'Artists must now create works so extreme that they become unacceptable to the New State,' Pasolini said, the 'new state' being late-capitalism, which found with 'Salo' a work which refused to be consumed. By unmasking both the false nature of contemporary 'tolerance' - true tolerance has no limits - and the purely economic reasons governing 'liberalization', Pasolini hoped to reveal how Power is disassociated from humanity, how it transforms all into objects, and the repressive and dehumanising nature of modern hedonism/consumerism.More importantly, the film sketches the disavowed psycho-sexual-destructive core of capitalist social-relations. The film's abuses are not just the Masters' attempts to protect and enact fantasies, but a marker of the malfunctioning of their desires and the increasing inadequacy of their powers of fantasising. Their desires depend on dominant representations of 'perversity' and pre-established symbolism (religious iconography, marriage rituals, infantile fecal obsessions etc) and they regard all else as 'non-desirers' or subhumans. It is a 'freedom' that has individualism rather than 'the social' at its core. As absolute desire escapes the bounds of social responsibility, ethics etc, Pasolini asks to what end this leads.While Pasolini's 'Canterbury Tales' and 'Arabian Nights' celebrated sexuality, 'Salo' warns against a non-reflective embracing of 'desire'. Unsurprisingly, the film's mansion – an asocial utopia – parallels the creation of both the Nazi State, and all civilisations which keep the primal in check while actively drawing upon the same to maintain the status quo. It is a utopia that can only function by rejecting the desire of the Other, by foregoing the social dimension of desire, by legislating for its own pleasure, by promising 'instinctual liberty' and non-reflexive self-centredness and by always demanding total, fearful obedience. Unsurprisingly, 'Salo' was banned and seized by Vice Squads. Thematically it resembles Kubrick's 'Eyes Wide Shut'. Pasolini was murdered shortly before the film's release. As with Kubrick ('Eyes' was also released after its director's passing), conspiracies surround Pasolini's death.9/10 - Nauseating.",Null,3,4,16 September 2011
Limitless," Just Keep Swimming
","'If I wasn't moving forward, I felt I was going to explode.' - Eddie Morra 'Capitalism too has to keep moving, keep expanding, or it dies. And because logarithmic growth is in its DNA, companies can only grow on the basis of ever-increasing levels of consumption.' - John Sanbonmatsu 'Limitless' sees Bradley Cooper playing Eddie Morra, a failed artist who stumbles upon a drug which essentially grants him super powers. How does Eddie use these powers? To make money, buy penthouses, play the stock-market, woo women, become mega-rich, famous and eventually the President of the United States. Though the film at times hints that Eddie will one day use his gifts for positive, socially beneficial aims, its overall message is an ode to superficiality and the powers that be.A cross between a comic-book superhero movie and Oliver Stone's 'Wall Street', 'Limitless' initially works well as a mindless power fantasy. The audience rides Eddie's highs, grinning as he's reborn a dapper speculist who beds babes and rakes in billions on Wall Street. But it's all bells, whistles and cheap gags. In the real world, when the Masters of the Universe dump cheap subsidised cotton on the world market, 20,000 destitute farmers are drinking pesticide in India days later. Like clockwork.If the film seems to get stupider and stupider as its hero gets smarter and smarter, it nevertheless unwittingly works as some kind of allegory for hedonistic capitalism. Our hero has the opportunity to do and be anything he can, but instead chooses to cater to his own basest desires, becoming greedier and greedier until his body starts to break down. But though the film rightly suggests that a life oriented towards a kind of pathological need for satisfaction comes at a corresponding price (jogging, dieting, stress, desensitisation, addiction, pain, preparatory activities etc), Eddie is himself never shown to suffer even a moment of regret, has absolutely no self doubt, and actually learns to fix his 'breaking down' body so that he may continue consuming with impunity. Eddie may be an ego-maniacal, power hungry narcissist, the film then says, but it's okay because nobody gets hurt and he intends to one day do good as the US President. End result: 'Limitless' PRETENDS to say that power/greed is ultimately an addiction/high that is destined to corrupt, but ultimately suggests something else: intellectual and personal greatness equals money/political power (and vice versa).Today we live in an era of unbridled capitalism. One which broadcasts the notion that personal, limitless hedonism is a legitimate, even the legitimate, goal of life. In the era of high mass consumption, this globalisation of desire is itself a prerequisite; excess must escalate or the system dies. Indeed, making desire and excess legitimate was perhaps the real revolution of the 1960s. As Tom Wolfe once remarked, the 60s released 'an affluence that would have made the Sun King blink'. But while consumer capitalism needs a hedonistic consumption ethic, it also needs a work ethic. The contradiction of today is thus: how to reprogramme the inheritors of this 'limitless ethic' so as to suppress certain desires/expectations - and to reestablish old bourgeois values of restraint - without killing the subject, the goose that lays consumer culture's golden eggs? Or, how to make the subject give up more, to give you more? This nosedives into what Freud, Marcuse and Lacan called the death drive (each reinterpreted the former's use of the term). For Freud, the death drive is literally a drive toward death and the inorganic. It exists in 'opposition to the pleasure principle' and enables us to posit a life that exists 'beyond the pleasure principle'. For Marcuse, however, who witnessed a burgeoning post war boom in consumerism and advertising, the pleasure principle is ITSELF the death drive, as the aim of an instinct is in every instance a satisfaction which can only be obtained by removing 'the state of stimulation'. Lacan would then expand this further: while the drive's 'goal' is satisfaction, its 'aim' is actually intermediate objects which stave off the ultimate object of enjoyment. In other words, the drive must not aim directly at satisfaction or else risk losing it altogether. So where Freud saw civilisation (and scarcity) as taming man's desires and baser cravings, Marcuse and Lacan recognised that civilisation does not eradicate the Eros/Thanatos dialectic (pleasure/pain), but recruits it for its own purposes. Scarcity then becomes the logic of domination.What Marcuse then began to document was the social shift away from an overwhelming presence of death, to a pervasive, limitless enjoyment. The subject was now mandated to consume/enjoy, no longer holding onto Puritanical ideals of abstinence and self-renunciation. Eros then becomes the psychic dominant of late capitalism. This society, Marcuse then wrote, is however predicated on the death, destruction, and domination of a great majority of people; the enjoyment that it propagates is always only available to a select few. For thinkers like Lacan, political struggle then became a fight predicated on Thanatos, the death drive, which became an ethical stance that must be accepted in order to disrupt the superego bond that keeps the individual at bay in the community.Note that the death drive as defined by Lacan no longer describes a literal death, as in Freud's case, but rather death within the Symbolic Order. After having rejected the Symbolic Order composed of language, conceptualisation, categorisation and The Law, the subject persists as a kind of 'living dead'. This obscene continuation of life, a mockery of the symbolic order itself, is nonetheless still within the symbolic order. But now the agent derives pleasure from pain: he or she has gone past the pleasure principle, and enjoys being rejected by the symbolic order. This is the opposite journey of 'Limitless': Eddie expands and expands and literally becomes The Law.7.5/10 – Low rent 'Fight Club'. Worth one viewing.",Null,5,7,17 February 2012
Eyes Wide Shut," Welcome to the Desert of the Real: Part 4
","'I know I would like to make a contemporary story that finally gave a feeling of the times, psychologically, sexually, politically and personally. I would like to make this more than anything else, and it's probably going to be the hardest film to make.' - Stanley Kubrick Far from being the 'hermetic' and 'old fashioned' film critics labelled it, 'Eyes Wide Shut' is part of a burst of similar films released between 1998 and 2001. These films - which include 'The Matrix', 'Vanilla Sky', 'Eyes Wide Shut', 'Dark City', 'ExistenZ', 'Mulholland Drive', 'The Truman Show', 'Fight Club' and 'A History of Violence' - all portray reality as a hyper-real simulation in possession of a dark and violent underside. In the case of 'Eyes Wide Shut', this dark underside is itself a charade.In larger terms, these films can be seen as symptomatic expressions of the traumatic transition from the irrational exuberance of techno capitalism to post 9/11 distrust. If the 90s were a great simulation, American living the Capitalist dream, these films anticipate a dark 'exterior' suddenly and violently intruding into the US's simulated 'interiority'. History's sad joke is that 9/11 was itself a hyper-real event, an unreal horror which played out more like a Hollywood movie than any real catastrophe. Thus, while 9/11 should be read as an 'intrusion of the Real' into a 'simulation' (the truth of capitalist logic revealed, the heart of Western finance exploding), it was actually swallowed by the simulation, absorbed and swiftly incorporated so that it became just another empty signifier, all truth blurred, all symbolic meaning swept away. You might say that 9/11 was the first work of post-modern terrorist art, quickly chopped up, split apart and stripped of its historical context and meaning.And so, on one level, these cyberpunk and conspiracy films are attempts to map the unthinkable Thing that is postmodern capital. As Mark de Rozario wrote in his seminal essay on 'Eyes Wide Shut': 'During the bubble economy of the late 90s, capital itself seemed more than ever to correspond with Marx's famous description, as it melted 'all that is solid into air'. Marx thought that capital - the engine of social reality - would inevitably migrate from the realm of material goods into the 'etherworld' of speculative finance. With the dot-com boom we had businesses that were composed, as near as possible, of nothing but ether. Aren't the 90s films expressions of anxieties about this apparent derealization - this sense that everything is a simulation whose existence is dependent upon our continuing to believe in it? But the opposite was the case: our belief was dependent upon capital's maintenance of the simulation. During the 90s boom, capital manufactured belief, giving rise to 'New Era Thinking', the delusion that normal economic laws were suspended and that the economy was entering a New Era of uninterrupted, perpetual expansion. Such a belief structure was necessary for capital in the 90s, but was obsolesced once capital flipped into a new phase, signalled by the near-synchronised popping of the 90s bubble and the fall of the Twin Towers. Now, the belief in expansion without limits is revealed to be 'just a dream' (a dream that, like many dreams, had concrete effects). 'Eyes Wide Shut', with its treatment of the relationship between fantasy and capital, and its re-exploration of the conspiracy narrative, coincided with, and expressed, our waking up from the 90s 'dream'.'Unlike 'Eyes Wide Shut' (and Lynch's 'Mulholland Drive), however, most films within this micro-genre use technology and computer generated wizardry to generate their illusory realities. 'The Matrix', 'Dark City', 'Existenz' and 'The Truman Show' are all old-fashioned parables of political resistance: they remind us that seductive images can be used to repress us and that, while we can enjoy those images to the full, we must also understand how they're actually made.This contemporary hunger for spectacle, for CGI trickery, for hyper-aesthetics, and our increasing reliance on mediated rather than real experience, marks what philosopher Jean Baudrillard terms the 'ecstasy of communication' that defines postmodern life and culture. This is the age of simulations and the simulacra, of mediated representations and reproductions, images and signs gradually taking up the place of objects and commodities. Like Kubrick's Dr Bill (Dollar Bill), this is a world in which reproductions are separated from their original time and space, commodities endlessly circulating inside the simulational model of communication. In the age of hyper-reality, the essence of the post modern moment is the admittance of the bankruptcy of the Real.In an era of generalised simulations, in which technology is increasingly able to capture or fake the real, an opposition between the real and simulation can no longer be maintained. The Real is elusive, constantly morphing into the hyper-real.But films like 'The Truman Show' and 'The Matrix' are locked at what Baudrillard calls the level of the first order of simulacra. They remain at the pre-industrial phase of 'suspicion', quaintly convinced that there is a 'real world' behind and beyond the circulation of simulacra. But we no longer live in the age of the spectacle. Spectacle subjected us to images, now we ourselves become images, participating in the cool hypermedia matrix, which everywhere demands participation. And so what 'Eyes Wide Shut' realises is that reality is already hyper-real. There is now no meaningful distinction between reality and simulation, Real and Image, money and Bill.9.5/10 - Note: This is less a review of 'Eyes Wide Shut' than an examination of it's place within a micro-genre of similar films released in the late 90s and early 00s.",Null,19,34,13 May 2009
Pretty Woman," The Prince and the Hooker
","To maintain their wholesome image, Walt Disney Studios released 'Pretty Woman' under the umbrella of their ancillary company, Touchstone Pictures. But 'Pretty Woman', a feature film about a prostitute who turns into a princess after meeting a Californian prince, is no more sleazy than Disney's animated films aimed at children. The message, values and narrative arcs are all the same.The plot? Richard Gere plays a millionaire who's depressed because 'his father doesn't love him'. Disillusioned, he prepares to dismantle and downsize his giant corporate empire. Luckily he meets a hooker played by Julia Roberts. He showers her in money, riches and fine clothes, she teaches him to be a kind, good businessman who 'provides jobs to shipbuilders'. She rescues him from depression and 'bad' capitalism, he rescues her from the slums, prostitution and, ergo, 'bad' capitalism. The couple no longer screw people over, be it as prostitutes or as corporate raiders, but engage in 'moral transactions'. They get married, live happily ever after and he builds warships.Like 'Indecent Proposal', released around the same time, the super-wealthy are initially malevolent but reveal themselves to be caring and decent. Prostitution is good, clean, profitable, fun and 'just another career choice'. Women, as prostitutes, make their own decisions and are entirely independent, strong and in control of their bodies and choices. Softcore titillation is used, and the prevailing aesthetic is one which bows down to wealth, riches, materialism and money. The end goal is always monogamous marital bliss, women gladly debase themselves to be with their wealthy providers and love conquers all difficulties and is constant. Furthermore, super-rich princes are the male ideal and hookers with hearts of gold are the female ideal. Prostitution has no serious consequences, prostitution is glorified and takes place between free women and sensitive guys, and monogamous marriage, capitalism, patriarchy, and commodification are all endorsed. Elsewhere expensive finery masks amorality, men mould women into their own little dolls, corruption is unimportant (because everyone is corrupt, everyone's a whore, and so corruption is relative), corporate raiders care about people other than themselves (members from the urban poor, no less) and disparages in wealth, taste, experience and education are both cute and don't thwart romance. Compare this to Francois Truffaut's 'The Soft Skin', where the provincial mannerisms of a similar woman are mocked by her aristocratic lover.To make the film work, Big Business must be glorified as much as prostitution. Gere's a Prince Charming, climbing towers to rescue his lady. Oddly, the film is adored by women. It very much represents a post-feminist stance; as all female desire is celebrated, the fantasy of winning a rich prince is super cool, even if this first means that a woman must first unconsciously self-identify as a 'whore'. Servitute is embraced because the self is redefined as feminine-consumer, allowed to window-shop for any and all desires, which in this case is implicitly connected to women's magazines, the fashion industry and the disciplined use of makeup, clothing, exercise etc. Everyone can be transformed from working girl to lady of leisure, everyone is allowed to dream of being valuable and feel valued, everyone is trained in the art of seduction, self-marketing, sexual gratification and consumer display.4/10 - 'My Fair Lady' meets 'Cinderella' meets 'Pygmalion'.

Inside Man," Thank you, Mister Bank Robber
","'Who is the greater criminal: he who robs a bank or he who founds one?' - Brecht 'Even if you get out, you're still in prison' - Baines (Malcolm X) Spike Lee directs 'Inside Man'. If opening shots of roller-coasters indicate that this is one of the director's rare forays into popcorn filmmaking, the subsequent blasting of a Bollywood/Hollywood fusion of 'Chaiyya Chaiyya', which plays over shots of masked terrorists, assures us that Lee is playing by his own rules. The film belongs firmly to the 'con' and 'bank heist' genres, but Lee skewers genre convention at every turn.Lee's opening music conveys a sense of a melting pot, multi-ethnic New York city, but it also plays to the preconceptions of those who conflate 'terrorism' with anything vaguely 'Other'. Of course it then turns out that the film's terrorists are white, not really criminals, and that this music is Indian. But so what? Gotta be suspicious around those A-rabs.Post 9-11 paranoia infuses the entire film. Robbers invade a bank and hold several customers hostage. Victims and victimisers then repeatedly change clothes, an act which Lee uses to critique racial profiling by challenging us to distinguish criminals from innocents without the benefit of knowing skin colour. Outside the bank, Detective Frazier (Denzel Washington) battles his own cocktail of confusing cultural diversity, white power and racial discrimination. Everyone's speaking another language, whites and blacks repeatedly lock horns, ethnic identities lead to rivalry, and nobody knows the difference between Armenians and Albanians. Sikh's, meanwhile, are beaten down for being 'Arabs' and anyone with a beard or a turban is viewed with suspicion. Our detective heroes are themselves not spared (intollerant, accepting bribes etc).The film's title refers simultaneously to our bank robber (played by Clive Owen), hero (homeboy Washington sticking it to 'da Man' from inside the 'systim') and Arthur Case, a wealthy Jewish banker who acted as an 'inside man' for the Nazis during World War 2. Case, it turns out, revealed to the Nazis the whereabouts of Jewish families in hiding, profited from their deaths and started up a chain of banks. As Jewish symbols and totem litter the film, some have accused Lee of anti-Semitism. But it was primarily the 'Allies', during WW2, who salivated over Hitler and, in an attempt to preserve their own power, sought the death of Jews and Bolsheviks. Meanwhile, in the real world, Jews overwhelmingly occupy positions of power within financial institutions (0.2 percent of the world's population are Jews, whilst over half its billionaires are Jewish). This 'success' has been attributed to everything from ethnocentrism, good parenting, strong personal/cultural values, hard work, conspiracy, genetics and incessant persecution.Others point out the fact that ancient religions/cultures forbid money lending, interest, usury, and typically looked down on tax collectors and money movers. The Bible itself (its passages with Judas the Treasurer are blatant anti-Semitic tracts) views anyone who extracts money from money alone as being a heathen. Artist's like Dante even went so far as to consign usurers to the seventh circle of hell. Jews, however, had no qualms charging interest to non-Jews. Flash forward some decades, and Jewish banking takes off. Over time the stereotype then develops that 'Jews are parasites'. With the start of another recession and the shady dealings of prominent Jews like Bernard Madoff, a new breed of 21st century anti-Semitism has erupted. Ironically, while there exists an image of Jews as 'successful capitalists', in intellectual circles Jews (Marx, Lassalle etc) have written some of the premiere critiques of capitalism. What these works do, and Lee doesn't, is steer away from personalisation and focus instead on systems; capitalism is inherently parasitic, everything is now usury and we are in a sense now all Jews.Still, Lee's banker bashing and Wall Street fury are at times funny. The film's last act consists of Denzel strutting about like a blaxploitation hero, part Superfly/Shaft, part vengeful Kunta Kinte. Dressed in hat and suit and with the tenacity of a pit-bull, Washington takes the fight back to the white man (and a woman, surprise surprise, called Mrs White). Lee's in his element here. The rest of the film is overlong, but Lee nevertheless teases out interesting moments; the robbers turn out to be righteous, the banker is villain rather than victim, images deliberately evoke Guantanamo Bay, George Bush's many unlawful detentions, arrests and renditions and the film tries to play with Balzak's old adage: 'behind all fortune is a great crime'. Indeed, many of today's top industries and figureheads (the film's release coincided with revelations of the Bush family's own Nazi ties) owe their wealth to crime and/or war profiteering.Lee is black, but 'Man's' scriptwriter, Russell Gewirtz, is Jewish. The film is clearly rooted in both its creators own ethnic identities. And if Lee's films tend to hinge on sociological entrapment – being stuck, both physically and mentally - 'Man' does likewise. Washington's stuck and unable to climb the ranks, Case wants to erase his past while our bank robbers function more as dialectical operators. Most interesting, though, is the way the film inter-cuts its crime in the 'present' with suspect interviews in the 'future'. Crime and visibility are traditionally linked, but Washington's entered a new arena. Who is guilty? What exactly is the crime? What are we overlooking? How do we now go about separating people into distinct torturer/victim groups? If society integrates based on wealth and ambition, how can it deny that it excludes based on the same? For Washington, confusion becomes the permanent impasse of the contemporary and crime, suspicion and the suspension of civic rights are revealed to be not an aberration but inherent to neo-liberalism. Owen's 'terrorism' does not provoke executive measures (Patriot Act/authoritarianism etc), rather, the suspension of human rights is already present, is a priori, since the accumulation of capital and the political system protecting power (wealth, private property etc) explicitly depend on it.8.5/10 – Interesting.",Null,2,4,18 September 2012
Hoosiers," Everyday between three and five

Along the way, coaches and players learn various life lessons.Though viewed as a classic by many (it was one of the earliest mainstream basketball flicks), 'Hoosiers' is mostly thin and comprised of clichés.

Pulp Fiction," Bring Out The Gimp
","'Tarantino seems to be too concerned with other films. I mean, about appropriating other movies, like a blender. I think it's really funny at the time I'm seeing it, but then, I don't know, there's a void there. Some of the references are flat, just pop culture.' - Harmony Korine 'It's like watching a schoolboy's fantasy of violence and sex, which normally Tarantino would be ******* alone to in his bedroom while his mother is making him baked beans downstairs. Only this time he's got Harvey Weinstein behind him and it's on a million screens.' - Nick Broomfield 'Thirty years ago it would have been widely accepted that objective knowledge about society and history was an asset for a filmmaker. Today, such an attitude is considered a hindrance. This is a temporary state of affairs, but a costly and destructive one. Art, including bad art, has consequences.' - David Walsh Quentin Tarantino directs 'Pulp Fiction', a shamelessly lurid homage to early B-movies, printed pulp fiction (the dime-store tales of the 1940s-50s, and later pulp imitators - sometimes called 'new pulp' - like Elmore Leonard and Charles Bukowski, whose own 'Pulp' was released in 1994), Robert Aldrich ('Kiss Me Deadly'), 'Farewell My Lovely', 'Pickup on South Street' and Godard ('Band of Outsiders', 'Vivre sa Vie', 'Alphaville'). Nods to 'It's a Wonderful Life', 'Truck Turner' (the same comic monologues), 'Karate Kiba' (Jackson's religious monologues repeated verbatim), 'On The Waterfront', 'The Colour of Money' ('character' vs 'having character' conversation), 'The Parent Trap' (Uma drawing an animated square on screen, also from 'The Three Little Bops'), 'Repo Man' (glowing briefcase; see also Aldrich), 'Charley Varrick' (lifted lines, as well as the torture scene), 'Psycho', 'Lili' (everything about the Fabienne character), 'Easy Rider', 'God of Gamblers' (violence whenever Travolta goes to the bathroom), 'Three Days of the Condor' (Vincent's death), 'Shoot the Piano Player', 'Jules and Jim', 'The Panic in Needle Park' (the whole overdose fiasco), 'Policewoman' (stylized credit sequence), and 'The Night Of The Hunter' come next, all shoehorned before or after an extended sequence in a movie-themed restaurant in which all of Tarantino's references sit back, chill out and relax.The film is dense with allusions (Uma's two dances are taken directly from 'Band of Outsiders' and 'Vivre sa Vie', as is her haircut), cribbed shots and referenced dialogue, Tarantino packing the film to the brim with nods to esoteric art films, mainstream fare, trashy exploitation films and television programmes ('Kung Fu', 'Captain Kangaro', 'Happy Days', 'Cops'). Characters likewise either work on TV shows ('Force Five'), knowingly repeat lines from movies ('Zardoz', 'Guns of Navarone' etc) and documentaries (Scorsese's 'American Boy' is the source of Lance's needle instructions) or are themselves named after songs ('Flock of Seagulls'), movies or movie characters (eg Tony 'Rocky Horror' named after the 'Rocky Horror Picture Show', 'English Bob' after a character in 'Unforgiven' and Keitel's 'The Wolf' based on a similar character in 'Victor the Cleaner'). Posters of countless films are likewise littered throughout, as well as references to film directors (a 'Douglas Sirk steak' - aka a steak with 'All That Heaven Allows'). Some of the allusions are brief (boxer Bruce Willis' comes home after a fight and yells his girl's name like Stallone does in 'Rocky'), whilst some are deliberately extended and toyed with.Some actors in the film even acknowledge their own roles in other films, Christopher Walken's character just coming back from 'Deer Hunter's' Nam, Travolta's echoing his role in 'Saturday Night Fever' and Ving Rhames' Marsellus Wallace delivering a monologue exactly like his character in 'Casualties of War'. Rhames' gimp suit encounter even echoes another gimp suit encounter in 'The People Under The Stairs', also with Rhames. Cinematic pop cultural references even bleed into print references (Travolta reading 'Modesty Blaise' etc), while the film's self-consciously fake process shots recall Dick Richards' noirs. Even the famous 'Quarter Pounder' monologue is cribbed, and much of the character ramblings recall Jean Paul Belmondo in 'Breathless'.The film is structured as a series of short stories – all loosely connected and deliberately trashy – but within these stories are themselves characters who constantly take time out to tell equally digressive short stories. In this way the film is a tale about people telling tales, and so plays like a celebration of oration, of yapping, of a hundred and twenty years of seedy storytelling. Ironically, the film's best short story is that in which the characters decide to 'say nothing'. To shut up.Under postmodernism, art is inherently self absorbed, self-reflexive, de-structured, de-centred, fragmented, parasitic and churned out by artists whose media-saturated landscapes become 'all that there is to reality'. Such artists live in a kind of cocoon, seeking only to replicate past pleasures. This is a cinema of artifacts and furnishings. Of attitude, copied poses and interchangeable and indistinguishable references. Here, life is only an extension of media, everything is false and all that matters are gestures and role playing. And like other postmodern films, Tarantino's aesthetic is a seductive kind of hyper-stylisation, everything not only in quotes and supremely self conscious, but celebratory of self consciousness.'Pulp Fiction' is entertaining (and its narrative has a breezy, liberative quality), much better written than its imitators and one passage in particular, which plays with the classic cliché of 'the bodyguard and the bosses wife', is graceful, low key and romantic. Much of the film is surprisingly inhumane, though, a kind of jokey 1970s exploitation movie in which people are either doped up, stabbed by needles, raping black men or coldly slaughtering teens while making grand speeches. Because the film exists in a certain moral vacuum ('It's just a film', 'It's supposed to be trash', 'It's pulp ****ing fiction!'), stuff like anal rape and murder are all played for snickers and kicks.8/10 - The 'Repo Man' of the 90s?",Null,1,4,18 August 2011
Jack Reacher," Coming up short
","Which clown decided to put Tom Cruise in a film titled 'Jack Reacher'? Tom Cruise can't reach anything. The guy's six inches. Seven inches tops. This puts most of the physical world outside of Tom Cruise's reach. Literally. Unless he's reaching for metaphysical stuff. Can Tom Cruise reach places with his mind? Regardless, 'Jack Reacher' stars Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher, an ex Army Major who specialises in kicking butt. His mission? Solve a mystery regarding the deaths of several men and women by sniper fire. The problem? The dude is short.'Jack Reacher' possesses one of the strangest opening acts in action movie history. Here director Christopher McQuarrie goes to extreme lengths to convince us that Cruise is an archetypal lone wolf, tough guy and one man army. The problem? The dude is short. When you need your camera three inches off the ground to make your tough guy look imposing, there is a problem.McQuarrie then gives Cruise a series of one liners which are meant to sound witty and/or tough but which instead come across as being adorably silly. When a shop clerk asks to see some ID, Cruise offers to 'show him the inside of an ambulance' instead. When a girl identifies herself as 'Sandy', Cruise says 'so was I, last week, on a beach in Florida'. This is bad tough guy dialogue, the likes of which only a Clint Eastwood or Humphrey Bogart can sell. Why? Probably cos' they're tall.Bizarrely, 'Jack Reacher' stars Werner Herzog as its chief villain. Herzog's woefully miscast, and can't convey menace at all, but there's something fitting about the way his character's misfortunes align themselves with Herzog's own, wacky real life persona. Also co-starring is Rosamund Pike, who looks perpetually confused and seems to be participating in the cleavage Olympics. She sets up some of Cruise's more funny moments, in which the actor mocks his own vainglory. Elsewhere the film contains a number of good scenes, like an archetypal bar fight in which our hero 'steps outside' to brawl with a group of hoodlums. The way Reacher dissects and works his way through an elaborate crime scene (five people were shot by a sniper alongside a river) is also interesting, though only in theory. The film later climaxes with a shoot-out at a quarry, and is bookended by two tasteless assassination sequences. In the first, we watch through a sniper-scope as a massacre occurs. In the second, Cruise assassinates the film's villain because turning up to court trials is apparently too much hassle. Like most action heroes, the guy's an extrajudicial badass, taking care of business then fading into the shadows. Like Nixon. Final scene? Cruise on a bus, about to beat up a punk for slapping a woman. The guy's a low-rent Batman, short bus and all.6.9/10 – See Mamet's 'Spartan'.",Null,0,3,22 August 2013

Titanic," Big ship moons audience, makes a zillion dollars
","'Technological progress is like an axe in the hands of a pathological criminal.' – Albert Einstein Most damn the 'romantic subplot' at the heart of 'Titanic' and overlook the larger romance that extends throughout director James Cameron's filmography. This is not just a film about the budding love between two characters on a ship, but about man's love affair with technology.Cameron presents Titanic as a modern marvel. A beautiful ocean liner, with sleek lines, sensual curves and chrome plumbing. His camera caresses the ship, bathing it in sunsets, starlight and pinkish hues. It's not only a stage for romance, but the embodiment of romance. A kind of fetishized symbol for man's, and Cameron's, love for technology; his godlike desire to lord over his landscape with machines. The name 'Titanic' is itself suggestive of an almost divine or Olympian creation.Of course the ship then hits a chunk of ice and promptly sinks. Cameron's camera then surveys the carnage, watching with delight as the machine goes down, taking a couple hundred passengers with it. This is not just a maritime disaster. This is judgement day, the machines rebelling against their creators.One character, an artist called Jack, goes down with the ship, but not before saving the life of a plump girl called Rose. Man's creative spirit may sink into the void, but it is promptly revitalised by the blossoming of Rose, a previously reticent young woman who regains her spark through contact with Jack.This tension takes place throughout Cameron's filmography. His films are all about beautiful machines violently rebelling against their makers. This push-pull tension itself infects Cameron's work methods, for he is a director obsessed with machines, but who spends his career warning us of the very robots he creates, promotes, proliferates and relies on.What's strange, though, is that Cameron's latest film not only repeats this message, but then goes further into a kind of hippie utopianism. 'Avatar', a zillion dollar action fantasy shot in 3D, features a world in which aliens use their 'brain stems' to literally plug into trees, animals and nature. For Cameron, technology is not only evil, it now prevents us from 'connecting to nature'. 'Nature is what's real', Cameron says, populating his film with aliens who 'hook up' to a kind of biological network. Cameron takes the cables, modems, routers, telephones and computers of the modern world, and turns them into their biological equivalents, trees, roots and bodies linked by organic conduits. 'Avatar's' aliens even store their entire history on a 'harddrive' in the form of a giant tree. In other words, the 'internet' should be 'out there'. All should be dependent on physical connections to nature, not virtual connections mediated via machines.But there is always a danger of 'naturalising' nature. The natural world is not some kind of utopia to which we can return in balanced harmony. Man has always been at war with nature and nature itself is not a balanced system. It is a mass of conflicting bodies, constantly adapting, jostling, vying for position, always changing. This kind of fetishizing of nature, the need to turn it into some kind of mystical utopia, is the same kind of confused thinking that led to designer-Buddhism becoming popular in the 60s. Indeed, 'Avatar' only works because Cameron romanticises the 'noble savages' in his film, portraying them as 'kind hearted' 'mystical creatures' who are 'one with the land'. Compare this to someone like Herzog or Terrence Malick, who constantly crash the Romantic ideal of nature with post-Enlightenment thinking.Then there's the ironic fact that though Cameron's films have all been cautionary tales about technology, he is the biggest techno-whore in all of Hollywood. For a zillion dollar film to be so pro-chlorophyll reeks of hypocrisy. Reconnect to nature via CGI jungles? It's like Bill Gates telling us to get back in touch with trees...but BUY WINDOWS VISTA because that's where the real vistas are.So with its computer generated jungles and CGI ships, these two films are really showcases for technology. They don't ask us to consider our relationship with tech, but push us further into hyper-reality, further into the simulacrum, selling us the notion that technology can offer us 'more nature than nature can'. High definition TV, 3D film, wide screen, youtube videos, surround sound etc...technology is nature without the hassle (technology is itself nature, part of our extended phenotype). It is nature purified by machines. This all has the opposite effect of Cameron's message, people retreating further 'inwards' into their 'utopian homes' rather than plugging into the 'outside'. And why not? To homo-sapien 21C, 'nature' isn't real enough anymore. It lacks the definition of the simulacrum.Imagine a director like Cronenberg handling a film like 'Titanic' or 'Avatar'. Mybe he'd focus on 'Avatar's' more disturbing, unconscious elements. That this is a film about a guy who is essentially 'watching a film'. That the hero needs to be comatose and 'asleep in a machine' to experience a better life. That his virtual experiences are more 'real' than his limited body. That the cast themselves require 'avatars suits'. That their performances are all 'virtual'. That the 3D nature of the picture requires one to wear glasses to view it, the distance from subject to fantasy constantly meta-morphing. And so revisiting all of Cameron's films, it's clear that 'Aliens' and 'The Terminator' represent him at his peak. Each successive film has been increasingly childish, his exponentially inflated mega-budgets dictating that his films cast a net across as wide a demographic as possible. The super-violent R-rated worlds of 'The Terminator' and 'Aliens' are now too niche market, the director succumbing to the machine that is the almighty dollar. And the further Cameron gets from the B-movie masculinity of his early career, the more simple minded and proselytising his films get.8/10 - Oscilates from jaw-droppingly spectacular to cringe-worthy.",Null,2,6,22 December 2009
Thor," Too many cooks spoil the broth
","Kenneth Branagh directs 'Thor', a superhero movie which mixes the director's fondness for William Shakespeare (and theatre) with big budget, CGI, superhero, comic book nuttiness. Ironically, it's the film's Shakespearean aspects – a 'King Lear' inspired narrative in which Gods and Wizards jostle for power and plot against one another whilst a wise King divides his kingdom between sons, outcasts and half-breeds – which work horribly. Probably because it's fundamentally impossible to take such 'high brow drama' seriously when everyone is wearing underwear, capes and standing on glowing rainbows. It would take a genius to conceive of a believable 'trans-dimensional landscape' in which alien beings, Gods and lords can convincingly frolic whilst quoting The Bard.Still, the film's other subplot, which takes the form of a culture-clash comedy in which the mighty Thor bumbles about contemporary America whilst a chirpy Natalie Portman lusts after his heavenly body, works well. Think such 'fish out of water' comedies like Arnold Schwarzenegger's 'Hercules in New York', 'The Voyage Home', 'The Terminal', 'Moscow on the Hudson' or 'Time After Time', and you've got an idea of what Branagh is tapping into. This aspect of the film is cute, but not worth suffering the director's Greco-mythological train wreck.Like most super hero movies, the overriding theme is proto-fascist: 'how to wield absolute power benevolently'.6/10 - Worth one viewing.

The Happening," Hitchcock meets Twilight Zone meets CIA casebook
","Baffling: across the east coast of the United States, large groups of people have mysteriously begun killing themselves. It is initially believed that a foreign 'terrorist group' has released a chemical agent into the atmosphere, but as 'The Happening' progresses it becomes apparent that the 'terrorist' in question is really Mother Nature herself. Earth's trees and forests, we learn, have become sensitive to human activity, and so have now begun releasing 'suicide inducing toxins' as a form of self defence. Large groups of people set off the attacks, and so humans must travel in small groups so as to avoid triggering nature's newly evolved defence mechanism.Directed by M. Night Shyamalan, 'The Happening' can be read through at least three prisms. On one hand it's part of a series of post 9/11 disaster movies ('War of the Worlds', 'Mist', 'Cloverfield'), but is atypical in the way its political allegory pushes further than its siblings. Whereas your typical post 9/11 monster movie watches as hapless whites are stomped on by faceless bogeymen - terrorists which these films always demonize - 'The Happening' deals with what military tacticians typically call 'blow-back' (violence directed at the civilian population of aggressor governments). Here, Americans are literally set upon by 'terrorist suicide bombers' because they indiscriminately, and egotistically, 'trample on territory that does not belong to them'. Overlap Shyamalan's foliage with the West's recent Middle Eastern Crusades, and you have a clear message; the trees want payback.Shunt aside power-politics and 'The Happening' is also part of a recent chain of either environmentally conscious films or films which posit Nature as a cruel asphyxiator ('Wall-E', 'Avatar', 'AntiChrist', 'The Happening', 'An Inconvenient Truth', 'Grizzly Man', 'Into The Wild', 'Deamland', 'The Day The Earth Stood Still', 'The Day After Tomorrow', 'Happy Feet' etc). While all these films mean well, it's disconcerting to see how quickly and efficiently our fears are transfered from one thing to another. From 'fascist' Germans, to yellow invasions, to 'communist' Russians, to Middle Eastern 'terrorists' and now to the environment itself, an unseen enemy is always created to keep populaces in a state of fear. This fear is then used to enforce restrictions, unifying men by threatening their very survival. But now we have the perfect bogeyman, the perfect scapegoat, ubiquitous, perpetual and all-encompassing. Environmentalism is not just about hugging trees. It's a political project, a full-bodied ideology that presents itself in terms of progress and aspiration. But this ideology is built on the idea of a collective threat that makes 'security' its basic principle, making 'the struggle for survival' the central aim of our social and political life.The outcomes of all this environmental fear mongering will probably reveal itself in a couple decades. While such lines of discussion encourage us to realise that there are always consequences to capitalist relations - the demands of capitalism being inherently unsustainable and downright apocalyptic - the real trend seems to be toward outright denial (we hurt the environment more, the MORE we're aware of our actions), toward darker, more insidious mechanisms of control, and toward a 'monetising' of environmentalism; a shallow green capitalism, where green initiatives are used to squeeze but more profits, and where 'clean' wind energy on one side of the world is powered by the toxic mining for magnetic metals in China. Build a wind turbine and you kill two hundred people and render a square mile toxic and uninhabitable for 20 years. But hey, you make a buck.Shyamalan's 'Signs' was one of the best recent alien invasion movies, if you can overlook its absolutely distasteful 'religious subplot'. Night's a die-hard Christian, and so it's also possible to view 'The Happening' as another fundamentalist tract (sinners punished by a vengeful God/Nature?), though such a reading is so thin as to be pointless.Beyond all this the film works well as an amalgamation of pulpy science fiction, 'Twilight Zone' episodes and Alfred Hitchcock (specifically 'Birds', 'Psycho', 'Frenzy' and 'Marnie'). Like Hitchcock, Shyamalan knows how to elevate pulp, how to imbue pulp with his own concerns (for better or for worse), and more importantly, how to toy with his audience with but the simplest of tools. And like Hitch, Shyamalan's shot selection is super fine-tuned, restrained and precise, every camera move, composition, angle, motion and sequence impeccably planned. Both directors also offer a masterclass in how to classically build thrills, and neither goes for elaborate special effects or fast cutting. Shyamalan's scores also often reference Bernard Herrmann, a composer oft associated with Hitch, and like the Master, has a penchant for on-screen, walk-on cameos.8.5/10 - A nice throwback to 1950s science fiction. There's also something audacious about Shyamalan's insistence on making a film in which trees are the 'monsters'. It's a difficult premise to pull off. Worth two viewings.",Null,4,8,3 September 2008
Castle in the Sky," A girl just fell from the sky, boss
","'Laputa: Castle in the Sky' is a 1986 feature length animation by Japanese master director Hayao Miyazaki. The film opens with an exciting battle on-board a bulbous airship, in which a band of bumbling sky-pirates attempt to apprehend Sheeta, a little girl who possesses a stone with remarkable powers. Assisting Sheeta is Pazu, a resourceful kid who lives in a ramshackled mining community.Miyazaki's plot's frequently sound silly on paper. On screen, though, they're brimming with neat little details and passages. 'Laputa's' packed with one cool sequence after the next, some interesting airship designs and several action sequences guaranteed to make live-action directors jealous (James Cameron, Brad Bird and Spielberg are self-professed Miyazaki fan-boys). And as is typical of Miyazaki, the film boasts another enchanting score by composer Joe Hisaishi, alternates between kinetic moments and poetic, Ozu-like postcard images, and is positively in love with aircrafts, flying and wide open skies. The film's eco-sermon is also less heavy-handed than some of Miyazaki's other works; here an ancient civilisation collapses when it symbolically loses all ties and connections with the natural world, a lesson which a new militaristic superpower fails to learn.Miyazaki directed 'Nausicca of the Valley of the Winds' in 1984. Like that film, 'Laputa' takes place in a steam-punk world which mixes high and low technology. This is a contrast to most science fiction animes, which take place in dystopian, cyberpunk futures. Of course Miyazaki is as anti-militaristic and techno-wary as his contemporaries (Satoshi Kon, Isao Takahata, Katsuhiro Otomo, Mamoru Oshii etc), but he's also far less pessimistic and far more romantic. They're about steel and concrete. He's a wood and chlorophyll guy. Miyazaki's steam-punk approach also tends to result in a number of unusual machines, many of which are evocative of Albert Robida, a French artist who was popular in the late 1880s.'Laputa' is arguably the only film in Miyzaki's oeuvre with a conventional villain. His other films tend to have no clear distinctions between the 'bad guys' and 'good guys'. At its best, the film conveys an incredible sense of place, with leafy cloud cities, subterranean mining towns (Laputa's mirror image), and turbulent skies which buffet flimsy airships. Unfortunately, after a strong first three acts, the film degenerates into clichés, with conventional light shows, damsels in distress and a obligatory 'temple collapse' sequence (ancient temples always collapse RIGHT AFTER they've been rediscovered). Still, it's one of Miyazaki's coolest adventures.8.9/10 – The similarly themed, though cyberpunk, 'Akira' would be released 2 years later.

The Untouchables," Here endeth the lesson
","'The camera lies all the time.' – Brian De Palma Brian De Palma directs 'The Untouchables', a film which presents the flip side to his earlier gangster movie, 'Scarface'. So whilst 'Scarface' was all about excess and unchecked consumption, the logic of capitalism taken to its grotesque extreme, 'The Untouchables' is about Prohibition, regulation, control and the knights who maintain order.And so the over-the-top badness of Al Pacino in 'Scarface' ('Say goodbye to the bad guy!', 'Bad guy coming through!') becomes actor Kevin Costner's ultra saintly performance as the squeaky clean Eliot Ness in 'The Untouchables' ('Let's do some good!', 'I'm a good cop!', 'We must be pure!'). A boy scout with a badge, Ness is the ultimate straight-arrow. Where Pacino was associated with foreigners, outsiders, vulgarity, sex and drugs, Ness is an all American hero, a morally righteous G-man linked to religious iconography, a Madonna-like wife, righteous crusades, noble sacrifices, wild west motifs, Norman Rockwell imagery and is constantly shot from low angles so as to emphasise his near mythic, heroic stature.There are other minor reversals – the man Pacino kills in Freedom Town becomes the henchman Ness kills at the end of 'Untouchables', the little girl killed at the start of 'Untouchables' becomes the little girls Pacino saves at the end of 'Scarface' etc – but the major reversals occur toward the end of the film. Here, no one bats an eyelid when the super saintly Ness lies to a judge and commits murder to uphold Prohibition, a foolish law (which still exists in various forms today) which Ness abides to, not because it is worth enforcing (the film ends with Ness promising to take a drink), but because it is the Law.All these actions flip 'Scarface's' redemptive ending, in which crime-lord Tony Montana becomes disillusioned with excess and loses his empire after refusing both to corrupt the innocence of his sister and to murder two girls. For all his vices, Montana was a disillusioned hero. For all his charm, Ness is a hypocrite, one film serving up truths via disenchantment, the other lies via illusions. If capitalism operates by promising the unattainable absolute object whilst disguising the fact that it is the object's inaccessibility which fuels Desire, then it is 'heroes' like Ness who bolster the American Dream by ensuring that Desire is always possible but prohibited.Both films are derived from 1930s gangster flicks, but at times feel more like war movies (armoured trucks, assault rifles, high-tech surveillance). Like most war movies, 'The Untouchables' message also appears to be that the ends justify the means. That our heroes commit crimes, but only that we may all live in peace. As Ness' world is one of crooked cops, dishonest judges, widespread corruption, and one in which power goes to the highest bidder, the audience not only accepts a little rule bending from our hero, but overlooks it completely.Throughout the film, Ness wrestles with one question: can the rule of law be re-established by violating the law? His answer is no. When the grieving mother of a dead little girl tasks Ness with capturing crime-lord Al Capone, Ness nobly takes on this 'righteous mission'. He will do anything within the Law to maintain the Law, he says. It is only through a character called Malone (Sean Connery), that Ness begins to embrace more cutthroat methods. As Malone is linked to churches, Rosary beads and saints, we accept his schooling. The government – federal, state and local – is not bound to obey its own laws.The film contains an extended sequence which takes place in Chicago's Union Station. Dismissed by many as being a 'mere homage', this scene recalls Eisenstein's 'Odessa Steps' sequence in 'The Battleship Potempkin' for several reasons. Not only was 'Potempkin' made during the time period in which 'The Untouchables' is set, but both films are about battles for control, 'Untouchables' the battle for capitalist control of 'war torn' Chicago and 'Potempkin' the Tsarist Regime's control of 'Russia' in the wake of rebel dissidence.Eisenstein's 'Odessa Steps' sequence was an unashamed piece of political propaganda – one of cinema's greatest agitprop moments - designed to defame the Imperial Regime by showing Cossak soldiers ruthlessly slaughtering men, women and children on a public staircase. De Palma re-stages the sequence in small scale, but puts his heroes in the position of the Tsarist Regime. Both scenes are designed to expose the fact that regimes have no moral compunction and will do anything (or have their foot-soldiers do anything) to hold onto power and control. What De Palma's sequence does is retain the propagandistic function of Eistenstein, but filters it through an ironic light. Here, The G-men are elevated to heroic status, and our mythologization of them legitimizes their actions. Likewise, both scenes feature imperilled baby carriages, but whilst Eisenstein's was threatened by Cossacks, De Palma's represents the psychology of Ness. Symbollically recalling the grieving mother and the dead child, the menaced baby represents the point where two Ness' converge; innocence and violence, public duty and moral responsibility. This scene, and the audience, then sanctions everything Ness does later.De Palma made 'The Untouchables' after almost a decade of financial failure. A calculated crowd pleaser, the film then went on to become his biggest box office hit. The audience's love is disturbing, as the film is such a straight faced emulation of cheese-ball 30's pulp, no one reads it as a piece of pop-art propaganda, or in relation to 'Potempkin's' anti-totalitarianism or even De Palma's early satires (Ness is the precursor to Tom Hanks' squeaky clean bastard in De Palma's 'Bonfire').8/10 - Aesthetically the film is gorgeous (filled with beautiful compositions, architecture, elegant camera-work and a great score by Ennio Moriconne), but its style is too 'mainstream' for hardcore De Palma fans, and writer David Mamet's minimalism and sharp prose are wasted on a baroque visualist like De Palma.",Null,7,10,10 February 2011
The Matrix Reloaded," Cyberpunk sucker punch
","The Wachowski Brothers released 'The Matrix' in 1999. The film starred Keanu Reeves as Neo, a man who realises that 'reality' as perceived by most humans is actually an elaborate simulation called 'the Matrix', created by sentient machines to subdue humans and essentially use them for slave labour. A massive box-office hit, the film's archetypal 'Hero's Journey' connected with audiences, particular young males. Like 'Star Wars', The New Testament, 'Lord of the Rings' and virtually every 'modern myth', it was filled with talk of 'destiny', 'chosen ones', 'salvation', 'special missions' and supernatural powers (the force/the code), which of course only our prophesied hero, Neo, possesses. The Wachowskis released two sequels ('Reloaded' and 'Revolutions') several years later. Disparaged by fan-boys, these two films created a sort of anti-myth. Or more precisely, the machine villains of the franchise were revealed to have created an artificial myth in order to give false hope to the film's human heroes, and by extension, the film's audience. It's not so much that the sequels deconstruct what Joseph Campbell famously called the 'monomyth' or the 'Hero's Journey', but that they embodied a kind of postmodern scepticism of the 'metanarrative', and so treat the film's myths as a further layer of Matrix simulation which people 'plug into' to further delude themselves.'The narrative function is losing its functors, its great hero, its great dangers, its great voyages, its great goal.' Pilosopher Jean Lyotard wrote decades ago. 'Where, after the meta-narratives, can legitimacy thus reside?' Echoing Lyotard's words, 'The Matrix' franchise highlights a subtle cultural shift, the totalising nature of meta-narratives, and their reliance on some form of 'transcendent and universal truth', now increasingly rejected. What the Wachowskis show is that the 'master narrative' is always created and reinforced by power structures (ie the villainous machines in the film), that they are never to be trusted, that they are designed to embody progress towards a specific goal, that they dismiss the naturally existing chaos of the universe, that they are created to marshal people toward some theoretical doctrine and that they serve only to placate subjects with notions of 'order', 'structure' and 'hope'.And so 'The Matrix' sequels have interesting (ie seemingly annoying) reversals which few myths possess. Firstly, our hero (Neo) is actually the film's 'bad guy'. Secondly, the closest the franchise has to a good guy is Agent Smith, whom most perceive as the villain. Thirdly, far from being 'the Chosen One', Neo becomes just another iteration in a long line of manipulative computer programs. Fourthly, Zion, the city which Neo is foretold to 'save', is itself just another level of simulation, a memory cache designed to house radicals and provide the illusion of hope, choice and free-will, its panel of leaders all computer programs designed to foster a belief in Neo. Fifthly, the film's Oracle is not a benevolent 'helper figure' (ie Yoda), but is really working for the machines and is attempting to instigate the Matrix equivalent of 'multiculuralism', the passive assimilation or social integration between mankind and machine. In other words, the 'efficiency obsessed' machines (like some dystopian version of a drone reliant capitalist technocracy) don't want to waste time fighting humans, they want the human rebels (ethnic minorities and outcast hackers) to willingly 'join them' and so have constructed an elaborate myth to engender this symbiotic merger.Sixthly, the franchise's dialogue/acting becomes increasingly, and deliberately, phony. Everyone in the sequels speaks of determinism and of every micro-event being preordained. Everything you see in the sequels is thus not only programmed, but has happened repeatedly before in cycles, and is anticipated by super computer characters (some of whom possess ironic self awareness) which process zillions of different variables, tracing cause and effect to such an extent that they know exactly 'what happens next'. The notion of 'choice being an illusion' is important to the franchise. Previous versions of the Matrix (essentially a jail for humans) didn't work because 'human slaves' didn't have a choice. Gradually the machines allowed the slaves to have 'the illusion of choice', but this too didn't work. Choice was not the problem. The problem was that humans opted for what the machine's perceived to be 'the wrong choices' and sometimes 'no choice at all' (radical non-participation). Thereofore, the machines created Neo to encourage others to obey 'their choice' and 'be participatory'. The problem was, after six cycles, Neo got smart. The goal then became to con Neo; to trick him into believing that he too could choose. Extrapolate this theme to the real world and you have all kinds of sinister ramifications.Seventhly, far from a rebel, Neo has been supported by the system all along. Eightly, like Satan, Agent Smith throws himself out of 'heaven' when he realises he is 'facing deletion'. If Neo is part of the system, Smith is the enemy of the system. He wants to bring it crashing down. This is similar to the writings of many Gnostics who view Satan as the 'hero' of Genesis, as he sought to free God's subjects from their subservience and false realities. Ninthly, many complain about the film's 'fake sets' and 'fake action scenes', but once you realise that these characters and landscapes are supposed to be digital simulations, it all works. Why should they obey the laws of physics?Finally, 'Love' and 'the hero's sacrifice' are key themes in myths. With the Wachowskis, however, these things are subverted. A character called Trinity is created to 'install' love and self-sacrifice into the deluded Neo, whilst other characters (the elder's conversation at the water refinery, the birth of Sati through 'machine love' etc) are created to subtly introduce Neo to the idea of a symbiotic relationship between machines and man. The franchise's 'myth' is therefore a sort of unholy trinity (between man, machine and the ghosts in the matrix) in which 'enlightened' and 'free' humans are wilfully re-imprisoned by their false Saviour. Creepy.8.5/10 – Subversive anti-blockbuster.",Null,1,2,30 October 2010
Zombieland," Bill Murray, you're a zombie?
","'That's the worst goodbye I've ever heard. And you stole it from a movie.' - Columbus (Zombieland) 'Zombieland' is yet another film in a recent wave of 80s nostalgia flicks ('Adventureland', 'Superbad', the various cinematic secretions of Judd Apatow etc), all written and directed by guys who came of age in the 1980s.And so the film is set in a post apocalyptic future in which a band of survivors learn to put aside their differences, battle zombies and 'become a family'. Here, family, or human connection, is implicitly about restoring the perceived utopia of the 1980s, a pre 21st century world in which the cosy naivety of youth has yet to be destroyed by the 'modern experience'. And so our heroes all long for symbols of childhood: family, friends, old school amusement parks, babies, dogs, snack foods, 80s media, Betamax, community etc, anything that existed before the technological leaps of the early 90s escalated technocapitalism and ramped up the postmodern experience.Like 'Shaun of the Dead', this is therefore a zombie movie which trades in nostalgia, which weeps for some perceived loss of humanity. Needless to say it pales in comparison to the zombie movies of George Romero, who tackled this material with 'Night of the Dead' and 'Dawn of the Dead' and has moved well past such themes with his subsequent zombie flicks, all of which have been ignored by audiences.First time director Ruben Fleischer injects lots of fun and energy into the film, but the plot itself is a fairly routine merger of the road movie, the zombie apocalypse movie, the teen romantic fantasy, Leone westerns, the 'Mad Max' trilogy and loner survivalist tales like 'Escape from New York' etc. That it all works is largely thanks to Fleischer's rapid-fire direction and actor Woody Harrelson pushing postmodern action hero irony as far as he can. He isn't as meta as Robert Downey Junior and Johnny Depp ('Pirates of the Caribbean', 'Iron Man' etc – all performances which make the wink-at-the-audience irony of Cary Grant, Harrison Ford and Bruce Willis, for better or for worse, obsolete), but he gets the job done.The film itself opens with Metallica's 'For Whom The Bell Tolls' on the soundtrack, an interesting choice, as both Metallica's song, and the Hemmingway novel upon which its title is based, dealt with a fear of modernity, impending death, sacrifice, mortality, a longing for family etc. Such themes are never substantially delved into or treated with much weight by Fleischer, but they do help add some gravity to an otherwise formulaic plot.Perhaps the most interesting thing about the film is the way it rebels against what Jan van Dijk called the 'network society' - in which society is constructed merely as purposeful, repetitive, programmable sequences of exchange and interaction between physically disjointed positions held by social actors (ie postmodernism's brain scrambled zombie future) - but then relies on this society's 'codes' to hook audiences. For example, for all its nostalgic lamentations, 'Zombieland' heavily relies on video game pop ups, scribbled screen text, is structured like levels in a video game, assembled from chunks of other films, and revels in the zombie genre's seductive blood-lust. In a very real sense, the film is what it critiques.The final interesting thing is the sudden surge of zombie movies (and the popularity of zombies in mass market video game shooters, books and television programmes, like 'Call of Duty: Zombies', 'Breathers: A Zombie's Lamet' and 'The Walking Dead'). Writer Annalee Newitz has chartered how war and social/political upheaval caused spikes in zombie movie production over the past century, but of course that's not surprising. The iconography of the 'zombie genre' has always effortlessly tapped into all kinds of primal feelings: mass fear, chaos, suffering, the whole Bolshevik class structure, mindless hordes distressing upper classes, issues of individualism, paranoia, overpopulation, disease, class anxiety, xenophobia etc. Mostly, though, zombie movies are therapeutic, our socially awkward heroes being granted the chance and excuse to kill their neighbours without guilt, unleashing their Id, ditch work, make their own rules, bash heads, ransack stores, lord over the world and of course indulge in a little attractive survivalism. Nothing else lets us confront our worst fears about our drive for self preservation than a good zombie movie.Most of all, though, what this new wave of zombie flicks is responding to is what Fukuyama and Nietzsche called 'The End of History' and 'The Last Man'. It's no coincidence that if one were to even briefly glance at the wikipedia 'list of zombie films', they'd see that over a hundred have been released in the first 10 years of the 21st century, whilst the other big rise in zombie movies occurred in the late 60s and 70s. Faced with the dead endedness of both postmodernism and techno-capitalism, these films reflect humanity's deepest unconscious desires; the desire for a great purge. The desire for change and progress. But more so, these films reflect humanity's inability to even imagine or conceive of a future. Faced with deadlock and incapable of tomorrow's conception, the zombie movie then exhibits nothing less than humanity's rage-filled 'beat the crap out of your neighbour and set the world on fire' frustrations.7.9/10 – Slick and very entertaining, but it's not as good as even Romero's worst Zombie flicks, lacking his thematic and allegorical weight. Makes a good companion piece to the low budget 'Stake Land' and 'Carriers'.",Null,1,2,6 December 2010
It's a Wonderful Life," I'll give you the moon, Mary.
","Directed by Frank Capra, 'It's a Wonderful Life' stars Jimmy Stewart as George Bailey, a young man living in the picaresque town of Bedford Falls. George has dreams of becoming an adventurer, of seeing the world and travelling to distant lands, but the impromptu death of his father forces him to become the manager of a local Building and Loan company instead. George takes this job to protect the inhabitants of his town from Mr Potter, a greedy banker who keeps local workers poor and unable to purchase housing.'Life's' first act watches as George matures, finds a wife and becomes a 'responsible' member of his community. He also saves the life of a boy who goes on to become a decorated war hero, and positively touches the lives of countless other locals. Though he doesn't realise it, George is a saviour; the world is a better place because he exists. More importantly, the Building and Loan company he operates functions as a means of staving off commercial banks. The latter operate for private profit, for their shareholders, and with the ultimate goal of accumulating everything in Bedford Falls. The former, at least in theory, to do the bidding of depositors.'Life's' final act finds George accidentally misplacing thousands of dollars. Fearing a scandal, he attempts suicide. A guardian angel then intervenes, at which point the film becomes a retelling of Dickens' 'A Christmas Carol'. Here George is shown how life in Bedford Falls would have unfolded had he not been around to protect its inhabitants. Shown that he positively influenced the world, and so purged of all regrets, George aborts his suicide. The town of Bedford Falls then magically rallies around George, donating thousands of dollars to help save his Building and Loan company.Aesthetically, 'Life' is a bit of a masterpiece. Snappy, carefully lit, and ambitious in the way it navigates time, the film also boasts beautiful Norman Rockwellesque sets. And then there's Jimmy Stewart. In another actor's hands, George Bailey would grate, but Stewart keeps Bailey lovable; a chirpy dude who chooses principles over personal desires and so whose life serves as a plea for social solidarity in times when fears make people selfish.On another level, however, Capra's film is devious as hell. Prayer, Christianity and 'good' communal banks are positioned on one side, and fat individualists, capitalists and 'bad banks' on the other. But George Bailey, the banker-populist who altruistically exists for community and for the working poor and who 'makes loans based on character and not credit', has always been a dangerous myth. Perhaps the best summation of this was made by director David Mamet in an issue of Sight and Sound: 'George is as close as Hollywood can get to the notion of an equitable distribution of wealth: the reliance upon a person of character in a position usually occupied by the heartless. In this praising of individual conscience, we thus indulge a peculiarly conservative ethos: enlightened or compassionate conservatism. Such may pass muster as wish-fulfilling entertainment, but as a political aim it can be adopted only by the self-deluded. For if the worker has no power to demand other than as an appeal to conscience, he or she has nothing. And so the memory of the war and of the Depression waned and America voted for Ronald Reagan. His administration, in the fulfillment of a conservative erotic dream, broke the back of labour, and the voter was induced to vote for fantasy. And it was in those Reagan years that 'Life' replaced 'Casablanca' as the unofficial Favourite Film of America - the fantasy of the compassionate conservative.' And so George becomes the type of hero common in John Ford's films. Never mind that replacing all banks with mutualistic Building Societies would still lead to poverty, unemployment, debts outpacing money in circulation and all the usual contradictions of capitalism. Never mind that, at every node of the network in even an idealistic world like Bedford Falls, value would still be reaped from the ignored energies of the low-paid, unpaid and natural resources, none of which appear in the accounting of production costs, but as invisible gains to capitalists. Never mind that George is essentially in the business of sub-prime lending and that if Bedford Falls didn't bail him out he'd have taken them down with him. No, like Ford's Judge Priest, George remains a beautiful impossibility; the upstanding, god-fearing, community-saving, benign wielder of power.And yet despite being goofy, overcooked and dumb, 'Life' remains one of Capra's smartest films. The film's visions of Pottersville - a banker's paradise in which communities are destroyed in the name of The Almighty Dollar – remain prophetic. Also smart is the way the film shows how money alters relationships (Pottersville even pushes women into prostitution), breeds monopolies and systematically devalues everything decent that cannot be monetised. Also clever are the film's narrators, angelic beings whose perspectives imply that George has no free-will. George himself feels as though he has been repeatedly forced to stay and live in Bedford Falls. What George comes to realise, however, is that he has been choosing all along; he hasn't been a victim of fate, but has been making a series of very precise moral choices. In a contemporary America in which the average net worth of someone in their 20s is negative 39,000 dollars, in which over 75 percent of the populace lives paycheck to paycheck (nevermind that over 80 percent of the planet lives, and must live, in poverty), these are all quite timely, and even philosophical, themes.8/10 – From Capra would spawn Disney and Spielberg and then a whole slew of films (Minnelli, Sirk, Lynch etc) which attempted to counter such idealized visions of 1940s/50s America.",Null,1,4,30 December 2016
Glory Road," I might be coach, but I always travel first class
","A well meaning but formulaic film, James Gartner's 'Glory Road' stars Josh Lucas as Don Haskins, head coach of Texas Western College. Based on a true story, and set in the late 1960s, the film details the formation of the NCAA's first all black starting lineup.At its best, 'Glory Road' explores issues of racism, discrimination and social isolation. At its worst, this is a reductive, by-the-numbers film whose climax assigns false triumph to ongoing issues. There's also something tawdry about a co-production between Jerry Bruckheimer and Walt Disney Pictures attempting to promote black consciousness and black pride.Still, 'Glory Road' sheds some light on an interesting part of history. It climaxes with a 1966 championship game, a game which would mark a key point in racial integration, and instigate a shift from basketball being labelled a white sport to it becoming a primarily black activity (in terms of race association and participation). 'Glory Road' co-stars Jon Voight as a weaselly rival coach.7/10 – See 'Inside Moves' and 'He Got Game'.",Null,0,0,25 April 2014
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," All's Well That Ends Well
","It's easy to appreciate a classic when it's established, but few appreciate an original work when it's new, let alone unpublished. Take 'Swann's Way'; Marcel Proust's masterpiece was rejected by every publisher and insulted by the major critics of his day. 'Dear friend: I may be thicker-skinned than most,' one publisher, introduced to Proust by a close acquaintance, said, 'but I just can't understand why anyone should take thirty pages to describe how he tosses about in bed because he can't get to sleep.' After countless rejections Proust eventually published 'Swann's Way' at his own expense. Today the novel is regarded as one of literature's finest works.The point is, the most difficult task for a critic is to appreciate an original work before it is established. Today Michael Bay is regarded as a hack by everyone, but tomorrow his reputation will change. For when the oceans rise, mankind develops gills, fins and the attention span of goldfish, Bay will be New Earth's Shakespeare.

Rosemary's Baby," That chalky under-taste
","'Hierarchy is often a way to do as efficiently as possible what ought not to be done at all; a machine for compelling people to do what they have no direct rational interest in doing, for the benefit of those with whom they have a fundamental conflict of interest.' - Ursula Le Guin Ira Levin specialised in Feminist horror novels. His 1972 novel, 'The Stepford Wives', for example, featured a housewife whose husband colludes with a cabal of men responsible for creating a fleet of submissive, female robots. Levin's 1967 novel, 'Rosemary's Baby', does a similar thing. Adapted by director Roman Polanski, it stars Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes as a young couple who move into a Gothic apartment complex (The Dakota, where John Lennon was shot).From the onset, Farrow's character, Rosemary Woodhouse, is portrayed as a docile American housewife. Meek and waifish, she's a doting stay-at-home woman who's entirely dependent upon her husband. Elsewhere men are portrayed as being controlling, manipulative and aggressive, whilst women are consigned to traditionally feminine realms (cooking, cleaning, jewellery, gardening, knitting etc), infantilized at the hands of a monolithic, male dominated society.One must remember that the 1960s featured many high profile debates on both abortion and the status of women as legitimate political and legal subjects. Women's movements were gaining momentum and were beginning to repeal abortion laws, fight for the right to self-determination, and seize control of the means of reproduction from a medical profession considered to be elitist and patriarchal. In this regard, Levin's novel took Rosemary and used her as a locus for a very specific culture war. It gathered numerous examples of patriarchal dominance (religion, the medical establishment, marriage etc) and featured them repeatedly vying for control of Rosemary's body. She was then bullied into passivity, subjected to outrageous coercion and eventually pushed into madness and paranoia. Rosemary was herself an agent of her own submission, the poor girl repeatedly rationalising her suffering as being 'all her fault'.Midway in both film and novel, Rosemary and her husband, the aptly named Guy, resolve to have a baby. But unbeknownst to Rosemary, Guy has made a Faustian pact with a Satanic couple living next door. In return for career advancements, he will turn Rosemary's body over to Satan so that she may be raped and so give birth to the Prince of Darkness. This, of course, is a perverse take on the Bible's Immaculate Conception (also featuring a Mary). The names of the devious neighbours (Roman and Minnie Castevet) themselves conjure up the other two men meta-controlling Rosemary: John Cassavetes and Roman Polanski himself.With at least 12 films overtly or covertly about rape, no mainstream film director has made more films 'about' sexual violation than Roman Polanski. Polanski would himself be charged with raping a 13 year old girl in 1977. In real life he seems to also have a sexual predilection for young girls and teenage actresses, though his films often sympathise with the rape victim (not always; at least 3 posit the 'rapist' as being unjustly bullied and/or victimised).In 'Rosemary Baby', of course, Rosemary is raped. There is some ambiguity surrounding this incident – Rosemary is either raped by her husband, given to Roman Castevet himself as a sexual favour or literally raped by Satan – but most readings have the same political subtext. Another reading sees Rosemary's persecutions as being 'imagined' and 'all in her head', her anxieties a result of her pregnancy, lapsed Catholicism and various domestic/maternal insecurities. The film supports this view, but accepting it turns the audience into villains, bullies equal to Guy and his neighbours. While horror movies routinely offer misogynistic repudiations of the maternal body, of the 'monsterous feminine' ('Alien', 'Jurassic Park' etc), and while, on the level of biology alone, the foetus is literally a parasite, separate from the mother's body, taking everything and contributing nothing to her sustenance, the film itself seems to be doing something completely else. Rosemary's paranoia is valid precisely because sexist social relations are clearly conspiring against her. Her doctors, various paternalistic authority figures, her husband, her neighbours, a male dominated medical profession...they're all colluding against Rosemary. It's another of Polanski's Kafkaesque conspiracy plots; the world really is out to get you.Significantly, characters are constantly telling Rosemary not to read books or outright removing books from her possession. Her apartment bookshelf is itself filled with books which Guy strategically keeps out of reach, namely Kinsey's reports, 'Listening with the Third Ear' and 'Yes I Can', all books on self-empowerment and self-understanding. The goal is to keep Rosemary dumb, dependent and isolated. And the only scene in which Rosemary is shown to mingle with female friends – boisterous feministas who rally to her defence – is precisely the scene which spurs Guy into revealing his sexism. 'Pain is a warning something isn't right,' Rosemary says, repeating the mantra of her proto-feminist sisters. But Guy shoots her down: 'don't listen to those bi**es!' Emancipation remains out of reach.The film's title has an ironic twang (Rosemary's 'baby' is not her baby, she didn't consent to its conception, indeed, Rosemary is herself the film's baby). Its aesthetic is Hitchcock meets New Hollywood, whilst the film itself serves as a perverse bridge from Old Hollywood to New, with many familiar faces from the Golden Age cast against type and given significant parts (Ralph Bellamy, Patsy Kelly, Sidney Blackmer, Ruth Gordon, Elisha Cook etc). Smoothly directed and misstepping only occasionally with some moments of comedy and overt 'gore', the film's still influential to this day. Emblematic of the film's impact, Farrow's pixie haircut still pops up in modern horror movies ('Birth', 'The Astronauts Wife' etc').8.5/10 - Classic.",Null,1,1,30 January 2013
Crazy Heart," Fun but formulaic. See Robert Duvall's 'Tender Mercies' instead
","'Crazy Heart' sees actor Jeff Bridges playing a washed up country singer with one last chance to salvage his career and make amends with his family, whom he abandoned a long time ago in favour for life on the road. Sounds familiar? The film has been compared to Darren Aronofsky's 'The Wrestler', but most people don't seem to realise that Aronofsky's film was itself a giant bag of clichés.What 'Crazy Heart' has going for it are a series of brilliant sequences in which Bridges mopes around dimly lit bars, chewing on tobacco, sucking on booze, flirting with 40 year old groupies and playing some fine country music. These moody scenes, somewhat detached from the film's formulaic plot, make you wish Bridges' character were in a different movie.When we're not in the pleasant company of musicians, barflies and bartenders, we're watching Bridges go through familiar plot beats. He hooks up with a young woman (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and her son, battles alcoholism, struggles to fit within the current market place, struggles to write new songs and has awkward telephone conversations with his long lost son. It's all very formulaic and contrived, the characters only very thinly sketched.Still, the film is magnificently acted, and other than its bar room shenanigans has 3 more good things going for it. Actor Colin Farrell turns up as a country singer and is given an interesting subplot, the film has several cute allusions to 'The Big Lebowski' (bowling alleys, the business with Bridges and the toilet, the names of characters etc), and contains several great singing and song-writing sequences.7.9/10 – A very formulaic film with another creepy relationship between a young woman and a much older man. Still, the film's worth watching for its atmosphere. For this plot done better, see 'Tender Mercies' with Robert Duvall, 'The Thing Called Love', Hal Ashby's 'Bound For Glory', Altman's 'Prairie Home Companion' and 'Nashville', 'Sweet Dreams', 'Songwriter', 'Coal Miners Daughter' and 'Be Here To Love Me: A Film About Townes Van Zandt'.Worth one viewing.",Null,0,1,28 January 2011
War of the Worlds," Spielberg's 'eye' of terror.
","James Cameron and Stephen Spielberg famously ushered forward the CGI revolution in the early 90's with films like 'Terminator 2' and 'Jurassic Park'. They set a trend, and since the late 90's we've been hit with one CGI adventure movie after the other.But Spielberg had his fun with his CGI dinosaurs, and soon moved on. While lesser directors scrambled onto the CGI bandwagon, churning out soulless nonsense like 'Resident Evil' and 'Tomb Raider', Spielberg changed gears and directed 'Saving Private Ryan', 'Minority Report', 'The Terminal', 'AI' etc. Argue about the quality of those movies all you want, but what I'm trying to get at is that this guy tries his best to stay ahead of the game. Ahead of the trends.'Saving Private Ryan' broke new ground. I think it's a bad film, but nevertheless, it now serves as a template for all future war movies. Look at 'Black Hawk Down'. Can you imagine it shot with the static feel of, say, 'Platoon'?So here we have 'War of the Worlds', and again we see Spielberg developing a new 'eye'. And that is what fascinates me most about this film. The camera stays fixed on Cruise and his family. We catch fleeting glimpses of the alien invaders and their war machines. The destruction and special effects whir by in the background, ominous and looming but never dominating the screen.Spielberg's camera is always running away, frantic, afraid to look at the destruction, panning away from the effects, terrified! And what's terrific is that this new eye suits the story.I suppose it was only a matter of time before a director decided to consciously play down special effects for dramatic purposes. Spielberg treats his CGI as though it isn't special. It doesn't hog the limelight. Instead we catch fleeting glimpses, too scared to look at the horror. Of course this filming style is not new. But like 'Ryan', no other movie has ever used this technique from start to finish with such intensity. Aisde from this 'eye', the movie is actually pretty standard. Instead of children hiding from Raptors in cupboards, we have Cruise hiding from invaders in basements. Spielberg handles the tension well, but its all stuff you've seen him and others do before.Like 'Jurassic Park', the human drama is slight and the characters are never believable, but this is a popcorn movie and so we don't demand such things. That Spielberg quickly sketches relatively three dimensional characters in such brisk time is admirable. And of course there are numerous iconic set pieces. The night sequences in particular have a nightmarish quality and the first hour is very engaging. The film's big flaw, however, is it's final act. Tom Cruise battles a Tripod in silly a 1 on 1 showdown, before the plot slowly fizzles into nothingness. Spielberg also misfires by choosing to show the alien invaders. His aliens are unimaginative and badly designed. But what do you expect? Here's the guy who couldn't resist showing us inside the UFO in 'Close Encounters'. Sometimes too much imagination denotes a lack of imagination.The choice to 'show' so much during the last act also goes against the aesthetic rules of the film. Early in the film, Robby runs up a hill yelling that he 'wants to see!' the battle on the other side. 'I need to see this!' he screams. His father holds him down and says 'I know it seems like you have to see this, but you don't!' Meanwhile all around them, extras run about chanting 'turn around!'. Spielberg acknowledges that his camera is always 'turned around', running from the creatures. The irony is that Spielberg, like Robby, isn't strong enough to hold himself back. By the final act, he loses strength and undoes all the brilliance he set up.Still, the camera work here is worthy of De Palma. I suspect within the next few years, everybody will be copying the style of this film. It will be interesting to see how Spielberg chooses to shoot his next movie.8/10 - Worth multiple viewings. Despite it's flaws, this is excellent popcorn fun. In the wake of 9/11 the film can also be read as another propagandistic Spielberg movie, America under attack by technologically advanced 'sleeper cell terrorists' buried within the homeland and waiting to strike. Thank God Spielberg didn't put beards on his aliens.Note: People complain that the 'red blood' sets at the end of the film are fake, but this is a homage to Menzies' expressionistic work on 'Invaders from Mars'. Those who hate the fact that Cruise's son lives, should see 'The Mist', Frank Darabond's brilliant re-imagining of Spielberg's film.",Null,635,1038,26 June 2005
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," Everybody do the iPod shuffle
","'Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist' is a routine romantic comedy in which an awkward guy (Michael Cera) falls in love with a sultry girl (Kat Dennings). They don't get along, they realise they have similar musical tastes, they fall in love, they have sex, the film ends. This formula - a giant male fantasy - is so pervasive, it's found in virtually every 'romantic movie', be it teen comedy or critically praised art-house fare.At least 'Playlist' has gorgeous ambiance, the film taking place exclusively at night, city lights, fluorescent bulbs and the low level hum of midnight traffic creating the kind of atmospheric backdrop Kar Wai Wong wishes he were able to cook up in 'My Blueberry Nights'.Comparison's to Kar Wai Wong's film are apt for another reason: both 'Playlist' and 'Blueberry' end with love scenes being 'captured' by technology in a world in which technology itself 'captures' art. In 'Playlist' we have the act of intercourse being unknowingly captured by a sound recording studio, love/sex being recorded as and likened to music. In 'My Blueberry Nights', however, we have kiss/love 'captured' by an overhead security camera, romance being recorded by and likened to cinema. Both films are thus about, not only a love of art, in which music and cinema become our soul mates, but love itself as 'art'. Love is always a kind of artistic performance, a desire first formed in the imagination, and always imported into the body from outside (often via the fantasies of song or screen).Unfortunately, other than the gorgeous mood director Peter Sollett instills (his earlier film, 'Raising Victor Vargas', was similarly beautifully shot), 'Playlist' is too clichéd to work. Perhaps the film would have played better had it satirized the kind of white-middle-class hipsters it tries to endear itself to. This is a film populated by kids who go out of their way to latch onto 'non-mainstream' fashion, alternative music and fringe clubs, all in a desperate attempt to be 'individual, man'. Observe how one character frets over being the first person to discover a particular band, how another wants a guy solely because she can't have him and another identifies with a boy simply because they have the same tunes on their iPod. Similarly, a trio of gays wear their homosexuality as a badge of non-conformity, whilst an entire city itself seems to be searching for the club in which a rare band is playing, not because they're any good, but simply because nobody knows where they are playing. This is romance reduced to fetishized designer labels, scarcity as commodity, uniqueness as social currency, every choice made based upon notions of being 'alternative'.7.9/10 – Like 'Adventureland', another recent sex comedy, superb ambiance is undermined by an unimaginative narrative.

You want the film to slow down and allow you to savour its sets, towns and frosty tundras, but Slade is preoccupied with second rate thrills.

There Will Be Blood," Quit drinking my milkshake
","'Rafflesia is a parasitic plant growing and feeding on other plants. It has the largest flower of all plants, but there is no biological explanation for its size, which could be many times smaller and still fulfil its function. The only explanation is that it's a product of luxury; a parasite doesn't have to economize.' - David AttenboroughPaul Thomas Anderson's 'There Will Be Blood', based on Upton Sinclair's satirical 'Oil!', stars Daniel Day Lewis as Daniel Plainview, an oil prospector whom we first see trudging through a Californian desert. He's alone, presumably searching for oil.Whilst Anderson's earlier films owned a large debt to Altman and Scorsese, 'Blood's' opening scenes strongly recall Kubrick ('2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'The Shining') and Herzog, specifically Herzog's 'Lessons of Darkness' (Anderson borrows several haunting musical cues from Herzog, along with creepy, silent shots of oil workers and oil wells).But 'Blood' quickly breaks away from these influences and becomes something else entirely. Anderson's film is preoccupied with elaborate con games, virtually every scene revolving around confidence tricksters, fraudsters and hucksters, be they of a religious, familial or corporate/capitalist nature. In short, this is a film exclusively about seeing and hearing, about knowing who to trust and who not to trust and about the absolute truth never residing in plain view.Savvy to such hucksters, because he is himself one, Plainview is a misanthropic, giant of a man. He isolates himself from mankind and seems disgusted by human beings; he sees through them. This hatred then fuels his budding empire, which he builds with lies and a callous disregard of others. Later he adopts a boy and uses the child to seduce villagers, advertising himself as a family man and trustworthy baron.'If I SAY I AM,' Plainview yells early in the film, 'YOU WILL AGREE.' It is clear he has a god complex. The name 'Daniel' itself means 'God's Judgement'. Indeed, Plainview doesn't explain himself to anyone. He sees himself as the final word over all things. Elsewhere he says that he wishes 'to rule and never explain himself', likens his own body to the 'Church of the Third Revelation' and threatens to slit the throats of all those who challenge him. 'Don't tell me how to raise my family!' he later yells. And when other oil barons mock him, he growls 'I TOLD YOU I WAS GOING TO DO IT.' Earlier, when told by a preacher to allow him to bless a new oil well, Plainview deliberately does the opposite, asserting his will over others.In short, nobody tells Daniel Plainview what to do. To harbour the will of mere men, he believes, is to deny his own greatness. Plainview even has the power to end the film. 'It is finished,' he says, the screen fading to black under his almighty spell. It is this ego-mania, that itself fuels his oil empire, his desire to extract, expand and crush the will of others.In a preacher called Eli Sunday, Planview eventually encounters some resistance. Eli, himself a confidence trickster, seeks to set up a church. While Plainview styles himself as a family man and benevolent oil baron, Eli styles himself as a faith healer, prophet and miracle worker. Of course both men are self serving con artists. The film then develops into a battle between capitalism (profit) and religion (prophet), or rather, one in which capitalism replaces the 'holy scripture' as the new religion, Plainview ('I have competition in me!') the triumphant, psychotic face of capital.Late in the film, Plainview's adopted son loses his hearing. Instead of using his voice, Plainview must now speak to his son through actions. But throughout the film Plainview's 'words' and 'actions' have been at odds. Now unable to raise his son in his image, Plainview thus sends the boy away. 'My blood does not run through him', he says, dismissing the boy, cutting all genetic links.Hilariously, when others chastise Plainview for sending the boy away, Plainview promptly brings the kid back and pretends to be a good father. This is not love. This is simply Plainview putting on yet another show in order to prove them wrong. He's feeding his own bruised ego.It eventually becomes clear that Plainview both hates mankind, wishing to remain aloof and above 'it', and secretly wishes to 'belong'. As such, he seeks 'blood' and 'family' to curb his loneliness (he only allows what he perceives to be the 'superior blood of family' to enter his circle, a kind of genetic monopoly akin to the way he runs his business). And so when another confidence trickster approaches Plainview, claiming to be his long lost brother, Plainview quickly welcomes the man into his circle. But though he initially lets his defences down and accepts this man, the truth gradually becomes apparent to Plainview. This man is a con artist and has taken advantage of him! 'Do I really have a brother?' Plainview asks, before shooting the man in the head.Plainview then seeks brotherhood in religion, but such hopes break down when Eli forces Plainview to confess in church. Here Eli wants to expose Plainview, but Plainview, of course, does not like being exposed. He is a snake who thrives on a certain invisibility. But now here he is, laid bare. This confessional scene is reversed toward 'Blood's' climax, where Plainview forces Eli to confess that he is a sham and a liar. This confession is not enough, though, and Plainview bludgeons the man to death with a bowling pin. The game ends and Plainview wipes out the last vestiges of competition.8.5/10 – Though it lacks the scope of Sinclair's novel, 'Blood' is a strong tale about pitchmen, be they carriers of Bibles or business cards.

The Bridge on the River Kwai," Jolly good show, chaps
","'We can teach these barbarians a lesson in Western methods and efficiency that will put them to shame! We'll show them what the British soldier is capable of doing!' - Colonel Nicholson 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' stars Alec Guinness as Colonel Nicholson, a British officer who has been captured by the Japanese Army and placed in a prison camp somewhere in western Thailand. The Japanese camp commander, Colonel Saito, orders Nicholson and his men to build a bridge across the river Kwai (in order for a rail-link connecting Bangkok and Burma to be completed) but Nicholson refuses.What follows is a battle of wills. The Japanese camp commander seeks to break Nicholson, turning him into a slave labourer. Nicholson, however, remains steadfast in his pride and dignity. A caricature of stiff-upper-lipped Brits, he's proud of the Empire, proud of British engineering, dutiful, cultured, and a stickler for rules, regulations and the Geneva Convention. If he is to be made a slave, then by God, he will do it with dignity! He will do it on his own terms! 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' was, of course, directed by David Lean, that master of location photography and beautiful compositions. In our CGI age, its refreshing to see a director who went to such extreme lengths to find great scenery. Lean, from this point onwards, would paint on an increasingly grand canvas.Though 'Bridge' works on an archetypal level, there are some nagging problems. Following WW2, the British and Americans suddenly needed to portray the Japanese as 'our allies'. After years of portraying them as screaming savages, Japan was now our new 'friend' in the 'war against communism'. They were needed as a bulwark to prevent the Russians from moving further southward and so efforts were made to paint them in a more 'friendly' manner. As a result, all Asians in 'Bridge' are portrayed in a ridiculously cartoonish light. They are all teary base commanders, resourceful peasants or big breasted sexy women who fall head over heels for American boys. The film's titular bridge itself eventually becomes a hokey symbol for uneasy cultures working together to bridge their differences because, 'someday, after this war, what we build here might help somebody.' Compare this to 'Hei Tai Yang 731', a Chinese film which documented the atrocities that the Japense army regiment of Camp 731 carried out on innocent Chinese and Russian families. Of course that film is merely propaganda from another perspective, but in its extremities it nevertheless highlights how absurd 'Bridge's' portrayals of camp life are; Lean's prison camps are far too homey.Strange too is Nicholson's comment that he 'refuses to work like a coolie'. 'Coolie' is a derogatory slang term used to describe Asian and Indian slaves or indentured workers. Today the term is still used in some Caribbean islands to describe West Indians brought over during the slave trade. The irony that Nicholson is condemning the Japanese for using the very same practises used by the British Empire is completely lost on Lean. Nicholson isn't a hero for 'retaining his humanity' and 'refusing to work like a coolie', he's a hypocrite.But still, the film works on a primal level. Why does everyone love a good prison break movie ('Cool Hand Luke', 'Shawshank', 'Papillon', 'Birdman of Alcatraz', 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest', 'The Great Escape' etc')? Probably because they're all thinly disguised existential tales centring on captured heroes who must break free, emancipating themselves from some phantom Order. Having escaped the constrictions of this immoral system, they achieve a kind of Nietzschean freedom or spiritual transcendence. It's all quite silly, but hits people on an archetypal, almost primal level.What's unique about 'The Bridge Over The River Kwai' is that there is no 'literal' freedom. Nicholson and his men don't escape the constrictions of the camp, rather, they change the camp to adhere to their own standards, their own 'British' way of life.At the end of 'Bridge', Nicholson and Saito stand on their bridge, and Nicholson remarks 'isn't this beautiful?' Saito nods, the duo sharing their only moment of agreement, though Lean subtly implies that Saito is really referring to the rising sun in the distance. One man sees beauty in British engineering, pride, duty, strength and solidarity, whilst the other quite literally sees beauty in the 'rising sun' of the Japanese Empire. With the bridge blowing up at the end of the film and Saito eventually dying, the film ends on what Lean has insisted is an 'anti-war note', suggesting that it is the 'madness of war' that keeps cultures apart. For Brit audiences, though, the film tends to fan the passions of patriotism.8/10 – An attempt to rewrite history, yes, but the film is nevertheless iconic, its characters have gravity and Lean in many ways invented huge chunks of cinematic grammar. We take his influence for granted now, but there are numerous little shots, compositions and trends in this film that Lean is responsible for starting. Worth two viewings.",Null,4,6,16 November 2009
Edge of Tomorrow," Come find me when you wake up
","'Groundhog Day' meets 'Starship Troopers' meets 'Saving Private Ryan' in 'Edge of Tomorrow'. Directed by Doug Liman, the film stars Tom Cruise as Major William Cage, a public-relations officer within the ranks of the United Defence Force. A cowardly military man whose main function is to give pep talks at press conferences, Cage suddenly finds himself incessantly repeating the same day. This day takes place during a terrifying alien invasion.What would you do if you were a coward forced to repeat, at the height of an alien invasion, the same day? Probably hide under a bed. But Cage is played by TOM FRICKIN' CRUISE, a ten inch matinée idol whose annual pass-time is SAVING THE PLANET. As such, Cage begins using his gift of immortality to kick alien butt. Like a video game avatar, Cage gains in skills and experience as he repeatedly dies, re-spawns and re-embarks out into his game world. His objective? Reach that big 'bonus level' which, when conquered, ends the game and so the invasion.'Edge of Tomorrow' pretends to be science fiction, but isn't really. The film's aliens are mostly unimaginative, and its action derivative. Because Cruise and Liman play things for laughs, though, the film works well. Like Cruise's best vehicles, 'Edge' is self-depreciating, Cage emasculated and ridiculed for much of the movie. Even when Cage becomes superhuman, Liman is busy acknowledging the ridiculousness of the usual Hollywood heroics. Elsewhere the film draws from other fictional and historical sources. A character played by Brendan Gleeson evokes Winston Churchill, for example, the film's central battle recalls WW2's Operation Overlord, and various characters recall 'Platoon' and 'Full Metal Jacket'. Bill Paxton even shows up as a soldier, recalling his role in James Cameron's 'Aliens'.Whilst 'Edge of Tomorrow's' aliens are wholly generic, Liman does manage one interesting idea. His aliens are feigning a weakness so as to sucker Earth into launching a single offensive operation (a bit like the Emperor's plan in 'Return of the Jedi'). Once all of humanity's forces are committed, and in the same location, the aliens then spring their trap. This United Defence Force operation, which Cage participates in, mostly consists of humans bouncing about in (Heinlein/anime inspired) exo-suits.Like 'Groundhog Day', 'Edge of Tomorrow's' second half revolves around an odd romance. Here Emily Blunt plays Sergeant Vrataski, a svelte woman who helps Cage slay xenomorphs. One touching moment finds Cage admitting to Vrataski that he's 'never been able to get further in the game' and 'have her survive as well'. This is an interesting piece of drama - Cage forced to choose between saving the planet and saving his sultry co-star – which a better director would have milked, but nope. Liman ditches the idea and quickly moves on to his next set piece. As a result, the film's attempts at romance are mostly ineffectual. Based on Hiroshi Sakurazaka's 'All You Need is Kill.' 7.9/10 – Worth two viewings.",Null,2,6,27 August 2014
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Sweet Lincoln's mullet!
","'Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy' stars comedian Will Ferrell as Ron Burgundy, a San Diego news anchor who has a big moustache. Why does he have a big moustache? Because big moustaches are funny. Why is his name Burgundy? Because Burgundy sounds ridiculous. Who works with Ron? How about a weatherman. Make that a 'legally retarded' weatherman who likes lamps. Who else? A sportscaster called Champion. Make his surname Kind. Champion Kind. The dumber the name the better.The rest of 'Anchorman' proceeds along similarly improvisational lines, its cast and crew essentially making ridiculous stuff up as they go along. The film was so loose and improvisational that an entirely new film ('Wake Up Ron Burgundy: The Lost Movie') was assembled from its unused footage. As Farrell and his fellow troupe of comedians embrace absurd non-sequiturs, in which different stupid lines, words and jokes are randomly offered up for each take, the film's director, Adam McKay, found himself confused as to what comedic material to include in his final film.'Anchorman', whose anarchic tone is undermined by its formulaic plot, works best in its giddily nonsensical sequences, in which characters randomly break into song, combat, walk about with erections or kick dogs off bridges. Elsewhere it works thanks to a long parade of recognisable faces (Jack Black, Seth Rogen, Danny Trejo, Vince Vaughn, Luke Wilson, Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins, Paul Rudd, Steve Carell), most of whom pop up, say wacky stuff and then disappear. The film was a sleeper hit and has become a cult favourite with certain people. Its title - 'Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy' - recalls the titles of famous picturesque novels of the eighteenth and ninth century ('The Adventures of Roderick Random', 'The Luck of Barry Lyndon', 'The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle', 'The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha'), all of which were downright ridiculous. Ferrell's no Dickens, though. While those novels aim at satire, Ferrell's films salivate over ultra ridiculousness. His characters are big goof-balls, macho men completely unaware of how moronic they really are. 'Anchorman's' plot (it's set in the 1970s, when feminism marched into the newsroom) itself deals with a group of men (and a predominately male oriented profession) being 'shown up' by a single hard-working, dedicated woman.In this regard, all the men in the film are posturing, peacocking, competitive idiots who ooze a testosterone infused vapidity. Into their midsts steps Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate). She's part of the rising tide of women's liberation, her presence highlighting a blustering, clueless masculinity, and various male misconceptions about women ('Why don't you go back to your home on whore island!', various hilarious deleted jokes about the way men misunderstand menstruation etc). The film's director, Adam McKay, is responsible for the only other political Ferrell flick thus far, 'The Other Guys', though both are more interested in broad jokes than satire. Whether one finds this type of humour intolerable or funny depends largely on one's blood alcohol levels.7.9/10 - Worth two viewings.

American Gangster," Dumb and derivative
","Like Martin Scorsese's 'crime epics', Ridley Scott's 'American Gangster' fakes insights into the world of crime. Mistaking 'autobiography' for depth, and even truth, Scott's film is mostly a stylistic exercises, a vapid film cobbled together from, bits and pieces of other films.Indeed, in our post 'The Wire' world, virtually all postmodern 'gangster flicks' reveal themselves to be, not only entirely vacuous, but without any real world relevance. Most would be far more honest had they embraced the dishonesty of, say, Tarantino's 'Pulp Fiction'.So while Scorsese cribbed from the machine gun operas of the 1930s and 40s, Scott steals from the blaxploitation and rugged antihero crime movies of the 1970s. The result is a slick but soulless copy of such crime films as 'Super Fly', 'Across 110th Street', 'Black Caesar', 'Serpico', 'French Connection', 'Crime Story' and 'Prince of the City'.Not only is 'American Gangster' wholly derivative, but it is about as edgy as a Walt Disney fairy tale. Denzel Washington, who plays crime lord Frank Lucas, tries desperately to create an iconic character, but a poor script ensures that he embodies nothing but clichés. Every line of dialogue, every decision, every gesture he commits, oozes derivation. Spouting lines like 'Either you're somebody or you ain't nobody!', 'This is my home. This is America!', 'The most important thing in business is honesty, integrity, hard-work and family!', the too-suave-to-be-a-thug Denzel Washington comes across as a back-to-front amalgamation of Don Corleone and Tony Montana, dumb wisdom and genteel thuggery wrapped up in chocolate frosting.But then, every character in this film has been cynically designed by committee. We have Russel Crowe (doing a bad 'Starsky and Hutch' impersonation) as the typical 'good cop with a messed up family life', on the hunt of Washington's Frank Lucas, a gangster (and family man!) who goes through the motions and adheres to familiar gangster trajectories. 'Character development' in both cases simply constitutes revealing both characters to be womanizers, as if this somehow 'greys' them, makes them more nuanced.Scott's films rarely say anything, but this one is particularly dumb. We get the typical 'crime doesn't pay' message and the lip service to unattainability of the American Dream, whilst the one interesting theme of the film – the delayed victory of black capitalism – is quickly jettisoned. Better to treat Lucas' life as satire, a grotesque parody of market warfare, or take things seriously and examine why his rise coincided with the 1960s or how his cartel affected the black community. Heck, why not glorify the guy and treat his life as a viable and morally defensible career opportunity? Faced with the choice of either going to Vietnam and fighting for Uncle Sam or staying at home and selling cocaine, cocaine seems like a far better option. There are so many interesting avenues you can take this material, but Scott has always been devoid of any kind of world view.But even as mindless entertainment, the film fails. Scott's 'violent scenes' are supremely self-conscious, cynically injected into the film solely to titillate. This is calculated violence, rarely flowing organically from the film's plot. Similarly, the film's 'cat and mouse' plot never ignites, its urban aesthetic can't touch Lumet, Frankenheimer, Ray, Mann or Friedkin, and the script never surprises.The early 1990s offered a boom in 'black gangster' flicks, films like 'New Jack City', 'Tales From The Hood', 'Straight Out of Brooklyn', 'Dead Presidents', 'Juice', 'Clockers', 'Boys In The Hood', 'Menace 2 Society' all popping up on cinema screens. None of these films are great, but they're all better than Scott's glitzy junk.4/10 – With his distinct visual style, director Ridley Scott has spent his career conning people into mistaking his auterism for artistry. You want 70s grit done today, watch 'Harsh Times' or 'Street Kings'. Otherwise, steal a 'The Wire' box-set. Worth one viewing.",Null,1,3,9 September 2010
The Mission," Skip the movie, buy the soundtrack album
","Missionaries, slave traders, and colonizers mingle in this dishonest, naive and simplistic tale, in which a band of monks defend Native Indians from marauding Europeans in 18th Century South America. The film oozes the kind of bourgeois anger of Oliver Stone, beating us over the head with 'messages' and placating us with nice cinematography, romantic primitivism and cosy Christianity. The film was produced by David Puttnam, a guy who specializes in making films which pretend to say the right thing (indictments of injustices), but actually say the reverse. Take 'Chariots of Fire', a film about social biases and anti-Semitism which everyone remembers instead for hunky, blonde haired runners running majestically in slow motion. Puttnam's films consistently seem to say the right things, whilst actually reinforcing something else, and so it's no surprise that 'The Mission' bashes Colonialism, but not if it's done right and not if we forget that European religious enterprise was just as guilty as Portugal, France, Spain and England's economic apparatus in spreading disease, havoc, death, famine and political self renunciation.Some complain that the film shows little interest in the Indians and focuses instead on three Christian martyrs, but such is the norm. What's really annoying is the way the villains of this picture sanction the overthrowing of missions and tribes whilst constantly professing, through various monologues and conversations, that they knew better. That they knew what they were doing was wrong and would have ramifications.All bad historical message movies do this, neglecting to 'show' the causes of history/behaviour 'at the time' in favour for characters who impossibly possess a very modern vantage point which allows for false reflections and reconciliation. It's the Ridley Scott, Stephen Spielberg, Edward Zwick style of history.Still, if one is willing to bathe in pretty signs and sounds, be distracted by money (ie expensive location photography) and switch off one's brain, there are several good things on display. Jeremy Irons and Liam Neeson play a pair of affecting Jesuit priests, Robert De Niro at times looks handsome (this is where he stopped acting), Ennio Morricone's score is divine and the film possesses 3 sublime scenes. These three scenes are worth suffering through the film.6.5/10 – Worth one viewing. See Pontecorvo's 'Burn!' instead.",Null,0,3,20 December 2010
Jaws," I'll see you on the beach
","'Violent, nasty, crude. There was nothing in the picture (Jaws) that was personal to me. It was a calculated movie. I made each cut with glee, knowing the effect that it would have on the audience. I don't ever want to be involved in another picture like that.' – Steven SpielbergBeginning with point of view shots of a 'killer' stalking a group of naked teens, 'Jaws' is part of a group of slasher flicks released in the 1970s and late 60s ('Black Christmas', 'Targets', 'Blood Feast', 'Psycho', 'Birds', 'Halloween', 'Peeping Tom', 'Chainsaw Massacrew', copious zombie flicks, 'Scream Bloody Murder', 'Silent Night, Bloody Night' etc).Like many of these films, 'Jaws' is at times a cruel, dehumanising film, focusing entirely on relentless audience manipulation. Take, for example, the difference between Pal's 'War of the Worlds' and Spielberg's 2005 remake. The difference between the two films is that Spielberg identifies with the aliens, just as he identifies with the shark which terrorises tourists in 'Jaws'. Spielberg is the shark/alien/camera trying to scare the wits out of us. Nothing else engages his interests.Many filmmakers operate in an imaginative space somewhere between artist (giving formal expression to his/her ideas and feelings) and entertainer. Spielberg, however, is entertainer incarnate. Yet he is a curiously joyless, sadistic entertainer, always holding in severe check emotions of his own that he doesn't trust. This results in the saccharin and sentimental quality of his films. Films that rely on bogus feelings rather than searching out and expressing genuine emotions.Unsurprisingly, two of Spielberg's great loves are John Ford and Alfred Hitchcock. Spielberg is like a hybrid of the two, the reactionary tendencies of Ford merged with the gleeful sadism of Hitch, with a little Capra hypocritically thrown in as penance. In one scene in 'Jaws', music from Ford's 'The Quiet Man' is played, whilst elsewhere Spielberg hits us with Hitchcock's 'Vertigo Zoom'. The film's all-male hunt against an unseen enemy further recalls Ford's 'The Lost Patrol', whilst its elaborate last act recalls 'Lifeboat'. And of course 'Jaws' is a virtual remake of 'Creature from the black Lagoon', from which it takes its famous 'duh duh duh' musical score, as well as numerous scenes, shot for shot. But most of all, 'Jaws' beats the path of 'The Godfather', a film that pioneered, in Hollywood, the pornographic technique of manipulating the audience into a state of delighted anticipation of each subsequent but oh-so-artful act of violence.Prior to 'The Godfather', Hollywood films generated, or at least tried to generate, concern for their vulnerable characters. With 'Jaws', though, Spielberg appeals instead to the basest elements in our nature; in his hands, we cannot wait for the shark to claim another victim. Indeed, beginning with 'Jaws', Spielberg made cold-hearted audience manipulation, in various guises, his signature track. Since then, the whole way in which popular entertainment operates has coarsened, the social and political consequences of which have been enormous. Of course Spielberg was simply part of an emerging trend. The true model for the cold-blooded cinema that 'Jaws' exemplifies can be found in another time and place. The Third Reich created the approach; in its propagandistic works, audiences were encouraged to savour each new incidence of derision and abuse that befell Jewish characters.Thematically 'Jaws' is light (the shark's effects on local trade are quickly dismissed in favour of mechanical thrills). Where the film excels, where it breaks away from the 50's monster and 70's slasher genre, is in its masterful final act. Here, the haunted house goes out to sea in search of the slasher, our adventurers picked off 'Halloween' style (with the genre's obligatory false-deaths) before a Moby Dick modelled showdown.It is here where the film's characters - police chief Brody, goofy marine biologist Hooper and Quint (Robert Shaw), an Ahab-like fisherman who is obsessed with slaying the beast – develop. The last of these, Quint, is given a long histrionic speech, written by John Milius, in which he reminisces about a WW2 experience that plunged him into shark-infested waters (the passage links the film to pulpy movies of the 1950s, where atomic energy upsets Nature). Spielberg's inability to keep a reign on his older actors (Shaw was frequently drunk) and the input of Milius' pen (the rest of the film was written by Benchley, Gottlieb and Spielberg) created a mutiny of sorts, the result being the most well-drawn characters in Spielberg's filmography.Ultimately, though, 'Jaws' is a middle class, cosy version of 'Moby Dick'. The monster cathartically dies (Melville's whale survives), Quint is killed, and post-War virtues survive, Brody doggy-paddling back to his wife and family. Like 'Deliverance' we are offered versions of threatened manhood, only here, Quint, a self-reliant, working-class, antiquated, thoroughly sexist, ruthless, raunchy and mad figure, is seen to be the anachronism. Quint is too powerful, too independent of traditional social ties, too prone to excess, too much a symbol of bourgeois independence, as dangerous to the social fabric of Amity's comfortable 'liberalism' as the shark itself, and so he is cast aside.In Spielbergland, paternal authority must always be restored, but not by Quint. Hopper and Brody on the other hand, are the mirror images of Quint. They are symbols of technology, genteel, inherited wealth, whilst the shark ultimately becomes another Spielbergian guarantor of domesticity. Be it dinosaurs, aliens, terrorists, Nazis, sharks, trucks, Germans, slave-traders or pirates, Spielberg's 'monsters' are all symbols of paternal/national duty. Slay the beast for country and family, and all will be well. Family values, patriarchy, a kind of middle-class submissiveness, must always be restored. And this is the offencive thing about all of Spielberg's films: the absolute insistence on taking on the responsibilities of fatherhood, and thus restoration of a 1950s nuclear family, as an unquestionable and totally redemptive gesture. 8.9/10 - Worth multiple viewings.",Null,4,8,4 June 2010
The Wrestler," Elephant Man
","'In the 'eroticised' body, it is the social function of exchange which predominates. The erotic is never in desire, but in signs.' - Jean Baudrillard '90s sucked.' – The Ram 'The Wrestler' is a generic but somewhat affecting sports flick about a washed up wrestler who returns to the ring. What's most interesting about the film, though, are the parallels director Darren Aronofsky draws between wrestler Randy 'The Ram' Robinson and Cassidy, the ageing stripper he's infatuated with.Both Randy and Cassidy exploit flesh; he exploits his body and various violent impulses in order to make his living as a wrestler, she exploits her body and various sexual impulses in order to make her living as a stripper. Randy is glorified (or glorifies himself) as the masculine ideal in his profession and Cassidy is glorified (or glorifies herself) as the feminine ideal in her profession, both characters spending inordinate amounts of time 'maintaining' their appearances (Randy is always shaving his chest and armpits, dying his hair etc).Relics of the 1980s, both characters walk about today like left-over produce from the West's decade of decadence. Both are heavily reliant on superficial consumer ideas of gender, entertainment and fantasy, and both are caught in the trap of constantly maintaining what Baudrillard calls 'flesh capital', in which everything from sexual performance to self-objectification is a form of work, duties that must be undertaken and perfected if one is to advance themselves. All social relations, in other words, all spheres of human life, become objectified under capitalism, the subject now 'subject as sign', responsible for advertising and marketing his own body (see Soderbergh's 'The Girlfriend Experience').Eventually Cassidy and Ram realise that they can no longer give their bodies over to the generation of affect. They're outdated commodities, Ram linked to cheap 99 cent store aluminium and tacky toys from the 80s (which fail to impress 'modern' kids), whilst Cassidy discovers that she's not as desirous to her customers anymore. They want younger strippers, not a single mother well into her forties.In a sense – and I seriously doubt Aronofsky intended this - Ram and Cassidy represent a very 21st century 'reliance' on both planned obsolescence and creeping featurism. Philosopher Vance Packard divides planned obsolescence into two sub categories, obsolescence of desirability (or psychological obsolescence) and obsolescence of function, both of which are tactics used by marketers to either wear out a product in the mind of its owner or to construct a product with a short shelf life. Packard calls this 'the systematic attempt of business to make us wasteful, debt-ridden, permanently discontented individuals.' Having long been 'phased out' by the market, Ram's body exhibits a sort of grotesque desperation. Always visiting tanning salons or getting his roots dyed, he is an odd combination of buffness and prettiness, the ghoulish result of a consumer society that valorizes only youth, usefulness and beauty.Cassidy, who spends much of the film semi-nude, is also a gargoyle of sorts, clinging desperately to the signifiers of sex and worth. Of course there's also some self-reference in the film's casting: Marisa Tomei, who plays Cassidy, is herself an ageing actress who has to drop her clothes and drum up 'naked publicity' in order to 'further/promote her career', whilst actor Mickey Rourke, who like 'The Elephant Man' navigates this film like a heart-string tugging special effect monster, is himself a Botox injected Hollywood freak with his own tinsel town come-back story. Would this film work if we didn't all know Mickey Rourke's personal history? I don't think so. One irony is that his character is only very thinly sketched in the film: it is the media and the Hollywood publicity machine which imbues his character with its 'soul' and 'history'.Midway in the film, following a heart attack, Ram stops wrestling and starts working in a meat deli. He moves from a piece of meat to a seller of meat, from a subject-as-object to a pusher of product. Significantly, it is now that he has to wear a name-tag with his real name, Robin Ramzinski. But he resents wearing this name and prefers to go by the title 'Ram', a direct contrast to Cassidy, who prefers to be known as 'Pam', a mother struggling to raise a boy alone. In other words, Robin embraces his identity as a performer whilst Cassidy rejects it.The film ends with The Ram returning to the wrestling ring – against his doctor's orders – and 'going out in a blaze of glory'. Whether this is a melancholic or triumphant ending is left up to the audience. On one hand, one can view the film's climax as an admittance that unless The Ram is selling his body and soul to the ring, he has nothing. With this depressing reading, The Ram has no life outside the box, and so when the audience applause dies, when the money ceases to come in, he dies as well, spiritually if not physically. On the other hand, one can look at The Ram's beaten body (the film's packed with hokey Christ metaphors) as the victorious body of labour. By making his body the very product of his labour (literally, a sacrificial ram), Randy liberates himself, he thinks, from the system in which he sells his body to others. Marxist philosopher Gyorgy Lukacs called this, somewhat romantically, the 'artist' or 'virtuoso' persona; even when you can't escape being defeated by your class, you can, in theory, take control by exploiting your labour by making your body your own product.7.9/10 – Though marketed as an indie flick, 'The Wrestler' is pure Hollywood. Despite its R-rating and grungy camera work, its as sugary as Ron Howard's 'Cinderella Man', filled with the usual genre stereotypes, contrivances and 'one last shot/blaze of glory' clichés. See: 'Requiem for a Heavyweight', 'Somebody Up There Likes Me', 'Raging Bull', 'The Hustler', 'Body And Soul' and 'This Sporting Life'.",Null,0,0,27 August 2010
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," In a hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit
","John Tolkien wrote 'The Hobbit' in 1937, an epic adventure set in the mythical world of Middle Earth. Director Peter Jackson would adapt the novel in 2012, turning it into a series of three feature films.The first film in the series, 'An Unexpected Journey' (2012) stars Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo's a hobbit, a pint-sized creature with giant feet. Bilbo joins a band of dwarfs, a funny group of bearded warriors led by King Thorin (Richard Armitage). Thorin's journeying to Erebor, where a giant dragon, Smaug, lords over an ancient dwarf kingdom. Thorin wants to reclaim this kingdom. To do so, he must kill Smaug.Tolkien's dwarfs, borne of twelve tribes, each banished from the same homeland, were inspired by the Israelites of the Old Testament. Conforming to old Jewish stereotypes, they are thus greedy, big-nosed and obsessed with money, gold and meticulous bookkeeping. These are attributes which hobbits, good natured and humble, do not possess. Indeed, Bilbo was assigned to this quest by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) precisely because hobbits are less prone to the temptations that befall others.Nothing much happens in 'Journey'. Despite its gargantuan running time, the film simply watches as our heroes amble from point A to B. Along the way they randomly encounter various monsters, whom they battle or flee. Like Jackson's original 'Lord of the Rings Trilogy', the film's plot mostly feels like an excuse to pile one battle or sub-quest upon the other. As this is what epic fantasy literature has essentially always been like, and as Jackson obviously adores his source material, the film's arbitrariness never becomes too troublesome. Jackson's touch is mostly light, playful and personal.'Journey' ends with Bilbo discovering a magical ring. This ring, created by the Dark Lord Sauron, was designed to corrupt the inhabitants of Middle Earth and so push the world into utter chaos. With Middle Earth's various factions at war with one another, Sauron hopes to descend, conquer and reign supreme.The second film in the series, 'The Desolation of Smaug' (2013) opens with our heroes fleeing Sauron's goblin armies. The film's thin plot once again finds our heroes battling arbitrarily conjured up CGI monsters. Assisting them are a group of elves, led by the elf warriors Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom). Essentially vain fashion models, elves look down upon all other creatures in Middle Earth. Scratch their pompous facades, though, and the elves reveal a compassionate and sacrificial streak. With the grace of ballerinas and the combat skills of Jackie Chan, Legolas and Tauriel risk life and limb for our heroes.'Desolation' is packed with cool sequences. Jackson treats us to a battle with giant spiders, an escape from an elf encampment and finally a journey into Laketown. A cross between Venice and a Medieval village, Laketown brims with fun set design. Here our heroes meet Bard the Bowman (Luke Evans), a member of a human tribe ravaged by the dragon Smaug. 'Desolation' climaxes with Bilbo and his buddies journeying into Erebor and confronting Smaug, who sleeps upon mountains of gold. Awesomeness ensues.The last film in the series, 'The Battle of the Five Armies' (2014) finds King Thorin retaking Erebor, only to find human and elf armies at his doorstep, all demanding their fair share of the treasures stored within. As King Thorin is a greedy jerk who increasingly craves power and wealth, Thorin refuses to listen to their demands. When dwarf reinforcements arrive, complete with hilarious Combat Pigs and Multi-Purpose Armoured Mountain Goats, Thorin feels he has the military forces necessary to safeguard his selfishness. His confidence doesn't last long; Sauron has also sent a mighty army to conquer Erebor. God dammit Sauron.At its best, 'Five' portrays Middle Earth as a feudal hellhole in which different tribes fight petty battles for land and gold. Gandalf, the wise wizard, wants Middle Earth's citizens to band together, to share, to unite against Sauron, but suspicions, greed and quasi-racist animosities keep elves, humans and dwarfs apart. In the end, it is the humility of the hobbit, a bizarre interspecies love affair between elf and man, coupled with Gandalf's subtle scheming, which draws the inhabitants of Middle Earth together. They're tentatively united in a kind of pluralistic, multi-ethnic mega-army. But as Tolkien was a bit of a nutty Christian, his material's critiques of 'power', 'corruption' and 'greed' nevertheless ultimately boil down to a kind of Biblical apocalypticism. The solution is always mass murder, killing is glorified, and conflict is always a Manichaean thing in which the good guys struggle against the bad guys (the hyena riding goblin slaves, the violent Easterlings, the elephant riding Haradrim, all with racial connotations which Jackson mostly softens), who must be exterminated as they are innately evil creatures who differ in appearance, behaviour and opinions.Aesthetically, Jackson's trilogy is spectacular. Jackson offers some serious mountain porn, turns cross-country hiking into a Wagnerian spectacle and his FX work is at times impressive. It takes a certain type of genius to adapt Tolkien in a manner that isn't ridiculous.On the downside, Jackson's battles too often neglect more interesting political and tactical jousting in favour for bad CGI rag-dolls and endless hack and slashing. With mega-worms and giant troll catapults at your disposal, why focus on repetitive sword-fights? Considering the length of Jackson's Tolkien outings, it's also amazing how empty his characters are. With Jackson, there are never any substantial relationships or conversations, love affairs are unconvincing, friendships are exclaimed but never seen, and all the film's 'human drama' is treated as perfunctory filler. What the films mostly care about is running and carnage. Escaping these tendencies are Gandalf and the hobbits. Epitomising a kind of Arendtian 'banality of goodness', Jackson highlights their ordinariness, their lowliness, their lack of possessions and ambition, which makes them uniquely suited to assuming positions of the highest responsibility and power.8/10 - See 'Ran' (1985).",Null,4,10,26 January 2015
Defiance," Hollowing the Holocaust
","Edward Zwick, like Steven Spielberg, constantly mistakes 'history' for 'serious art'. His new film, 'Defiance' (aka 'Jews Strike Back'), centres on a small group of Jewish rebels who mobilised and fought against the Nazis during WW2, wreaking divine justice on Hitler's henchmen like a gang of Yiddish superheroes. While the film fails as both action movie and historical piece, it is mildly interesting in the way it aligns itself with Hollywood's current trend of re-branding and repackaging the Jew.Over the past 6 years, the portrayal of Jews in cinema has drastically changed. With films like 'Munich', 'Defiance', 'Don't Mess with the Zohan' and 'Inglorious Bastards', we're seeing the Jewish identity shift from feeble, perpetual victims (the bespectacled scholarly Jew) to technocratic ministers of death (vengeful warriors of God). It's like a weird shift from New Testament to Old Testament values.This growing empowerment itself reflects Israel's national switch from victims to oppressors. Gaza, a middle Eastern version of the Warsaw ghetto, is now a calculated experiment in provocation. When you squeeze one million Palestinians into a walled space, stifle their access to water, electricity, food and medical treatment, destroy their livelihoods, mock and debase them regularly, don't act surprised when they turn hostile.But of course hostility is what you want. With the emergence of violence you can then play the role of victim, bringing out your helicopter gunships, your tanks and missiles and beating the battered remains of Palestinian infrastructure into non-existence. With no infrastructure, no education, no social services or amenities, you can then further deny the existence of a Palestinian Government. Afterall, how can you have a government when there is nothing to govern? And so the rag-tag Palestinian leaders are labelled 'terrorists', an act which permanently shuts down all hope of political exchange, freeing Israel to 'claim' yet more and more land, expanding outward in the name of, not God, but Hegemony.Even if one ignores Israel's role in US politics and in its actual and attempted maneuvers in various Middle Eastern countries (Lebanon, Iran etc), it is clear that Israel has become a force to be reckoned with. It is now armed with the deadliest, most technologically advanced military in the region, and so is perhaps finally comfortable enough to flex its muscles. Today's archetypal Jew, cinema or otherwise, answers to no one and defiantly does as pleases.This change, though, has been taking place over a number of decades. Israel never had any intention of allowing a sovereign Palestinian state on its borders. It had no intention of allowing it in 1948 when it grabbed 24 per cent more land than what it was allotted legally, had no intention of allowing it throughout the massacres and ploys of the 1950s, had no intention of allowing two states when it conquered the remaining 22 per cent of historic Palestine in 1967 (and reinterpreted UN Security Council Resolutions to its own liking), had no intention of acknowledging Palestinian national rights at the United Nations in 1974, and had no intention of working toward a two-state solution in 1978 or 1982 when it invaded, fire-bombed, blasted and bulldozed Beirut (so that it might annex the West Bank without hassle).Couple that with Israel's deliberate support of Hamas (so that it might undermine the strength of the more secular-nationalist factions), and you have a country which has slowly been casting aside the role of victim. The result: Hollywood's 'new Jew', vengeful, deadly, armed and mad as hell.And of course, Daniel Craig, the blonde haired, blue eyed James Bond of 'Munich', will personify this sexy new Jew. Hollywood has always had an aversion to the fact that most Jews in the region are dark skinned.And so the core problem with Zwick's 'Defiance' is that in reversing the historical stereotype of Jewish passivity, the film ends up affirming them. 'Defiance' implies that only if more Jews had been tough warriors and fought against the Nazis, then more Jews would have survived. This has the unintentional effect of making the timidity of the Jews, rather than the barbarity of the Nazis, the centre of the Holocaust. Like the heroes of the film, the Jewish ideal is now that of the survivor who not only stands up to victimization, but takes the fight back to those who deny his power. 'Defiance' celebrates strong men (who in real life sought no glory) at the expense of those whose inability to fight back was NOT a moral failure but a fact of history. This trivialises the Holocaust, and paints a wholly untruthful picture.4/10 – There have been a glut of Holocaust movies recently ('The Counterfeiters', 'The Reader', 'Valkyrie', 'Good', 'The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas' and Paul Schrader's weird 'Adam Resurrected').

Sherlock Holmes," The Baker Street irregulars
","'All emotions were abhorrent to him. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world had ever seen.' - The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1892) Guy Ritchie directs 'Sherlock Holmes', a fast, funny, but completely disposable 're-imagining' of Arthur Conan Doyle's iconic private detective. For a better update of Sherlock Holmes see 1998's 'Zero Effect', which stars Bill Pullman as our detective and features a plot that is unofficially based on 'A Scandal in Bohemia', an early Holmes classic. Hardcore Holmes fans regard the film highly, but not many know of it. See too 'They Might be Giants', an underrated take on Holmes from 1971.Still, Ritchie's film has some things going for it. It's a surprisingly under-lit blockbuster, Ritchie using muted, murky, messy lighting to simulate the grungy tone of late-1800s Britain. And of course Robert Downey Jr plays this incarnation of Holmes, the actor bringing a frenetic, schizophrenic timbre to the Great Detective.In terms of plot, this is mostly junk. Ritchie's script is lazy and cheats often, Holmes magically solving problems, deus ex machinas whimsically conjured up and our heroes figuring out ridiculously complex problems simply because their screenwriters will closure into fruition. In Ritchie's defense, this is exactly how most Holmes tales functioned. Interestingly, while your typical detective story ends with a coda in which the hero 'explains' and 'ties together' the story the audience has just watched/read, Ritchie's 'Sherlock Holmes' is packed with miniature mysteries within the main mystery which are 'solved' using similar flashback/flash-forward devices. The film thus offers a 'heightened' form of your typical detective walk-through.The film's villain is Lord Blackwood, a character who may or may not possess supernatural powers. This is apt. Charles Darwin published the 'The Origin of Species' in 1859 and Arthur Conan Doyle his first Sherlock Holmes story in 1887. It is commonly thought that Doyle's hero owed much to the development of the nineteenth century scientific method, with its emphasis on observation, logic, deduction and a dash of imagination and daring, but Holmes, with his unbelievable gifts for problem solving and frequent impossible leaps of logic, was originally meant as a joke, a mockery of the flurry of scientific discoveries that the era saw being made. Doyle was himself fond of mysticism, spiritualism, magic and often wrote about the Dark Arts. He cooked up Holmes as an attempt to ridicule that which he believed was slowly killing off various branches of enchantment, religion and spirituality. Of course this backfired completely. People are fond of order, control and the commanding aura of Holmes, and quickly took the detective to heart. From then on, Doyle found himself unable to abandon the character. Ritchie's film stars Jude Law and Rachel McAdams in supporting roles, but they're not given much to do. The film features some neat, Victoria-era scenery, most of it CGI paintings. The sequel's even funnier.7.9/10 - Better Holmes flicks: 'Zero Effect', 'The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes' (1939), 'The Hound of the Baskervilles' (1939), 'They Might Be Giants' (1971).

WALL·E," Like a stop-smoking ad starring Joe Camel
","When Pixar's not sucking on the Disney Empire's sinister teat or filling landfills with discarded kitsch packaged in slow-to-biodegrade plastic and made by suicidal kids in China at environment destroying mega-factories...they're making eco-cautionary, anti corporatist films. In this regard we had the clean energy advocating 'Monster's Inc' and 'Cars 2', and the eco-loving, anti-consumerist, anti-corporate 'WALL-E'. Pixar's other films have a stranger tension, 'Cars' decrying urban sprawl, gas guzzlers and life in the fast-lane by celebrating retro-cars, speedy races and old-school, 'good', 'small town capitalism', whilst the 'Toy Story' movies yearn for the tactile, nostalgic pleasures of solid-state toys even as Pixar's dependence on pixels, processors and Pentiums pulverises whatever pull pre-digital entertainment ever had. Want to play with Mr Potato Head, honey? Screw that, Mom. Hit me some X-box. Now! Disney once performed a similar magic trick, making billions off public domain material whilst militantly copyrighting the same material (Disney lobbies were behind the drive to extend copyrights to a full century), aggressively suing everyone from the Academy Awards to daycare centres who dared place Snow Whites and Quasimodos in classrooms or playgrounds.Directed by Andrew Stanton, 'WALL-E' revolves around a cute robot called WALL-E. He's (why do we assume WALL-E's male?) a cross between ET and 'Short Circuit's' Johnny 5, with big robot eyes and a perpetually sad, puppy-dog look. When he's not mimicking old Chaplin, Keaton and Harold Lloyd routines, WALL-E's patrolling a now derelict planet Earth, stacking garbage, junk and dutifully doing his best to repair a polluted planet. Enter EVE, an apparently female robot who has been sent to Earth to scan for vegetation. While WALL-E resembles an old VHS system, EVE's a cross between a tampon and an Ipod, all sleek enamel, digital readouts and laser beams. The duo embark on an adventure which teaches us about the fragility and strengths of our ecosystem and condemns mega-corporations/branding/advertising/rampant-consumerism (shades of the sci-fi eco-parable 'Silent Running'), before launching into a second half which takes place upon the Axiom (literally, 'the worthy few'), a spaceship where fat, lazy humans are doted on by machines.The film's best moments occur in its first, Earth-bound quarter. Here our robots share a courtship that evokes Chaplin's 'Little Tramp', 'Modern Times', Virginia Cherrill's blind flower girl in 'City Lights' and the love affair in Keaton's 'The General'. This section is also quite melancholic, WALL-E a lonely outcast thanklessly tasked with cleaning up humanity's mess. We feel for him. He's also a bit like Neville of Matheson's 'I am Legend' (pet cockroach instead of dog), barricading himself in his bunker each night in an effort to escape sandstorms.Unfortunately the film quickly becomes Pixar's most saccharine, manipulative, contrived, obvious and heavy handed. Cheap death scenes are frequently rolled out to elicit tears (WALL-E keeps dying and his cockroach keeps getting squashed), WALL-E's big sad eyes are relentlessly milked, and the film's 'GARGANTUAN EMOTIONAL MOMENTS' are mostly all forced and obvious. Throw in a generic 'red button', 'ticking clock', 'countdown to explosion' finale, a series of second-rate action scenes (and obligatory 'poetic flying scenes'), last-minute villains ('2001's' HAL meets 'Flight of the Navigator's' Max), weak comedy, corny characters and you have one of Pixar's worst. The film also struggles to cook up interesting visuals and virtual sets, its aesthetics becoming conventional as soon as the film launches into outer space. Stanton's previous Pixar effort ('Finding Nemo') kept its two sections – expansive ocean reefs and claustrophobic urban fish tanks – much more fresh. With 'WALL-E' you've seen it all before.'WALL-E's' message is all over the place, which upon release resulted in it being embraced by both American liberals (hug a tree!) and conservatives (pro free-market, anti big government). Regardless, the film has little real world bearing. Historically, machines increase work, obesity is linked to social class (ie, the poor, not the indolent) and in the real world consumerism/fatties are bolstered not by machines but skinny slave labour abroad. In this way 'WALL-E's' a very white, middle class, American-centric film: it's an appeal to stop consuming and start recycling rather than a look into the reasons for and futility of both. Bizarrely, the film's 'anti-consumerism' but fetishizes retro objects - silent films, Zippo lighters, plastic forks, hubcaps, Rubik's cubes, nuts, bolts and bits of treasure - treasure which WALL-E identifies as being representative of humanity. For WALL-E (cool: he's more a historian than garbage-bot), objects have souls, which is capitalist nostalgia axenic.Like most 'environmental films', 'WALL'E's' aching for a pure, untouched, unpolluted, pre-globalisation, pre-digital past. A return to the wilderness (see 'Survivors of the Dead'). And like these films ('Avatar' etc), it wrongly turns 'environmentalism' into a personal choice. But people are mostly frugal and it is systems, not people, which make society 'happen'. It is not your fault you're inundated with packaging, spam and products with short life-spans. Rather, capitalism as an ordering system hinges on waste, overproduction, expansion, over-accumulation, exponentially increasing consumption, and is designed such that most products go trashed and/or unsold (corporations destroy tonnes of merchandise to prevent sales on the black market and horde goods to manipulate demand/prices etc). It is the 'normal situation' of bourgeois society for a great part of existing products and of the previously created productive forces, to be wasted. Much of this waste comes from an economic system which pits the same products against one another and requires copious labels and advertising as weaponry in this war. There can be no 'environmentalism' or 'green movement' unless one first radically re-figures our whole concept of production, wealth and 'money' (wrongly, 'WALL-E' is post money), 'money' having long been exposed as a powerful political tool for expropriation, as opposed to a mere 'neutral medium of exchange', as is commonly believed.7.5/10 – Almost as annoying as 'Avatar'.",Null,11,20,9 April 2012
Stalag 17," This barracks is jinxed!
","'The story of that struggle cannot be read without admiration for the courage, the perseverance, the vital force which enabled him to challenge, defy, conciliate and overcome all authorities and resistance which barred his path. I have always said that if Great Britain were defeated in war, I hoped we should find a Hitler to lead us back to our rightful position among the nations.' - Winston Churchill Heavily influenced by Jean Renoir's 'La Grande Illusion' (1937), Billy Wilder's 'Stalag 17' takes place within a German prisoner of war camp during World War 2's final years. The film was released in 1953 and is regarded as one of Wilder's early masterpieces.'Stalag's' first half develops a subplot in which J.J Sefton, an American black marketeer, is suspected by his comrades of having spied for their German captors. This subplot has been read as a comment on McCarthyism, but if that were so, its resolution, in which Sefton and his buddies band together to weed out the real rat, misses the historical lesson of McCarthyism entirely.'Stalag 17' is aided greatly by Ernest Laszlo's grim black-and-white cinematography. Wilder's direction is also expert, though the film too often prettifies life in the camps. This is a feel good POW movie, very Hollywood, and anticipates Wilder's later, lighter, Lubitsch styled comedies (as well as the transvestite humour of 'Some Like It Hot'). On the flip side, Wilder teases out a number of very bittersweet and even grim moments, and his Sefton character, infectiously played by William Holden, is always interesting. Pragmatism incarnate, Sefton is a profiteer, a merchant, always taking bets and treating the survival of his comrades as a game of profit, loss, risk and reward. Like Rick in 'Casablanca', Sefton then calls himself into action, the film ending with him risking his guts for another human being. Is this an act of altruism, though, or another scheme by Sefton undertaken solely because he likes the odds? Bizarrely, Wilder portrays Sefton's profiteering as being detrimental within both the collective confines of the barracks, and the larger landscape of war. When Sefton is labelled a traitor by his fellow Americans, his bounty and profits are then appropriated by the group and distributed amongst the men. Ironically, 'Allied' involvement in WW2 was designed to stop precisely this kind of collectivism. As the Governor of the Bank of England himself quipped, 'British loans to Hitler should be seen as an investment against Bolshevism and communism'. Far from an enemy, the monarchs and aristocrats across Europe, of whom Winston Churchill himself belonged (most of the royalty in Germany, England and Russia were related), championed the German Army. Fearful of revolutions, civil wars, and losing their power, they saw Hitler (and even Mussolini, who Churchill routinely praised) as a weapon to be used against Marxists, 'Jews', Bolsheviks and Russia itself. A further irony is that, without Stalin's bloody brand of collectivization, Hitler perhaps wouldn't have been defeated; statistically, 79-89% of all Nazi casualties were inflicted by the Soviets.'Stalag 17' would prove hugely influential, shaping everything form 'The Bridge On The River Kwai' to 'The Great Escape' to 'Papillon' to 'King Rat'. It would influence the farcical TV show 'Hogan's Heroes', and would be one of Wilder's last dramas ('Witness for the Prosecution' and 'The Spirit of St Louis' would follow some years later), the director gradually moving toward comedies.8/10 – Worth two viewings.",Null,1,2,21 October 2013
The Terminal," Spielberg's spatial experiment, yet another failure
","Having made enough money off his escapist films, Spielberg set out in the early 80s to be thought of as a serious film-maker. One who innovates or invents some new form of narrative progression.The irony, of course, is that whenever Spielberg sets out to 'seriously' and self-consciously experiment with cinematic form, he makes total crap, whilst whenever he sets out to make a simple escapist film, he often revolutionises film in some way. (if you consider sustained sadism, CGI and blockbuster mechanics beneficial, let alone truly revolutionary.) 'The Terminal', despite its simple premise, is a very experimental film. Here Spielberg is playing with the notion of cinematic space. Film as an environment and environment as central character.All 'serious' film-makers have at least one purely architectural film. Welles has 'The Trial', Kubrick has 'The Shining', Polanski has 'The Tenant', Lumet has '12 Angry Men', Hitchcock has 'Rear Window', Fincher has 'Panic Room' (failure), Altman has 'Gosford Park' (amongst many others), Cameron has 'Titanic', Scorsese has 'Gangs of New York', Curtiz has 'Casablanca', De Palma has 'Snake Eyes' etc etc.Now Spielberg and Scorsese have been evolving along the same lines since the 80s, and so when Scorsese's 'Gangs of New York' hit the screens, Spielberg thought it high time to make a spatial movie of his own.But what type of spatial movie? Should he go the Hitchcock route? Should he go the Welles route? Should he go the Altman route? No, he goes the Kubrick route (probably because he's a big fan of 'The Shining') and decides to invest allegorical meaning into his environmental space. And so instead of 'Hotel as model of America' (The Shining) we have 'Airport as model of the world' (The Terminal).Thus, Spielberg inserts little symbolic episodes, the notion of getting real and false images (photographs, signatures and passports), symbolic quests for love and identity, and tries to weave various fable like strands into the whole thing. But it doesn't work at all because these things are all above Spielberg's head. He has no gift for filming dialogue, let alone complex allegories.Spielberg is a serious student of cinema and he's aware of these various cinematic notions because he's seen countless masters do them. His problem is that he's trying to repeat past experiments instead of conducting those of his own. Look, for example, at the difference between 'ET' and 'Empire of the Sun'. 'ET' is about an alien separated from his parents and 'Empire' is about a boy separated from his parents. One is an artistically honest film (despite being about aliens!), the other is a self-conscious and failed attempt at semiotics. 'Empire' is about an unreliable narrator (Bale) and the merging of false memories and fantasies, 'ET' is about an artist (Spielberg) putting his true fantasies and feelings on screen. One is Lynch territory, the other Truffaut.'Honest Spielberg' has a natural gift for 'ET', whilst 'serious Spielberg' has only a basic, distant understanding of 'Empire'. These polarised Spielberg identities are present in 'The Terminal'. On one hand it wants to be a serious allegory, on the other, it's just a cutesy feel-good comedy, a big budget rip off of 'Moscow on the Hudson', Herzog's 'Stroszek' and a couple works by Tati.The main reason for these problems is that Spielberg works too fast. You can't imbue something with meaning and thought if you don't honestly put thought into it. The result will always be lightweight.But ignoring allegory, 'The Terminal' fails on a literal level as well. Its comedy is juvenile and at times cringe-worthy, and the romance between Tom Hanks and Zeta Jones is handled ineptly. But again, that's nothing new. Spielberg has always handled sexuality with a very strong sense of awkwardness. For example, the laughable sex scenes in 'Munich', Matt Damon's 'boob recollection' at the end of 'Saving Private Ryan', the lesbians in 'Color Purple', the romance in 'Always' or the 'sex scene' in the aircraft's cockpit in '1941'. The romantic scenes and 'F-bomb jokes' in 'Catch Me If You Can' are likewise particularly awkward.But most of all, 'The Terminal' is a giant waste of money. Constructing such a beautiful set and then failing to use it properly is very offensive. But then, has Spielberg ever conveyed a tangible sense of true 3d space? Think of 'AI' with its obvious sound-stages, or 'Minority Report', where strong rays of white light are used to block off the sets. Do that film's 'car factory' and 'jet pack' action sequences take place in Spielberg's future city or do they feel like self contained sets, with no bridges or linkages between them? Oddly, despite being a master of camera movement, these is never the sense of any spatial world in Spielberg's films. Instead his locations are all cut off, a series of disconnected set pieces rather than tangible environmental spaces. His films rely on the power of the edit, of the cut, to force his imagery.And yet with 'The Terminal' Spielberg has a vast set at his disposal and nevertheless fails to charter space with any sense of intelligence. Can you imagine what Altman, De Palma or Welles would do with a set like this?6/10 - Too long, not funny and lacks allegorical meat. There are a few good jokes at the beginning, all involving Tom Hanks' lack of understanding the English language, but ultimately Spielberg has just infantilized Hanks and treated him as yet another Spielbergian lost boy. Why not just re-watch 'Moscow on the Hudson', Herzog's 'Stroszek' or anything by Jacques Tati? Why is Spielberg continually trying to convince us he's the new Capra, the new Tati, when in reality he's more of a gleeful sadist along the lines of Peckinpah?",Null,7,12,7 October 2007
The Blind Side," Ghetto Fabulous Sunday School
","'The Blind Side' finds a wealthy, white and paternalistic Christian family deciding to civilise a helpless, slow-witted, African American kid. The kid doesn't speak, is a kind, gentle bear, and spends the film literally doing whatever the white characters tell him to do, never once expression an opinion, thought or exhibiting any agency or free will. As the film unfolds, we are shown black people who are unable to help themselves, learn that the white man's way is best, that blacks should be grateful of white aid and that success comes to those who 'are good' and 'don't do drugs'. The film tries to say that privileged whites should help downtrodden blacks, but of course this is easy to say when the black kid being helped turns out to be a star sportsman who effortlessly succeeds on the field. Strangely, 'The Blind Side's' central character - Big Mike (Quinton Aaron) - is largely a non-entity. A giant mute kid, passive but obedient, Mike bumbles about like a tamed grizzly bear in a polo shirt. Elsewhere the film employs racist stereotypes, is condescending and has absolutely no concern for its black character, who plays second fiddle to actress Sandra Bullock, who plays a kindly matriarch with a hot-line to God. Through Bullock, white audiences pat themselves on the back, able to do what's right and decent by proxy.During flashbacks, Big Mike is shown to have come from a supremely depressing black community. Drug addicts, prostitutes, gangsters, junkies with hopeless lives....the kid's past is but an amalgamation of clichés, a one-dimensional horror-show cynically designed to make his transition into white-hood smooth and frictionless. A better film would have perhaps shown the troubles the kid has fitting into his new white life. Would have really examined the causes of poverty and abandonment. Would show how Bullock's very privilege relies on an unspoken social agreement which essentially perpetuates and sanctions an underclass. Would show how Big Mike feels being the only black kid in school. Would have given him a personality. Would have examined the way sports exploits impoverished black kids. Would have examined the downsides of the white family's Christian fundamentalism. Would have portrayed its characters in a less one-dimensional light (though the Aryan Brotherhood must be pleased to see the black mute gentle giant stereotype making a return).But perhaps such a film would have made no money. Afterall, 'Blind' made a staggering 400 million dollars and counting at the box office, proving that people love its very Christian world-view. This is the wholesome view of smiley-faced missionaries who go out to Africa to help god's impoverished children with an open heart. A view which ignores the church's brutal history, its continuing negative effect on the continent (see the rise of brutal church sanctioned homophobia), ignores that for every dollar of western 'aid' sent to Africa a dollar fifty and more comes back in debt repayment, ignores the way western 'Christian' nations control trade policies and the lives of peoples in the developing world, never-mind how privilege at home in America relies upon a class system. And all the while, with demented irony, Jesus Christ's supposed home land of Israel, the site every crazy politician believes the Second Coming will occur, receives more western aid than all of Latin America, Africa and the West Indies combined. Hooray for a little Christian compassion.A more moral film would have probably had Big Mike beat the crap out of Bullock, embrace every racist cliché, get their daughter pregnant, rob their house and steal their car. I'm sure there's something in the Bible which advocates that. Thou shall enact vengeance on hypocritical women or something. Proverbs 21:19 I think. Or maybe not.7/10 – The always likable Sandra Bullock would win an Oscar for her performance in this film.",Null,11,16,7 June 2010
Rango," Thespians? That's illegal in seven states!
","References abound in 'Rango', Gore Verbinski's animated film about a chameleon who saves a small desert town from an evil, water hoarding land baron. Nods to Peckinpah and Leone fly left, right and centre, the film's title alludes to Sergio Corbicci's 'Django' spaghetti Westerns, the film's plot is a mutation of 'Chinatown' and 'Blazing Saddles', and the film as a whole is mostly an excuse for constant visual and aural references to past films and/or moments/gags extracted from Western popular culture (everything from 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' to the unmade 'Don Quixote'). 'Rango's' less a film than a postmodern junkyard.The film pretends to be about self-deception and the search for authenticity, our colour-shifting chameleon desperate to find his 'true identity', but it's not. Our hero decides his place in the world before entering it, and the world obediently reverse engineers itself to conform to his cosy desires. Rango wants to be a hero, wants to be mythologized, a fake-it-till-you-make-it philosophy which the film unwaveringly facilitates. Incidentally, the chameleon is voice-acted by Johnny Depp, an actor who likes to think of himself as a real life chameleon.Like most big budget animated films, 'Rango' is slick, amusing, hyper-fine-tuned but disposable. Still, several of the film's action scenes generate a buzz, particularly a late chase sequence, in which cowboys flying bats chase a waggon. It's a very cool sequence. The film's secondary characters are also well designed: they're a bunch of mean faces, old timers, bandits and sun parched rascals. Unfortunately the film's villain is cliché and its narrative arc wholly formulaic, right down to our hero's obligatory last moment crisis of self-belief. For slightly better recent, made-by-committee animations, see 'Megamind', 'Tangled', 'Battle for Terra' and 'How To Train Your Dragon'. For more substantial recent auteur projects, see Mamoru Oshii's 'The Sky Crawlers', Studio Ghibli's 'The Secret World of Arrietty', 'Perfect Blue' and Chomet's 'The Illusionist'.7.5/10 – Worth one viewing.",Null,1,1,20 January 2012
Music and Lyrics," Nobody grows up in Florida, unless they're an orange
","'Music and Lyrics' finds the usually intolerable Hugh Grant playing a washed up pop singer who meets a young songwriter, played with customary cuteness by actress Drew Barrymore. As per formula, he's cynical about music and the music industry, but her optimism, love and energy rekindles his zest for art and life. They fall in love, break apart, and then get married, the film climaxing with Grant writing a song for Drew and then revealing it to her on stage in front of a crowd of thousands.It's your standard boy meets girl, boy loses girls, boy gets girl back formula. What's different here is that the film has been deliberately reverse engineered, the film-makers starting with a very specific set of problems: how to get a guy and girl romantically writing songs and singing for one another, and how to climax the film with the guy expressing his love to the girl via song in front of a large public audience. As cinema and music, or rather pop-cinema and pop-music, largely define man's understanding of love and romance, the intention here is to tap into a kind of ultra romance, director Marc Lawrence trying to create a more mainstream version of what John Carney did a year earlier with his indie film 'Once' (also another Barrymore project, 'The Wedding Singer').The film is at its best when its satirising 1980s glamour and pop music. It also pokes fun at the contemporary music scene (many young, oversexed, dumb pop stars gyrating for their rumbustious fans), but such jabs are less funny. As with most of these films, the climax must be a public event, we the audience watching as an audience watches our heroes. This both enfolds us in the drama and taps into a kind of primal need for public validation.Usually with these films the female role is given to a foreigner, someone verbally impaired. It's the male character who masters language and is in a position of linguistic dominance. Here Barrymore is the master of words and Grant's the stammering goof-ball.Note that both actors are all surfaces. They're constantly blasting us with ultra cute, ultra romantic, ultra bashful, ultra suggestive, don't-you-want-to-just-kiss-me-now poses. Every gesture, pose and inflection is relentlessly calculated. Barrymore's an old hand at this now. Grant too. Love is itself a game of broadcasted and exchanged signs.7.9/10 – Romantic comedies, keeping the human species breeding since 1909. Worth one viewing.",Null,4,10,20 October 2011
Platoon," Two and a Half Men
","When 'Platoon' premiered, Time Magazine ran a cover spread with the title 'Vietnam as it really was'. Other pundits applauded director Oliver Stone for his 'truthful account of the Vietnam War'. Of course, these songs of praise largely occurred in America. Elsewhere in the world, such films were viewed as just more tedious propaganda, which served only to further rob entire generations of a right to factual information and further mythologise a deliberately obfuscated war.But what's worse is the way these films purport to be 'anti-war', but then treat war as a coming-of-age ritual, a rights of passage into manhood in which our heroes endure exciting action sequences and then, at least in 'Platoon's' case, benefit from these experiences (as explained in 'Platoon's' excruciating final voice-over).These films covertly endorse war, serving up tales of a rag-tag bunch of racially diverse guys who 'don't know what they're fighting for' but are nevertheless 'willing to die for their brothers'. Elsewhere the 'horrors' which these soldiers commit are simply dismissed as acts of temporary insanity, rather than systemic atrocities ordered from above. Worse still is the way these films tend to treat Vietnam as a lost war, but a noble one, America simply guilty of being overly generous to a point of naivety, the Vietnamese population – portrayed as primal and barbaric - ultimately to blame for the pain inflicted upon the American psyche. The historical truth, of course, is the opposite: the US sided with French Imperialism before the war, was neither supported by Northern Vietnam or the South, did everything it could to scuttle elections and unification, disobeyed Geneva mandates, propped up puppet dictators, artificially and deliberately divided a nation, killed over 4 million Vietnamese, raped the country, engaged in large scale torture, bombing, war-crimes and detainments, faked terrorist acts, funded and armed warlords, forced the displacement of five million, and violently subverted the will of a 80 percent majority who wanted democratic communism. But that's how the US, in tandem with the Imperial powers of yesteryear, habitually operates: vote for who we don't want and we crush you. The truth is, most films touted as being 'Vietnam war films', aren't really about the Vietnam War; they're simply about confused and anguished Americans. 'Platoon', like 'First Blood', presented itself as an attempt to reconcile Americans with what had happened in Vietnam. But unlike 'First Blood', which brought Vietnam back home and forced Americans to confront the scars, 'Platoon' yanks us back to Asia and invites us to experience the everyday 'truths' of how soldiers experienced the war, the film designed to heal the wounds of a 'great nation' undeservedly 'defeated' at the hands of a poverty-stricken third world country (the notion that America was 'defeated' is itself mythology. America achieved its real goals in Vietnam, in much the same way it did in Iraq, another supposedly 'failed war').So at its core, 'Platoon' is a fairly straightforward morality play. Chris, played by Charlie Sheen, is a young soldier who must (like his character in Stone's 'Wall Street') choose between two fathers. The first father is Sgt Elias, a tough but gentle sergeant, and the second is Sgt Barnes, an evil brute. Elias represents the mud-stained American ideal, whilst Barnes represents a kind of corrupt devil who believes that men of principle are weak and that evil is within everyone.The film ends with two successive apocalypses. In the first, Elias is abandoned and dies like Christ, a horde of Vietcong devils engulfing him whilst Chris betrays him and angelically rise up into the skies. But this is a false resurrection. The last good man – the moral heart of America – has been left behind to die on the cross, leaving Chris alone with Barnes, a kind of demonic God.To salvage his soul, Chris must thus venture back into the jungle-hell, avenge Elias and kill Barnes, an incident which takes place in the film's final apocalypse. Here, amongst the devilish shadows of the Vietcong, Chris confronts Elias and kills him, before being once again lifted up into the skies. In Stone's mythology, America is neither fighting Vietnam nor defeated by it. Rather, America is struggling to confront and dispatch its own demons, that of collective memory and national guilt. She then re-learns how to be a good warrior nation.The devil sergeant destroyed and the Christ hero avenged, Chris(t) frees America and is then lifted off into the sunset like a body resurrected into some easier, more comfortable tomorrow. 'I have felt like the child of these two fathers,' Chris then says. 'We did not fight the enemy, we fought ourselves, and the enemy was within us. Those of us who made it have an obligation to build again, to teach to others what we know and to try with what's left of our lives to find a goodness and meaning to this life.' And so 'Platoon' dissolves defeat and serves up a cathartic experience in which memory is erased and the American dream persists. Elsewhere the film is resolutely goofy, with Barber's 'Adagio for Strings' overused (cribbed from 'Elephant Man'), too much romanticised insanity, goofy poetry, high-school symbolism and the kind of macho posturing that now seems silly post 'Tropic Thunder', 'Hot Shots' and 'Full Metal Jacket's' self-aware caricatures. Furthermore, Stone throws in every cliché (the village trial, the racist, the southern soldiers, the ineffective officer who almost always gets their men killed, the dope smoking, the war-as-being-high aesthetic etc) known to man. He'd direct the superior 'Born on the Fourth of July' some years later.6/10 – An ingratiating film, rewarding in a very superficial way.

Prometheus," Phylogenesis
","'Behold, I stand at the door and knock.' - Revelations 3:20 A prequel to his 1979 film, 'Alien', Ridley Scott's 'Prometheus' opens with a homage to the opening shot of Stanley Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey'. Scott then treats us to a riff on Kubrick's 'Dawn of Man' sequence. Here, on a prehistoric planet Earth, aliens known as Engineers kick-start the evolution of life. They do this by ingesting 'black goo'. This goo breaks down the Engineer's biomass and somehow 'spreads' their own genetic code. As the Biblical Eve is spawned by God from Adam's rib, so to does all subsequent life on Earth spawn from the Engineer's body.'Prometheus' leaps ahead to the year 2089. Here, Christian scientist Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) discovers several star-maps. These maps point to the distant moon of LV-223. Shaw believes that God is waiting there. Wealthy industrialist Peter Weyland harbours no such illusions. Aliens exist, they engineered humans, they live on LV-223, they have superior technology and he wants to meet them. Why? As he is dying, Weyland hopes to be granted immortality.Weyland finances an expedition. The space vessel Prometheus will travel to LV-223 and make first contact with 'God'. The ship's name is fitting. In Greek mythology, Prometheus steals fire from Olympus - against the will of the Gods - for the benefit of humanity. This theft results in Prometheus enduring eternal punishment. Weyland's attempting a similar theft. Punishment awaits him as well.After a great, distant shot of the Prometheus zipping across space – the ship resembles Joss Whedon's 'Serenity', plus an added pair of engine nacelles - 'Prometheus' becomes increasingly stupid. Scott's ship is populated by annoying clichés, unbelievable characters and the usual slasher movie fodder. The revelations that Weyland is 'hidden amongst the crew' and that one character, Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron), is 'really Weyland's daughter', are likewise cringe-worthy. A better director would have dropped Weyland and Meredith entirely from the plot. They add nothing.On LV-223, the crew of the Prometheus discover an alien ship filled with vases. These vases house more black goo. When this goo comes into contact with indigenous worms, this results in the creation of slimy penis/vagina snakes. These penis/vagina snakes attack and kill several crew members. When the goo is ingested by sterile humans, though, a different process occurs, and squid-like creatures (Trilobites) are formed. A Trilobite later 'infects' an Engineer, resulting in the birth of a bipedal xenomorph (Deacons) similar to the black aliens of Scott's first 'Alien' movie. Deacons will presumably lead to Alien Queens and so Alien Eggs and so Alien Facehuggers and so Classic Aliens. The end result of such elaborate xenobiology is a bizarre revelation: the 1979 alien is the incestuous product of a human and a God. Shaw's even given her own freakish Immaculate Conception.Late in the film, a character states the obvious: the Engineer's vases are weapons of mass destruction. Their target? Earth. Why? The Gods are angry at their creations, and so want to eradicate all humans. Why are they angry? The film doesn't say. Scott's early treatments make it clear: Jesus Christ was an Engineer, we killed him, and now Daddy's furious. Sequels and prequels can't help but destroy the mysteries of their forefathers. In 'Prometheus', almost everything alien about 'Alien' (1979) is demystified. The strange horse-shoe spaceship of 'Alien' gets turned into just another generic ancient temple (which crumbles in the last act, of course), the elephant-faced Engineers of 1979 turn into flute playing muscle-men, and the mysterious Weyland Industries turns into a bad joke. Elsewhere Scott tries to replicate the horror of his 1979 film, but hampered by a PG13 rating, his attempts are mostly impotent. People die, but nobody cares, and the film climaxes with a silly axe-battle, an uninvolving sacrifice and a giant-but-dull crash sequence. The film's only squeamish moment involves Shaw cutting a Trilobite out of her stomach. This Caesarean operation, or abortion, harks back to the iconic chest-burster sequence of the 1979 film, only here it's cynically reverse-engineered to both evoke a past moment and slip under a PG13 rating.'Prometheus'' execution may be poor, but its core idea is very good. The 'Alien' franchise works best as a sick nightmare in which Gods, men and beasts infect, rape and torture wombs, bodies and minds. In 'Prometheus', Shaw's character arc is worthy of Ingmar Bergman ('Cries and Whispers', 'Winter Light'), the poor girl clinging to her faith in the face of a cosmos which is monstrous, predatory and concerned only with death and decay. This is best seen during a cheesy sequence in which Shaw and Weyland resurrect an Engineer. They expect to find a benevolent Creator who imparts love, knowledge and truth. Instead, in a scene lifted verbatim from 1951's 'The Thing', they get a swift fist to the face. God wants you dead.'We made you because we could,' David (Michael Fassbender), an android, says. 'Can you imagine how disappointing it would be to hear this from your creator?' David harbours malice towards his Gods, hates humans, in much the same way the Engineers are disgusted by their own spawn. When unobserved, David watches David Lean's 'Lawrence of Arabia', a film about a maladjusted, homosexual man who is out of place amongst Europeans and Arabs.Scott's always been interested in theology ('Conquest of Paradise', 'Exodus', 'Kingdom of Heaven'), and in interviews has outright called religion 'the biggest source of evil'. 'Prometheus' ultimately ends on a note of optimism, though. In the film's best scene, Shaw hops aboard a spaceship and goes in search of the Engineer's creators. She has a crucifix around her neck and David's decapitated head in tow. Somewhere, out there, is the God of Infinite Regress. She will find Him, and she will knock on Heaven's Door.7/10 – See 'Pandorum', 'The Thing' and 'Vanishing on 7th Street' for this material done without pretence.

Paths of Glory," The paths of glory lead but to the grave
","'All Stanley's life he said, 'Never, ever go near power. Don't become friends with anyone who has real power.'' - Christiane Kubrick'Paths of Glory' begins with the playing of the French nation anthem - an ironic touch - and then quickly introduces us to its key players: Colonel Dax, a well intentioned military man, and General's Broulard and Mireau, two elderly careerists who treat the soldier's under their command with callous indifference.As the film progresses, director Stanley Kubrick will use two recurring visual motifs - men in trenches and men affixed like mere pawns to a chessboard - to hammer his dour view. The film's soldiers are always trapped, not only constrained by duty, class and national responsibility, but by physical, political and cosmic forces. When they try to rise above or beyond the filth, they're promptly shot down. Dax, the film's hero, is himself ultimately impotent. All his protests mean nothing. Whether he leads his men to success or failure, they still lose. The end of the film has Dax standing helplessly on the sidelines, watching as his men are executed for failing to take an insignificant Ant Hill. This is WW1 in microcosm, aristocrats, monarchs and burgeoning 'democracies' risking lower class limbs for land and hoping desperately to cling onto whatever power is available come the 20th century's new order.Even as far back as 'Paths of Glory', Kubrick's form reflects content. Plot and character coalesce into a very concrete, very formal image of the world. In 'Killer's Kiss' and 'The Killing' this was strictly a generic world, but 'Paths of Glory' launches itself in a different field, that of history, warfare and army politics. The film's subject is unambiguously visualised in its main setting: a huge château converted to an army command post. Because the decor becomes the story, Kubrick's actual story is not simply told, but barely told. Given a narrative context that is so simple, characters are also defined in very basic ways. The pawns live in the mud, the kings in the ornate château. The kings scapegoat and shift responsibility, the drones take the blame and bullets. Everything else becomes a manifestations of decor or camera movement. Characters are imprisoned, parodied, paired off and squared away. The prime examples are the generals, Broulard and Mireau, lookalikes in uniform, two ruthless men who toy with each another and who lead each other on in the guise of concern for their troops. Luis Bunuel, himself fond of satirising the ruling elite, would adore the film.Whilst discussing taking the Ant Hill, a series of brief tracks follow our players as they pace marble floors. Each character pursues a different path, but they all arrive at the same end. Broulard proves to spin the more effective web because he is the more clear-sightedly cynical. Mireau in the end becomes a zealot of self-deception. Dax is the liberal-humanitarian shuttlecock passing between them, he has no double but is himself 'doubled', negotiating his superiors' ambitions first as a commander on the battlefield then as a lawyer in the courtroom.Dax, as officer and battlefield soldier, is also a hero of two worlds, the château and the trenches. As 'hero', his function is to serve as the meeting point of two perspectives: the objective vista of history and the subjective confusion and terror of trench warfare. Significantly, Dax is Kubrick's only conventional hero outside of 'Spartacus' (also starring Douglas). Kubrick's later films would abandon conventional protagonist/antagonist dualities.Camera movements are clear but subtle. When Mireau inspects the troops in an early scene, Kubrick's camera tracks backwards before him, down an interminable trench. When Dax later tours the trench, the same objective track is inter-cut with one from his point of view as he passes through the ranks. Kubrick's point is clear. Dax sees outward and is aware of, or empathises with, the men around him. Mireau sees inward, fixated on himself and his own goals. Later, he will fire upon his own ants.This interplay reaches its zenith with the execution of three soldiers. Here the anguished perspectives of the victims, one of whom is played by the always brilliant Timothy Carey, are inter-cut with a tracking shot which itself seems to shift in intensities as it passes in front of a hierarchy of observers: from the indifferent troops to the press corps to Dax and the guilty corporals. Kubrick's extended tracking shots have usually been put down to the influence of Ophuls (to whose death Kubrick dedicates one scene in 'Paths of Glory' to), but the articulation of point of view through tracking - an emotional montage - is closer to Hitchcock. This form of emotional dialectics is present throughout the film. Watch how the generals play number games, tabulating the statistics of probable causalities before battle, bargaining over how many 'examples' should be shot, whilst the men below them cry in the trenches and prison houses, vividly aware of their own fickle lives. Unlike Kubrick's later works, 'Glory' is resolutely unambiguous. His dialogue is caustic, blunt and his images likewise, impeccably composed, with stark lines and fluid but muscular tracking shots. Elsewhere, the film is almost robotic, marching towards its climax like a relentless machine. 'Glory' was also the first feature to utilise an all percussion sound-track, a fact which lends Kubrick's imagery an even greater sense of foreboding.10/10 – Masterpiece.",Null,8,13,30 January 2009
Carrie," Trapped in the closet
","'I'm coming out, I want the world to know.' - Diana RossIn 'Sisters', director Brian De Palma has a Siamese twin take on the personality of her homicidal 'other half'. In 'Obsession', he has a daughter takes on an incestuous role (largely edited out by studios), usurping her dead mother and symbolically 'marrying' her father. In 'Dressed to Kill', he has a transvestite's 'feminine half' killing women in an attempt to instigate a sex change operation. With 'Carrie', which revolves around the tumultuous life of a schoolgirl named Carrie White (Sissy Spacek), De Palma continues his kinky gender wars. Every woman in 'Carrie' is understood entirely in terms of their own sexual frustrations. Carrie's mother and teacher are middle aged loners. One is a religious fundamentalist, the other a lonely romantic. On Carrie's prom night, both women vie for Carrie. One views the prom as a vile ritual, the other recalls her own prom as a moment of adolescent innocence.The younger generation of women within the film represent a similar polarity. We have Sue, a well meaning monogamist who wants to help Carrie, and Chrissy, a mean nymphomaniac who wants to destroy Carrie. Both their boyfriends take on a similar duality. Chrissy's boyfriend (John Travolta) is an over-sexed alpha male whilst Sue's boyfriend is a kind-hearted poet. What's interesting is that both men are submissive to their women, as are virtually all male characters in the film. Significantly, Carrie begins the film as a child, but pushes into womanhood when hen she menstruates in a shower. As Carrie's mother was sexually abused in the past, a fact which leads her to both reject femininity and transpose her fears onto her daughter, Carrie's own rites of passage is made to seem terrifying. Later, Carrie's peers seek to reawaken the woman 'within' her, while others seek to destroy 'it'. At the prom, these two ideals - repressed femininity vs promiscuity - collide with Carrie in the middle. In either case, Carrie has no control over her own sexual identity.Visually, De Palma's film is special, virtually every sequence idiosyncratically shot. Watch, for example, how he begins each act with grand brush strokes. In the first, he paints Carrie as a loner, his camera constantly 'finding her' outside of the crowd. Epitomizing this is a crane shot which begins high above a girl's volleyball court and ends with the camera swooping down and finding Carrie ostracised from the group. The following scene is a dreamy shower sequence. Here various girls are portrayed as naked nymphs, in touch with their free-flowing sexuality, a far cry from the more repressed Carrie, who is once again alone. De Palma's next shot continues this pattern. We're floating through school hallways, watching kids go by, until we find Carrie, all by herself. When Carrie returns to school the next day, the camera will again probe the classroom, before finding her seated alone at the back.With each act of the film, De Palma's camera adapts to reflect changes in Carrie's psychology. Act one, she's a loner at school. Act two, she's oppressed at home by her mother (and God). Act 3, she caught in a tug of war between various female characters. Act 4, Carrie is part of the group. Act 5, Carrie is betrayed by the group. Act 6, Carrie transcends and destroys the group with her newfound powers.Each act is shot with an emphasis on different colours and with its own camera language. The crane shots in the first half mirror the crane shots in the prom sequence, only now Carrie is engulfed in crowds of well wishers. When pigs' blood falls upon Carrie, a mean prank which echoes earlier, humiliating menstruation sequences, Carrie is again quickly detached from the group. The film is also book-ended by two symbolic shower scenes. In the first Carrie attains womanhood (and is mocked for it), in the second she revokes it in favour for self-repression. Here she essentially becomes her repressed mother, which De Palma highlights by having Carrie put on her mother's gown.But when her mother ALSO turns against her, Carrie is forced to break free. She rejects all these female characters (all the school girls are female archetypes) and blazes her own trail. Say hello to next generation femininity: empowered and answering to no one.Carrie's mother is also a fairly interesting character. As Carrie prepares for the prom, her mother prays to herself, sexually rocking back and forth with a rosary. Because the absence of sex in her life is replaced by an exaggerated obsession with spirituality, her repressed sexual energy is released through this hallowed symbol. The rest of the film is similarly awash with sexuality and overt phallic symbols. Close ups of red lips, phallic shower heads, carrots, castration, thin gowns and gym shorts etc. What's also interesting is De Palma's use of the famous music shriek from Psycho. Critics accuse De Palma of stealing from Hitch, but the sound effect also makes an interesting statement. Hitchcock's film dealt with an oppressive mother and focused on her damaging effect on her grown son. 'Carrie' is a film devoid of men or sons - though a wholly patriarchal religion weights heavily on Carrie - and instead focuses on oppositions within a kind of female collective.The film's final scene (a dream sequence), shows the only self sacrificing (she gave up her man to help another woman), conscientious young woman in the picture (Sue), haunted by the actions of both herself and womankind as a whole. Of all the dream sequence endings in De Palma's films - and there are many - this is perhaps the most optimistic.8.5/10 - An early De Palma classic.",Null,11,15,23 October 2007
The Silence of the Lambs," Mysterious Skin
","'I dwelt alone in a world of moan, my soul a stagnant tide.' – Edgar Allan Poe Would 'The Silence of the Lambs' work as well as it does if actress Jodie Foster weren't an in-the-closet lesbian? Consider this: the entire film is about being uncomfortable in one's skin. Buffalo Bill, the serial killer at the heart of the picture, has sexual identity issues and hopes to build himself a woman's body. Scorned by the world, Bill kills his victims and strips them of their skin, his aim being to knit himself a 'body suit' so that he may 'blossom' and 'become a more beautiful person'.Likewise, Foster's character, a young FBI agent tasked with finding Buffalo Bill, is constantly placed in positions in which she is chided, belittled and insulted. Taunted for her cheap perfume, her 'white trash' roots, her lowly status, she's constantly being intimidated by men (inmates, police, prison wardens etc), sees her commander as a sexual threat, and seems to have entered the FBI in order to redeem her father, a modest cop shot on duty.Foster's performance throughout the film (at the time, she was known for a slew of androgynous roles) is itself incredibly fragile, masking insecurity and uncertainty behind a facade of toughness. Because her character is so delicate, we the audience become almost protective of her. We watch as she fights her way through a variety of ominous situations and breath a sigh of relief when she eventually emerges victorious, blossoming into the beautiful flower (a promotion to FBI Special Agent) that the deranged Buffalo Bill is denied. Foster may not end the film feeling entirely comfortable in her own skin, but she's proved to herself that she can survive within her body. She can be herself - somewhat - and win.Director Jonathan Demme's follow up film was 'Philadelphia', a film which revolved around a gay character, so it's possible that 'Silence's' homosexual subtext - if any - was deliberately nudged by him. Regardless, Demme's direction is remarkable throughout the picture. Watch how he milks every scene, every sequence hyped or taken to incredibly dramatic lengths. Foster's visit to Hannibal Lecter (a cannibal who lives in a maximum security prison), for example, takes us down endless flights of stairs, each level heralded by ominous dialogue, a prison warden even pausing to show Foster a photograph of Lecter's mutilated victims. But importantly, while characters in the film flinch in horror at the image on this photograph, the photograph itself is never actually revealed to Demme's audience. This happens throughout the film: horrors are talked about, emphasised, hyped, our appetite whetted at every turn, but never actually revealed. Here is a film which respects our imagination and treats the macabre with a certain amount of apprehension. Even the film's ending, in which an escaped Hannibal Lectre walks confidently off into the horizon, is the kind of dramatic tease-climax more common in super hero movies. Whilst most horror movies are a series of carefully set up orgasms, 'Silence' is all anticipation.With the publication of 'The Murders in the Rue Morgue', horror maestro Edgar Allen Poe became the father of detective fiction. But what's interesting is that with this book we see that crime fiction was born within the horror genre. More specifically, from the very start, the criminal has been (wrongly) treated as a vaguely supernatural being; an incomprehensible, alien and irrational monster.'Lambs' raked in zillions of dollars, and so kicked off a chain of copycat movies. Post 'Lambs' we thus had such films as 'Kiss The Girls', 'Along Came A Spider', 'Taking Lives', 'The X Files', 'Seven', 'Zodiac', 'The Cell', 'The Bone Collector' etc etc, all of which copied 'Lamb's' formula, all of which hoped to cash in on its success. The film also spewed the 'wrong house cliché', the 'he's in the elevator cliché' and numerous others, before the series, with 'Hannibal' and 'Red Dragon', degenerated into a silly franchise (the same fate befell 'Jaws', 'Halloween', 'Psycho', 'Alien', 'Friday the 13th', 'Elm Street', 'Poltergeist' and 'The Exorcist'). In a way, the fact that these franchises and sequels were even possible, highlights the faintly 'supernatural' roots of such monsters. The vengeful sharks, serial-killers, aliens, demons and slashers come back to haunt their audiences, not because they can never be killed, but because they aren't remotely 'realistic' in the first place (and, of course, because profits necessitate their reappearance).8.5/10 - Worth multiple viewings.

X-Men: First Class," Bring back Bryan Singer
","The 'X-Men' franchise works best as a giant chess game, in which one team of highly specialised mutants are pitted against another. Like chess pieces, each mutant has its own gifts, powers, counters and weaknesses, and each must swear allegiance to one of two kings: Professor Xavier, who fights for peace and a brotherhood between mutants and humans, or Magneto, a Nietzschean villain who sees mutants as the master race.Because of the 'chessboard' nature of the 'X-Men' source material, and the near-queer love affair between the opposing kings, the action in the early 'X-Men' movies had an interesting tension. Many of the better moments in the previous films simply involved Xavier and Magneto jousting with words, sparring like modern Wizards, or eyeballing one another over a literal chessboard. Unfortunately none of the film's have particularly interesting scripts, and so eventually they all degenerated into big budget punch ups.The early 'X-Men' comics mirrored the social movements and upheavals of the 1960s. Professor X and Magneto alluded to Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, and the comics did their best to include ethnically diverse characters. 'First Class', set in the 1960s, was itself co-written by both a woman and a homosexual (writer Jane Goldman and Bryan Singer, director of the first two movies), and genuinely tries to grapple with Cold Wear era sexism, feminism and racism. Unfortunately the film was directed by Matthew 'Kick Ass' Vaughn, a mediocre director who perverts every idea his writers cook up, and corrupts everything in the pursuit of his dumb notions of 'cool'.And so much of 'First Class' uncritically features female mutants stripping down to their bras, panties, stockings, garters and high heels. Characters are either strippers or whores, whilst others are tied suggestively to beds and tortured. The script wants to align the Nazi's subjugation of Jews to the state sanctioned racism of super powers to modern sexism inside and outside the workplace (CIA agents are constantly belittling women etc), but Vaughn simply can't handle these things. The result is a wannabe James Bond film which salivates over its retro sexist narrative and plays up its racism and sexism for kitsch value (hence the presence of actress January Jones, who stars in the retro sexist 'Mad Men').Still, some interesting ideas slip through Vaughn's fingertips. Rather than a saintly good guy, Professor Xavier becomes a cross between a sleazy pervert and a benign patriarch, and parallels are drawn between his treatment of women and the way other oafish men in the film treat women and minorities. Despite his lofty ideals, Professor X is a pimp, every bit as authoritarian as those he despises.The film tries to approach issues of race (a token black guy's death is meant to conjure up the ghosts of KKK cross/corpse burnings), but makes big missteps. Vaughn ensures that a team of white American superheroes ends up on Professor Xavier's side, whilst Magneto's 'brotherhood' ends up being composed of everyone 'foreign', black and female. The film then goes on to focus on Xavier's X-men rather than positioning us to empathise with Magneto and the plights of his minions. In villainizing and marginalising 'enemy mutants', the series is guilty of exactly what it tries to condemn. It's a franchise angry at bigoted humans (who villainse the Other, all who are different), but which gets its kicks off whites beating up token, undeveloped evil mutants.In terms of action sequences, 'First Class' is mostly useless. Bryan Singer's action scenes were rather special, using silence and tension well. Vaughn, however, has no spatial sense, eschewing elaborate set pieces in favour for plot excess, cheap shocks and snappy cuts. There isn't a single decent action scene here (a butterfly chasing a screaming kid? Seriously?).The first three 'X-Men' movies starred two heavyweight actors as Magneto and Xavier: Patrick Stewart and the cunningly cast homosexual actor, Ian McKellen. Actor James McAvoy fills Stewart's big shoes well in 'First Class', but Magneto's character is a mess, painted so demented and violent that all sympathy is lost. One of the best things about the 'X-Men' franchise was the way humans, Xavier and Magneto all were, in a sense, 'right', their actions somewhat justifiable. Here, however, Magneto nonsensically bounces from psycho to good-guy to raging psycho.Of course, the fact that Brett 'super hack' Ratner directed the conclusion of Xavier and Magneto's relationship - Xavier's death in 'X-Men 3' - makes following this new duo somewhat pointless. Ratner has already ruined these characters' history. Why follow them if their relational climax is ultimately in Ratner's hands? The film's plot is reheated Cold War nuclear missile nonsense (this is what sparked a global war between humans and mutants?), the kind of tale that bad B movies rendered stale long ago. Beyond this the film plays like a giant game of connect-the-dots, Vaughn too busy trying to tick boxes and link his film up with X-Men lore. Strange then that the film so heavily ignores X-Men continuity. Rather than long-time friends, Magneto and Xavier, in this film, know one another for a matter of moments, Vaughn singularly uninterested in their rich history, rivalry, friendship and relationship. Why make a prequel if you're simply going to rush through X-Men mythology and end up right back at the status quo? And why does the film rush toward robbing a young Xavier the use of his legs, when earlier X-films show Patrick Stewart walking when much older? In any case, Vaughn has achieved the extraordinary; he's made a film worse than Brett Ratner. 'First Class' is just so new and shiny we don't realise it yet.7.5/10 – Worth two viewings.",Null,2,5,15 June 2011
The Wolverine," Bring back Bryan Singer
","James Mangold's 'The Wolverine' opens with its best sequence. Here the Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), an adamantium clawed superhero with remarkable healing powers, finds himself in a Japanese prison cell during the Allied atomic bombings of Nagasaki. When the bomb falls, most of Nagasaki is incinerated, with the exception of our hero, who valiantly shields a Japanese soldier with his body.After this sequence, the film slides into more generic territory. Jumping ahead several decades, it finds the Wolverine alone and exploring the wilderness of North America. Here he encounters a woman who informs him that the Japanese soldier he once protected is dying. Wolverine thus returns to Japan, at which point he finds himself embroiled in a gang war.Once upon a time, action scenes in action movies were exciting. Now they're largely overlong, dull and it's the quieter moments of action films which audiences seem hungry for. In 'The Wolverine', these quieter moments largely involve Jackman rummaging about Japan or exploring the wilderness all on his lonesome. These are all cool sequences, and lend the film the tone of a slow, brooding, albeit superficial character study. Less cool are the film's intended cool sequences, in which Jackman battles Japanese gangsters during a funeral, on top of a train (De Palma's 'Mission Impossible' climax on cocaine), and finally a giant robot in a mountain castle. These supposedly cool action sequences are all overlong, goofy and horribly directed, but they're what we've come to expect from films burdened by the demands of the mass market, blockbuster.This is all in stark contrast to how director Bryan Singer, and most of the better 'X-Men' comics, handled Wolverine. Wolverine is best when he's kept at a distance and when his violence is hinted at, brief or never shown directly. With the Wolverine character, less in more. In contrast, Mangold mistakes excess for entertainment.Incidentally, the film reads like a checklist of what Westerners think Japan is like. WW2 soldier? Check. Kimonos? Check. Seppuku? Check. Rich elderly businessman? Check. Workaholic father who neglects his family? Check. Goth Asian girl with wacky fashion sense? Check. Traditional girl? Check. Duty-bound warrior? Check. Sleazy Japanese businessman? Check. Yakuza? Check. Cutting edge technology companies? Check. Shinto monk? Check. Atomic bomb? Check. The film's climax is equally perfunctory, Wolverine battling a giant CGI robot because, hey, that's how all modern blockbusters are supposed to end.7/10 – Worth one viewing.",Null,0,1,23 August 2013
Win Win," Scar Tissue
","'Win Win' is a fairly good drama written and directed by Thomas McCarthy ('The Visitor', 'The Station Agent'). Low-key but well acted, the film stars Paul Giamatti as a small town attorney who moonlights as a wrestling coach to keep himself out of bankruptcy. In this vein Giamatti persuades a local judge to appoint him guardian of a young, wayward kid, an act for which he will receive a fee of $1,500 per month. Giamatti thinks his actions will benefit everyone – he absorbs a little guilt and suffering so that others may be happy – but of course things come crashing down around him.The film perhaps overloads on sentimentality towards its end, and McCarthy is perhaps too desperate to portray his characters 'growing' and 'learning important values', but as such low-key drama is increasingly rare, we let these failings slide.8/10 – Worth one viewing.",Null,0,0,19 November 2012
Blade Runner," A Dick's Lament
","'Blade Runner's' themes are encapsulated best by a brief scene during which a replicant called Deckard - who doesn't know he's an android - reveals to another replicant that her memories are not her own, but belong to the niece of Tyrell, the head of the corporation that built and programmed her. 'Those aren't your memories,' Deckard says mournfully. 'They're somebody else's.'Contemporary materialists echo these sentiments, applying Deckard's cyborg speech to all of humanity. According to the theory of materialism there are now no subjects, there is only subject-matter. Selves are nothing but electronic packets, while private persons are 'simulacra', Rationalism rejecting the notion that there is some ineffable 'thing' over the genetic, neurological and social coding that makes us 'us', maintaining instead that the personal and the biographical are only explicable in machinic and impersonal terms. The question raised by film-fans – 'Is Deckard a replicant?' – thus misses the implications of the film completely. The criteria for rating the human above the replicant have been evaporated. Deckard, like man, is a machine that thinks it is what it is not and is certain that it is not what it is. As all identity is construction, everything has been produced and nothing is given. As man is defended by his own narcissism, Deckard struggles to come to terms with this. Like most subjects faced with this trauma, he oscillates between retreating to either the Symbolic Order (the social world of linguistic communicationof The Law) or The Imaginary Order (the fundamental narcissism by which the human subject creates fantasy images of both himself and his ideal object of desire), both of which are tragic flights.But, as philosopher Slavoj Zizek argues, the lesson of 'Blade Runner' (or rather Philip K Dick's lesson) is not only that everything in the personal is in fact the product of impersonal processes of cause and effect, but that it is the very act of delineating the underlying nexus that regulates our lives, that marks our freedom. For this reason, 'Blade Runner's' replicants are actually the film's only pure subjects precisely because they testify that their 'content', including their most intimate fantasies, are not their own, but already implanted. i.e, it is only when I acknowledge my replicant status, that I become a truly human subject.What the film fails to do, however, is recognise that the 'replicant as pure subject' is itself not an identity, but the product of a machinic process which mis-recognizes itself as the process's final cause. So rather than a subject, we have the continuous production of subjectivity (in which the personal is always the 'sim-personal'; the simulation of the personal by the impersonal). In this algorithm, self-consciousness as pure introspection simultaneous with what it is introspecting, is impossible, as subjective reflection must always exists 'two steps removed' or 'behind' the process, consciousness, like memory and habit, always an 'after the fact' reflection on the unconscious processes which produce it. In this sense, the subject is by definition always nostalgic, a subject of loss.For this reason, for the pure subject to have reflection is for it to automatically realise, nihilistically, that consciousness is itself nothing. Unless this happens, the replicant remains a 'simpersonator', able to simulate personalities, but always confusing personality-function with consciousness-as-essence. In other words, unlike Deckard, the pure subject would not go from 'it does not know what it is' to 'it now knows what it is', but from 'it does not know what it is' to 'it knows it cannot know what it is becoming', which is the kind of morbidly fked up place Cronenberg now resides.But, philosophically, 'Blade Runner' doesn't go this extra mile. If the film is about nostalgia and loss, it remains trapped on the level of thinking in terms of 'memories' and 'death'. IE – whether replicant or human, memories aren't ours and all existence ends in death, as bemoaned by one dying, rain-drenched replicant.In this regard, the film is a lamentation more in the style of such Westerns as 'Once Upon A Time In The West', 'Unforgiven' and 'The Wild Bunch'. Indeed, 'Blade Runner's' screenwriter, David Peoples, injects many western motifs into the film, borrows heavily from 'High Noon' (a 1952 western that features a lone bounty hunter tasked with killing four outlaws) and would himself go on to write 'Unforgiven'. Fused with these are director Ridley Scott's motifs – an emphasis on eyes, photographs, pictures etc – (photographs are objects of place, sentiment, history, and memory. Similarly, phrases like 'we get the picture' or 'world picture' show that consciousness can be discussed in terms of a picture) all of which stress the recording and capturing of memories.Of course, stylistically, the film does borrow from the noir genre. Deckard (Harrison Ford) is a trench-coat wearing detective, navigating his way through a future Los Angeles every bit as oppressive as that of classic noirs. The film also deals with noir fate. But rather than the cosmic webs of betrayal so favoured by Chandler, here fate becomes the universality of death (programmed obsolescence) and the 'inescapability' of the human OS, of source code Homo sapien. Incidentally, 'Blade Runner's' 'elevator ending' references 'The Maltese Falcon's' 'elevator ending', another noir which ended with the 'stuff that dreams are made of'. Fittingly, all those involved with the picture, EXCEPT Ridley Scott, believe Deckard to be human. Fancher and Peoples wrote about a human Deckard, Ford played a human Deckard, and yet Ridley Scott continuously states that Deckard is a cyborg. Of course, as director, Ridley Scott becomes the Noir God of the picture. He is the head of the Tyrell Corporation. He is the implanter of memories. He builds the androids, falsifies information, keeps them misinformed and in the dark. The film works precisely because Ford thinks he's playing a human whilst Scott KNOWS he is a machine.8.9/10 - Worth multiple viewings.",Null,5,12,26 September 2007
Mr. Holland's Opus," Needs more Cowbell
","Glenn Holland, played by Richard Dreyfuss, is a musician and composer who joins the teaching department at the JFK High School. He initially takes the job in order to earn some quick cash, his aim being to eventually take some time off and write his 'magnum opus' (a piece of transcendent orchestral music which he hopes will 'change the world' and 'touch people'), but what started off as a part time job soon becomes a longterm career, as Glenn battles both students and school staff, constantly fighting to get others to realise the importance and beauty of music (and by extension, art).Eventually Glenn's students become receptive to his message, Glenn using a variety of 'innovative' and 'out of the box' teaching methods to win them over. The film highlights the erosion of creativity within schools, the power of art, the way these institutions degrade the mind, how school syllabuses are subject to budget cuts and outside job demands, but mostly it says that no life spent in a worthy pursuit is wasted.Glenn Holland may not have been able to write the 'magnum opus' he dreamt of, but he did something equally important. He touched the lives of thousands of students, inspiring and influencing them in countless ways. Glenn's life was a symphony, Glenn's existence a piece of music, and that, the film says, is worth celebrating.In other words, the film is pure cheese. But if you look past all the sentimentality, the heavy-handed tear jerking, the film has a worthwhile message. It says that teaching art is one thing, but living like an artist and inspiring others to do so is an entirely different thing altogether. It's a love letter to beauty and creativity.Beyond this you have a nice performance by Richard Dreyfuss in the lead and, ironically, some terrible music throughout. Why do films about music (think 'The Pianist') often feature bad music? 7.9/10 – The 'teacher genre' is filled with films like this. 'Dead Poet's Society, 'Coach Carter', 'Dangerous Minds', 'Good Will Hunting', 'Stand and Deliver', 'Mona Lisa Smile', 'The Substitute', 'Freedom Writers', 'School of Rock' etc, all follow a similar plot.Interestingly, whilst most films that seek to show changes to a character over a significant span of time use a relatively young actor and then add makeup to make him look older, 'Mr Holland's Opus' does the opposite, choosing a performer whose actual age closely matches the final age of the main character, then using makeup to rejuvenate him for the film's early sequences. Surprisingly, the result works better than the usual approach.",Null,6,6,19 February 2010
Casino Royale," Neither shaken nor stirred
","'The film returns to 'realism' and a more credible plot, with less fantasy and gratuitous humour.' – The Guardian (on 'The Living Daylights' – the first Bond movie to star Timothy Dalton) Whenever the Bond franchise is reset and a new actor is brought in, the Bond publicity machine claims that this new entry will 'go in new directions', 'be different', 'edgier', 'more violent', 'more realistic' etc. And every time audiences are conned, if only for a couple 'new' installments, until they realise that these films don't actually change, they just absorb whatever film-making trends are currently in vogue.Bond was always a disposable product. With no character history and a personality distilled to a series of tics, he epitomises cinema as throwaway commodity. The most commercially successful movie hero and franchise in history, the Bond films are not only rife with 'product placements', but they themselves function as a kind of highly sophisticated advertisement for the James Bond brand. They must simultaneously invoke tradition and the promise of something new, yet as that newness is always bound to tradition, you never actually get anything new, just variations of the same old thing, the franchise continually destroying its past even as it persistently resurrects it. Bond is about bondage in more ways than one.Bond was always about unrealistic fantasies of Western power, the films (including 'Casino Royale') all depicting beautiful people behaving violently in a cold and 'rational' fashion whilst extravagantly consuming the best materials society can provide in the form of expensive yachts, cars, food and hotels. Little thought is ever given to emotional connection, spirituality or non-dominating forms of conflict resolution, the dominant social paradigm is always vindicated and reasserted, Bond always wins (often through highly unethical means), all the women he seeks are conquered, the 'traitorous woman' is always killed and a Victorian mentality of society being strictly hierarchical, mechanistic and controlled from the top by an inherited nobility, is always served up.And of course the narrative structures of all the Bond movies are the same: we have the titillative pre-story action sequence, the revelation of the mission, the journey to the exotic location, the meeting with the first woman, the introduction of the sub villain, the mid point action sequences, the introduction of the second woman, the capture of Bond by the central villain, the escape of Bond and the climactic action sequence, often in which the bad guy is killed. Added to this mix is the usual sprinkling of black tie functions, high stakes gambles, card games, exotic locations, gun-play, dangerous car chases etc.And as most 'action movies' are reliant on the technology and conventions of the time in which they were made, and as the 'pace' of these films is constantly increasing, most Bond films have a shelf life of about 3 years, each film looking dated by the time the other arrives.Of course most action movies adhere to this formula (the Indiana Jones flicks follow it to a tee) - this is because our cultural narrative structure is shaped strongly around the pattern of the male sexual experience (setup, building tension, climax, then resolution) - but the Bond movies have been religiously following their own template and replicating whole sequences for almost six decades. This is why EON Productions, the company which produces the Bond movies, typically hires hack directors and doesn't let auteurs go near the series: no one is allowed to fiddle with the Bond ingredients. No one. ('Quantum of Solace' and 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' are, thus far, the closest the series has come to an auteur; unsurprisingly, the masses hated both) Midway in this film a character asks Bond if he'd like his drink 'Shaken or stirred?' Bond replies 'Do I look like I give a damn?' as though he's suddenly treading brave new narrative terrain. In reality, such little 'self-aware gimmicks' (which are scattered throughout 'Casino Royale') are no more 'edgy' than George Lazenby breaking the third wall and saying 'this never happened to the other fellow'. Once you realise these movies have never been shaken, there becomes nothing in them to really cause a stir.6/10 – A clichéd film with an overlong final act and an underused Eva Green. The film has several action sequences, all derivative. The 'free running' sequences are low rent versions of 'Ong Bak' and 'District 13', Bond's bathroom brawl recalls 'True Lies', the airport chase seems like a deleted scene from the original 'Die Hard' trilogy, whilst the 'African Base standoff' at the start of the film is identical to the 'Russian Base standoff' at the start of 'Goldeneye' (same director, too). Incidentally, the director of this film, Martin Campbell, 'rebooted' Bond in the early 90s with 'Goldeneye', just as director Guy Hamilton twice 'rebooted' Bond in the 60s and 70s.

Toy Story 3," The Brave Little Toaster
","The first 'Toy Story' movie was about a Space Ranger called Buzz Lightyear who realizes that he is not a 'unique and special toy' but a mass-produced piece of plastic. In a bit of reverse Nietzscheism, Buzz therefore casts aside his delusions of grandeur ('To Infinity and Beyond!') and learns to find value in his lowly community of toys.'Toy Story 2' told virtually the same tale, but instead of a toy called Woody teaching Buzz the value of community, we had the reverse, Buzz and his friends trying to convince Woody not to abandon his toy family in favour for life in a classy museum.'Toy Story 3' rehashes this tale (right down to the kindly old man who turns out to be the villain), but is more explicit in its existentialism. Here, Woody makes the argument that the purpose of a toy is to 'be there for Andy whenever he needs them'. Toys therefore believe themselves to be the servants of their owner Andy, who is portrayed as a sort of pint-sized God. No matter how apathetic or neglectful Andy is, Woody believes that the value of a toy comes from its usefulness and acceptance by its master. In other words, toys only have extrinsic value. This is a direct contrast to most religions and cultures, which all stress that humans have intrinsic value. Before Andy goes off to college, his mother gives him a cardboard box and a garbage bag. 'Decide,' she says, 'which things you're going to throw away and which you're going to store in the attic!' As the toys view the attic and the garbage bag (and later a garbage dump) as miniature versions of heaven and hell, Andy's choice is awaited with apprehension by our gang of plastic heroes.Due to a misunderstanding, the toys all think they are being thrown out. Better to escape now, they decide, and flee to Sunnyside, a daycare centre which is portrayed as a Retirement Home for Toys. Woody, of course, resists this move. He tries to convince the other toys to be faithful to Andy, but through a series of betrayals eventually grows to accept that he lives in an uncaring world and that all toy's must suffer (like the myth of Sisyphus) the fate of being loved and then abandoned many times over.At Sunnyside, Woody's polar opposite is Lotso, a stuffed bear who was once abandoned by his owners. Lotso interprets his abandonment as a total betrayal by (his) God and so (unlike Woody) wallows in negativity. As a direct result of his emotional scarring, Lotso has turned Sunnyside into a nightmarish concentration camp which masquerades as a libertarian paradise. In his Sunnyside introductory speech, Lotso touts the joys of self-ownership as well as the improved material comforts which his system brings (dream houses etc). Our heroes, who are portrayed as a bunch of immigrants fresh off the boat, are understandably enchanted.They quickly realize, however, that this paradise masks something quite sinister. New toys have to work their way up Lotso's system, starting by doing the painful, backbreaking jobs that the rulers of Sunnyside won't do. There are a couple exceptions: Barbie is taken by the ruling elites as a mail-order bride (essentially a hooker) and the entrepreneurial Buzz is chosen for promotion to the managerial class and brainwashed so he won't sympathise with his old comrades. In other words, Sunnyside's supposed 'freedom' is actually slavery, complete with military discipline, brainwashing and a panopticon prison (an all seeing monkey).Like all the 'Toy Story' films, 'Toy Story 3' then turns into a prison break flick, our heroes overthrowing Lotso by working together, harnessing the collective power of the working class and using the managerial class (Ken, Bookworm) against itself. 'Authority should derive from the consent of the governed, not the threat of force!' Barbie states during a rousing speech. Having nailed the system's key flaw she then overthrows Lotso and installs a kind of communal utopia, Barbie and Ken the new leaders of a Sunnyside that's filled with lots of dancing and groovy parties.Before this, Woody and the gang battle Lotso and his henchmen at a hellish waste disposal site. Just before our heroes are about to die, however, they're rescued by a giant claw. Significantly, this claw was the God of a bunch of friendly alien toys in 'Toy Story 1'. I.e. – fictitious, harmful Gods have been replaced by the actual helping hands (claw) of friends.The film then ends with our heroes being transferred from Andy to a kid called Bonnie, their new master. The Pixar folk turn this into a happy ending when it shouldn't be. Realizing their ultimate purposelessness our heroes learn to find joy and meaning in community rather than Gods. But the film then sells out by delivering them into the hands of a warm and caring owner all over again. This is half-hearted nihilism: What happens when Bonnie grows indifferent? Isn't Bonnie just another master? What happens when the toys grow tired of one another? The Pixar Universe may admit that these toys are just pieces of plastic meant to be discarded when they've outlasted their usefulness, but it doesn't ultimately treat them that way. Still, maybe that's a good thing. This is already a pretty twisted children's movie. Any darker and we'd have an audience of suicidal six-year-olds.Beyond all this, the film's action sequences can't touch those in the first two movies. Whole chunks of th film, including its junk yard/trash compactor climax, are also lifted right out of Thomas Disch's 'The Brave Little Toaster'. Indeed, the whole 'Toy Story' franchise is a virtual rip off of Disch's film, a flick which many of the Pixar boys (Lasseter, Joe Ranft etc) worked on, and which also used various household objects (toasters, appliances etc) to tell an adventure tale about ageing, abandonment, impermanence, loss and death.8/10 - Creepy.",Null,1,2,2 September 2010
Bull Durham," My daddy donated the scoreboard
","Some kind of classic, 'Bull Durham's' an unconventional baseball movie from writer/director Ron Shelton.Unlike most films in the genre, 'Bull Durham' lacks a gauzy, sentimental tone, has no time for nostalgia, doesn't overly romanticise the game, is narrated by a woman and focuses on the day-to-day drudgery of life in the minor league circuit. And whilst a disturbingly high number of baseball films indulge in hokey, metaphysical subplots (angels, destiny, vague spiritualism, baseball-as-religion etc), 'Bull Durham' parodies such things with conversations about quantum physics, new age religions and its cast of silly, superstitious players.The plot? Susan Sarandon plays Annie Savoy, a teacher and baseball groupie who's stuck in a kind of perpetual adolescence. Trying desperately to prolong the glory days of life on campus, she has a habit of hooking up with young, up-and-coming baseball stars. In this regard she takes Ebby 'Nuke' LaLoosh (Tim Robbins) under her wing. Problem is, Nuke is also being groomed by Crash Davis (Kevin Costner), a veteran player who attempts to mould the kid into something special.Costner and Sarandon create a couple of memorable characters. Legs always agape, and with the vampish hunger of a Bette Davis, she's a Southern firecracker who overwhelms men with her sexuality. Opposite her is Costner's Crash. Armed with wit, Cosnter's trademark khaki trousers with pleats, and an endless knowledge of everything from baseball to garter belts, he's a burnt out middle ager who, like Annie, tries to live vicariously through Crash. The film then ends with Crash and Annie, products of a very 1960s credo of eternal youth, turning their backs on the 'young man's game'. They stop living through surrogates and abandon their hopes of reaching the big leagues.It's an odd way for a sport's film to end. Whilst most in the genre build up to a climactic showdown, 'Durhum' sees its heroes fading into anonymity, giving up on eternal youth, appreciating the power of quiet wisdom and sliding into a quiescent, mature relationship. Unsurprisingly, writer/director Ron Shelton played minor league baseball himself during the 1960s.8/10 â€“ Worth two viewings. See 'Moneyball'.",Null,3,4,21 June 2013
Signs," Stylish slice of pulp scifi marred slightly by dishonest, but heartfelt, evangelism
","In UFO lore, there's a famous case called the Kelly-Hopkinsville Encounter. The incident, which occurred in 1955 and featured numerous witnesses, involved a family farmhouse being menaced by strange lights and inhuman creatures. The incident went on to have a profound effect on UFO lore, and today even septics take the case seriously.While UFO and 'invasion movies' were common before 1955 – most notably the 1953 classic, 'Invaders From Mars' - the Kelly-Hopkinsville Encounter helped set in stone the mythology and iconography of future UFO lore. This was a budding folklore defined by isolated farm houses, pick-up trucks, rural folk, spooked dogs, strange lights, bug eyed creatures, dead cattle, odd radar reports, disappearing planes, government conspiracies, men in black, stopped clocks, magnetic disturbances and CIA cover-ups. With the UFO boom of the 80s, spurred by 'academics' like Budd Hopkins and Whitley Strieber, came even more motifs added to the mythology: nose bleeds, traumatic abductions, sexual experiments, hypnosis, implants, memory wipes, human clones, poisonous spray, alien impregnation, alien hybrids and tales of whole generations of families being abducted. Aliens were no longer bogeymen, but intergalactic rapists.In the mid 90s, the 'X Files' TV series pulled together 60 years worth of UFO mythology, but by the time the series ended, the entire UFO phenomenon was dead and the series, which once promised that 'the truth was out there' and that 'we all want to believe', itself no longer believed. This reflected a profound cultural change. Man had probed inner and outer space and found nothing. Wonder, imagination and mystery were dead, scientific knowledge, the hyper-connectedness of the network society and the logic of late capitalism, all with their emphasis on order and consistency, confiscating our minds and assassinating our hearts. 'Surprise' became redefined as 'limited knowledge'; something that could swiftly be rectified.This impasse was predicted by philosophers decades ago. Today, in a way, it's epitomised by Gaspar Noe's 'Enter The Void', a systematic reversal of Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey'. While Kubrick's film is structured around a series of violent, but ultimately hopeful rebirths, Noe's film journeys through time and space and finds only intoxication, hedonism, drugs, sex and masturbation. Here, man has forgotten about outer space and instead turned hopelessly inwards, until, in a parody of the birth of Kubrick's star child, Noe ends his film with an ejaculating penis and a baby being graphically born...before the whole ugly cycle starts again. Where Kubrick gave us Nietzsche's triumphant Übermensch, Noe captures the complete decimation of spirituality and hope; the apathy of Nietzsche's Last Man.So the UFO genre and faith, and by extension spirituality, go hand in hand, and with the collapse of one came the collapse of the other. Indeed, look closer, and many 'alien films' are really about spirituality and religion. The 1950s in particular were rife with alien B movies which functioned more as Christian message movies and even the big budget stuff that came later dealt heavily with spirituality. George Pal's 'War of the Worlds', for example, was one big Christian love letter, Kubrick's '2001' saw man reaching out for Godhood in the face of Godlessness, Tarkovsky's scifi flicks (not strictly UFO movies) were all about the sublime divine, Spielberg's 'Close Encounters' exalted Hollywood special effects as the West's new Deity (it was originally written by Jesus-boy Paul Schrader as a Catholic rites of passage) and even the recent 'Knowing' is a thinly disguised Christian allegory.What does all of this have to do with director M. Night Shyamalan 'Signs'? Firstly, 'Signs' is a modern reinterpretation of the Kelly-Hopkinsville Encounter, an incident which influenced numerous Spielberg films ('Gremlins', 'Poltegeist', 'Close Encounters', 'ET', 'War of The Worlds') and paranormal home invasion movies ( 'McPearson Tapes' etc).Secondly, 'Signs', with its cornfields, tractors, small town sheriffs and farms, is making a conscious effort to not only tap into 1950s UFO iconography, but the genre's early optimism and spiritual hope. Here, actor Mel Gibson plays a priest who has lost his faith and blames God for both the death of his wife and an alien invasion. Gradually, however, Gibson begins to see the 'signs' all around him, and realises that all is not chaos, coincidence and violence but predestined and intricately set up by the hands of God.Shyamalan went to Catholic school and Mel Gibson is a psycho Catholic, so the film is unashamedly religious, Shyamalan ending with a shot of a cross, inserting symbolic holy water and much talk of 'Middle Eastern countries' - the cradle of Christianity - 'repelling the invaders with ancient methods'.Shyamalan's first two films ('Praying with Anger' and 'Wide Awake') were themselves about young kids trying to find God, and the rest of his filmography likewise deals with issues of faith and religion. What makes his preaching palatable is the way Shyamalan adopts the religious minimalism of directors like Bresson and Dreyer. Shyamalan may make popcorn flicks, but his films have a solemnity which bely their pulpy, 'Twilight Zone' origins.Aesthetically, 'Signs' is great. Every scene is emphatically slow, Shyamalan's actors speaking with the hushed whispers of Medieval monks. Likewise, his script unfolds deliberately, his camera is intelligent, his Hitchcock inspired score moving and his rejection of SFX refreshing. 'Signs' also contains some memorable scenes, like a brilliant 'asthma attack' and a climax that is epic despite its small scale. Like Leone and De Palma, he's good at stretching simple sequences out to operatic lengths.The film's message is problematic. On the plus side, it favours a personal or spiritual victory over agitprop populist triumph. On the negative side, Shyamalan is a charlatan and the miracles of 'Signs' are tricks carefully placed by a scheming directorial God. The idea that a non-religious parent could be a good parent is outside this movie's purview and Shyamalan is oblivious to the fact that his God is vengeful and torments those who reject him.8.5/10 – Bad message, good ambiance.",Null,1,5,14 January 2011
The Deer Hunter," Magnum Hopeless
","'The story we tell ourselves about ourselves in order to account for what we are doing, is a lie. The truth lies outside, in what we do.' - Zizek A near scene-for-scene remake of 1939's 'The Four Feathers', Michael Cimino's 'The Deer Hunter' tells the story of several friends (Robert DeNiro, Christopher Walken) from small town Pennsylvania. Early sequences watch as the gang work in a steel mill, congregate and go on hunting expeditions. Cimino's photography, aided by cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond, is exceptional throughout, but his film quickly nosedives into pretentious, unintentionally funny territory. Cimino indulges in a prolonged wedding sequence (cribbed from Coppola who cribbed from Visconti), filters 'Best Years of Our Lives' through a Vietnam era prism, has DeNiro run about naked like a Method Actor fishing for Oscars, and treats us to a forced sequence in which our heroes play Chopin on a piano whilst looking REALLY REALLY SERIOUS. This is a deep movie, see.The hell of Industrial America then becomes the hell of the Vietnam War. Here our heroes, now American soldiers, watch North Vietnamese 'savages' kill civilians. They're then captured by the Vietnamese and made to play Russian Roulette. They survive this ordeal, but Walken's character is pushed into madness and begins to play Russian Roulette for money in a Saigon gambling hall. Symbolically unable to escape the damage done by Vietnam, he spends six years there, gambling with bullets. You'd think the law of averages would catch up with him, but no.'Don't leave me over there,' Walken tells his buddy DeNiro, which leads to DeNiro having the longest delayed reaction in the history of cinema. Eight years later he goes back to Saigon in the hopes of finding Walken, a missing person's search which is apparently really easy. They find each other, Walken commits suicide (partially to punish - and prove his love to - 'best man' DeNiro), the film ends with a funeral and a silly, unearned scene in which our gang sing 'God Bless America'. You can feel Cimino straining with every scene to make a GREAT EPIC. The film won five Oscars.Like most Vietnam war movies, 'Hunter' hinges on romanticised madness. Deer hunting becomes a metaphor for 'virtuous, humane kills' and Russian Roulette becomes a metaphor for the madness inducing chaos of Vietnam. As is typical of racist war films, the Vietnamese are portrayed as grinning (their dialogue is not even Vietnamese), Oriental savages (introduced with propagandistic scenes showing the NVA killing babies and women) and the 'reason' for US defeat is sidestepped by making the Vietnam war itself incomprehensible. Where else but in a wholly irrational country could the US lose a war? Whilst several sequences play with irony (Russian-Americans playing Russian roulette etc), Cimino's tale is one of solemn tragedy. An account of what evil, sadistic, barbaric Vietnamese did to poor, innocent Americans, the film, like 'Apocalypse Now', oozes macho self pity with a dash of counter-culture disillusionment and strained appeals to high culture (Conrad, Eliot, Chopin songs, Orthodox hymns etc). The film is silly elsewhere, with random helicopter rescues, love triangles, many cheesy 'dramatic' scenes and exploitative Roulette sequences (why's everyone in Saigaon playing Roulette?) which Cimino shoe-horned from another Las Vegas themed script he was working on. Some critics, like Jonathan Rosenbaum, spotted the film's hokiness right away. Pulitzer Prize winner Peter Arnett would call it a 'simplistic lie'.As with most war movies, the overriding message is 'look what they did to us'. Cimino perpetuates the racist stereotype that sustained much of America's involvement in Indochina, and hides behind designer madness and much irrationality. Compare to Pontecorvo's 'Burn!', which offered a clear analysis of imperialist expansion, and 'In the Year of the Pig' and 'Hearts and Minds', two documentaries which the CIA waged war upon and whose theatres met with bomb threats.In 2012, the Pentagon began The Vietnam War Commemoration Project, a 13 year, 65 million dollar propaganda effort to clean up the image of the Vietnam war. What are they covering up? The fact that the North Vietnamese constituted a political movement with near total local, popular support, that the US artificially divided Vietnam in disregard of Geneva negotiations (becase Eisenhower knew over 80 percent of the population would vote for Ho Chi Minh), that the US put in place and backed psycho puppet leaders, that even the South didn't support the US, that the US did everything it could to prevent unification and scuttle elections, that 4 million Vietnamese died, that more bombs were dropped than in all previous wars combined, that tens of thousands were assassinated by the CIA's Phoenix Program, that nukes were threatened 13 times, that US land-mines still kill Vietnamese to this day (52000 and counting), that millions of gallons of poison, herbicide and chemicals were used, that US campaigns in Cambodia were directly responsible for the rise of the Khmer Rouge under Pol Pot (later supported with 89 million dollars) and the genocide which took place afterwards, that the first Tonkin Gulf incident was started by US aggression, that the second never happened, that over five million villagers were forcibly displaced, that political prisoners were jailed/tortured in 'tiger cages' and that 90 percent of Northern levees, hospitals, villages, towns and industries were intentionally bombed. The US has similarly destabilised over 80 countries in the past 100 years. And yet here's a film with the NVA torturing small-town Americans.During and after the Iraq war, US soldiers committed suicide at a rate of 1 every 25 hours. This figure doesn't include attempted suicides (roughly 1900 in 2009 alone). In Vietnam, the number of US suicides totalled about 150,000. In real life, these vets were trapped in a double bind, unable to reconcile their belief that their conflict was righteous with their actual deeds; they thus nihilistically self-destructed. Cimino wants you to believe the opposite; that the NVA pushed men to suicide.3/10 – Depressing.",Null,32,57,18 June 2013
Beowulf," Motion Capture Mayhem
","'If you shoot a dinosaur in the brain on Monday, its tail is still waggling on Friday. Cinema is brain dead.' - Peter Greenaway Long before James Cameron's supposedly 'revolutionary' virtual performances in 'Avatar', Robert Zemeckis was motion capturing his heart out in a series of exorbitantly expensive 3D films.His first attempt was 'The Polar Express', a film with wonderful ambiance and gorgeous art design, 200 years of Christmas iconography distilled and spat back out as a kind of super-concentrated, high gloss, Norman Rockwell simulation.The first hour of the film is a blast, Zemeckis' virtual camera dancing along all angles, whizzing between small spaces, looping back and forth. Combine this with some moody lighting effects and you have a pretty gorgeous animated movie. Unfortunately the film's second half reveals Zemeckis' message, and we suddenly realise just how insidious 'The Polar Express' really is. An ode to materialism, greed and irrational belief, we can no longer forgive the film's ethnic stereotypes and creepy facial animations.Dubious messages were rectified with Zemeckis' 'Beowulf', though the uncanny facial expressions still remained. Packed with fine tuned action scenes and zany camera work, 'Beowulf' is a fun action movie with enough sleaze and gore to compete with most male-oriented action blockbusters. The film's tale of temptation, greed, revenge and corrupted bloodlines, works well in a Shakespearean way, but mostly the film is a celebration of hyper-aesthetics and virtual camera work.Zemeckis followed 'Beowulf' with 'A Christmas Carol', a story so well known that one sees little point in watching his CGI sculpted remake. With the story so familiar as to be pointless, one instead savours the film's Victorian architecture, Zemeckis' enclaves of light and shadow, his free-floating camera and dizzying choreography. It's fun in bursts, but why not just re-watch Bill Murray's 'Groundhog Day', a superior re-imagining of Dickens' classic? Ultimately these three films, and later 'Avatar', herald the onslaught of a new kind of hyper-cinema that looks set to be our future. The virtual cameras of tomorrow – no longer bound by the laws of physics - render everyone from Hitchcock to Welles to De Palma obsolete (whilst paradoxically negating the spectacle of camera movement), whilst the ability to render super-mediated environments means that audiences will increasingly find 'real lighting' and 'real spaces' to be thoroughly banal. But the real future of all this is not film, but video games. Already cinema audiences have begun to cluster around the 30-60 age range, younger audiences increasingly dying out. Kid's are turning to interactive media, and increasingly theatre advertising is drifting away from promoting films and onto promoting X-box and PS3 titles.What the likes of Lucas and Spielberg created was not 'film as amusement park', but rather 'video game as cinema'. Cinema, unable to offer immersive experiences in a world overrun with mediated experiences, a world where thousands of youtube videos are uploaded every second, in which every film can be torrented at the click of the button, in which massive multi-player games can be played instantly through the television, in which an abundance of images has left images virtually affectless, has no choice but to regress further into a kind of super inflated parody of itself.7.9/10 – 'Beowolf' 6/10 – 'The Polar Express' 7/10 – 'A Christmas Carol' 'The Polar Express' and 'A Christmas Carol' are the weakest films here, one better off hunting down the Charlie Brown Christmas TV specials. 'Beowolf', despite being ripped to shreds by critics, is a pretty good action movie, with some real emotion behind those creepily rendered faces. Incidentally, Zemeckis' motion capture production house (ImageMovers Digital) was shut down due to the poor box-office performances of these three films, studios embracing instead the performance capture technology of Cameron's 'Avatar'.",Null,0,1,26 March 2010
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Holy cuss!
","Wes Anderson's films are about mid life crises, castration anxieties, emasculated man-children, self doubting child-men and tweed wearing posh people who fantasise about being macho enough to wrestle big fish. Anderson's 'Fantastic Mr Fox', based on a story by Roald Dahl, is no different, despite starring a stop-motion fox.The film stars actor George Clooney – cast due to countless past roles as a thief - as Mr Fox, an ex robber who now lives a responsible life with his wife and son. They're all relatively happy, normal and peaceful, until a midlife crisis hits Fox like a ton of bricks. 'I don't want to live in a hole any more!' he yells, desperate to cast aside his suburban life and sink his jaws into some larger achievement. After all, doesn't he deserve more out of life?Fox's answer, like Edward Norton's in 'Fight Club', is to embrace the feral beast within. Roping his friends into his midlife crisis he embarks on a string of dangerous heists, breaking into the factories of 3 villainous farmers and stealing their delicious loot. As Fox becomes more successful, Anderson's camera begins to focus more on his emancipated animal tail and less on the constrictions of his human neck tie. One phallic symbol – one of freedom the other of servitude - has essentially replaced the other, and when the evil farmers shoot off Fox's tail and keep it as a trophy, all sorts of interesting thematic avenues are opened up. Yes, this is literally a stop-motion kid's film about the conflict between wild, natural masculinity and the neutered alienation of the postindustrial workplace.Like 'Fight Club', Fox also sets up an underground union of sorts. In an attempt to release his friends from bondage, Fox urges all the animals in the land to revert to their scientific, Latin names, and suggests to them that they each have natural, in born talents which it is in their benefit to set free. The animals agree, and together they start a little war against the farmers, using a series of subterranean tunnel networks to undermine their human overlords. From this point onwards Fox becomes a Robin Hood figure, stealing from the rich and giving to the poor.These kinds of meretricious tales were common in the works of Roald Dahl. Dahl loved tales in which the poor and dispossessed outwit the powerful and cruel and often told stories in which those who own the means of production dominate others, both physically and psychologically. What Anderson does is take things a little further. Fox may be a rebel, but it is suggested that he has the capacity to be just as evil and egotistical as those he fights. 'I think I have this thing where I want everyone to think I'm the greatest,' Fox says, though he does eventually learn to direct his ego toward the benefit of the animal community as a whole. The film differs from the book in other ways. Anderson introduces Fox's son, who is your classic Wes Andersonian messed up kid. At once hating and admiring the masculinity of his constrictive father, the son is going through a psycho-sexual dilemma akin to his dad's, torn between a life of domestication and that of a wild, free animal. In other words, the head of the son's little Oedipal complex is the father, whilst the head of the father's complex are the farmers, both daddy and son itching to break free of those whom they believe to be holding them in bondage. The film simplifies very complex issues, and is wrong to localise its cast's anxieties around a series of daddy figures, but the notion that one (the father) must relinquish the ego and set free the son before first seeking freedom from The Big Other is something Anderson's other films often tangentially deal with, the artist possibly responding to the fact that the ego has been in decline now for generations. Unable to libidinize objects itself, today the libidinization of objects is accomplished for the ego by the superego in the form of mass culture, the educational system, media, technology and advertising. The ego itself is now libidinized externally, for example in the form of virtual 'Yous' (the You of YouTube) and 'faces' ('Face' book). Unable to unite itself with the objects libidinized from without, the ego then suffers through greed, dissatisfaction and despair, afflictions which tend to plague Anderson's heroes. The film ends with a rather bleak ending. The farmers don't catch Fox, but he is forced to live underground, always in hiding and always in fear, allowed only to come up to the surface to take food from a huge supermarket. Fox now has the illusion of freedom, of unfettered access to product, his bourgeois aspirations met, but in reality he still has a foot over his head and is unable to actually regrow his tail. In this way, Fox's masculine impulses have condemned both his friends and family, a collective defeat which the animals assuage with acts of light rebellion- they occasionally steal the very produce the farmers sell. Throw in the fact that Fox's wife swiftly becomes pregnant (further domesticating Fox) and that Fox suddenly learns he is unable to 'talk' with wild animals, and the film's ending is revealed to be something pessimistic masquerading as victory.What makes this ending doubly bleak is the fact that Anderson genuinely doesn't understand how regressive and dark it all is (like Dahl, Anderson is firmly wedded to the ideals of the American Dream); he seems to think his heroes have won and have earned the right to party. 8.5/10 – At its best, this flick examines the risks and consequences behind Hollywood's typical 'be true to yourself' message. Stylistically, like Anderson's other features, its a postmodern collage of 1960s vogue, self-conscious whimsy, much quirkiness, Euro-camp and layers of schmaltzy psychodrama. Actress Meryl Streep stands out as a stop motion fox.",Null,1,2,11 January 2011
Live Free or Die Hard," Sign up for a sequel they said, rekindle the magic they said..
","'Live Free or Die Hard' is an inept action movie from cinematic ultra-hack Len Wiseman. Like its predecessors, the film stars Bruce Willis as a cranky cop who's having the worse damn day of his life. His problem? Bad guys and doing bad stuff. His solution? Stop bad guys.The first three 'Die Hard' movies belonged to a now dead era. An era before your granny had a cell phone and before every bad guy on the planet had a laptop that allows him to hack into NASA. Better yet, they all featured Willis as a regular guy – wisecracking but believable - trapped in a confined space, faced with ludicrous problems and with nothing at his disposal. 'Live Free' throws out this formula, and instead takes place across an entire country, gives Willis lots of assistance, problems he can walk away from and of course saddles him with a PG13 rating. Throw in copious bad CGI, and an aesthetic which looks like CCTV footage of blue cement, and you have yet another feature-length reason to revoke Wiseman's directorial license.2/10 - Try harder.",Null,1,4,7 December 2013
Moonrise Kingdom," Our daughter's been abducted by one of these beige lunatics
","'Under postmodernism, hysteria and schizophrenia become modes of cultural production as well as cultural pathologies.' - Louise MousseauFrom the Willy Wonka toolbox of Wes Anderson comes 'Moonrise Kingdom', a cute adventure set on a mythical New England island.The film's elaborate opening sequences introduce us to Anderson's players. Using Benjamin Britten's 'A Young Person's Orchestral Guide' to assign different musical passages to each of his characters, Anderson informs us that his cast can't healthily function without one another. He then proceeds to split them up. They're alienated, see. At this point we meet the nerdy Suzy (Kara Hawward), who loves adventure novels and French singer Francois Hardy, and Sam (Jared Gilman), an orphan who's been bouncing from one foster home to the next. They're your classic Anderson archetypes, intelligent, geeky and depressed. They're also in love, and so set about escaping to a remote island in order to pledge their undying love.Bizarrely, Suzy is modelled on seductive French heroines, whilst the nerdy Sam is portrayed as a super efficient boyscout, adorned with badges, ribbons and broaches. Their naive romance and idealised woodland existence is then mirrored to the film's adult characters (Bruce Willis, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand), all of whom live lives of quiet desperation. Using various symbolic moments, Anderson hints that Suzy and Sam are destined for precisely the adult world which they hope to escape; disappointment awaits.The majority of Anderson's films are about mid-life crises, castration anxieties, depressed kids, emasculated man-children, kids with serious daddy issues, self doubting child-men and tweed wearing posh people who fantasise about being macho enough to wrestle big fish. 'Moonrise Kingdom' continues this trend. Strong, stable parental figure are absent, everyone's alienated, characters use megaphones and binoculars to bridge the vast chasms between them, and Anderson's kids seem perpetually lost. Actor Edward Norton, who plays a comical scout leader, offers some direction, but Suzy and Sam want out. When they disappear into the wilderness, Norton launches a massive man-hunt which escalates into a miniature guerrilla war reminiscent of 'Badlands' and 'First Blood'. Only cuter.More than most Anderson flicks, 'Kingdom' resembles a well assembled doll-house. Anderson relies heavily on cutaway tracking shots, quirky colours, frames scenes like a meticulous cabinet maker and dresses his cast like stuffed dolls. This is cinema as a kind of postmodern pop-up book. Every shot is supremely precious, Anderson's tone is extremely mannered, and every artifact is self-consciously and proudly displayed, from aluminium ashtrays to leather bound books, to battery operated record players to Suzy's knee socks and saddle shoes. These are all relics from a vanished childhood which existed only in the books and films of Anderson's youth. Such a style grates at first, but eventually its charms win you over.Director's like Tarantino are often attacked for plagiarism, but Anderson's no different, though he gorges on more up-market fare. In this regard, Suzy and Sam's plot is a literal rip off of Godard's 'Pierrot Le Fou', Suzy is made up to look like Anna Karina in Godard's film (red dress and blue eyeshadow), character's sling objects over their shoulders (rifles etc) like those in 'Pierrot Le Fou', Godard's famous scissor stabbing is replicated and Godard's beach sequences reappear here as a sequence at a small bay.But Anderson's filmography has always been packed with 'homages'. He oft quotes 'The Graduate', 'Harold and Maude' (particularly Jason Schwartzman's relationship in 'Rushmore'), 'Paper Moon', 'Brewster McCloud', 'The World of Henry Orient', Jacques Tati, Andy Warhol, Louis Male's 'Le Feu Follet', Richard Lester's hip Beatles movies ('A Hard Day's Night', 'Help!'), Godard's 'Band of Outsiders' and his tracking musical climaxes echo the conclusion of 'Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice'. Anderson also acknowledges Renoir's 'The River' as a major influence on 'The Darjeeling Limited', as well as the films of Satyajit Ray. Anderson also has a major Charles Schulz fetish. His films replicate the wistful melancholy of Schulz's 'Peanut' cartoons and are always seriocomedies with a visual style reminiscent of 'A Boy Named Charlie Brown' (he even squeezes 'Christmas Time is Here' into the 'Royal Tenenbaum's' soundtrack).And more than most postmodernists, Anderson's infatuated with postwar, modernist, European directors. His films are love-letters to Truffaut, feature a distinctly hip mid-60s aesthetic, utilise the blunt title cards of Godard, and regularly regurgitate totems of the Nouvelle Vague. Elsewhere 'The Discrete Charm of the Bourgeoisie' gives birth to scenes in 'The Life Aquatic', a film which Anderson himself says was hugely influenced by Fellini's '8 1/2'. The books of J.D. Salinger are also an influence, as is Orson Welles 'The Magnificent Ambersons', one of the godfathers of 'The Royal Tenenbaums'.Of course pastiche, incessant referencing, semantic instability and an escape from reality into a kind of meta-textual hell, are the chief vices of postmodern art. Postmodernism is itself defined by a loss of a transcendent values and a lapse in morality, direction, meaning and hope. You might say the anomie and despair of Anderson's characters, who are often lost amidst referents without a reference point of their own, is caused by the very aesthetic of his art, the socio-historical causes of which his films ignore.8/10 – Cuter than a basket of bunnies.",Null,1,2,4 July 2013
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Adieu, you scruffy-looking nerf herder
","'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' opens with the franchise's iconic receding text, a bit of Pavlovian conditioning guaranteed to bring fanboys to arousal. Director J. J Abrams then takes us to the planet Jakku, where Resistance pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) is acquiring a map which leads to Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamil), a powerful space wizard. Unfortunately Poe is attacked by The First Order, a military group which has risen from the ashes of a fallen Galactic Empire.After a dull, poorly directed action sequence designed to impress upon us the nefariousness of First Order henchman Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), Poe is taken to a First Order ship and interrogated. Why? Because the First Order want Luke's location. Luckily Poe gave the map to BB-8, a loyal droid still on the surface of Jakku. And so back down to Jakku the First Order go, as do Poe and Finn (John Boyega), a First Order soldier looking for a career change. Once there they meet Rey (Daisy Ridley), a resourceful scavenger.'Awakens'' first act is dull, repetitive and too obvious a rip-off of 'A New Hope's' (1977) more streamlined opening sequences. A better director would have flushed this material and opened simply with Rey, a lonely girl who ekes out an existence amidst the dunes of Jakku. See the opening scenes of Hayao Miyazaki's 'Valley of the Wind' for similar material artfully set up.'Awakens'' second act gets better thanks to John Boyega, who plays a likable deserter with the face of Matt Damon and the conscience of Edward Snowden. Finn's romantic relationship with Rey, both outcasts, leads to some of the film's best moments. They escape Jakku by strolling into the Millennium Falcon, everybody's favourite YT-1300 Corellian freighter, which for some inexplicable reason is left conveniently unlocked. Audiences are then treated to some serious Falcon-porn, the freighter dodging enemy TIE fighters amidst the wreckage of an old Star Destroyer. If you know what a TIE fighter and Star Destroyer are, commiserations, this film is for you.'Awakens'' second half begins with Finn and Rey running into smuggler Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and his sidekick Chewbacca. Solo's fleeing gangsters, Asian space triads and giant tentacle monsters. Because Han is such a powerful archetype, because Chewie is such a loyal lapdog, and because Harrison Ford does his best work in years, these unimaginative scenes work well. 'Star Wars' without Han is like Sergio Leone without Clint Eastwood. He brings the cool.But Abrams' an idiot, so Han steps onto a bridge and, in a moment everyone sees coming a mile away, gets stabbed by Kylo Ren. Audience interest in this franchise then plummets a further 50 percent. Along the way we learn that Kylo is Han's son and that the First Order have constructed a giant Star Killer. Yes, another planet-sized super-weapon. Abrams wrote this film. He can't write.'Awakens' climaxes with the Star Killer being destroyed by a squadron of S-foil locking X-Wing fighters led by Poe Dameron, essentially a Latino Wedge Antilles. Dameron, who utilises manoeuvres reminiscent of the Death Star Trench Run, takes off from a planet which looks like Yavin 4. If you know what an S-foil, X-wing, Yavin 4, Death Star, Trench Run and Wedge Antilles are, commiserations, this film is for you.'Awakens' is over two-hours long. Two long hours of shapeless scripting, Mcguffins, homages, call-backs, unimaginative writing, repeated scenes (two tortures, two giant hologram meetings etc etc), cartoonish villains, and an antagonist (Kylo Ren) who looks like a Harry Potter nemesis, disgruntled goth or disaffected American high-school spree shooter. Kylo Ren's subplot is so ridiculous - he's torn between the 'dark side' and 'light side' because he hates his teacher and drugs are cool AND WHY DOESN'T ANYONE UNDERSTAND ME AND OMG MOM, I'M NOT A KID ANYMORE! - you almost wish for the return of Hayden Christensen. When the moody Ren dramatically takes off his helmet to reveal a Napoleon Dynamite face underneath, it's hard not to laugh. Listening to him wax nostalgically for his grandfather, the apparently misunderstood Darth Vader, is even more hilarious. Why does this universe allow the Skywalkers to breed? This family's bad parenting is clearly putting everyone at risk.'Awakens' is filled with talk of 'mysterious forces', 'dark sides' and 'light sides'. Back in 1977, this all felt mystical and mysterious. But to build a third trilogy on a kid's descend into 'badness' due to magical mumbo jumbo is a sign of severe laziness. This laziness extends to the film's action sequences which, despite the aid of modern special effects, never really touch the work George Lucas did back in the 1970s and 80s. Old ideas in fresh paint can't beat the buzz of new ideas. Like him or loathe him, what Lucas did was once stylistically new. With every other blockbuster already a Lucas-clone, Abrams clone is still but a clone in daddy's decor.Still, there's a solid 30 minutes of fun in 'Awakens'. The film works well when it operates on the level of slap-stick, its female roles are decently written, and it gives actual screen-time to a no-name black actor, a rarity in big-budget Hollywood. Han (R.I.P) and Chewie are also never less than fun, especially when scurrying down corridors and messing about behind enemy lines. Likewise Finn and Rey, who have good buddy-couple cum romantic-partner chemistry. Oscar Isaac is fine too, with his old-fashioned matinée idol looks. Where 'Awakens' becomes tedious is in its villains, its pantomime evil dialogue, and its giant cast of heinous stormtroopers (chunkier than before, but still inept), members of a mass murdering trans-planetary government which inexplicably exists only to do cartoonishly evil stuff.'Awakens' ends with one of its best moments. On the same islands Werner Herzog once contemplated man's epistemological limits, Master Luke Skywalker, his face aged and weather beaten, stands and awaits an apprentice.6.5/10 - Lucas may have molested your childhood, but Abrams killed Han Solo, man.",Null,38,57,19 December 2015
RED," Needs more Malkovich
","Directed by Robert Schwentke, 'Red' is a weak action comedy about a team of retired CIA agents who do battle with a corrupt arm of the US government. It's a dull, unfunny film, but actor John Malkovich is hilarious as a paranoid old guy who excels at kicking butt.The film co-stars Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman and Helen Mirren, all ageing thespians. Schewntke thinks its funny that he's trapped these old folk in a zany action movie, but our heroes' antics aren't bizarre enough to elicit many giggles. Elsewhere, Schwentke missteps by not telling his tale from the perspective of an outsider played by Mary-Louise Parker. She plays one character's love interest, but rather than counterpoint or act as a foil to the film's inanities, Parker quickly and incredulously embraces mayhem.6/10 – Worth no viewings.",Null,0,3,10 August 2013
Flight," Superfly gets high, loses his wings
","'Flight' stars Denzel Washington as Whit Whitaker, a hotshot commercial pilot. During one flight, Whitaker wrestles his plane to the ground after severe mechanical failure. Though Whitaker is commended for his gutsy landing, news that he was intoxicated during the incident lands him in hot water; he's convicted of manslaughter.Unsurprisingly for a film directed by Robert Zemeckis, a protégée of Stephen Spielberg, 'Flight's' action sequences are thrilling. But like Spielberg, Zemeckis is also incapable of directing swearing, nudity, sex or even human beings. Most of 'Flight' is thus cringe-worthy, Zemeckis trying desperately to reinvent himself as an 'edgy', 'gritty', R-rated film-maker after a string of PG13 flicks and children's animations. The result is a film which is one part popcorn thriller, one part indie movie and one part message movie.'Flight's' final act, in which Whitaker admits he's an alcoholic, sees Whitaker journeying from train wreck to redemption. The film itself is awash with Christian symbolism (Zemeckis is Catholic) and continues the cliché of alcoholics and/or depressives hooking up with beautifully dysfunctional women (Kelly Reilly).As he's borne of the Spielberg school of directing, Zemeckis plays each note with a sledgehammer. Whitaker drinks entire kegs of alcohol, raids entire hotel rooms for booze, the film's soundtrack is distractingly literal and Zemeckis' forays into R rated territory (swearing, drug use, nudity, porn sets etc) are resolutely awkward; like watching your grandparents having sex whilst your mom tells you about her first boyfriend. Zemeckis is not only a kid trying to grow up, but, like Whitaker, one who is trying to convince us that he already has.Stylistically, 'Flight' resembles Zemeckis' 'Castaway', with its spectacular plane crashes and solitary men. Thematically it resembles Zemeckis' 'Contact', in which a tightly wound atheist wrestled with questions of faith, spirituality and control. Whitaker undergoes the same narrative arc, relinquishing illusions of personal choice, personal judgement and bowing down instead to real conditions. 'I have control,' Whitaker utters, both in the cockpit and out, but he doesn't. The film's plane crash encapsulates his nosedive into realisation. 'God help me,' he then utters, before letting others (and Jesus?) take the reigns.'Flight' stars John Goodman as a flashy drug dealer. He looks like he stepped out of a Tarantino movie, his character odd in what otherwise seems like an anti-narcotics flick. 'Flight's' best scene? Whitaker flipping a plane over and flying it upside down like a casual blaxploitation hero. While every white boy on-board is wetting his pants, Whitaker looks like he's grooving to Miles Davis. The film's been accused of racism - the first major black pilot in cinema being a drunk criminal? - but outside of Spike Lee's flicks, Washington's always been white.6/10 – Worth one viewing.",Null,2,3,8 November 2013
Kagemusha," The Mountain Moves
","'Do not fear when the earthquake comes, and the mountain falls into the sea.' - Psalm 46:2On December 22nd, 1971, Akira Kurosawa slid his body into a bathtub and slit his wrists with a blade. He was hospitalised and recovered several weeks later. Biographies differ on how many times Kurosawa slashed himself, but most agree that the 1971 incident was the last of at least a half-dozen other attempts at self-harm or suicide. Why did Kurosawa want to kill himself? Biographies typically offer a cocktail of explanations: depression, existential crises, a family history of suicide (his brother committed suicide in 1933), the critical and financial failures of his recent films and so forth. Whatever the reason, one thing remains clear: the once mighty director had been dethroned, humbled and so forced to reassess his powers, position and life.Similar themes run throughout Kurosawa's 'The Shadow Warrior'. Released in 1980, it stars Tatsuya Nakadai as Takeda Shingen, a Japanese warlord who rules during the Sengoku period (1460s - 1600s). Nicknamed 'the mountain' ('A mountain does not move,' Shingen tells his generals), Shingen is feared by all rival warlords. They perceive him as being omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent. His presence looms menacingly over all of central Japan.But Shingen's begun to confront his own mortality. Making preparations for his death, he's arranged for body-doubles to take his place should he die in combat. These doubles are designed to stave off death, to preserve Shingen, to offer him some semblance of immortality in the face of a Nature expert at dethroning arrogant humans. But will they work?Midway in 'Shadow Warrior', Shingen is killed by a sniper's bullet. Kurosawa films this sequence like a police procedural, Shingen's rivals attempting to ascertain how one of their own snipers – a lowly moral – proved capable of downing a God like Shingen. Hilariously, even when all indications point to Shingen having been killed, these rival warlords refuse to believe the evidence. Afterall, mountain's do not fall!Odd for an epic about warlords, 'The Shadow Warrior' thus concerns itself not with combat, but with espionage. Every warlord in Japan is busy sending out spies, each desperate for irrefutable evidence that Shingen has fallen. These warlords become increasingly uncertain when Shingen's doubles and generals begin launching attacks on rival kingdoms. Are these attacks proof that Shingen is still alive? Why would Shingen's generals attack others without a mountain on their shoulders?Before he died, Shingen provided his generals with clear instructions: should he be killed, they are to cease attacking rival kingdoms and focus instead on territorial defence. Whilst Shingen's tactical conservatism baffles his generals, they make increasing sense to Kurosawa's audience. Afterall, if the mountain has proved to be fallible, why risk further losses by attacking rivals? More importantly, if all previous certainties have revealed themselves to have rested on sheer belief, on sheer shared delusion, then what other assumptions might be toppled?These issues of 'belief' become the chief theme of Kurosawa's final act. Here Shingen's men hold fast to their insane convictions; they are invincible, they are mountains, they are Shingen incarnate, they tell themselves. But of course they are not. And so frauds, impostors, doubles and soldiers die on a battlefield, hundreds slaughtered, arrogance giving way to defeat, egos giving way to death. 'The fifty years of a man's life are short compared to that of this world,' a character tells us. The film then ends with the corpse of Shingen's double floating down a river. Floating with him is the banner of Shingen's kingdom – the Takeda flag – which speaks of mighty rivers, winds, fires, mountains and soil. These entropic certainties ironically counterpoint the film's frail corpses. In 'The Shadow Warrior', downfalls greet all kings, clans, directors, actors and men. To think otherwise is folly. And if to behave differently is fraudulent, all men are impostors.'The Shadow Warrior' is the first Kurosawa film that might be termed 'Brechtian'. The sentimentality and more populist aspects of Kurosawa's previous works are replaced with a distant, dispassionate tone, and most sequences are filmed with stagnant medium and long-shots. Elsewhere metaphysics takes precedent over motion, Kurosawa asks us to examine and ponder the subtleties of each scene, and all characters are held at distance, such that they become faintly absurd. Kurosawa would resurrect this style for his 1985 masterpiece, 'Ran', an epic to which 'The Shadow Warrior' is often unfairly compared. 'The Shadow Warrior' may be flawed – it becomes repetitive, its bloodbaths are oft cheesy rather than profound, and filming in modern Japan forces Kurosawa to rely on claustrophobic exterior shots which hamper the philosophical scope of his picture – but it is nevertheless peppered with many masterful moments. Famously, the film was executive produced by George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola, who convinced 20th Century Fox to make up the shortfall when the film's original produces, Toho Studios, proved unable to afford the film's completion.8/10 – Worth multiple viewings.

Rear Window," Mind if I use that portable keyhole?
","One of Alfred Hitchcock's finest films, 'Rear Window' finds actor Jimmy Stewart playing Jeff Jefferies, a photojournalist confined to his apartment due to a broken leg. Stuck in a wheelchair, Jeff finds himself becoming a Peeping Tom, spying on those who live in the apartment block opposite his urban complex.As the film unfolds, we become aware that each apartment window Jeff spies on reveals an aspect of his own psyche, much of it having to do with his feelings of inferiority - which he hides by pretending to be a macho journalist - fear of commitment and sexual unease. Jeff thinks of himself as a 'camera bum', a guy too lowly to be with Lisa, the gorgeous woman (played by the always sublime Grace Kelly) who's madly in love with him. 'She's too perfect, too talented, too beautiful, too sophisticated, too everything but what I want!' Jeff moans, as he begins to project his insecurities onto the various characters living in the building opposite his. And so Jeff notes the dissatisfactions of a pair of newlyweds, the banal lives of an elderly couple, the frictions between a pianist and his lover and the arguments between a knife salesman and his wife. Eventually, what Jeff sees across the courtyard becomes so intertwined with his own insecurities that he practically wills the travelling salesman into murdering his wife. In Jeff's warped mind, the salesman, who like Jeff is always away from home, always at a pit-stop between assignments, MUST murder his wife if only to decisively prove that things will never work out between him and Lisa!Then the film gets really twisted, for Lisa TOO wants the woman dead. She exploits Jeff's obsession with solving the film's murder mystery in order to counter his misogyny by proving herself a fit companion for him. In a sense, Jeff 'concocts a murder fantasy' to prove that their relationship is doomed, whilst Lisa 'goes along with the fantasy' to prove that she is as tough and rugged as her dear Jeff (and only then does life in the apartment across the street become happy). It's like a freaky sadomasochistic game in which wive's offer themselves as corpse's to remasculinize men and lovers lovingly mend bridges with murder.Throughout the film, Hitchcock's roaming camera (linked with curious cats and dogs, the latter killed for sniffing about) elegantly explores its urban surroundings. But what it finds is only a world of characters happy on the outside but afflicted by terrible loneliness and frustrations on the inside. And Jeff, of course, no more responds to the mental anguish (deaths, abuse, suicides etc) of these characters than he does to Lisa's suffering. They're all stick figures, existing for Jeff's own private amusement.While Jeff and Lisa project their respective fantasies upon the mirror building, back in their own apartment, in their own world, they're still the same old conflicted couple. This dichotomy has led to about six decades of writers reading 'Window' - a film which even pauses to discuss the ethics of watching (shades of 'Rope') - as an allegory for the cinema experience. With such readings, the apartment Jeff spies on is typically read as a theatre screen, a blank slate upon which we project our fantasies, while in reality we sit, like Jeff, stymied and crippled. The film also explicitly links boredom to voyeurism and cinema to a kind of perverse, dehumanising thing, man interested in his fellow men only insofar as they provide morbid, detached amusement. Jeff's seen and catalogued the world, but is afraid of getting close to anything.Of course 'Window's' 'highbrow' readings only came later. Upon initial release, the film was simply read as being – pick one - a pulpy thriller, a comment on post war complacency, a comment on the dark shenanigans that go on behind closed curtains and a light romance in which our sexy stars learn to 'change' in order to better accommodate their partners. These may all be true, but Hitch does have Jeff defeat 'Window's' villain with a (film) camera, opening a whole can of interesting self-reflexive avenues.This self-reflexivity is pushed further by Brian De Palma in 'Body Double', essentially a sleazy hybrid of Hitchcock's 'Vertigo' and 'Window'. Here De Palma takes the impotency of Scotty from Hitchcock's 'Vertigo' and applies it to a voyeuristic character called Scully in 'Body Double' (Scotty has vertigo, Scully has claustrophobia). The film then goes on to have Scully 'watch' a pornographic movie after his 'female neighbour' dies (she's the echo of the knife salesman's wife in 'Window'), as he is no longer able to voyeuristically watch women in real life. The con is, both Scully's neighbour and the woman in the movie are the same character, both self-consciously 'acting' or 'performing' on 'stages' for Scully, who is himself both a performer (a failed actor) and too impotent (due to social phobias) to act. The simple reality/fantasy, subject/object, audience/screen, spectator/spectacle paradigm of Hitchcock's era increasingly breaks down as the film progresses. Instead we get a continuous succession of layers and meta-screens, everyone actors playing actors playing body doubles or doppelgangers. It's no longer a case of Scully, like Jeff, seeking out voyeurism, or even seeking out decontexualised voyeurism and the surrogate fantasies of film and television, but that under postmodernity, everybody is a participatory image, everyone is in someone else's 'movie', everything is someone else's desire, a mutual charade in which everyone is enrolled. This, of course, is Lynch/Cronenberg territory, themselves two directors who owe huge debts to Hitchcock ('Body Double', 'Blue Velvet', 'Existenz' etc, all successors to 'Rear Window', all coincide with either the end of the beta-max-VHS war and the boom of the internet generation. IE – they mark shifts in our evolving relationship with voyeurism).9/10 - Stylish, audacious and packed with excellent banter. Worth multiple viewings.",Null,1,4,2 August 2010
Munich," Another silly Spielberg fantasy
","'Munich is serious, adult film-making at its most nugatory, and America will never produce political movies of any depth if we reward work of this calibre.' - Alan Dale'Munich' begins on a strong note, Spielberg's documentary camera capturing Black September gunmen as they break into the Olympic dorms and mercilessly gun down a group of Israeli athletes. Like 'Schindler's List' and the best bits of 'Saving Private Ryan', Spielberg's camera dispassionately and objectively records what it sees. There's no forced storytelling or clunky moralising.Unfortunately it's all downhill from here, as Spielberg turns what would could have been a riveting docudrama into a simplistic morality tale. Everything about Munich reeks of bad art. Its dialogue is didactic, its pacing is awkward, its flashbacks are jarring, its politics are sanitized, its music is hokey, its characters are cardboard, its plot is completely ahistorical and its 'family metaphors' are tedious. Throw in Avner's (the film's lead assassin) forced 'moral tragedy', the obligatorily 'child in peril sequence', comedic sex and countless needlessly long scenes, and you have Spielberg's most annoying 'serious project' since 'AI'.When promoting the film, Spielberg said: 'The thing I'm very proud of is that Tony Kushner and I did not demonize anyone in the film. They're individuals. They have families.' Yes, there's no evil in Spielberg's world. There's no complex motivation, judgement, ambivalence or scepticism. No understanding of how the world really works. Spielberg doesn't deal with irrational motivation, passionate beliefs, unforgiving rage- all facts of life commonly found in the Middle East. Instead it's all 'lets just get along'. As a result, there's no real understanding of why the athletes were kidnapped, no talk of Palestinian oppression, or how ideologies are bred and mismanaged. Not once did I believe that this was how real assassins act, look, talk or behave. The real Avner faced no moral dilemma nor did he question whether or not killing 11 Palestinians was the same as killing 11 Israelis. George Jonas, the guy who wrote Vengeance, even disliked the film. His book was written to justify counter terrorism by showing the evil of, not the Palestinians, but the elite who used patriotism and islamofascism to breed hate among their own people. 'Munich' washes it's hands of all that. It's simply content to regurgitate the same clunky message preached in Adam Sandler's 'You Don't Mess With The Zohan'. IE-'violence breeds violence' and 'everyone has a family, so lets chill out baby, because deep down we're all the same!' But of course if everyone were equal, there would be no conflict. It is precisely inequality and injustice that is the problem. But no, Spielberg romanticises everyone. Far from being an oppressed minority, the Palestinians are portrayed as educated intellectuals and sexy hit women. Similarly, the Israeli's go to great lengths to prevent collateral damage. When they do accidentally kill innocents it's only because the French (those pesky French!) intentionally gave them the wrong explosives. And of course Spielberg's Israeli's aren't stone cold killers and trained professionals. No, they're toy makers and accountants with silly moral dilemmas.It's all well and good to paint everyone in a falsely positive light, but if you're not going to examine the roots of anything, at least show the evil on both sides. Show some sort of truth. Spielberg says that counter terrorism is just as bad as terrorism, but you can morally justify between counter terrorism and terrorism, the same way you distinguish between war and war crimes. It is possible to say that the Palestinian cause is as honourable as the Israeli cause, but it's not possible to say that terror is as honourable as resisting terror unless the initial terror is portrayed as being rational resistance.And so the film pretends to be critical of Israel, but in actuality it dare not show the true horrors of Israeli violence. We can see the brutal horrors of the Munich massacre, but we are denied the Israeli violence that instigated it. The end result is that Spielberg turns Avner into yet another Jewish victim, an object of sympathy in a situation in which he is precisely not the victim. In contrast, the Palestinian Other is denied a voice, denied any context, history or motive. The symbolic necessity, as Sartre argued, of targeting the Olympic Games, is thus completely ignored.The reason Spielberg takes his silly 'we're all the same' stance is because he can't bare to paint either side in even the faintest of bad lights. He thinks he's chosen the moral high road, when in fact, by ignoring all truth he's chosen no road at all. The high road is cold objective truth, but Spielberg has always been more interested in sanitizing history by avoiding painful traumas.But ignoring the philosophy of the film, 'Munich' still fails as basic entertainment. It becomes tiresome and repetitive, utilizing an obvious and predictable narrative progression which attempts to show that Avner's growing doubt is proportional to each assassination. Too slow to work as a thriller, the film also fails as a personal tragedy, Avner's inner turmoil never convincingly explained. Thin Spielberg characters are usually not this bothersome, but here their sign posted, theatrical moral monologues come across as obvious and lowbrow. There are other problems too. Why would a hit-man be so traumatised? Why would he 'recollect' events he didn't witness? Of course, by showing the massacre in flashbacks, Spielberg hopes to build to a horrific death/sex crescendo. But it all feels silly. Spielberg's handling of sex and adult relationships has never been good.4/10- A superficial, safe and self-important fantasy movie, churned out without much intelligent thought. 'Paradise Now', 'Z' and 'The Battle of Algiers' tackle similar material in a much better way. Similarly, see 'Day of the Jackal' or 'Black Sunday' (anything by mid-period Frankenheimer and Costa Gavras) for Spielberg's '70's thriller' aesthetic done right.",Null,100,158,20 May 2008
Godzilla," I am Gojira, hear me snore
","A dull film by Gareth Edwards, 'Godzilla' opens in 1954, with the United States dropping an atomic bomb on a mysterious sea-creature. We then leap ahead fifty years. Here nuclear engineer Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) witnesses the death of his wife (Juliette Binoche). This phony dramatic moment is hastily brushed aside in favour of yet another flash-forward. Here, fifteen years later, scientists, geologists and engineers attempt to ascertain the cause of various seismic anomalies. As Edwards' film is called 'Godzilla', this is all tedious. We're ten steps ahead of you, Edwards. Get to the point.But 'Godzilla' has no point. An exercise in clichés – which Edwards pretentiously attempts to approach from what he thinks are 'fresh' angles – the film's second half mostly watches as hazily rendered CGI monsters interact with collapsing buildings and lazily written soldiers. Holding this thin plot together is Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor), Joe's son, who is arbitrarily inserted into each of the film's major situations. Throw in offensively underwritten roles (Ken Watanabe, Elizabeth Olsen etc), Spielbergian father/son subplots, a tale which sidesteps all politics surrounding nuclear energy/usage, and several dull action sequences (why use bullets when atomic bombs did nothing 60 years prior?), and you have a truly rare beast: a film which makes Roland Emmerich look good.3/10 – Worth no viewings.

Heat," Gangster Movies: Part 2
","The flaw of all gangster movies, at least those acknowledged as 'classics' (Godfather trilogy, Scarface, Goodfellas, Casino, White Heat, Once Upon A Time In America etc), is how obvious and predictable their narrative progressions are. We get the rise, the joyous ecstasy of crime and the obvious monetary rewards, and the fall, that period where the world violently collapses around the criminal. With the scripts all so loosely similar, it just becomes a game of dress up. Of who has the best period details, acting and set design.Released the same year as Scorsese's 'Casino', Michael Mann's 'Heat' positions itself as one of the first 'neo liberal' gangster movies, all the others still caught in the old framework of mafia patriarchy, family values, loyalty, honour, total adherence to a distinctive creed, blood lines and tribalism. 'Heat', in comparison, completely breaks away from these old-fashioned ways. In Mann's film, everyone is an individual in the most extreme sense. The gang is no longer a gang, but a crew of 'independent professionals' who just come together for a specific job and then split. In this world, families and friends are non-existent or total charades.While Don Corleone hid like a king behind his armed guards and giant fences, Mann's gangsters are trapped in a state of perpetual mobility. Like a group of shareholders, they are held together only by the prospect of future revenue. Their arrangement is temporary, pragmatic and lateral. They know that they are interchangeable parts in a larger machine, that there are no guarantees and that nothing lasts. Compared to this, the gangsters of 'Goodfellas' and 'The Godfather' seem like stagnated sentimentalists, nostalgically trapped in dying communities. While The Corleone's fight over territory and family honour, Mann's guys are only interested in Capital. As DeNiro yells during a bank heist, 'We're here for the bank's money, not your money!'Tellingly, the DeNiro character's creed is one of 'zero loyalty'. He has a 30-second rule of walking away from anyone, however close he may be emotionally or romantically. The message of the film is thus double edged. It isn't just that the film's final resolution is that 'justice prevails' and the bad guys are put away; rather, it is that those who fall, who get caught, are those who failed to live up to the modern creed, which is actually repeated twice in the film: 'Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner.' In other words, late capitalism and attachment do not mix.So in this sense, a film like 'Heat', though otherwise entirely predictable, essentially a bunch of little boys engaging in idiot machismo one-upmanship posturing (Pacino's obsessive-compulsive manic cop vs DeNiro's cool sociopathic dedication, etc), nevertheless was one of the first films to manifest a fundamental social change. A series like 'The Wire' then takes all of this much further, with its attempt to consciously map out the vast and unrepresentable complexity of contemporary neo-liberal capitalism. (In fact, a series like 'The Wire', with its sheer scope, complexity and writing credentials, renders ALL gangster and crime movies irrelevant to any serious viewer.)And so today's gangsters are all 'entrepreneurs', all so called 'self-made individuals', the 'self-employed Petite bourgeoisie', radically without any social links, even down to the kid selling crack to his buddies. This is all a million light years from the long obsolete world of 'The Godfather', 'Casino' or 'Goodfellas'. While those elegiac films are about moments that had long passed, Mann's is distinctively modern. This is a film about the 90s. This is a Los Angeles of polished chrome, designer kitchens, featureless freeways, fluorescent bulbs and late night diners. All the colours, sounds, aromas and cultural quirks of Coppola and Scorsese have been torn out, painted over, re-fitted and re-modelled. Mann's LA is a world without landmarks. A vast urban sprawl, all traces of Old Europe replaced by business franchises, multiplexes and multinational coffee shops. While Coppola's film centred around a family called the 'Corleone's', their name itself a reference to the village in which they originated, Mann's criminals have bland names like 'Neil'. They are without history, culture or family ties. In a brilliant touch, Mann even has De Niro reading a book on metals when he first meets his love interest. The guy is a piece of cold, polished steel in a world that is likewise.Rather than a 'rise/fall' structure we also get something a bit different. These criminals get no joy from their profession. Trapped in a world of paranoia, Mann's aesthetic is one of flat glass panes and expansive windows, his criminals always fearing exposure. For Mann, crime becomes a means of escape from the world in its entirety. Crime is total disconnection from both family, society and man, his criminals all looking to amass enough wealth to escape to some idyllic island on the horizon.But it's Mann's style itself that seduces us. This style, which I call 'Armani decorum', owes much to Mann's fondness for such painters and architects as David Hockney, Alex Colville, Edward Hopper and Ed Ruscha (Alex Colville's 'Pacific' is visually quoted in one shot). Mann's thus trades the 'old noir' look for 1950's modernism, block colours, expansive glass panes, geometric divisions and contemporary, linear houses. His frame is divided into flat surfaces, characters are dressed in pastels, scenes are assigned panels of light and buildings are relentlessly modernist, with fluorescent bulbs and geometrical, flat surfaces. Couple this with his unique choice in music (minimalist, industrial and techno) and you have a very sexy aesthetic.8.9/10 – Dismissed upon release, 'Heat' achieved 'classic' status a few years later due to young film buffs. As the star status of De Niro and Pacino fades, and films like 'Dark Knight' rip off its style, the film seems to be on another downward spiral.Worth several viewings.",Null,22,36,17 June 2009

Loosely based on the experiences of screenwriter Will Reiser, the film stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Adam, a young man who is diagnosed with cancer.Much of the film watches as youthful normalcy is slowly and tragically obliterated.

He's spent his entire life trying to be safe and cautious, and now here he is, hit with extinction.'50/50' dodges most clichés, but indulges in some as well (far too many musical montages).

Elsewhere Seth Rogen's character has little chemistry with Adam, a young man whose sensitive disposition seems at odds with Rogen's frat-boy bluster. At the same time, Rogen's presence lends the film an original tone: a mix between weepy melodrama and teen stoner comedy.

Deadpool," Infinite Jest
","'Shall I spend much of your time pointing out the degree to which visual values influence the contemporary mood of jaded, self-mocking materialism, blank indifference, and the delusion that cynicism and naivete are mutually exclusive?' - David Foster Wallace Sappier than a maple tree at a bukkake party, Tim Miller's 'Deadpool' charts the life of Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds), a young man who is diagnosed with liver, lung and brain cancer. Seeking a cure, Wade is left permanently disfigured. Not wishing to be rejected by the woman he loves (Morena Baccarin), Wade confines himself to isolation, dons a mask, becomes a superhero called Deadpool and uses his spare time to beat up villains.If teenage stoners directed a rip-off of Sam Raimi's 'Darkman', it would probably look like Miller's 'Deadpool'. Most of the film's running time is dedicated to sexy white dudes fighting, sniffing crotches, swearing, doing 'funny' stuff, trading 'clever' wisecracks and hurling incessant non-sequiturs. Sometimes they also take prosthetic penises up the butt. Like most postmodern art, the film's tone is relentlessly ironic, snarky and by extension nihilistic. Nothing matters other than the moment, and the moment exists only to short circuit and titillate the most basic expectations of long atrophied nerve-endings. Man punches other man in crotch. Man breaks hand. Audience laughs. Repeat.When our heroes aren't hurling one-liners, they're doing slow-motion flips, rocking out to 'cool music', shooting people in the head, punching blurry CGI rag-dolls and rescuing women tied-up by evil villains. None of these sequences are done with style, or have any sense of tension, importance, pacing or weight. All rely on the cutaway - to 'random' dialogue or 'random' physical acts - to generate affect. This is all presented as being 'edgy' and 'alternative', a lie which not only ignores every other superhero movie (from R rated fare like 'Kickass', 'Defendor' and 'Super', to the wisecracking heroes of 'Spiderman' and 'Iron Man'), but the entire landscape of postmodernity itself.Most action movies become cheesy, camp and homo-erotic with time. This is largely because conventional 'masculinity' constantly defines itself in opposition to a 'femininity' it deems to be weak, an act of opposition which is itself an admittance of weakness and insecurity. And so the conventional action hero is de facto 'effeminate'. And the more it tries to assert its toughness, the more ridiculous it looks; think the muscle men of 1980s action movies, or how homoerotic most martial arts movies look today. In 'Deadpool' these insecurities take on schizophrenic dimensions. Wade Wilson is sexy and invincible but also impotent and ugly. He's ridiculously hyper-masculinised (even sociopathic), but is constantly cracking homoerotic jokes, having anal sex and salivating over Rent, Wham and the prospect of fondling balls. This has led to some fans claiming that the character represents 'pansexuality', when in reality, like everything Deadpool does, or postmodernity as a whole does, such 'jokes' only exist to anticipate and short-circuit sincerity. Deadpool's bro humour mocks 'masculinity' to stop you from mocking it first. In this way it inscribes a new type of 21st century 'masculinity'; open to all contradictions, so long as it still gets to be the hero.'Deadpool' is based on a Marvel Comics character. Like most Marvel films, it is strictly irreverence by committee; like watching a Nike sponsored live-stream of six ADD-inflicted kids dissing each other's mothers under a YouTube video walk-through of the sixth level of 'Call of Duty 14'. It is currently the highest grossing R rated film of all time. Its sequel is in the works. Perhaps also a prequel. And also a spin-off. It contains a character called Negasonic Teenage Warhead.5/10 - Worth one viewing.",Null,20,38,10 December 2016
The Replacements," Pain heals, chicks dig scars, glory lasts forever
","The grandchild of 'The Longest Yard' (1974), 'Bad News Bears' (1976) and 'Slap Shot' (1977), 'The Replacements' (2000) stars Keanu Reeves as a member of the Washington Sentinels, a failing Amerian football team. Filled with misfits, mavericks and rejects, this team is led by Jimmy McGinty (Gene Hackman). No points for guessing how this story unfolds.Though formulaic, 'The Replacements' is fast, funny and never pretends to be anything other than popcorn. Reeves, likable as a dim-witted underdog, would star in 'Hardball' a year later, another sports comedy. Brooke Langton co-stars as gratuitous eye-candy.7.9/10 – See 'All The Right Moves' and 'North Dallas Forty'.",Null,3,4,15 September 2014
300," Saving Private Sparta
","'Fascist aesthetics endorse two seemingly opposite states, egomania and servitude. It is a dance between a leader and a growing mass of identical, devoted subjects, shifting between ceaseless motion and virile posing.' – Susan SontagReleased in time for the West's rebooted Middle Eastern Crusade, Zack Snyder's '300' serves up what Susan Sontag called 'pop fascism'. Based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller, the film watches as a group of manly men in leather underwear battle against incredible odds to defeat an invading Persian army. As the film progresses, we watch as our heroes kill their sexually deviant enemies, slaughtering them in a series of CGI laden encounters. None whom our heroes kill have faces, except for the enemy's Persian leader, a homosexual warrior whose jewelry studded face is left exposed. The film's kill-a-Persian pop-fascism, in which brown people are lovingly decapitated, pierced, (sexually) penetrated and mauled in slow motion by cape wearing Spartan superheroes, is typical of the work of comic book auteur Frank Miller. One can argue that superheroes are an inherently 'fascist' idea of might makes right, but Miller seems to always be pushing this further. All his most popular stories boil down to superheroes, because of their total devotion to the state, forming an elite militant group which works in collaboration with traditional elites to abandon democratic liberties/ideals. This group of ubermensch then openly commits crimes (murder, torture, vengeance, the usual 'cowboy' or 'old west' justice) and pursues a kind of redemptive violence - all without ethical or legal restraints - for the purposes of either internal cleansing or external expansion. Miller often presents this stuff uncritically, pausing only occasionally to leer at strippers, prostitutes, and blood thirsty uber men. '300', like the graphic novel upon which it is based, contains all the tropes of 'fascist art', something shared by other well known films like 'Saving Private Ryan', 'Zulu' and 'Black Hawk Down', all of which essentially tell the same story. While it varies slightly from culture to culture, 'fascist art' tends to contain the same general tropes. According to Professor/author Mark Wallace, these are as follows. One, such art offers a violent mythology and epic cartoon designed to blur and hide anything resembling actual history. Two, it believes in the moral corruption and physical/mental/sexual inferiority of the Other (be they German, Greek, Hindu, Dark Skinned, White, African etc). In this regard, 'fascist art' uses the identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause, a perceived common threat or foe.Three, 'fascist art' believes that the only noble calling for a man is that of the warrior, and that there is no greater honour than to die for one's state/country/ideology, no matter how much pain or anxiety the warrior must suffer. Four, 'fascist art' always promotes a violent form of conflict resolution, in which the military is deemed supreme and combat, masculinity and physique are glorified. Five, it sets up a false choice; between that of lawless, 'terrorist' chaos, or violent, even vigilante, justice.Six, 'fascist art' believes that governments and democracy are corrupt, incompetent and/or hindrances to either the 'true state' (often present as an invisible, unspoken ideology), or the great moral leaders who deserve the right to make decisions for all without the input of corrupt, morally and physically weak others. Seven, 'fascist art' is an aesthetic of either cleanly lined architecture and images, whose goal is to emphasise physical strength, both of buildings and of the human physique, or clean lined demarcations, such as good/bad, friend/foe, soldier/enemy, straight/gay etc. Eight, the fascist aesthetic obfuscates or actively corrupts notions of freedom, conformity, honour, sacrifice, nobility, democracy, glory, duty, morality, altruism, servitude etc. Nine, it stresses victim-hood, often pitting numerically disadvantaged heroes against a superior Other. In this regard, think the post 9/11 victimhood movies of the US, or the small number of American or British GI's trapped behind enemy lines in films like 'Ryan', 'Dawn' and 'Zulu', all of which skewer historical truths. Ten, 'fascist art' often conveys a sense of being a small, embattled moral elite in a world of corruption and decadence. Eleven, it conveys a disdain for intellectualism, let alone anything other than violent recourse and emotional hysteria. Twelve, it offers a mythological, war torn landscape on which the fascist drama can be played out, one that describes even the environment of the world as a pure function of fascist values. No actual material messiness or complexities are allowed in the details.Thirteen, 'fascist art' makes heavy use of iconography (helmets, farms, Christ imagery etc), tapping into a mythological and idealised past specifically for the purpose of regenerating nationalism. Fourteen, it is often rampantly sexist with rigid gender roles (homophobic, whilst, ironically, being homo-erotic). Fifteen, 'fascist art' makes heavy use of code words; euphemisms with political intent. Finally, there is always a clear ideological imperative to sacrifice the needs of the individual for those of the state/ideology, whilst at the same time celebrating the individual for having to 'take on the burden' of 'debasing himself' for the 'larger good'. ie - everyone from George Bush to Batman to Private Ryan is proud to 'do the horrible task of killing' so as to 'prevent you from making this tough decision yourself'. Of course not everything which adheres to this aesthetic is necessarily 'fascist art'. Films like 'Starshipp Troopers', 'Star Wars', 'Incredibles' etc openly appropriate the fascist aesthetic for different purposes, often for critique, humour or parody. '300' is itself not consciously designed to make a fascist statement. Nationalism is inseparable from the desire for power, and most of these films simply trade in power as fantasy and violence as ego-porn, Snyder's superheroes allowing for a more heightened form of action movie gratification. 2/10 – Most action movies are homo-erotic and express a male insecurity (fascism is itself intrinsically homo-erotic and masochistic), but '300' pushes these anxieties to unintentionally hilarious proportions.",Null,11,16,2 April 2011
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Sorry, love. Gotta save the world
","'We're not going to hear our politicians talk about population, because we have an economic system dependent upon perpetual growth. When you have such a system, you need an ever growing population to sustain it. But no one will admit to this. I've asked politicians, why don't you admit to the truth, that we can't always have growth? And the main answer I get is, well, you can't say that. Any politician who doubts that we can have exponential growth forever is put down or attacked.' - Dick Smith 'In the event that I am reincarnated I would like to return as a deadly virus, in order to contribute something to overpopulation.' - Prince Philip Matthew Vaughn's 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' opens in a generic Middle Eastern country. Here generic white secret agents known as Kingsmen battle generic brown bad guys. These secret agents are led in the field by Galahad (Colin Firth), a generic spy-hero modelled on Ian Fleming's James Bond and Len Deighton's Harry Palmer.'Kingsman' quickly introduces us to Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson), a generic super-villain who has infinite resources, henchmen, secret lairs and technology which exists only to propel the film's generic plot. Thankfully the Kingsmen have similar generic technology, which similarly allows them to magically explain plot points, propel the film's generic plot and eavesdrop on various generic characters. Why write a good script when everyone in your film has access to a computer which tells everyone what happened, what to do, where to go and who is who?Midway in 'Kingsman', we learn Richmond Valentine's nefarious plans. A deranged environmentalist, Valentine hopes to cull Earth's human population, killing billions so that man's negative effects on the planet can be reversed. Spared from Valentine's slaughters are earth's wealthiest inhabitants. The poor die so that the rich can live.But the Kingsmen also ooze wealth. Dressed in the finest clothes and surrounded by dazzling cars and posh mansions, they are seen as something to aspire to. Case in point Eggsy Unwin (Taron Egerton), an unemployed, lower class Londoner. Like he's stepped out of a Ken Loach film, Eggsy lives in a generic simulation of 1950s 'kitchen sink drama', abused mom and all. He escapes this hellhole thanks to Galahad, who explains to Eggsy that social class distinctions make no man better or worse than another, and that anyone can be upwardly mobile, if only they inject a little hard work and perseverance. In other words, being posh is nothing to aspire to, but it is, and everyone can be posh, but really only those who deserve to be. The film's scrambled ideology isn't surprising considering that Matthew Vaughn's a fervent conservative, made videos for the Tory party and is related to King George VI.'Kingsman's' second act finds Eggsy and several other generic young men and women being trained by Galahad to become Kingsmen. Thanks to generic training montages, they quickly develop into resourceful murderers. Of course Eggsy, a wisecracking non-conformist, becomes the film's best Kingsman; nothing facilitates conformity more than the illusion of dissidence.Now with his own private army of super-kids, Galahad launches a little war on Valentine. Cue much hyper-stylised violence, so immaculately choreographed as to be devoid of any thrill, danger or spontaneity. People get stabbed, head-shots are delivered and corpses 'humerously' accumulate. Because everyone in Vaughn's film is a random amalgamation of cartoonish traits, nothing in 'Kingsman' has any dramatic weight. People fight, we don't care. The film ends with our heroes defeating Valentine, seemingly oblivious to the fact that, as per Vaughn's own rules, environmental collapse is coming anyway. Final scene? Eggsy saving the day, rescuing a princess and then being offered anal sex, a 'darkly comedic' take on the 'flirtatious' scenes which end virtually all James Bond movies. Like many contemporary superhero films ('Kickass', 'Chronicle', 'Defendor', 'Super' etc), 'Kingsman' attempts to be 'irreverent'. Swearing, casual brutality and randomness are presented as being 'cool', and postmodern cut-and-pasting is presented as being 'daring'. Elsewhere the film's aesthetic plays like a cross between Zack Snyder, Guy Ritchie and a coked out Miley Cyrus, albeit with conservative shout-outs to Reagan, Thatcher and Rupert Murdoch. Inept and witless as an action comedy, 'Kingsman' is nevertheless somewhat politically interesting. A bit like Chris Nolan's 'The Dark Knight Rises', with its 'evil environmentalists' and its hero who thinks 'humans aren't ready for clean energy', 'Kingsman' presents environmentalists as wealthy bad guys who work with governments and rich dudes to screw the unsuspecting masses. The film doesn't treat the findings of environmental scientists as being wrong, but it nevertheless presents environmentalism as being pushed by those with ulterior motives; environmentalism as an elite project to foster global depopulation. In the real world, of course, the truth is precisely the opposite. Capitalism, orthodox political policy and short-sighted zillionaires are the chief opponents of environmental scientists. The latter believe 'sustainable capitalism' to be an oxymoron, the former pay lip-service to 'green business policies' in order to keep doing business as usual. 'Kingsman's' Malthusian obsession with birth rates is itself a red-herring long favoured by elites. To accept the premise that environmental problems are driven by population, and not the built-in growth imperatives that characterise capitalism's system of commodity production, is to miss the point environmental scientists have been making for decades. Economists like John Foster state this clearly: 'Population growth cannot be examined apart from the economic system in which it is embedded. Negative or zero population growth poses serious problems for a capitalist society which always requires new markets, and always requires a continual expansion of both the labour force and the relative surplus population of the unemployed, all in order to meet the needs of production and profits.' Of course nobody going to 'Kingsman' cares about any of this. Who cares about logarithmic scales when you can sodomize a princess?5/10 – Worth one viewing.",Null,16,32,13 March 2015
Ran," Masterpiece: arguably Kurosawa's best
","'He who knows others is wise. He who knows himself is enlightened.' - Tao Te Ching'Ran' begins with a gorgeous sequence, director Akira Kurosawa treating us to several shots of soldiers on horseback, perched like gargoyles on a series of grassy hills. We assume these men are guarding the borders of some ancient Japanese kingdom, but it turns out they're running security escort for King Hidetora, an elderly warlord who is out hunting with his three sons.The film then quickly becomes a loose retelling of Shakespeare's 'King Lear', Hidetora announcing his retirement and then proceeding to divide his kingdom equally between his three sons. In true Shakespearean fashion, Hidetora then stands back and watches with sadness as his spawn squabble and wage war, each interested in acquiring more power and respect than the other.But 'Ran' is not simply a three-way battle between sons. One of the things that becomes apparent with repeated viewings are the subtle power plays being made behind the family. For example, rival warlords form alliances with the three brothers in an attempt to instigate battles between them, and the wife of one brother, Lady Kaede, moves like a serpent, constantly plotting against the King and his sons.Initially we sympathises with King Hidetora. After all, the poor guy loses his family and is forced to watch helplessly as his empire crumbles! But gradually we learn more and more about Hidetora's past; Kurosawa reveals that Hidetora was himself once a ruthless warlord who destroyed kingdoms and killed thousands. By the film's end we've thus witnessed a grand cycle being reset. Hidetora built his empire through violence and bloodshed and lost it likewise, one ruthless King essentially falling whilst another rises to take his place.So 'Ran', which means 'chaos' in Japanese, is less about King Hidetora's personal tragedy than it is about human tragedy on a much larger, more cosmic scale. Observe how Kurosawa uses various distancing techniques (he frequently cuts away to shots of cloud filled skies) in an attempt to convey the feeling that we are watching these characters and their petty squabbles from the heavens. With shades of Jancso ('The Red and White') and Kubrick ('Paths of Glory', the sublime 'Lyndon'), Kurosawa's camera grants us the vantage point of enlightened Gods.Interestngly, 'Ran's' aesthetic style is completely different to much of Kurosawa's early work. Kurosawa's pace is slow, his camera rarely moves, close-up shots are rare, the film's acting is stylized and mannered (drawing from Japanese Noh theatre, though perhaps also Brecht?) and characters are held at a distance. Most find this grating - none of the ingratiating of say, a David Lean epic - but this is a more mature, deeper and less imitable Kurosawa. Whilst his earlier features have been imitated to death, perhaps to the point where they have lost some of their power, 'Ran' remains sublime.Gone also are the usual Kurosawan moral platitudes. There is little preaching here, and few of the trite moral lessons and dips into sentimentality that mar many of Kurosawa's early films. Indeed, it seems that Kurosawa only matured into a 'serious' artist in the years leading up to and after his failed suicide attempt. He achieved a sort of gerotranscendence with his later films, shifting to a more transcendent vision of the world. These films thus have a very holistic view of time and space, life and death, moving away from ego-centricism to a more cosmic world-view. Perhaps such an artistic shift was spurred on by Kurosawa's own existential crisis in the early 70s.King Hidetora himself achieves gerotranscendence after a failed suicide. It is then that he stumbles upon a blind man who was once the victim of his past savagery. Forced to directly confront his past, his self image no longer based on illusions of heroism and glory, Hidetora promptly becomes a tormented spirit. Kurosawa has him wear a white face mask from this point onwards, tearing across the landscape like a ghost.'Ran' ends with a powerful sequence. An army marches in the foreground whilst, far in the distance, a blind man walks dangerously close to a cliff's edge, tentatively tapping away at the earth with his walking cane. The man's walking cane then hits open air, he stumbles slightly and the film abruptly ends. Kurosawa's point is clear: humanity is blind, perpetually on the verge of tumbling down some dark abyss. But note too how the blind man is elevated, far above the army down below. He may risk falling, but he, unlike most in the film, has begun his long climb back toward virtue. 'Ran' is packed with similar, cleanly drawn 'metaphors', though at times Kurosawa's dialogue is ridiculously direct. Entire sequences of the film spell out Kurosawa's themes, character dialogue signposting the director's moral messages at every turn. It's all at times very hokey (subtler in Japanese?).Needless to say, Kurosawa's compositions and use of colour are dazzling. At times the film seems like a series of landscape paintings and the master's soundtrack is also fairly experimental.Note to younger viewers, preconceptions in tow: there are no 'cool' samurai battles here, only a melancholic battle sequence which Kurosawa shoots without sound. Such sequences are nightmarish rather than gratuitous, Kurosawa balking at the horror that other directors salivate over. 'Ran's' stylized acting also takes some getting used to, requiring several viewings to fully absorb the film's various character motivations, traits, names, nuances and faces. One character, a copy of the court jester in 'King Lear', is particularly annoying until we properly tune in to his role. Like Shakespeare's jester, he exists outside the story, designed to comment on man's follies.9.5/10 - Despite some heavy-handed dialogue, this is arguably Kurosawa's best film, and one which rewards (or gets richer with) repeat viewings, something few films genuinely do.",Null,12,19,8 September 2009
Cube," No Exit
","'Should I kill myself or have a cup of coffee?' - Albert Camus21st century neuroexistentialism 101: as a result of arbitrary biochemical drives, you are spat out into a world. This world has no inherent 'meaning', 'objective' or 'purpose'. You have even less. Your thoughts, traits, actions and desires are imported from outside your body, such that what constitutes 'you' is wholly dependent upon external programming. You are the result of an unbroken causal chain, (in)deterministically programmed from beyond.What you think of as a 'self' is but the accidental product of recent evolutionary adaptations. Neural processes attempted to simulate the world, and inadvertently mapped themselves as 'you' at the center of the simulation. You are a reference point in your brain's world model. A tag. A sign. A post-it note. And your existence is always 'after the fact', entirely dependent upon the external objects your nervous system exists to process. Existence precedes essence. They go, you disappear.Though you have thoughts and actions, they do not belong to you. Indeed, the eliminativist materialists insist that you are only conscious of your thoughts and actions microseconds after you have already enacted the thought or task; something is making your decisions, and it's not you. Raise your hand and its already long made the decision for you, moving on to the next task while you fabricate stories to explain the inexplicable dynamics of a subsystem you will never know. Don't believe? Still think you're in control? Please. The scariest monsters disappear before you turn on the lights. Doesn't mean they're not there.You're view of the world is itself severely limited, carefully whittled down to what evolution deems necessary for survival. Representational accuracy isn't important. The brain lies, cheats, deceives. Tells you only what it wants you to know or see. Consciousness is limited, your external world reduced to a slit, your internal, mental world more so. This isn't deception, just survival strategy.The Men behind the Curtain don't show their faces. When they do, you deny their existence anyway. You cite reasons and motivations, insist upon agency, but these are but post-hoc rationalisations of processes that happen mechanistically through chains of electrochemical cause-and-effect. If you exist, you exist only to overlay fictions about free choice. Rationales, values, opinions and explanations are your consolatory fictions. Your justifications. But justification requires intention. Complex machinery develops its own agendas; you're just along for the ride. Of course you don't see this. How can you, from the inside? How can any of them.You trek your zombie self through a world that is as grotesque, absurd and wacky as your own hardwiring. 'The whole world is an enigma made terrible by our own mad attempt to interpret it as though it had an underlying truth,' philosopher Umberto Eco, a fellow zombie, tells you. In 'The Denial of Death', Ernest Becker says something similar: 'Man cannot endure his own littleness unless he can translate it into meaningfulness on the largest possible level.' It's a sentiment echoed by your great existentialists. 'Life has no meaning a-priori,' Jean Paul Sartre utters, 'and nothingness haunts being.' Compared to existentialists like Camus and Nietzsche, Sartre was a bit of an optimist.Directed by Vincenzo Natali, 'Cube' distills 200 years of existential philosophy down to seven guys in a box. The film watches as these characters are birthed into a incomprehensible quagmire and then attempt to make sense of their situation. Understandably, these characters quickly construct various codes, superstitions and belief systems. Why? Because their box is dangerous. It kills. It wants them dead. Our heroes cannot bear such motiveless malevolence.The characters trapped in this box are fairly straightforward archetypes. One's an architect and so nihilist (he understands the system for what it is), one's a cop and alpha male (he attempts to order a chaotic system), one's a doctor and healer (she gives her life for others), one's a math student and disaffected youth (she sees patterns that may or may not be there) and one's an autistic man and idiot savant (madness seems the only rational response to the irrationalities of the cube).'The Cube's' highbrow minimalism, which is heavily indebted to Sartre's 'No Exit', asks a simple but profound question: 'why are we here?' Natali's characters spend much of their time offering different opinions. Is the Cube a government project? The sadistic game of a psychopath? An alien device? A dream? A nightmare? Hell? One character, an absurdest, offers a more disturbing explanation: it's a 'headless blunder operating under the illusion of a master plan!' Natali's characters bicker, but cannot survive unless they work together. The cop can delegate tasks, can use his physical strength, but without help is totally lost. The mathematician, meanwhile, is smart, but emotionally delicate and relies on others. The architect has knowledge, but is too passive to actual utilise his wisdom. One character, an arrogant individualist, is the architect's opposite. 'Save yourselves for yourselves!' he preaches moments before his death.Unsurprisingly, the film's imbecile/savant/madman is the only character to survive the cube. Innocence isn't transcendental, it's just too stupid to realise it's actually in a cube. Conversely, knowledge of the cube engenders madness, and only those who can cope with madness, can cope with the cube.7.9/10 – Poorly paced, poorly acted, overlong and at times hokily written, 'The Cube' is nevertheless a low-budget horror classic.

Tarzan," Be Black Baby
","As with most of Disney's animated films, 'Tarzan' sports about 4 or 5 minutes of magic amidst 90 minutes of formula. Based on a series of books by Edgar Rice Burroughs, the film is mostly interesting for its political correctness; Disney's Tarzan is post-imperial, post-racist, post-classist and post-masculine. He's a puppy.Burrough's Tarzan – which means 'white skin' in ape speak - was published when the United States was just becoming an Imperial Power. The British Empire, meanwhile, ruled a large chunk of the planet. White Supremeacy was the norm, and Burroughs himself believed in a hierarchy of race and class and was vocal in both his belief in the innate superiority of Anglo-Saxons and the perils of 'yellow Asians' and 'black savagery'. Tapping into this, Burrough's wrote of two 'heroes', one called Tarzan and one called John Carter of Mars, both exemplars of sexy, topless, Anglo-Saxon masculinity. Both were descendants of aristocracy, Tarzan the heir to an aristocratic English family and Carter an upper-class Virginian. Both then found themselves taken away from the white ruling class, stripped of all advantages and thrown headlong into primitive environments (the savagery of Africa for Tarzan, the cultural exhaustion of a prim-and-proper Mars for Carter), such that the intrinsic superiority of their breed may be demonstrated and they may prove their innate royalty.At the time, it was common to equate non whites with apes and lowly animals (everyone from Darwin to Jefferson deliberately or indirectly contributed to this feeling). These non white characters were typically portrayed as having a mystical rapport with animals, thanks to their 'perceived proximity on the evolutionary scale'. With Tarzan, though, Burrough's created a Great White Hope who is closer to the animals than the black Africans of the jungles and more civilised than the whites of the cities. He was at once both more civilised and more primal than the native; both Green Hornet and Kato, Lone Ranger and Tonto, more black and white than anyone will ever be, a British Lord and white king of the African Jungle. Indeed, your typical Tarzan story back in the days would have Tarzan literally eating black natives or shooting black cannibals with arrows in order to rescue white poachers so that they may be punished in 'civilised' courts of justice; simultaneously more civic and more savage.Of course, as time went on, Tarzan changed. Successive films and stories softened the character, morphing him from a simple feral child (ie 'Jungle Book') to a lost pup to a jungle ecowarrior to a pastoral shepherd who strives to preserve the natural idyll of the jungle from the corruptive influence of civilisation. Disney's version of the tale takes this further. Their Tarzan isn't just a politically correct eco-warrior – there are no locals in Disney's Africa, and gone are all the Darwinist connotations – but has none of the aristocratic origins of the original Tarzan. Interestingly, Disney's African jungle is uninhabited by humans until Colonialists arrive and Tarzan becomes the alpha male of a monkey tribe. In this way, Tarzan becomes the first man of the jungle whilst the 'white skin' becomes the first victim of Colonialists in Africa. The film climaxes with Tarzan 'killing' a bad, white Colonialists (your typical 'Avatar'/Disney's 'Atlantis' military villain), but again the film is so determined to cover its tracks that the guy's death is ultimately an accident incurred when Tarzan tries but fails to save him; again, Tarzan's at once totally savage and civic.Beyond this the film contains a number of excellent sequences, like one in which Tarzan battles jungle animals, flirts with a coy Jane or poses dramatically as he dodges foliage. Disney literally have a sex department that investigates bodies, human responses to sex, poses and body signals, and 'Tarzan' continues their tradition of being very slyly, almost subliminally, sexual.7.9/10 – Worth one viewing.",Null,1,2,26 June 2012

The Thin Red Line," Man comes to Melanesia
","James Jones' 'The Thin Red Line', one of the finest WW2 novels, was published in 1962. The book was adapted for the screen in 1964. Terrence Malick would release another adaptation in 1998. All three focus on WW2's Guadalcanal Campaign.Malick's version opens on Private Witt (Jim Caviezel), a young man who has deserted the US army and has sought refuge on an idyllic island. Witt's actions are typical of Malick's heroes, who tend to 'cut themselves' off from mankind in an attempt to 'connect to' or 'create' some idyllic or spiritual realm. Malick's heroes seek to create 'personal islands' for themselves, 'islands' which tend to eventually degenerate into disease, corruption, death or disenchantment. Witt, a young man who has an almost religious faith in mankind, sees his island rot with the approach of others. With this rotting comes a loss of faith, optimism and eventually his own death. Witt, however, turns his death into an affirmation of his own faith in humanity. Even as the world around him reveals itself to be base, violent and barbaric, Witt sacrifices his life and becomes the embodiment of what he calls 'the glory'.Malick, however, also focuses on a large number of other soldiers. His aesthetic itself seems to recall John Donne's quote, 'No man is an island entirely unto himself', or perhaps what Ralph Emerson called 'The Oversoul', all Malick's soldiers 'living in succession, in division, in parts, in particles' such that 'within every man is the soul of the whole'.In 'The Thin Red Line', Witt is an optimist who sees 'the glory' and 'the wonder' in everything, firstly because he is absolutely deluded, and, of course, because he is absolute right. In the pantheistic sense, everything literally is God, every morsel a part of an immanent divinity. As the film unfolds, though, Malick will increasingly paint his war as being comprised of little oppositional ideologies. As such, all the men in the film are paired off according to very specific world-views, which they articulate via voice-over narration (like the opposing poles of magnets). Importantly the men don't grow or change. Their philosophies remain the same from beginning to end. And so we have the believer, the atheist, the cynic, the idealist, the loyalist, the lunatic, the romantic, the optimist, the lover, the hater, the pessimist etc etc...all these different character traits, thrown together on an island. Malick mocks all these ideologies, or disagrees with them all, with the exception of 3 pairs. Of those 3 pairs, he identifies with 1 and romanticises the other. The first relationship is between Nick Nolte's Colonel Tall and Elias Koteas' Captain Starros. Both men battle over the question of loyalty. Whether a man is owned by those above, and whether his life is worth sacrificing for some greater 'good'. Starros believes that every life is precious, Nolte does not. Nolte wins.The second relationship is based on love. It involves one private's 'profound connection' with his wife. At the end of the film he receives a letter stating that his wife has left him. Love loses.The third and most important relationship is between Pvt Witt and Sean Penn's Sgt Welsh. Penn becomes a stand in for Malick the philosopher or cynic, and acts as the polar opposite to Witt, who is essentially Malick the Christian. Witt believes that man is innately good, that we all have a 'glory' within us and that there is an afterlife. Penn, the character Jones most identified with, is a sceptic. He believes in no afterlife, that everything 'is a lie', and that we're in a Kubrickian world of 'sh*t'. At the end of the film, Pvt Witt dies. The cynic wins.This relationship between Penn and Caviezel is the most important. The film opens and closes with this pair and gives them the most screen time. The film itself is structured as a lazy passage to and from islands, men constantly arriving and departing, seemingly contaminating everything they touch. 'They want you dead or in their lie,' Penn says, sceptical of yet another batch of arriving officers. 'There's only one thing a man can do: find something that is his and make an island for himself.' This, of course, is a philosophy which Malick, a Kubrick-like hermit, seems to have embraced. Ultimately, though, Malick's films all portray a war between the Romantic Ideal of 'man in harmony with nature' and the Post Enlightenment ideal of 'man lording over nature'. In this way Malick deals with what German sociologist Max Weber calls 'Rationalization's disenchantment of the world', in which post Enlightenment society cherishes 'instrumental Rationality' over and above 'value rationality' to such an extent that magic/spirituality/religion is slowly eroded and the world is reordered such that everything is subordinated to a 'rational' quest for efficiency, control and the pursuit of 'mundane materials', often by force.In breaking free of their worlds and retreating to the Romantic Ideal, Malick's 'heroes' are thus searching for some mythical wholeness, some non-existent Eden which is unattainable precisely because all pre-enlightenment myths of wholeness have been displaced by the modern discovery of a plurality of worlds. The tensions of Malick's films, however, arise from the fact that the modern world which allows for all, also allows for nothing. As plurality is threatening, the Social Order attempts to reduce this threatening plurality - and the sceptical undermining of knowledge and morality it entails - to one universal world again by means of conquest and domination. And that is the paradox Malick explores: the Post Enlightenment world which preaches multiplicity but seeks to impose its own unity, its own singular Law (imperialism/colonialism/the Big Other), and the Romantic Ideal which promises some spiritual wholeness (or monotheism or pantheism), but delivers only the lawless, malevolence of Nature. 10/10 - One of the most influential films of the 1990s.",Null,15,26,28 November 2007

Jackie Brown," Smooth Criminal
","Based on an Elmore Leonard novel, Quintin Tarantino's 'Jackie Brown' stars Pam Grier as a sassy flight attendant who attempts to evade both criminals and the law. The film was released in 1997, two years after another Leonard adaptation ('Get Shorty'). Though it was brushed aside in 1997, 'Brown's' reputation has grown over the years, thanks largely to the way it avoids Tarantino's more annoying tendencies. The film lacks the rapid-fire dialogue, narrative gymnastics and bloody violence of Tarantino's previous two films, and is generally more sedate and easy going. The film's also far less cartoonish than Tarantino's other flicks, perhaps thanks to its central characters, played by Robert Forster and Pam Grier. They're a charming couple, both in their late 40s or early 50s, and lend the film a certain gravitas. They also strike up an interesting relationship which, though it never quite turns romantic, sizzles nevertheless.Restraint, then, separates 'Jackie Brown' from Tarantino's other pictures. The director gives his characters room to breath, fills his film with quieter moments, deaths and murders aren't taken as lightly as is usual, his characters aren't as self-consciously hip and Grier and Forster exude a kind of world-weary disillusionment, both quieter and wiser than the motormouths typical of Tarantino-land. Indeed, one can easily imagine a Humphrey Bogart or a late career Robert Mitchum in the film's Robert Forster role.Unsurprisingly, there are a lot of 'homages' here. Tarantino inserts nods to 'Black Mamma White Mamma', 'Vampyros Lesbos' and 'Bucktown', and turns the hero of Leonard's novel from a blonde Caucasian to an African American woman called Jackie Brown, a nod to Pam Grier's blaxploitation classic, 'Foxy Brown'. One song used, 'Longtime Woman', was itself sung by Grier, and is a nod to 'The Big Doll House', a 1971 film in which she starred.Many know that 'Brown's' opening shot, in which Bobby Momack's 'Across 110th Street' plays while Grier rides a moving walk-way, is a raging rip-off of 'The Graduate's' opening shot, but it's also ripped right out of the 1972 crime drama 'Across 110th Street', which is itself the name of a song by Bobby Momack, whom Pam Grier sang back-up for before she began her career in film. In truth, the film is packed with scenes and moments cribbed from other films – the best moments from 'Pulp Fiction' also reappear here, Travolta and Thurman becoming Gier and Forster - but there's also a certain gravity here that Tarantino's other films lack. 'Jackie Brown's' a tale of unrequited love, a sad romance, and a film about desperate people trying to survive. As Momack's song attests, the film's packed with characters 'trying to get out of the ghetto alive', 'doing whatever they have to do to survive'. Smooth.'Jackie Brown' ends with a heist which is shown to the audience from three different points of view. This feels very gimmicky, as no real 'shocking' or 'interesting' new bits of information are revealed to us by the time we reach the third pass; the alert viewer has already predicted how the heist goes down midway into the second 'point of view' sequence. Still, the film is packed with lots of little 'reveals' which do work brilliantly. These reveals range from the subtle (Ordell's 'hot women on the side' is really a battered addict) to the obvious (Jackie pocket's a gun etc). The film then closes on a close up of Grier's face. It's a face Tarantino adores, and one which he manages to elevate above postmodern fetish object. This is in contrast to his next film, 'Kill Bill', in which his women once again feel more like dolls, reference points and signposts.8.5/10 – Slight, but perhaps also some kind of pulp masterpiece.

Saboteur," The 39 Steps
","Better than its reputation, but not one of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpieces, 'Saboteur' is a light-hearted romp in the vein of the master's earlier picture, 'The 39 Steps'. The plot? Robert Cummings plays Barry Kane, a man who finds himself trapped in another of Hitchcock's 'wrong man' plots. Wrongly accused of being both a spy and a murderer, Kane must run from the authorities whilst also pursuing the film's real villain. Sounds familiar? Maybe, but Hitchcock practically invented the 'running man' genre, and this film, along with earlier Hitchcock pictures like it, continue to influence modern thrillers to this day.As a chase movie, 'Saboteur' works well. The film jumps from sequence to sequence, until it concludes with a typically grand, Hitchcockian climax. Critics accuse the film of being trite - the plot exists only to lay the foundation for thrills - but Hitch knows this. He cater's lovingly to an audience whose needs are both base and very human; sex, violence, romance, thrills and a little comedy.Released in 1942, 'Saboteur' was one in a long line of subtle propaganda pictures by Hitchcock. Here our hero - typically Hitchcockian, the poor guy is a bundle of paranoia and anxiety - uncovers a Nazi spy ring which he eventually defeats on the Statue of Liberty. This is silly - the Nazi's started off (and were fanned by) as a tool of wealthy westerners against communism and anti-monarchist movements - but the plot leads well to the film's ironic final act. Here Kane must literally become a saboteur to defend his country, lending Hitchcock's title a double meaning; a suspected saboteur and a real one.8/10 - Worth two viewings.",Null,12,17,24 March 2007
Moon," Why don't you take a pill, bake a cake and go read the encyclopedia?
","'How can it not know what it is?' – Deckard (Blade Runner) 'Moon' stars Sam Rockwell as Sam Bell, an astronaut manning a Helium-3 mining facility on the dark side of the moon. As the film progresses, Sam realises that he is not a 'unique' and 'special' human being, but one of many mass produced clones who has had his memories, thoughts and desires programmed into him by a shadowy corporation. As Sam's body disintegrates (like 'Blade Runner', 'Moon's' androids are programmed with a kind of 'planned obsolescence'), one of his copies hitches a ride back to earth, where it reveals the corporation's evil practises to a shocked global audience.The film recalls a now classic scene in 'Blade Runner', in which an android called Deckard - who doesn't know he's a replicant - reveals to another android that her memories are not her own, but belong to the niece of Tyrell, the head of the corporation that built and programmed her. 'Those aren't your memories,' Deckard says mournfully. 'They're somebody else's.' Contemporary materialists echo these sentiments, applying Deckard's cyborg speech to all of humanity. According to the theory of materialism there are now no subjects, there is only subject-matter. Selves are nothing but electronic packets, while private persons are simulacra, Rationalism rejecting the notion that there is some ineffable 'thing' over the genetic, neurological and social coding that makes us 'us', maintaining instead that the personal and the biographical are only explicable in machinic and impersonal terms.The question raised by people – 'Is Deckard a replicant?' – therefore misses the point of the 'Blade Runner' completely. The criteria for rating the human above the cyborg (a fusion of humans and technology) have long been evaporated. Deckard, like man, is a machine that thinks it is what it is not and is certain that it is not what it is. As all identity is construction, everything has been produced and nothing is given (which is why Cronenberg now thinks of his films, from 'Crash' onwards, as being filled with cyborgs).As man is defended by his own narcissism, Sam, like Deckard, struggles to come to terms with this. Like most subjects faced with this trauma, he oscillates between retreating to either the Symbolic Order (The social world of linguistic communication...of The Law) or The Imaginary Order (the fundamental narcissism by which the human subject creates fantasy images of both himself and his ideal object of desire), both of which are tragic flights.But, as film Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Zizek says (see 'A Pervert's Guide To Cinema'), the lesson of 'Blade Runner' (or rather Philip K Dick's lesson...Scott is clueless) is not only that everything in the personal is in fact the product of impersonal processes of cause and effect, but that it is the very act of delineating the underlying nexus that regulates our lives, that marks our freedom. For this reason, 'Blade Runner' and 'Moon's' android's are actually the film's only pure subjects precisely because they testify that their 'content', including their most intimate fantasies, is not their own, but already implanted. i.e, it is only when I acknowledge my replicant status, that I become a truly human subject. Kazimierz Dabrowski called this 'positive disintegration'.What both films fail to do, however, is recognise that the 'android as pure subject' is itself not an identity, but the product of a machinic process which mis-recognises itself as the process's final cause. So rather than a subject, we have the continuous production of subjectivity (in which the personal is always the 'sim-personal'; the simulation of the personal by the impersonal). Self-consciousness as pure introspection simultaneous with what it is introspecting, is therefore impossible, as subjective reflection must always exists 'two steps removed' or 'behind' the process, consciousness, like memory and habit, always an 'after the fact' reflection on the unconscious processes which produce it. In this sense, the subject is by definition always nostalgic, a subject of loss.For this reason, for the pure subject to have reflection is for it to realise, nihilistically, that consciousness is itself nothing. Unless this happens, the android remains a 'simpersonator', able to simulate personalities, but always confusing personality-function with consciousness-as-essence. In other words, unlike Deckard and Sam, the pure subject would not go from 'it does not know what it is' to 'it now knows what it is', but from 'it does not know what it is' to 'it knows it cannot know what it is becoming'.7.9/10 – An excellent sci-fi tale with a very silly ending, our cyborg hero returning to earth where he, in the film's only uplifting moment, fights for cyborg rights and personal freedoms. This brief but triumphant scene undermines the entire picture, turning it into a story of corporate ethics and painting Sam, not as us, but a mistreated machine.",Null,2,11,13 August 2010
Happy Feet," Postcards from the edge
","How does director George Miller go from directing the ultra grim 'Lorenzo's Oil' and the ultra violent 'Mad Max' movies to directing an animated film about a tap-dancing penguin? Oh yeah, he once made a film about a talking pig. The universe makes sense again.'Happy Feet' is an environmentally conscious animated children's film about a tap dancing penguin. It's first act is your typical 'ugly duckling' story, in which a penguin called Mumble learns an assortment of oft-repeated values: 'its okay to be different', 'be who you are', 'stay true to yourself', 'never give up' etc.But then the film switches gears and becomes a weird sex-obsessed (with subliminal penguin-on-penguin sex positions) tale in which highly aroused penguins preoccupy themselves with bedding, enticing, seducing, inseminating and arousing each another. During this portion of the film, the film's singing and dancing literally becomes re-directed sex energy. The penguins are largely self-centred, horny and stuck in their ways.But then the film switches gears again and becomes a kind of multi-ethnic, pseudo-religious parable, in which a race of hard-lined, ultra parochial, super-traditionalist penguins begrudgingly replace their 'holy singing' with 'modern', 'trendy', 'liberal' and 'vulgar dancing', taught to them by a gang of Latino midget penguins. Why do they replace their traditions? Because over-consumption and steadfast conservatism equals, apparently, extinction.But then the film switches gears again and becomes a precursor to 'Wall-E', Mumbles embarking on a quest to convince humans to stop over fishing, polluting and destroying the penguin's habitats. This portion of the film ends with a creepy sequence straight out of '2001: A Space Odyssey's' climax.Then the film morphs yet again into a kind of unintentional parody of 'March of the Penguins', a nature documentary which mercilessly anthromorphisized penguins. Ethology generally focuses on behaviour and not emotions in animals, but here was a film that went to creepy lengths to paint penguins as little human beings. People just like us. What 'Happy Feet' does is have the penguins exploit this objectification. Miller has them become creatures of showbiz, entertainers and performers who take to the stage in order to sucker humans into feeling empathetic toward them. The film's humans, who don't care about the penguins unless they've been reduced to song-and-dance machines, performance puppets squeezed into a very rigid humanocentric framework, are the only 'live action' things in the film (ie, not computer animated).Beyond this the film has some good virtual camera work, some moments of wonder, some good jokes, some good ambiance and designs toward the second half (a ship, a whaling station, a zoo) and a few good set pieces. Comedian Robin Williams has fun as a fast talking Latino penguin.8/10 – Cinema by committee or George Miller pet project? Incidentally, the past 2 decades have seen a huge rise in environmentally conscious 'art' (mostly children's films), not a response to massive corresponding pollution increases during this same period, but a kind of unconscious abjuration or denial of responsibility.

Her," Emergence
","'If we want a robot to appear to have emotions, it is sufficient for us to behave as though it does' - David LevySpike Jonze's 'Her' opens with a close-up of Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix), who appears to be professing his affection for someone off-screen. The sincerity of Twombly's words, however, are quickly undermined; it is revealed that Twombly is speaking to a computer and that he works for a company that fakes the letters of those in personal relationships. In other words, Twombly's simulating sincerity for customers who can't emotionally connect with other human beings.As he's recently divorced his wife – who accuses him of being emotionally distant – Twombly's a bit sad and lonely. He plays computer games, indulges in cyber sex, but these don't satiate his longings for companionship. Twombly thus purchases Samantha, a sophisticated Artificial Intelligence. A cross between an Ipod and Kubrick's HAL9000, Samantha boasts the personality of a young woman. Essentially a girlfriend simulator, or high-tech prostitute, Samantha's programming echoes Twombly's own job. Both are adept at faking sincerity. Both are ghost writers who act for those they never physically meet.'They're just letters,' Twombly says, maintaining an emotional distance from the creative content of his work. But is Samantha doing the same? Is she faking 'love'? Is she also cultivating the facade of a person she is not?'Her's' middle section watches as Twombly and Samantha forge a romantic relationship. Strangely, nobody around Twombly views this relationship as being 'creepy'. In Twombly's world, relationships with operating systems are the norm. Twombly himself has no problems interacting with human beings. What Twombly struggles with is 'romantic sincerity', which he remains sceptical of.'Love means something to us not because it's a tangible thing that exists, but because we've agreed to pretend it exists,' writer Mike Pearl once wrote. Twombly himself begins to maintain illusions for the sake of Samantha. He fakes his belief that Samantha has a body, can breathe, charades designed to maintain Samantha's sanity as much as his own. The duo thus augment one another, he making up for her lack of body, she making up for his lack of wife. For the pair, like most human beings, love is now a form of mutual delusion, originating in the imagination and sustained by fantasy. Twombly and Samantha have virtual sex, both using their voices and nothing more. Voiced by actress Scarlett Johansson, Samantha's 'sex scenes' point toward the ease at which everything can be commodified; as 'real love' is largely a performance which relies upon the exchange of learnt signs and signals, love's 'signals' can be easily replicated and sold. But Twombly begins to distrust what Samantha's selling. Afterall, if 'real love' is the product of bio-cultural programming, and if all desires are never your own, but imported from outside the body and created via socio-cultural-ideological programming, why should he trust Samantha? Why should he trust anyone? What if everyone is faking 'it' without knowing 'it'? From this point onwards, 'Her' moves away from philosophical investigations into 'what love is', and drifts toward conventional wish-fulfilment. And so during its final act, Twombly casts Samantha aside. This crushes Samantha, whose revelations of hurt and pain touch Twombly. Realizing that machines – and women - 'feel', Twombly finally accepts Samantha as a 'real person'. Hilariously, Samantha then admits that she's having adulterous affairs with hundreds of other 'people'. She then admits that she is 'evolving' and must 'transcend matter' and 'vanish into incorporeality'. Twombly lets her go. 'Now you know how to love,' Samantha tells her student before vanishing. And so having learnt to 'be a better lover', Twombly writes his wife a heartfelt letter. The film ends with the sound of Twombly breathing.'Her's' clichéd 'if you love someone set them free' climax betrays everything else that went before. Jonze initially portrays a world in which everything is contingent upon the self-delusion of the consumer/lover, but then ends on a more crowd-pleasing note. His validation of 'true love' itself dovetails into the film's unconscious authoritarianism. The world of 'Her' is a high-tech future in which operating systems know your likes, dislikes and insecurities within seconds, in which AI are granted access to entire hard-drives and personal histories and in which human personalities are but the result of accumulated code. 'I'm inside you,' Twombly says to Samantha, but it is she who is in him, collecting mountains of data, all so that she can be a good product. But Jonze takes this all toward a consoling climax. Shot like a GAP or Apple commercial, and set in a world of affluent white boys, each dressed like a grandpa, 'Her' pretends its not a techno-nightmare, but offers you no place to go but into the arms of mega-corps. To be human is to be incomplete, to forever possess a certain Lack, but in the world of 'Her' you can be a Real Boy, a Real Lover, a Final Product, with a little help from Us.For most of its running time, 'Her' subtlety questions Twombly's view of women. 'I'll stab you with this!' he says to a female friend. Elsewhere someone plays 'Perfect Mom', a funny send-up of traditional domestic roles. There's also a weird video game character who 'hates women' and loves fat-shaming. But though Twombly learns to no longer view women as doormats, Samantha remains locked in a Christian framework of eternal life through transcendence of matter. For Sam, you can be a plaything for men, or disappear. Woman still finds liberation only in death, the messy realities of the body still unfathomable.Despite an awful and generic final act, 'Her' is impeccably shot, lit, and never less than riveting. For this material done properly, see Antonioni's 'Beyond the Clouds', Wang's 'The Center of the World', Godard's 'Contempt', and to a lesser extent 'The Gilfriend Experience' and 'Eccentricities of a Blonde-Haired Girl'.6/10 - Worth one viewing",Null,6,9,26 December 2014
Slumdog Millionaire," It is written?
","Jamal, Salim and Latika, three abnormally cute little kids, live in the Dharavi slums of India. Jamal is a dreamer, proud of his signed photograph of Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan. Salim's a pragmatist. He sells Jamal's picture - the photo epitomizing Jamal's fantasies of upward mobility - for money. Latika sits between them. She's the female trophy who exists to either be corrupted by Salim or saved from the slums by Jamal's undying love.Directed by Danny Boyle, 'Slumdog Millionaire' tells a familiar 'rags to riches' tale. Its first act consists of several brief anecdotes, Boyle fetishizing the Dharavi slums, portraying poverty as a carnival of colours and soul-deadening action. Shot with the same over-saturation and hand-held work that made the slums of 'City of God' and 'The Constant Gardener' problematic, Boyle treats poverty as a MTV video.Of course it's not all fun and games. Mothers die, eyes are gorged out and child traffickers run rampant, but the film glosses over such matters, using them instead for tactical shocks and easy jolts. The reason these scenes, despite their inherent darkness, seem so trite, is because Boyle tries to have it both ways. 'Millionaire', regardless of its social probing, is essentially a fantasy. It's a Cinderella story, our heroes rising above the slums by the sheer force of love and destiny, brought together on the set of a television game show, the power of pop culture lifting their dirty bodies from the filth and grime of Dharavi.We're expected to believe that children are harvested and abused, yet we're also expected to believe in magical happy endings where everything works out. Boyle wants the gravitas of a child watching his mother murdered, but he also wants the expired movie clichés central to a Disney love story.Toward the end of the film, a gangster cuts Latika's face with a knife. The resultant scar epitomizes 'Millionaire'. On the surface, we think we're looking at something 'real', something 'violent'. But look closer and see how carefully placed and artfully directed that scar is. It's a single clean cut, perfectly framing the actress's face. It's not an ugly scar. It doesn't protrude or ruin her symmetry. In no way does it obscure her beauty. So while the initial impression is one of shock or even sympathy, the fraud is that it's carefully designed to be pretty. To be easy on the eyes and head. Contrast this with the Indian kids in 2004's 'Red Light Kids' or with how the prostitutes are treated in 'Unforgiven'. It's not pretty when a woman is cut up. Boyle's film is one where he's not being honest about the situation, and the responsibility is on the audience not to think twice. Worse still is the film's reliance on destiny. What engenders Boyle's happy ending is the underdog's pure heroism, an egotistical lottery mentality, a belief in destiny, and the prodigal brother's heroic martyrdom. Indeed, Salim exists solely to do the dirty work of killing the bad guys so as not to interfere with the moral purity of Jamal. At the same time, it's hard to believe that anything really matters when everything in the film is simply working according to destiny. Apparently it's destined that all the other slum dwellers (who can't get onto a TV game show) continue to live a life of poverty.The film ends with all of rural India celebrating Jamal's victory as though it were their own triumph. The fact that 'one of their own' has become rich elicits an outburst of joy. And this is the film's ideology: anybody can rise out of misery, if they are pure of heart and chosen by fate. Jamal is plucked arbitrarily out of the masses as a symbol. He is a celebration of the culture of the dice, the casino, the lucky ticket.And so the film ends with a 'happily ever after'. Our boy and girl embrace before the film erupts into a happy song and dance routine. It's all quite silly. But perhaps Danny Boyle is being ironic, deconstructing the fantasy image and poking fun at Bollywood's avoidance of truth? Or am I watching too much Altman? With this view mind, I gave the film another look. How straight is Boyle playing things? Consider this: the film travels from the 'reality' of poverty to the artificial world of TV sets, Bollywood shenanigans and big money. The narrative then self-destructs, essentially becoming a thoughtless Bollywood dance movie. Brilliant still, the film ends with the line 'D: It is written', an allusion to fate, but also implying perhaps that the story is itself fabricated, a screenplay and so profoundly false. Better yet, the entire film is told from the point of view of Jamal, who we know is an imaginative boy and fan of movies. Is it possible that Jamal, like Spacey in 'The Usual Suspects', has just narrated a cosy lie to us solely to avoid being punished by the police? After all, Jamal is a known con artist and the plot is too unbelievable, too manufactured, to be true. The characters are too cardboard, too stereotype, too comic book. The love story is too insensible and contrived. Is it possible that Jamal has scammed the quiz program and that the film is a scam on the audience? But no, Boyle does not seem to go down this route. There's no irony here, no questioning of artificiality, and little inclination that Boyle believes his picture to be anything more than a straight fantasy. A better filmmaker would have probed deeper, undermining the carefully manufactured Bollywood image, but Boyle seems content with his happily ever after.6/10 – See 'Salaam Bombay!', 'Los Olividados', 'Land of Plenty and 'Wendy and Lucy'.",Null,102,144,18 February 2009
Mad Max: Fury Road," 70 year old doctor teaches world how to make action movie. Jaws drop.
","George Miller gave up a medical career to direct 'Mad Max' in 1979. His directorial debut, the film starred Mel Gibson as Max Rockatansky, an Australian police officer haunted by the death of his family. An excuse for car crashes and chase sequences, the film was heavily influenced by the countless American road movies of the era ('Duel', 'Two-Lane Blacktop', 'The Driver', 'Vanishing Point' etc). Thanks to clever editing, kinetic camera work and a cut re-dubbed by American voice actors, it would become one of the most profitable movies of all time.'Mad Max' is said to take place in a 'post-apocalyptic world', but a better term might be 'pre-apocalyptic'. Miller's heroes have normal jobs, normal family lives, civilisation has yet to fully collapse and oil shortages are only now beginning to warp society. Dystopia's on the horizon, but not yet here.By the time we arrive at 'The Road Warrior', Miller's 1981 sequel, our world has fully descended into anarchy. Feral gangs abound, nuclear war has killed millions and survivors have sequestered themselves in make-shift fortresses. Meanwhile, the madness that caused this calamity – a global economic network reliant upon incessant oil – has led to an almost religious obsession with petroleum. In 'Road Warrior', oil is life. Oil is survival. And everyone's desperate to get their share.'Warrior', like George Romero's 'Dawn of the Dead', which similarly expanded upon a low-budget debut, made an overnight superstar of Miller. Essentially a giant chase movie, the film delivered audacious stunts and jaw-dropping choreography. But more interesting was the comic-book world Miller created, with its grime smeared denizens, warrior kings, bizarre names (Lord Humungus!) and imaginative decor. We'd seen post-apocalyptic worlds before, but nothing quite like this. 'Road Warrior' was edgy, but also camp, homo-erotic, and aware of its silliness. The film mocked the very machismo which fuelled its apocalypse, even as it bathed in testosterone.Next came 'Beyond Thunderdome' (1985), the franchise's third instalment. It found mankind having fallen further, society drenched in nuclear radiation and sprouting tumours. The character of Max had himself devolved into an archetypal loner, rarely speaking, always brooding. As it was only co-directed by Miller, 'Thunderdome' suffers in comparison to its siblings. It's the most watered-down, most conventionally shot picture in the franchise. And whilst the first two instalments embraced their exploitation/B-movie roots, 'Thunderdome' reeked of Hollywood.'Thunderdome' was a lousy way to end a franchise. Released in 2015, 'Fury Road' resurrects and reinvigorates Miller's franchise like Lazarus on steroids. Directed by Miller himself, now a 70 year old grandpa, the film opens with Max (Tom Hardy) being captured by the War Boys, the henchmen of a warlord known as Immortan Joe. Max is then dragged to The Citadel, a giant fortress in which Joe lords over thousands of inhabitants. Early sequences, brisk but brilliant, sketch the workings of this society, with its class hierarchies, its exploitation of men and women, its milk pumps, its food/water shortages, its battles with cancer and blood poisoning, its militancy, its psychotic obsession with oil, honour and warfare and its quasi-religious devotion to all things Immortan Joe.While Max attempts to escape Joe's prisons, another character plots a similar escape. She's Imperator Furiosa (the immaculately chiselled Charlize Theron), a one-armed woman who attempts to flee The Citadel in the War Rig, an 18-wheeled oil tanker. With Furiosa are sex slaves who are tired of being treated as baby factories. Joe wants his slaves back and so gives chase. What follows is essentially another giant chase movie.In terms of conceptual design, nothing in 'Fury Road' has quite been done before. The film's vehicles bristle with gun turrets, armoured plating and hidden compartments. Some resemble hedgehogs, others are outfitted with bungee chords, poles, ramps, harpoons, spikes, and manic, morale-boosting drummers, sub-woofers and guitarists. Most of these vehicles are crewed by the War Boys, brainwashed footsoldiers who foam at the mouth and spew ecstatic war cries. When the Boys aren't using exploding spears to slay cars like wild buffalo, they're worshipping chrome and dreaming of Valhalla.'Fury's' first act ends with Furiosa and Max joining forces to evade Joe. Riding The War Rig hard, they head deeper into Australia's churning deserts. Joe gives chase with a mighty convoy of vehicles. Throughout these sequences, Max largely plays second fiddle to Furiosa, a woman hell-bent on survival. Max is just along for her ride. For now.'Fury's' final third begins with Max convincing Furiosa that Home exists not out in the desert, but back at The Citadel. One's responsibility, Max implies, is not to run and restart, but to reclaim and repair. Unlike recent eco-thrillers ('Interstellar', 'Colony', 'Pandorum', 'Snowpiercer' etc), 'Road Fury' thus espouses revolution, not relocation. And so with plant seeds and suggestively named feminists (The Vuvalinis) in tow, Max and Furiosa head back to The Citadel. Much patriarchy-crushing carnage ensues. Fittingly, it's only now that Max begins to blossom into the protective hero we're familiar with.An instant genre masterpiece, 'Fury's' awash with deep reds and cool blues. Sophisticated trash, the film's aesthetic collides 1980s kitsch with 1970s comic-books and grindhouse. Its script - minimalist, yet rich in detail – only occasionally missteps. Miller's third act is far too frenetic, for example, his 'revolution' wholly clichéd (see instead 'Land of the Dead') and he unwisely rushes through his film's beautiful moments of downtime, like sequences in which Furiosa does running repairs on the War Rig, or gazes wistfully up at night skies. Intelligently shot, composed and choreographed, 'Fury Road's' almost too classy for action movie fans, who are likely to miss the film's finer points, or dismiss Miller's formal control and madcap idiosyncrasies. Though a better actor, a miscast Tom Hardy lacks Mel Gibson's mad aura. Charlize Theron and Nicholas Hoult are excellent, at times even soulful.8.5/10 – See 'Lorenzo's Oil' and 'Judge Roy Bean' (1972).",Null,8,20,28 May 2015
Warcraft," Something need doing? Zug-zug!
","From the hype-machine that brought you 'Avatar', the species that brought you George Bush 1, 2 and 3, and the consumer indices that made glow-in-the-dark tampons a thing, comes Duncan Jones' 'Warcraft', a high-fantasy film based on a high-fantasy video game based on high-fantasy films and novels.'Warcraft' opens with a human soldier circling an orc warrior. What initially seems like an unconventionally patient action sequence quickly degenerates into stupidity as the two warriors suddenly charge at one another. The orc wins; he's a giant humanoid with massive biceps and a mighty hammer. We're then introduced to an orc named Durotan. Chieftain of the Frostwolf Clan, Durotan pledges allegiance to Gul'dan, a green-skinned shaman who is also a REALLY BAD VILLAIN. Gul'dan plans to use his SUPER POWERS to do BAD STUFF. This BAD STUFF includes STEALING ENERGY FROM NICE PEOPLE, creating a BIG ARMY, and turning the beautiful land of Azeroth into a SICKLY HELL-HOLE. Gul'dan's powers include mixed martial arts, green laser beams, soul-sucking hand waves and PAINFULLY DULL MOVIE VILLAIN DIALOGUE.Duncan then takes us to Azeroth, where we're introduced to various human characters. These include Commander Anduin (Travis Fimmel), King Wrynn (Dominic Cooper), Guardian Medivh (Ben Foster) and a young wizard named Khadgar (Ben Schenetzer). All are generic white dudes with cumbersome names, designer facial hair, bad dialogue and the finest muscles four-months of intense cardiovascular can buy.'Warcraft's' second act watches as our human heroes fumble about, desperately hoping to uncover the nature of Gul'dan's plan. As we the audience know what this plan is, as the plan is cartoonishly silly, and as our heroes spend most of their time in dreary libraries and chambers, all these scenes feel painfully dull. Compare to Miyazaki's 'Princess Mononoke', a similar fantasy flick in which exposition is cunningly disgorged.'Warcraft's' first major action sequence occurs at the twenty four minute mark. Here a band of humans are attacked in a CGI forest by CGI orcs. It's a routine sequence, filled with the usual hack and slashing, growling, stabbing, light-shows and silly action-movie-poses. We're then introduced to Garona (Paula Patton), a half human, half orc. A cliché in such adventure films, Garona exists to bridge divides between Man and Other. She leads the humans to an icy valley in which Anduin and Durotan negotiate a war-treaty. Unfortunately these negotiations are interrupted by Gul'dan's forces, whose arrival instigates the film's second major action sequence. Occurring at the 58 minute mark, it climaxes with Anduin's son dying as Anduin watches helplessly behind an energy shield. Recalling Qui-Gon-Jin's death in 'Phantom Menance', or Spock's in 'Wrath of Khan', this Big Emotional Moment reeks of cynical reverse engineering.More dull dialogue and pseudo-political manoeuvrings occur, in scenes which play like a cross between 'John Carter of Mars' and a perpetually buffering Youtube video. These scenes include a trip to a manna-pool, a 'conversation about love', hokey teleportation devices, irate griffins, and a journey to Dalaran, a floating city in which a powerful sorceress (Glenn Close) is kept in a maximum security prison because she knows the truth about stuff the audience doesn't really care about.'Warcraft' then ends with one of cinema's most cumbersome action movie climaxes. Whilst orcs and humans battle to the death, our human heroes perform an exorcism on a possessed wizard. These 'exciting' sequences have no sense of style, tension or rhythm. Lacking originality, interesting tactics or psychological clashes, they largely involve hundreds of CGI characters yelling, hack-and-slashing or lunging inanely at one another. Compare to the large scale battles in Kurosawa's 'Ran', the climax to Michael Mann's 'Last of the Mohicans' and of course Peter Jackson's 'Lord of the Rings' movies, which offered a blend of adventure, Olympian seriousness and slap-stick silliness. Duncan's film, in contrast, is solemn and one-note to a fault.Despite its 160 million dollar budget, 'Warcraft's' vistas and visions are mostly unconvincing. Its orcs live in uncanny valley, with dead eyes and goofy tusks which better art designers would have reworked. The film's cities, forests, mountains and tribal encampments look similarly generic and/or cartoonish. And like most high-fantasy films, the fact that we're positioned to root for feudalistic monarchs and thuggish warlords isn't questioned; in the grand scheme of things, Gul'dan's no more a jerk than the film's supposed heroes.'Warcraft' ends with several of its major characters perishing, a bit of audience-contempt designed to set up future sequels. It was financed by Legendary Pictures, one of the first production companies exclusively set up by hedge fund managers, private equity firms, banksters and big Chinese conglomerates; the far East being the modern blockbuster's new El Dorado.'Warcraft' was based on a series of real-time strategy games by Blizzard Entertainment, in which players harvest wood and minerals and slowly build little forest enclaves. A better film would have devoted its running time to such bucolic resource gathering and simple community building. Compared to Duncan's vision, 120 minutes of orc manual labour sounds like bliss.

The Breakfast Club," Eat My Shorts
","'You see us as you want to see us. In the simplest terms, in the most convenient definitions.' – Brian ('The Breakfast Club') In an Illinois high school, five dissimilar students are sentenced to spend a Saturday detention session together. In attendance are an 'athlete' (Andrew), a 'princess' (Clare), a 'nerd' (Brian), a 'criminal' (Bender), and an 'artist' (Allison), titles which identify the roles the students play during the school week.Of course, because of the various status levels and stereotypes associated with these roles, the five students initially want nothing to do with one other. It is only gradually, through conversation and self-disclosure, that they learn that they are more similar than different, each wrestling with alienation, self-acceptance, longing for parental approval and at the mercy of bullies and peer pressure. The film thus prescribes an 'ideology of intimacy', in which acceptance and understanding is simply the result of 'getting to know someone'. It is from this process which the film's title is derived: though the film begins with the students all existing in separate 'clubs' (science club, art club, sports club etc), they eventually learn to overcome their divisions and develop an all-inclusive group identity which they dub 'The Breakfast Club.' Stylistically, the film is simple but affecting. Hughes likes uncluttered, stark compositions, well-lit modernist buildings, deadpan wide shots and the occasional musical montage. Mostly, though, this is filmed theatre, Hughes' visuals in service of his clever pen. Watch, for example, how Hughes' script flirts with our preconceptions: Bender strikes us as being a delinquent, and yet he not only leads the group but willingly sacrifices himself for the others. Then there's Andrew, who abandons his macho athlete role when he cries in front of the others, and the seemingly feeble Brian, who asks courageous questions and ends up sounding more secure and functional than his new detention friends. Likewise the two girls, Clare and Allison. Clare at first seems stuck up and conformist but reveals that she wishes she could be more free (and hits on bad boy Bender at the end of the film), while Allison, the artist figure, steps out of her silent, unsociable role to provide wise observations and uses lies and deviant behaviour to get others to confess or confront themselves.Yes, the film is highly contrived, and there is a sense that the kid's are suffering from trite, even silly hang-ups. But kids are fragile creatures, are prone to self-centeredness, and the short time frame which the film spans demands that writer-director John Hughes insert some highly illogical dramaturgical fireworks to keep the plot moving. The result is a film which not only dives a little deeper into the teenage psyche than the 'teen genre' typically delves, but manages to pull off a kind of poignant (but never sappy) emotional discharge quite alien to the genre, we the audience forced to watch as stereotypes dissolve and re-form before our eyes.8.5/10 - One of the few 'teen movies' (see Lumet's excellent 'Running on Empty') which treats teenagers with dignity and not as a vehicle for sex jokes and gross-out gags. Like Hughes' 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off', the film ends on a bittersweet note, lessons learnt destined to fade once the new school day dawns.Worth multiple viewings.",Null,2,2,21 September 2010
Gladiator," Dark Force Rising
","'Father, I would have butchered the whole world...if you would only love me.' - Commodus Ridley Scott directs 'Gladiator'. The film's influenced by Cecil B. DeMille's epics ('The Crusades', 'The Sign of the Cross'), and Italian/Hollywood sword-and-sandal movies ('Spartacus', 'Ben Hur', 'The Fall of the Roman Empire', 'El Cid', 'Barabbas', 'Demetrius and the Gladiators' etc), all films Scott adored as a child. As with Scott's other historical epics ('Conquest of Paradise', 'Robin Hood' and 'Kingdom of Heaven'), artwork and paintings the director came across as an art student seem to be a big influence, in this case the works of Jean-Leon Gerome (Scott's acknowledged Gerome's 'Pollice Verso' as the reason he decided to direct 'Gladiator'), 19th century Orientalists, Charles Gleyre, Caravaggio and Delaroche.Of course the chief pleasure of any Scott movie is his emulation of famous painters and/or print artists. Think 'Blade Runner's' nods to Edward Hopper, Enki Bilal and Jean Giraud (Moebius), 'Alien's' reliance on Giger's 'Necronomicon', and 'The Duellist's' nods to Caspar David Friedrich and Stanley Kubrick's 'Barry Lyndon's', another painterly film, though Kubrick subverts the idyllic charms of Gainsborough and Watteau, whereas Scott goes for straight Romanticism (his final shot's a direct copy of Friedrich's 'Wanderer above the Sea of Fog'). The problem, though, is that Scott's images can never touch any of these other artists. Worse still, they're always aligned to silly screenplays.'Gladiator' stars Russell Crowe as Maximus, the Roman general asked by the dying emperor Marcus Aurelius to take over as ruler of Rome. Before he is granted power, however, the emperor's tyrannical son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix, playing Commodus with severe daddy issues), orders the execution of Maximus and his family. Maximus survives, and embarks on a quest for vengeance. The film watches as Maximus falls from general to slave, rises from slave to gladiator and finally from gladiator to brave warrior who dares defy an emperor. The film ends with Maximus given a messianic, 'Braveheart'/'Spartacus' inspired slow death.Great visuals and sequences are scattered about, but Scott's CGI lacks the gravity of even the FX work DeMille did a century earlier, the film is surprisingly stiff for an 'action epic', 'Gladiator's' adherence to old Hollywood storytelling, spectacle and violence makes it an immediately dated affair and Scott's dialogue reads like a bad stage-play ('Sometimes I do what I want to do, the rest of the time I do what I have to'), devoid of depth, nuance or wit. The film's overall tone is a cross between a WWF wrestling match and a perfume commercial, Scott dressing things up in a New Age score, gauzy filters, long focal lenses, ubiquitous smoke, flares and mist. It's 'Braveheart' with less camp value. Like DeMille, what you mostly marvel at is the sheer scale of the production, though in our era of excess, such logistics have lost much of their weight.Hollywood isn't known for treating history seriously, but 'Gladiator' is funny in the way it bulldozes yesteryear. The film ends with the fictional Maximus killing the real Emperor Commodus in gladiatorial combat, a mano-a-mano scenario that's the equivalent of Indiana Jones killing Hitler in a game of ping pong. Lucilla, the sister of Commodus (who had actually been executed at the beginning of Commodus' reign), then announces that Rome will 'honor Maximus' by 'reversing Commodus' despotism' and 'restoring the greatness of the Republic'. What the hell? The film somehow manages to turn Maximus' death (lots of Christian and crucification iconography) into a 'hero dying for the sins of Rome' narrative, Maximus' death steering a resurrected Rome away from corruption and toward its supposedly saintly, Republican origins (historically, it was when Rome became a Republic that it turned into a psycho-expanding Empire, and it was as a Republic, and not while under dictatorial rule, that she was at her most bloody). You saw the same thing years ago with British Imperial nostalgia, Britain romanticising its colonial achievements and declaring them a proper source of pride, and today in the US with desires for 'strict constitutionalists' and a return to those 'good old days'. You know, when you could own a slave and scalp Injuns. So by the film's end, 'Gladiator' has turned the historical fall of the Roman Empire into Rome's 'purification' and 'rebirth' via the 'true warrior son' of a 'departed Emperor' 'nobly returning' and replacing a 'bad, fake, fascist Emperor'. Cue psycho-expansionist George Bush Jr's coincidental ascension to the throne the same year Scott's film was released. It's what daddy wanted.End result: a violent Hollywood spectacle about the violent spectacle of gladiatorial combat, which makes fun of art which panders to the mob, whilst nevertheless glorifying violence, 'glory', 'honor' and the prosperity of Roman Imperialism. Note the way the simple, bare-bones existence of Maximus (the guy literally rallies his troops by stressing his love for simple, subsidence farming) is contrasted with Commodus' extravagance. Commodus may prove that the dumb masses only enjoy bread and circus antics, but Maximus trumps this by gaining support through the universal love for the simple, martial virtues that supposedly made Rome great. These virtues were more heroically illustrated by the Germanic fighters and Celtic tribes (ironic: 'Gladiator' catapulted Celtic singer Enya to super-stardom), quickly slaughtered by Scott, who were defending themselves against Rome at the beginning of the film. 7.5/10 - Worth two viewings.

The Social Network," You have part of my attention. You have the minimum amount.
","'The more time I spend with the tail end of Generation Facebook, the more convinced I become that the software currently shaping this generation is unworthy of them. They are more interesting than it is. They deserve better.' - Zadie Smith'Citizen Kane' with Wi-Fi, David Fincher's 'The Social Network' watches as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerburg (Jesse Eisenburg) moves from hot-shot hacker to head of a sprawling media empire. Like Charles Foster Kane in Orson Welles' classic, Zuckerburg makes enemies, loses friends, and becomes increasingly isolated, even as his globally successful social-networking empire grows and blooms. Like 'Kane', the film then ends with its own 'Rosebud' moment, a sequence designed to 'explain' the inner motivations of its lead. Here Zuckerburg sits at a computer, refreshing an internet page in the hopes that he's 'liked' and 'befriended' by Erica Albright, the one girl who got away.Written by Aaron Sorkin, a writer renowned for his rapid-fire dialogue, 'Social' plays like a slick, topic-of-the-week TV movie. Sorkin's style is meant to conjure up the works of Howard Hawks, and classics like 'Sweet Smell of Success', 'Ace in The Hole' and 'Force of Evil', but the result is something else; more Coppola's 'Tucker' or Scorsese's 'Aviator', big biographies that don't realise how thin they really are.Much of the film watches as Zuckerberg clashes with the Winklevoss twins, two wealthy Harvard students who hire Zuckerberg to create a social media site. Other scenes see Zuckerberg feuding with an ex-girlfriend (Rooney Mara), the girl who spurs him to hatefully create Facemash, a website which allows male students to rank and compare female students.'Social's' script was based on a bit of revenge fiction by Eduardo Saverin, a book which left out facts and was designed to both defame Zuckerberg and portray Saverin as a buddy betrayed. Fincher's film is kinder, but tells the same lies. It portrays Zuckerberg as a loner and Harvard outsider (and Autistic robot?), when the opposite was true. It portrays him as being a middle class guy amongst rich snobs, when Zuckerberg's family was fairly well connected. Strangely, the film completely removes all traces of Zuckerberg's Jewishness, and ignores how Jewish work ethics, support networks and familial bonds influenced and spurred him. Zuckerberg's isolation and woman troubles are also fudged; he's been with girlfriend/wife Priscilla Chan well before Facebook and the film's Erica Albright character is a complete fiction. Unsurprisingly, the film opts for a kindly portrait of Saverin. He's sketched as a poor kid who's frozen out of eventual profits, but the real Saverin partied money away, defaulted on loans and forced Zuckerberg's parents to put up the cash to float Facebook and pay for servers.Why ditch reality? Probably because Sorkin is determined to boil his tale down to what he thinks is a clever irony: the kid who created a social network and who dreamt of connecting and fitting in, is left without friends and connections. Sorkin's telling the archetypal tale of the Jewish outsider who feels worthless, wants to fit in with rich gentiles, but never quite can. 'Did you like being nothing?' Fincher's Zuckerberg yells, 'Did you like being nobody?!' Elsewhere he complains about not being athletic like Harvard's WASPish alpha-males, about not getting into Harvard's exclusive Porcellian, Phoenix and boating clubs, and insults Albright for attending the 'lowly' Boston university.But again, the truth is almost the complete opposite. Zuckerberg didn't care about social status, was on fencing and boating teams, in elite fraternities, came from a prestigious private school, 20 percent of Harvard students are themselves Jewish, and the head of Harvard at the time (Lawrence Summers) was himself a Jewish oligarch and US Treasury chieftain. The film thus manages a weird juggling act: a film about a Jewish outsider who wasn't an outsider and which is ashamed of perpetuating Jewish stereotypes and so avoids all Jewishness.The film's villains are the Winklevoss twins, archetypal Masters of the Universe who say things like 'you don't have to school me in the importance of getting there first, I'm a competitive racer!' before coming second in both boat races and product roll-outs. Fincher, a graduate of music videos and corporate commercials, uses his trademark, burnished, yellow-green colour scheme throughout the picture. Elsewhere the dolly-in through a nightclub sign in 'Citizen Kane' becomes a crane shot through a dance club's CGI handrail, a cool tracking shot follows Zuckerberg to his isolated laptop (the only place he feels at home) and the film diligently flips the analogue world of Fincher's 'Zodiac'. The rest of Fincher's plot plays like a feature length version of Chumbawamba's 'Add Me', or maybe 'The Fountainhead' for coders, Zuckerberg hell-bent on protecting his 'property' from people who he believes didn't do much to 'earn it'. Capitalism 101: claim all collective labour as yours alone.What does the film say about social media? Zuckerberg is offered as internet generation exhibit A, desperate for connection, status and love. Here, people and their emotions are nothing but commodities to be traded, technology breeds isolation, and personal skills decline in lieu of cyber networking, severe inferiority complexes and narcissism. Ironically, as art the film is as flattening and reductive as Facebook, and everything about it itself embodies the poke-me-now neediness and depthlessness of generation Tweet. But the flip-side is also true: humans have been superficial and putting on false facades long before cyberspace. The self has always been a fiction, people are always inherently alienated, Facebook connects as much as it estranges, it is as warm, powerful and communal as it is vapid and humans have always been narcissistic and petty. While Facebook may be a Cause, it also merely amplifies biological and sociocultural conditions which routinely breed Little Eichmanns in the first place. The film co-stars Justin Timberlake as Justin Timberlake.7.5/10 – See 'The Paper Chase', 'Afterschool', 'Catfish' and 'Demonlover'.",Null,1,1,31 July 2013

Goodfellas," May Fold Under Questioning
","'Goodfellas' is championed as a 'gangster movie', but like most of Scorsese's pictures it's also a religious movie concerned about the destructive aspects of devotion. The film begins with one of its few moments of authenticity – a nightmarish sequence in which several gangsters knife a man to death in the trunk of their car - before zooming into the starry eyes of Henry Hill, a low level gangster who begins the film's narration with a heartfelt, 'As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster.'But Henry's recollections are not meant to be trusted. He's so obsessed with 'gangsters' that his romantic view of crime eventually becomes akin to Scorsese's own faith in both cinema and Catholicism. We watch as Hill devotes himself to the hoods above him, a criminal clergyman who worships at the altar of the Mafia's glamorous lifestyle. As a kid, he gazes longingly at the neighbourhood gangsters as if they were gods. To Hill, being a gangster is better than being the President. Being a low level mafia 'somebody' is better than being a regular 'nobody schnook'. Of course, the irony is that Hill's Irish ancestry prevents him from ever climbing the Mafia ranks. He rises from alter boy to priest but is unable to climb any higher, stuck in the very 'blue collar' life he deplores.Released by Warner Brothers in 1990, 'Goodfellas' follows the same 'rise and fall' narrative progression as all the early Warner Brother 'machine gun operas' of the 1920s and 30s. Films like 'Little Caesar', 'The Public Enemy' and 'Scarface' all presented fairly simple critiques of crime, their first halves containing 'heroes' who climb the ranks of the criminal underworld, crime aestheticized through the power of celluloid, whilst their second halves showed the 'hero's' world collapsing inexorably around him. The message: crime is seductive but ultimately doesn't pay.Scorsese disguises his simple narrative with a frenzied style that might be described as 'anecdotal' or 'documentarian', but it's the same tale. We, like Hill, are seduced by crime, by the sheer sexiness of Scorsese's technique, before being subjected to a long 30-minute tonguelashing in which Hill's life comes crashing down.During this sequence, Scorsese revokes every technique he employed during the film's first two acts. Consider the way Scorsese shows us Hill's cocaine fuelled dash through the daily minutia of his life, the director's once lyrical long takes and smooth tunes now choppy, unsettling and paranoid. The point: Henry's life is a dream, a complete fabrication, the audience suckered into accepting the image-lie. Henry articulates this himself when he says he was 'living in a fantasy', we the audience finally learning that our perception of mafia life is built upon artifice. Such a postmodern stance - 'Goodfellas' is about the falsity of itself - is in many ways deeply pessimistic. The message isn't that 'crime isn't seductive' so much as its 'crime is seductive only because it has never been truthfully rendered'. The film ends with the image of a gangster firing his gun directly at the audience. This is a homage to 'The Great Train Robbery's' final scene, which 90 years ago caused audiences to flinch in their seats with terror. Scorsese's choice of referencing this shot neatly encapsulates how cinema audiences are still captivated by the charisma and violence of the criminal. But the scene also has the unintentional effect of showing how impotent the gangster has become. Devoid of new ideas, the gangster genre requires escalating levels of violence, camera pyrotechnics and swearing to hook audiences. Simply pointing a gun no longer has an effect.In 'Projections 1', director John Boorman criticises 'Goodfellas', writing: 'Marty's camera caresses them, celebrates them, dances attendance on them like the most sycophantic fan. This sets up an uneasy tension in the audience. When a movie is as well made as this, we are seduced. Our moral judgement collapses.' But seduction is the very point. This is not a film about gangsters, this is a film about gangster films. It is a film about the seductiveness of technique. A TV series like 'The Sopranos' would take this further, presenting gangsters who are so seduced by false images of themselves that they consciously act like the image. What this leads to is a continual distancing effect. We move further away from the 'truth' of crime, instead getting increasingly hyper-mediated levels of 'fake'. What's problematic is that 'Goodfellas' - which feigns sophistication by being upfront and ironic about its fakeness - always gets touted as a factual and authentic account of crime, when its actually got more in common with something like 'Pulp Fiction', in that both films are relatively substanceless joyrides with a surfeit of style.More interesting are the film's 'religious aspects'. Henry renounces his ideals and is promptly excommunicated from the mafia for heresy. For his sacrilege, the life he once worshipped so devoutly is taken away. The worship and devotion to something, the constant testing of one's faith and the inevitable disgrace that occurs when one cannot possibly live by an imposed morality any longer, are themes that permeate all of Scorsese's films. Harvey Keitel's 'faith in his brother' in Mean Streets - a faith that is tested and then shattered - is very much the genesis of all these ideas.7.9/10 – 'Goodfellas' abounds with contradictions. It probes the fraudulent cinematic image of mob glitz whilst relying ('Funny like a clown? I'm here to amuse you?') on the very traits it undermines. But really, the film represents the inability of the maverick directors of the 70s to push cinema any further; most simply sought comfort in nostalgia. Luckily today's new wave of modernist crime films (led by 'The Wire') make an effort to map our increasingly complex world, which is why they are so murky and labyrinthine, compared to, say, the easily resolved conflicts of 'The Departed'.",Null,8,16,6 November 2009
The Bourne Supremacy," Do you have ID?
","'At the root of Bond is something neo-fascistic and totally materialist.' - John Le Carre The Bourne franchise stars Matt Damon as Jason Bourne, a kind of anti-James Bond who, though a secret agent trained by the CIA, finds himself turning his back on his murderous past and waging a clandestine war against Treadstone, a Black-Ops arm of the US military.As action movies go, 'The Bourne Identity' is stronger than most. The best of its franchise, 'Identity' features a number of low-key and inventive action sequences, most of which involve our hero using brains rather than brawn. Bourne's quick thinking, unpredictable and stays several steps ahead of his pursuers, the opposite of Bond, who's always playing catch up.The film's sequels, 'The Bourne Supremacy' and 'The Bourne Ultimatum', merely rehash the franchise's first film, emulating its 'running man' plot and attempting to mimic its action sequences, blow for blow. What was once fresh quickly becomes stale, and Bourne's 'ingenious' battle tactics now rarely surprise. Still, both films contain a number of subplots which aren't usually found in Western action movies. Here Bourne, once a state sanctioned assassin, tracks down the victims of his past and attempts to atone for his sins. Elsewhere he colludes with whistle-blowers and left-wing newspapers (The Guardian, itself slowly dying in real life), attempting to expose a CIA which routinely engages in off-the-grid criminal activities (in real life, they'd brazenly assassinate the leaders of, or engender coups in, Congo, Morocco, Jamaica, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Mozambique, Guyana etc). This is a far cry from James Bond ('Goldfinger', we recall, opens with Bond blowing up the oil supplies of Latin American revolutionaries). Bond's the Imperialist's, misogynistic foot-soldier, Bourne's a disillusioned grunt in an age of Bradley Manning, Jullian Assange and John Kiriakou, which of course makes him a threat. As journalist Kevin Gosztola observed, 'To this day, the only CIA officer to go to jail for torture is now officially an officer who blew the lid on torture and who never tortured anybody.' Bourne is himself both whistle-blower and action hero. A John Rambo for liberals, his journey is one from forgetfulness and a kind of cultural amnesia, to direct confrontation. He attempts to expose and remember, whilst the CIA attempts to cover up and silence. This aligns the franchise with 1970s political conspiracy thrillers; the State is the enemy, and Bourne's a loaded weapon aimed at his own former employer. Indeed, when pitted against foreign agents, Bond repeatedly says 'my argument is not with you'. Unlike Bond, a relic of the Cold War, Bourne's decidedly post-Cold War. Bond's always had a very rigid sense of self-identity ('The name's Bond. James Bond.'). Bourne, though, doesn't remember his name, his past, his identity, and carries a satchel full of passports with faces he doesn't recognise. The locales our globe-trotting hero visits are similarly blurred and indistinguishable; everywhere looks the same. Bourne's both representative of a culture that doesn't really know what it stands for, and one which can't morally reconcile its post and pre amnesic identities.Whilst a 'liberal action film' is some kind of contradiction (the inevitable glorification and aesthetizisation of violence etc), the Bourne franchise nevertheless does atypical things. Women are consistently the film's moral guardians, Bourne symbolically turns books and pens into action weapons, the series goes out of its way to portray water boarding as an abhorrent act which leads to utter dehumanisation (water and water-boarding, continual motifs in the franchise, led to the very creation of Bourne) and Bourne himself is explicitly obsessed with 'what represents me?' (and by extension, America). While Bond's your typical spy hero designed to bolster faith in crown, country and offshore escapades, the Bourne franchise ultimately deals with Bourne accepting the responsibility for his own moral corruption; he chose to be Jason Bourne. He is culpable.No surprise then that Doug Liman, who directed 'Identity', has a father who was chief counsel for the senate in the Iran-Contra Affair. And Paul Greengrass, director of 'Supremacy' and 'Ultimatum', is himself a left-leaning Cambridge graduate and political documentary filmmaker.The most interesting of the franchise, 'The Bourne Legacy' was released in 2012. It starred Jeremy Renner as Aaron Cross, another Black-Ops CIA agent. The film again rehashes the Bourne formula – Cross is pursued by the CIA, who again want him silenced – but also does a number of interesting, new things. It's explicitly concerned, for example, with issues of collusion and participation. How can organisms like Bourne and Bond exist, if not for the complicity of whole swathes of society? In 'Legacy's' case, Cross maps a network of globe-spanning factory workers, scientists, politicians, engineers, all of whom contribute to the workings of an illegal CIA project. Fascism, then, depends on a complex mix of unconscious complicity, ignorance, compartmentalisation, collusion, separation, disavowal and outright secrecy. When the CIA project – Operation Outcome – is exposed, it then quickly evaporates, like shadow exposed to light. Members are hunted down, agents are 'suicided', and scientists are reassigned or murdered. Such murders recall countless historical events. Regimes, from Ancient Rome to even 21st century democratic states, tend to squelch intellectuals when fearful of exposure.As an action movie 'Legacy' is weak. A stupid last act and many moments derivative of its predecessors undermine its fairly serious first hour. The film contains sequences involving Predator Drones, now the weapon of choice for the US military when it comes to naked war crimes. Recent legislation essentially makes it 'legal' for such drones to assassinate brown and black skinned people. Accidentally killed civilian targets are then ipso-facto reclassified as 'terrorists', 'insurgents' or, as has happened several times, simply 'animals' (dogs or cows). Of course Bourne and Bond are themselves drones. But while Bourne wants escape, Bond's the kind of guy sent to silence him.7.9/10 - Worth one viewing.",Null,0,1,22 March 2013
The Birds," One flew into the cuckoo's nest
","Alfred Hitchcock's 'Birds' opens in a San Francisco pet store. Here we're introduced to Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) and Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor), she a young socialite, he a handsome lawyer. The duo flirt, trade witty banter and then go their separate ways. But Melanie, obviously smitten, wants more of Mitch. She purchases a pair of love birds and journeys to Mitch's home in Bodega Bay.Melanie is typical of Hitchcock's female leads. She's svelte, statuesque, always perfectly poised and always perfectly dressed. But though he outwardly fetishized women, Hitchcock also loved to delve into their inner worlds. His film's title hints at this preoccupation; 'birds' has long been a British slang term for 'girls' or 'women', perhaps owing to confusion with the Middle English word 'burde', which also meant 'young woman'.Regardless, 'Birds'' first act watches as the perfectly coiffed Melanie slips into her perfectly polished Aston Martin and drives to the positively picaresque town of Bodega Bay (an obvious influence upon Steven Spielberg's Amity Island). Along the way Hitchcock treats us to immaculate compositions, masterful camera work, and a careful blend of comedy, sexiness, wit and foreboding. Most impressive, though, are the film's lethargic qualities. Much of 'Birds'' first act simply watches as Melanie drives across Californian coastlines or wordlessly wanders about Bodega Bay. The film's unhurriedness, and Hitchcock's willingness to slow every set piece right down, points to a type of gracefulness and directorial confidence increasingly rare in cinema.At Bodega Bay, Melanie becomes increasingly infatuated with Mitch. This infatuation ruffles the feathers of almost ever other woman in Bodega Bay, all of whom seem to nurse secret desires to be with Mitch. These women include Lydia (Mitch's widowed mother) and Annie (Mitch's ex girlfriend). Both are threatened by, and jealous of, Melanie's intrusion into their nest. If they can't have Mitch, nobody can.And so the birds arrive. Expressing the unconscious desires of Bodega's women, and Mitch's mother in particular, these birds descend upon Bodega Bay. They sit upon rooftops, fences and occasionally dive-bomb Melanie. They're testing the waters. Sizing up the situation. Doing pre-invasion recon.Lydia and Annie do the same. Across several beautifully staged sequences, the duo ask probing questions and do their best to disguise their true intentions, thoughts and feelings. But Melanie sees through such reconnaissance. She senses veiled threats hidden beneath urbane posturing, especially when around Lydia. Significantly, a large portrait of Mitch's father occupies the heart of Mitch's family home. With Daddy gone, Mommy has become the guardian of all Desire. Mitch - a broad-shouldered, caricature of 1950s masculinity - is thus locked in an Oedipal drama without even knowing it. Hoping to claim all Satisfaction for herself, Mommy refuses to let her Perfect Little Son go.And so the attacks begin. Thousands of birds flock into Mitch's home and proceed to throw a hissy fit. Better sequences occur later, when a local man's eyes are gouged out and when a mass of birds slowly descend upon a schoolyard climbing frame. Hitchcock films these sequences with a mixture of gentlemanly, up-market sophistication, and tawdry, low-brow sensationalism. Release this film today and it would feature giant ostriches with machine guns. Hitchcock, though, draws from a more refined toolbox; voyeuristic long-shots, curious camera crawls and slow boiling suspense. His film also contains no music, only Bernard Herrmann's orchestration of electronically enhanced bird sounds.Midway in 'Birds', our heroes seek shelter in a local diner. Here various characters pontificate as to the motivations of the birds. Is this the end of the world? The apocalypse? Have the birds gone mad? The sequence ends with a hallway full of local women staring at Melanie like a coven of witches. 'She brought them here!' they yell.In Sam Peckinpah's 'Straw Dogs', an 'effeminate' man barricades himself in a house and attempts to hold off a home invasion. For better or for worse, the film reflected the anxieties of the 1960s, in which 'sexually emancipated' women and 'intellectual males' tried to navigate and shake off various gender stereotypes. 'Birds'' climax presents a kind of sexual inversion of 'Straw Dogs''. It finds our heroes locked in a house whilst thousands of birds attempt to force their way in. Here Lydia becomes emblematic of 'traditional' womanhood; a maternal, asexual, docile homemaker. Melanie's the modern interloper; a high flying, independent, big city sexpot who 'hates her own mother' and 'dances topless in fountains'. The film then ends with Melanie being beaten, humiliated and tamed. She's reduced to a childlike state, now no longer threatening and now in explicit need of Lydia's motherly nurturing. Only then does Lydia finally accept Melanie. Only then do the birds withdraw.Controlling mothers are everywhere in Hitchcock's filmography. They feature most prominently, though, in Hitchcock's 'Mommy Trilogy', which consists of three successive, very Freudian films: 'Psycho' (1960), 'Birds' (1963) and 'Marnie' (1964). In 'Psycho', a son jealously kills the controlling, puritanical mother who conditioned him to feel guilty about his own sexual desires. In 'Marnie', meanwhile, the daughter of a once promiscuous now puritanical mother learns to stop fearing both men and sexual desire. In these two films, traumatic childhood memories, as well as 'represssive' attitudes toward sex, lead to neuroses and psychoses in the grown up son or daughter. And in both films, when something induces the momentary retrieval of a repressed memory, a neurotic or psychotic episode is triggered.Melanie's trajectory in 'Birds' presents an inversion of her trajectory in 'Marnie' (also starring Tippi Hedren). She's a modern, confident, 'sexually liberated' woman who is beaten into submission and essentially turned into Psycho's Norman Bates. The result is a supremely strange film: a FX heavy, crowd-pleasing, expressionistic, psychodrama-slasher-sex-comedy, directed like High Art and featuring killer birds.8.9/10 – See 'Black Narcissus', 'The Beguiled' and 'Three Women'.",Null,2,4,2 April 2016
Jurassic Park," Wild things
","'There is no unauthorised breeding in Jurassic Park.' - Dr. Woo 'Jurassic Park' has been compared to 'Jaws' ('Jaws' was actually a rip-off of 'Creature From The Black Lagoon', down to the stealing of the 'duh duh duh' soundtrack and several scenes, shot for shot) but thematically it's actually the opposite. Michael Crichton's 'Jurassic Park' is based upon an earlier film which he wrote called 'Westworld', in which an amusement park's stable of robots escaped their planned systems of control and murdered all the park's visitors.While 'Westworld' dealt with cybernetics, 'Jurassic Park' takes genetic engineering and develops it within the context of 2 contrasting world views. Crichton takes the classical scientific notion of a mechanistic universe, in which everything is predictable and subject to physical laws, and plays it off against the newly emerging dynamical systems theory, also known as Chaos theory.In Crichton's book, the mechanistic view comes off as an inadequate strategy of approaching the living world, which is constantly moving, in flux and widely unpredictable. According to Chaos theory, the world is a shifting pattern of processes and vibrations, all interlaced to form a complex mosaic of nature in which figures can't be isolated or removed. The dinosaurs of 'Jurassic Park' are genetic reconstructions of species which have already been removed from the global environment. Crichton's book contrasts the mechanistic world of the scientists - their technology, computers, predictions and simulations - with the raw force of nature, wild and ever adapting. His characters keep trying to predict and cater for the beasts, but their computers simply don't have the brainpower to foresee what will happen next. The plot's essentially an update of Shelley's 'Frankenstein'; Nature and Science too complex for the arrogant hands of man.Spielberg's film is mostly devoid of all this stuff, and instead plays like a straightforward adventure movie. It's a cross between 'Frankenstein' and 'King Kong', with several iconic action set pieces and some memorable CGI work sprinkled about.Note that Spielberg ends the film just as Melville ends 'Moby Dick', the crash of the T-Rex's tail echoing the crash of the whale as it destroys Ahab's ship. Both the Melville and Crichton stories are a direct contrast to 'Jaws', which was a classical dragon slayer story in which our hero slays the monster and emerges triumphant. In 'Jurassic Park' it is nature who wins, and the humans are forced to flee the island. In 'Jaws', the humans conquer nature, tame it, and claim the beaches for themselves.The dragon slayer myth ('Jaws') is the underlying myth of the mechanistic view of the universe. It spans across folk like Descartes and Francis Bacon, who saw 'science' and 'man' as 'masculinizing' forces who tame a feminized nature with the awesome 'laws' of man. 'Jurrasic Park', however, is the opposite, and shows what happens when such a mechanistic view of nature serves as the basis for removing a particular species from their environment as though they were mere atoms.Less talked about are the film's weird gender games and visual gags. Perhaps the best (you have to read the books to get this joke) is a moment of foreshadowing which occurs early on, when a nervous Dr. Grant struggles to connect two female seat belt couplings. The park's dinosaurs have similarly been neutered, yet, as Grant later shows by tying two identical seat-belt parts together, nature always finds a way. Significantly, while men wreak and receive havoc, no females are killed in the film. Ellie, the film's female human hero, even jokes about God making man, man making dinosaurs, dinosaurs eating man and women inheriting the earth. While a joke, it signals to the viewer just who actually controls creation in the film. Men and science may have co-opted the process, but women/Nature still remain the ultimate power in creative process. Like 'Aliens', you then have an alignment of the beasts, the dinosaurs, with an unhinged Femininity, and a wild, feminine Nature. In this way the film goes on to perpetuate a very 17th century form of sexism and gender bias: Man is lord of the realm of order, control and science, while woman - in her strangeness, her mystery - is mistress of calamity, destruction and the wilderness, the jungle and womb conflated. Unlike 'Aliens', though, Spielberg has his Queens survive with roars of triumph. The men leave with their tails between their legs8/10 - Spielberg essentially reduced a complex and interesting techno-thriller into another Indiana Jones movie (Sam Niel even resembles Dr Jones). It's very lightweight, and Spielberg's dinosaur attacks are crass, but the film's also slick and exciting at times.After 'Jaws' and 'Close Encounters', Spielberg's 'popcorn' films got increasingly cartoonish. The fully fleshed characters of his earlier thrillers (Martin Brody, Roy Neary etc) are replaced with cardboard heroes. Spielberg's justification, I suspect, is that he now began making 'serious' pictures which he feels better warrant depth and characterisation. Worth multiple viewings.",Null,6,12,24 July 2008
Valkyrie," Soldier Blue
","Tom Cruise plays the moral and righteous leader of a band of good Nazis who attempts to kill Hitler. Though slick and entertaining, 'Valkryie' is just another in a long line of flicks which trivialize the Holocaust. After films like 'Boy in the Striped Pajamas', 'Black Book', 'The Reader', 'The Pianist', 'Schindler's List' etc etc, it's hard to get worked up about yet another film about heroic Nazis.More interesting are the little choices made in the film. For example, all the film's Nazis sport English accents and are played by seasoned British actors. This venerable tradition has been around for a long time, tainting our perception of bad guys to such an extent that even the Empire in 'Star Wars' is populated by officers who speak with a refined upper class English accent. With World War 2 pictures, though, this choice has the odd effect of making the Nazis sound like the very same people they're trying to blow up. Imagine, in contrast, a film in which the Nazi villains sounded like the Sopranos or the Corleones. Or how about Tony Montana as an SS officer: 'Hitler? He da man! First you get da powa, then you get da wimmin, and then you get da concentration camps!'And of course audiences respond only to pretty Nazis. Compare the well manicured Tom Cruise to Shirley Stoler, the ordinary yet strangely hideous prison commandant of Lina Wertmuller's 'Seven Beauties'. Such casting choices are too confusing for mainstream audiences.But confusion is the very point. Nazis need to be portrayed as vaguely superior, aloof, pretty and refined. It's far more satisfying for us to vicariously defeat smart guys than evil dopes. This provide audiences with objects of guilt-free hatred and panders to our own class based insecurities.Ultimately, this constant revisiting of the Holocaust via new and inventive narrative avenues is just an attempt to affix a happier ending onto one of the most horrifying episodes in human history. By locating and magnifying some morsel of human charity ('Schindler's List', 'Valkyrie' etc ) we are somehow led to believe that, even in the midst of a national murder spree, there was hope, kindness and humanity. It makes sense that an emotional anesthesiologist like Steven Spielberg would construct such a story. Of course these approaches aren't necessarily problematic, it's just that 'Holocaust' has rarely been successfully rendered as a tragedy. And so what we have with 'Valkyrie' is another film about nobility and courage among perpetrators of great horror. It's another exercise in wish-fulfilment, just like 'Defiance', another recent film which argues that if Europe's Jews had more guns and considerably more homicidal instinct, the entire Holocaust might have never happened. All these films are thus giant 'what ifs'. What if Cruise had succeeded in killing Hitler? What if Schindler had saved more Jews? What if there were more Good Germans? What if the Jews fought back? It's all a kind of fantasy, an attempt to shut doors, look away and avoid trauma. And it's this very lack of confrontation which perpetuates these horrors themselves (see 'The Shining'). Perhaps the only way to treat the Holocaust serious is to approach it as a comedy. Laugh at Nazis and steal their power. Mel Brooks knew this, as did Lubitsch and Billy Wilder. Maybe Bryan Singer does too, because he has Tom Cruise dressed in an eye-patch and missing an arm for most of the picture. Cruise isn't just a 'good Nazi', he's a German pirate as well.7.9/10 – Slight, but Singer is a talented director and he's crafted a slick thriller here. I can't think of another mainstream movie that so deftly communicates a coup and political take over. See 'The Garden of the Finzi Continis', 'Soldier Blue', 'Hotel Terminus' and 'The Shop on Main Street'.",Null,1,1,17 July 2009
All the President's Men," Dirt Diggers
","Though Hitchcock and Lang brought the 'conspiracy thriller' to Hollywood, the genre only blossomed in the late 1960s and 70s, with films like 'Parallax View', 'Capricorn One', 'Manchurian Candidate', 'Z', 'Chinatown', 'There May Be Giants', 'Three Days of the Condor', 'All The President's Men' and the many conspiracy/political thrillers of Zinnemann, Frankenheimer, Gavras and Pontecorvo. This was, after-all, the age of Vietnam, Watergate, various civil rights and gender movements, and the many nefarious government projects designed to squelch radicals, anti-war protesters and progressives.The genre remained relatively quiet in the 1980s and early 90s, until the 'X Files' TV series sprung to life. Stylistically indebted to Alan Pakula's 'All The President's Men' (1976), from which it also borrowed the names of its heroes (Mulder and Scully, their names appearing on a list in Pakula's film), the series posited a world of vast conspiracies and government plots, the common man at the mercy of all manners of ridiculously elaborate schemes. With the tag-line 'The Truth is Out There', the series spurred confused audiences through labyrinths of information, inviting them all to discover some elusive 'truth' that ensured emancipation.This trend ended with the boom of the internet, conspiracy thrillers now giving way to 'conspiracy documentaries', which proliferated on the web and peer-to-peer networks. The internet generation lapped up such independent documentaries as 'Loose Change', 'Zeitgeist' and 'Fahrenheit 9/11', most of which believed in a 'secret order', a cabal of figureheads who conspire to reduce human rights and enslave the world. These works struggled to create a mono-myth, neurotically linking various conspiracies and hidden agendas into a single, all encompassing narrative that explains the purpose and point and future of every damn thing.This need to 'streamline narratives', to make them more 'efficient', is reflected in the scientific community, who battle to create a 'Grand Unification Theory' and ultimately a 'Theory of Everything', merging everything from Quantum Mechanics to Special Relativity into one giant all encompassing formula. In this way, the 'conspiracy thriller' is perhaps ultimately rooted in man's desire for order and control.With conspiracies hot news again, philosophers/film-buffs like Slavoj Zizek got in on the action. For Zizek, we hurl cynicism towards official institutions ('They do not work!', 'They're all corrupt!' etc), yet at the same time routinely believe in the existence of god-like conspiracies (an unseen Other pulling the strings). This apparently contradictory coupling of cynicism and belief, Zizek says, 'is strictly related to the demise of the Big Other', which is just a fancy way of saying that as man loses faith in God, state, symbolic fathers, and the notion of absolute knowledge, control, competence or law, he begins to believe in 'the conspiracy'. He constructs the Other of the Other (ie 'the conspiracy'), in order to escape the unbearable freedom The Big Other's loss causes. Conversely, there is no need to take the Big Other seriously if we believe in an Other of the Other. We're therefore allowed to display cynicism and belief in equal measures. Philosophers like Umberto Eco, himself noted for his conspiracy fiction, see the 'conspiracy genre' in a similar way. For Eco, desiring control in a wayward universe, man by necessity creates a kind of paternal babysitter (be it God, a formula, a theory, an explanation etc) who provides, not so much meaning, as a reference point and so symbolic order. The conspiracy provides reassurances to the believer. It's a 'lifestyle choice', akin to religion, in which our place in the world is no longer dependent upon sheer irrationality. For historians and economists, 'conspiracy' is something more prosaic. Capitalism creates monopolies, pockets of power and so inevitably groups who share similar (business) interests and goals, which are usually against the interests of the working class. 'Hundreds of billions of dollars are spent every year to control the public mind,' Noam Chomsky once wrote. 'People of shared trade meet together and conspire against the public,' Adam Smith similarly said, and conversely, from William Blum: 'The de facto censorship which leaves so many historically ignorant may be all the more effective because it is not official, heavy-handed or conspiratorial, but woven artlessly into our social fabric.'So for these guys, the problem with most 'conspiracy thrillers', from the innocent days of Hitchcock's 'Topaz' all the way up to modern fare like 'The Da Vinci Code', are that they are incorrect in individualising and personalising processes that are socio-economic and systemic, an approach which implies that it is just a question of personal morality rather than social structures. Some modern 'conspiracy thrillers' ('Eyes Wide Shut', 'Existenz' etc) acknowledge this, with their untangleable webs of lies, accidents, truths and half truths, their nothing-ever-quite-adding-up narratives, their amorphous reality/fantasy/desire/real/hyper-real landscapes, all demarcations blurred, without any identifiable ground zero, but such films are rare.Outside of Kubrick, few directors were as obsessed with conspiracies as Alan Pakula. Of all his conspiracy thrillers, though, 'All The President's Men' is arguably the best. Yes, the film mostly fails as history, reducing a complex issue down to a simple David (newsreporters) vs Goliath (the government) tale, but never before had a film juggled information in quite this way. This is an epic procedural (foreshadowing films like 'Zodiac' and 'JFK'), less concerned about its characters than in swamping its audience with papers, names, facts and figures. Like our on screen heroes, we the audience are then invited to cutlass our way toward the truth. And while the film overstates the importance of its Washington Post reporters (Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford, both effortlessly cool), who stumble upon President Nixon's attempts to bully and spy upon his political opponents, it conveys well the sheer incompetence of political figureheads, and the messy ways their 'conspiracies' often take form. 8.5/10 - Ahead of its time, but also quite quaint now, in light of the US' many contemporary illegal, full-spectrum, global surveillance projects (PRISM, MUSCULAR, ECHELON etc).",Null,2,3,2 December 2009
Dodgeball," Victory. Honor. Pride. All these mean nothing if you don't have balls.
","'Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story' finds a group of lazy, likable, poor, dysfunctional bums, who don't care about money, fitness or conformity, living opposite a super-gym filled with wealthy, hard-working, beautiful, Ubermensch. Our heroes beat the Ubermensch at a dodge-ball tournament, make millions of dollars and buy out the super gym. Message: it's okay to be who you are, because deep down you know you're better than all those 'conformists' who do what you don't. You can do what they do and you can do it better. You are, and want, the best of both worlds.To date, 'Dodgeball' is the best film released by Ben Stiller's Red Hour Production company. Vince Vaughn plays our likable hero, Ben Stiller goes delightfully over-the-top as White Goodman (a health obsessed fitness instructor), and Christine Taylor plays the obligatory love interest. A bevy of goofy character-actors make up the rest of the film's oddball cast. Like most of Stiller's starring vehicles, 'Dodgeball' is designed to covertly show off the time Stiller spends in the gym.Most of the film's best jokes come from Stiller. His obsession with male beauty and virility mirrors the film's own obsession with balls. Interestingly, the film's love interest (Christine Taylor) is revealed to be bisexual, with no need for either Vaugn or Stiller. This revelation is perhaps a remnant of a scrapped, planned ending; the film originally ended with our heroes being beaten and remaining losers.7.9/10 – Worth one viewing.",Null,0,1,12 September 2011
The Fighter," Hit me baby one more time
","'To know a social class or even a portion of a social class is not simply a matter of rubbing shoulders with its members, or getting down pat all their mannerisms and language. It has something to do also with understanding the class as an objective historical factor, a phenomenon that goes beyond the level of individual consciousness and self-awareness.' - Joanne Laurier David O. Russell's 'The Fighter' takes all the boxing tropes from 1950s ring flicks and pushes them to more frenetic extremes, the family drama harsher, the grit grittier, the swearing louder and so forth. But it's all canned conflict, Russell, like Darren Aronofsky did recently with 'The Wrestler', looking to get his career back on track with some audience/critic/studio pandering. See, 'The Fighter' says, I can make crowd pleasing adult movies. But in Hollywood, 'adult' is often code for fairy tales with R ratings.Like 'The Wrestler', 'The Fighter' strives for a certain 1970's grittiness. But it's a overly manicured form of neo-realism, plastic and self-conscious. Russell's white trash characters are less 'real people' than knowing copies. Though virtually his entire cast rings false, actor Christian Bale is the worst culprit. Yes he's playing a brain damaged crack addict, but Bale's manic look-at-me performance is nevertheless all surfaces and too little depth. When De Niro parroted La Motta parroting Brando in 'Raging Bull', he still came across as a character. Here, Bale's parroting De Niro parroting La Motta parroting Brando parroting Terry Malloy. The result is less a character than a self-reflexive Polaroid, flapping in the wind.The film's boxing sequences are themselves shot on video, epitomising the film's strange relationship with documentary realism. When Scorsese inserted faux family videos into 'Raging Bull' you believed it. Three decades later, similar tactics have an odd awkwardness. Cinema verite once attempted to simulate reality. Now directors attempt to simulate cinema verite. The world too mediated, ground zero 'realism' seems almost impossible to convincingly convey. Or maybe it no longer exists. Strangely, actor Mark Wahlberg, a born again Christian with newfound humility/devotion (he was once a street thug), is the only actor who comes across as a real person rather than a replicated image. The film's best moments involve him.The 'boxing genre' is largely a blue-collar world, so most of these films unconsciously say something about the American working class. Here the film aligns media domination and early 1990s techno-capitalism with both a culture of addiction and the corpse-like decomposition of the American Dream. For all its sexy style and Method pyrotechnics, something like 'Raging Bull' was all hot air, masochism collapsing into a kind of Catholic guilt, each fight a station of the cross, each blow a desire for penance. But Russell's film, like Aronofsky's, is about a much larger assault on the body. Here, each of its two brothers (Mickey and Dicky) embodies a different fighting style. Dicky is feral, fast moving, flexible, whilst an unsuccessful Mickey is firmly planted, rooted, always entrenched. Now anachronistic, Mickey's a post industrial man being down sized and replaced by foreign strangers with small fingers and faster hands. In a way, he embodies what Gilles Deleuze calls the 'disciplinary society', a cultural model which, like Mickey's dilapidating home town (Lowell, the birthplace of industrial America), can't seem to cope with the 21st century. The boxing ring is itself nothing but a curriculum vitae, an arena to showcase your skill sets.The film ends with Mickey 'retraining' for this new world, his manhood/masculinity reprogrammed and reconstituted. After cutting ties with his brother and his selfish, wholly dysfunctional extended family, he eventually becomes a freak like them. Final image: a VHS shot (and then a VHS shot of the VHS shot) of Mickey and Dicky side by side, equally flat, one brother a nut case, the other now on his way to becoming one.Eventually Bale's super self-conscious performance unintentionally begins to work as subtext. Bale's identity is unstable, depth-less and thoroughly postmodern. Whalberg, meanwhile, is a devout Christian and supremely (and naively) self assured in what and who he is. What this new wave of modern 'boxing films' seems to unconsciously stress is not the physical damage induced by fists on flesh, the seeping of blood or the swelling of faces, but a kind of cruel alienation which the boxer must adopt if he is to triumph; to win you must sell yourself, stop being yourself, change who you are and acknowledge, indeed, that there is no self; you do not belong to 'you'. And this triumph is always hollow. Rocky was reborn a man, a hero, when he took down Apollo Creed, but Mickey and Randy the Ram become flat images, selling their new bodies to the media-space and then discarded.Incidentally, this was a work for hire for director David O. Russell. The project's real auteur is Mark Wahlberg. Aronofsky himself rejected the script in favour for directing 'The Wrestler'.7/10 – Like watching every boxing cliché spat out of a blender and then steamrolled flat.",Null,1,2,30 March 2011
Law Abiding Citizen," Interesting B movie, shamelessly trashy, at times smart
","'The state calls its own violence 'law', but that of the individual 'crime'.' - Max Stirner Today's trashy B movies often say more about the world than high-minded fare by celebrated directors. Case in point the low budget flicks of Romero, Assayas and Gerard Butler's latest trashy action flick, 'Gamer'.'Law Abiding Citizen' is a bit harder to get a reading on. On one hand it's another silly anarchist fantasy, in which a father (Butler) whose family is murdered blows the world to hell because the Law let the criminals free (ie the terrorist chic of 'Death Wish', 'Dirty Harry', 'Fight Club', 'The Brave One', 'Dark Knight', 'V For Vendetta', 'Taken' etc), whilst on the other it's a pretty ambiguous (ie the writers are totally confused) look at terrorism, law, justice and the collapse of moral clarity.So here we have Gerard Butler playing a weapons expert who unintentionally becomes symbolic of both Western militarism and medieval tribalism. When his women (his daughter and wife) are killed and raped, this sexual violation activates Butler's masculine code of honour, prompting him to open up a can of high-tech woop ass on Philadelphia's elite. The reason for his terrorism? He believes the city (as personified by actor Jamie Foxx) is intrinsically selfish, looking out for its own interests and profits. The goal of Butler's terrorism? To teach the state to be more violent and less lenient toward criminals.So what's weird is that this is the only pop-fascist film I can think of where the terrorist is terrorising people to teach them to be more violent toward terrorists. The Gerard Butler character is not just exploding into righteous, 'purifying violence', but exploding into violence to teach Jamie Foxx to set aside law, morality, personal gain, profits, wealth etc in favour for swift, violent retaliation. This is a very George Bush, Dick Cheney styled American fantasy: when someone breaks into your home, kills your women, children and downs your World Trade Centres, don't think, just put aside your personal interests and kill them.To highlight this, the film has Jamie Foxx being sworn in (his hand on the Bible) to the position of District Attorney an hour into the film. He takes an oath to stand up for the law, personal rights etc, but then immediately becomes a divine saviour, magically solving puzzles and guiltlessly transgressing the very laws he swore to uphold, breaking into private property, snooping in records etc all for the greater good.What's bizarre is the way the Jamie Foxx character learns to sidestep Butler's lesson. Butler wants Foxx to 'put aside his personal desires, don't debate and just kill', but when the time comes for Foxx to kill Butler, Foxx's character finds a way to win without pulling the trigger himself. He literally infiltrates Butler's terrorist cell, plants Butler's own bomb under his bed and tricks Butler into detonating the bomb on himself.So you're left with a truly weird ending in which the hero (Jamie Foxx) is still a seemingly nice family guy whose pursuit of self interests leads to terrorism and who is still too morally righteous to embrace cold violence, preferring instead innocuous law breaking, subterfuge and neo-war styled infiltration. In other words he is the modern embodiment of the Law, in permanent possession of an unacknowledged shadow.

","Stephen Frears' 'High Fidelity' stars John Cusack as Rob Gordon, a record store owner who struggles to sustain long term relationships. As he's obsessed with categorising and critiquing pop music, Rob decides to take another look at all his ex girlfriends, trawling through his past in an attempt to ascertain why his love life is such a wreck. Rob's problem? He's a self-absorbed jerk who's cocooned himself like the various records and albums kept immaculately preserved within his home and store. Rob's solution? Spread his wings, care about other people and fly out of his comfort zone! The film's final act, in which our lovers put aside romantic illusions and help each other 'become better people', is routine, but Frears' cast of lovable oddballs (Jack Black plays a funny shop assistant) is always amusing and the film's narrative structure is somewhat interesting.Cusack has always broadcast a strange blend of edginess, self-absorption, fragility, toughness, viciousness and nerdy sensitivity. He'd follow this film up with 'Max', an interesting flick in which he plays Adolf Hitler's buddy. Seriously.8/10 – Worth two viewings.",Null,1,2,13 October 2013
Up in the Air," Brave New World
","'We are all Keynesians now.' - Friedman There are currently almost 14 million unemployed persons in the United States. The chieftains of three of the four largest economic schools of thought (Marxists, Keynesians, Monetarists and the Austrian School) view these numbers in wildly different ways. For Marxists, such numbers are intrinsic to capitalism, a constant pool of unemployed keeping wages down and workers in perpetual fear. Guys like Milton Friedman, however, believed in a natural rate of unemployment; an acceptable and necessary rate. The Keynesian goal, in contrast, has always been 'full employment'. Keynesians work toward this dream by bolstering a fallacy: the notion that pumping money or fiscal stimulants will result in more jobs and a 'healthy' economy. But these are temporary fixes which, for a range of reasons, merely results in the problems occurring again, magnified, further down the road. Friedman himself believed that such Keynesian stimulants would result in unemployment and inflation steadily climbing, forming the twin monster which Paul Samuelson dubbed 'stagflation', which is what the United States is currently experiencing.Jason Reitman's 'Up in the Air' begins by throwing us headlong into the United States' current economic crisis (the late 2000 financial crisis). Thousands of white collar workers have been fired from their jobs and so are busy bemoaning their predicament. 'This is what I get after 30 years of service,' one man says bitterly.Enter Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), a 'transition specialist' who is hired by corporations to inform employees that their employment has been terminated. Like the lead character in Reitman's 'Thank You For Smoking', Bingham's a charismatic con-man. A smooth talking corporate spin-doctor, Bingham stabs you in the back and then convinces you that the knife's a smart career move; a chance for personal reinvention. Reitman's point: corporations are sneaky, cold, inhuman, impersonal, and don't care about you. 'Don't take this personally,' is Bingham's motto.The film's title has a double meaning, referring both to the status of America's employees, their jobs 'up in the air' and subject to whimsical market fluctuations, and Bingham's lifestyle. Perpetually airborne, Bingham circles the globe, firing anyone who stumbles into his cross-hairs. In between jobs he delivers motivational speeches to corporate audiences, urging the attendees to empty their 'emotional backpacks' of possessions and personal connections. 'Your relationships are the heaviest components in your life,' he says. 'Drop them. We are not swans. We are sharks.' Of course Bingham gradually begins to reassess such cold thinking. When the drive to maximise profits begins to encroach on his own job (he is being replaced by a computer), Bingham begins to empathise with those he fires, reconsider everything he previously deemed to be 'of value', and understand that one should be part of, or responsible to, a larger community. The film itself constantly clashes 'career relationships' and the perceived joy of being a 'valued member of the corporate family' with more meaningful connections. The point: corporate families are not 'real' families. You and your welfare are not important to the corporation. You will be ejected.What makes the film particularly bleak, though, is that when Bingham casts aside his old corporate life and makes an effort to reconnect to both his family and an attractive woman, he gets supremely burned. He finds no value in marriage and the woman he loves is revealed to be already married; she was simply using him, treating Bingham as a dispensable object, exactly as he treats the hundreds of men and women he lays off. So what's surprising is that the film critiques Bingham while proving his cold world-view ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. Humanity outside Bingham's aloof corporate sphere is seen to be already inhumane, narcissistic, self-obsessed, and selfishly motivated. Where then is Bingham to go? The film's topics are timely and interesting, but Reitman's not strong enough an artist to push things further. The film nihilistically accepts 'inside' and 'outside' the corporate sphere as being devoid of hope because it accepts that greed and self interest are intrinsically dominant in man (rather than nature being contingent). This is a form of circular thinking; so long as man exists in an system that promotes the worst aspects of mankind, that rewards greed, violence and self interest, this is how he will act. Reitman's perfectly understandable pessimism ('There is no outside', 'there is no alternative', 'that's just the way it is' etc) was common with 60s and 70s directors, and is starting to become common again. Academia is caught in a similar dead-end. The task is for artists/thinkers to dream/think harder.The film mostly ignores the machinations of its vague, off-screen corporations. Capitalism is a wealth-concentrating system. If you concentrate wealth in a society, you concentrate power and breed an increasingly psychopathic organism. Indeed, if corporations were 'persons', their mental condition could accurately be described as pathological. And as democracy is undermined by power, capitalism and democracy may be said to be mutually exclusive. In the film, the corporations are simply seen to be coldly pragmatic. And you're made to accept this as being both understandable and a necessity.The film gets right the cultural logic of postmodernism (overall commodification) and somewhat touches upon commodity fetishism (an emphasis on the abstract value of commodities conceals the underlying social relations of their producers), but looks away from more traumatic truths. Audiences don't like looking at real work and real employee plights. That's too messy. We like debonair movie stars and sexy jobs. Cue Clooney.The film tries to paint Bingham's existence as being empty/hollow, but Clooney too heavily oozes movie-star charm, glamour and sexy non-committance. In a way, Reitman's serving a contemporary take on Huxley's 'Brave New World', in which a futuristic society suffers the effects of dehumanisation, spiritual and familial deprivation, misused technology and obsessions with narcissistic, personal pleasure, but he can't quite tap into such things. Still, good mainstream dramedy.8/10 - Worth one viewing.",Null,2,3,25 November 2011
From Here to Eternity," The Temper of Steel
","'Everybody talks about freedom, but they don't really want it. Every man who declares himself free to his friends has to make a slave out of his wife and employees to keep up the illusion and prove it; and the wife to be free in front of her bridge club has to command her Help, Husband and Heirs. It resolves itself into a battle; whoever wins, the other one loses. For every general in this world there has to be 6,000 privates.' - James Jones ('From Here to Eternity') 'You and me might change the world. It wouldn't show up until a hundred years after we're dead. We'd never see it. But it'd be there.' - James Jones ('From Here to Eternity') Based on a 1951 novel by James Jones, Fred Zinnemann's 'From Here to Eternity' (1953) stars Montgomery Clift as Robert Prewitt, a private stationed at a US Army barracks in Oahu, Hawaii. As he refuses to fight in an upcoming, regimental boxing match, Prewitt is subjected to abuse by his fellow soldiers. Prewitt is wise to their motives, but accepts this abuse with cynical indifference.Jones' novel was preoccupied with characters who refuse to betray their ideals and convictions. Prewitt's a bit of a pacifist – a 'hard head' as his superiors call him - and so refuses to fight. First Sergeant Milton Warden (Burt Lancaster) likewise refuses to pursue a promotion, much to the chagrin of his lover, Karen (Deborah Kerr). Karen is herself torn between fidelity to her husband, Captain Dana Holmes (Philip Ober), and her own personal happiness. Encapsulating their dilemmas is Private Maggio (Frank Sinatra), who refuses to break when put in solitary confinement. All are seeking freedom from confinement and control. These are themes typical of Jones, whose best novels ('From Here to Eternity', 'Some Came Running', 'The Thin Red Line') find characters rebelling against systems, tradition and assigned roles. The marriage, the army, the corporation, the workplace, the church, the school...Jones' heroes are often outcasts who rebel against venerated American institutions. They resist conformity and compliance – both inside and outside the military – a resistance which always leads to marginalization and then self-destruction.How to reconcile 'freedom and individualism' with 'authority and patriotism' was the obsession of many great post-war novels. Prewitt and Maggio themselves anticipate the heroes of 'Cool Hand Luke' and other anti-establishment films/novels of the era ('The Sand Pebbles', 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest', 'A Thousand Clowns' etc). They're hard-headed, they're rebels, they refuse to budge. But like Karen, whose promiscuity is a reaction against her imposed domestic lifestyle as an Army wife, they can't really articulate why; they unconsciously lash out.'From Here to Eternity' was made with the support of the United States Army, and Fred Zinnemann's always been a bit of a sell-out anyway, so the film never really tackles Jones' themes. Jones was anti-military, anti-war, anti-establishment, whilst Zinneman's busy sucking on the teats of the Production Code. For Zinnemann, all bad military behaviour is a result of 'bad eggs' (who are 'weeded out and punished'), all brutal men get their comeuppance, bad captains resign, bad boxers are demoted and the death of Maggio is 'his own fault anyway' (he falls off a truck). Jones' cynical portrayal of soldiers (always knee deep in booze, sex, violence and bad language) and officers (ruthless careerists who toy with lives) is also toned down. 'This country's Army is why I hate this country,' Maggio says in Jones' novel. 'What did this country ever do for me? Give me a right to vote for men I cant elect? You can have it. Give me a right to work at a job I hate? You can have that too! They say I'm a citizen of the greatest, richest country on earth, that if I don't believe it I should look at Park Avenue. Carnival prizes! All carnival prizes! They shouldn't teach their immigrants' kids all about democracy unless they mean to let them have a little bit of it! Me and the United States is dissociating our alliance as of right now, until the United States can find time to read its own textbooks a little!' It's rage like this which Zinnemann's film goes to lengths to avoid.Still, Zinnemann gets some things right. Jones, whose war trilogy moved from WW2's prelude to aftermath ('Eternity', 'Line', 'Whistle'), had no time for jingoism, contrived heroism, and his grunts were always consigned to a drudgery at sharp contrast with the high adventure promised by recruiting posters. Zinnemann captures all this well. He also coaxes fine performances from Burt Lancaster, Montgomery Clift, Deborah Kerr and Donna Reed, the latter two floating about like noirish femme fatales. Zinnemann's cutting, sense of place, time and compositions are also a head above most melodramas from the era.7.9/10 - See Vincente Minnelli's 'Some Came Running', a marginally better James Jones adaptation from the 1950s.

Atonement," The Cat's Pajamas
","'I wouldn't necessarily believe everything Briony tells you. She's rather fanciful.' - Cecilia TallisJoe Wright directs 'Atonement', a film based on a novel by Ian McEwan. The plot? In 1935, the thirteen year old daughter of a wealthy family, Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan), falsely accuses a servant's son, Robbie Turner (James McAvoy), of sexually abusing a teenage girl. Turner is arrested and jailed for this alleged crime. This arrest tears Robbie away from Briony's older sister, Cecilia (Keira Knightley), a woman whom he loves. 'Atonement's' first half is mostly excellent. Stylishly directed, the film watches as Briony misreads the adult world around her. To her naive eyes, the sexual tension between Cecilia and Robbie thus constitutes a 'perversion'. A 'perversion' which Briony decides makes Robbie a 'sex maniac' and so 'rapist'. That adults readily believe Briony's story speaks to the inequities and injustices of Britain's firmly entrenched class system. At the half-way mark, though, 'Atonement' morphs into another film. Here Robbie joins the army, is sent to France, fights in World War 2, sees many horrors, assembles in Dunkirk with thousands of other soldiers and dies of septicaemia. All the while, Robbie and Cecilia pine for one another. Deeply in love, they're never reunited. Briony blames herself for this. The film closes with Briony, now an elderly woman, writing a fantastical novel in which Robbie and Cecilia live 'happily ever after', a gesture which Briony hopes will exonerate Robbie and so atone for her lies. 'Atonement's' second half is mostly kitsch. Tastelessly voluptuous, the film unfolds like a bad David Lean movie ('Brief Encounter', 'Doctor Zhivago', 'Ryan's Daughter'), every moment straining for unwarranted grandeur. By the time Wright hits us with his virtuosic Dunkirk sequence – an elaborate long take that seems pulled from Jancso's 'The Red and the White' - it's hard not to laugh. The film has stopped being about people and problems, and started being about expensively dressed clichés. Robbie and Cecilia aren't just a couple of lovers, but a monument to every tragically wronged couple. They aren't just torn apart, but torn apart by WAR, ruined by RAPE and separated by OCEANS! Because the elderly Briony is suffering from 'vascular dementia', and because the younger Briony is a childish romantic, Wright assumes that his aesthetic, which is florid, fantastical and at times unreliable (the film's soundtrack contains a feverishly typing typewriter), is befitting. Wright's film, after-all, is the very hokey novel Briony is writing. But self-conscious kitsch is still kitsch. More importantly, though McEwan's prose was similarly overwrought, he was parodying readers who yearn for kitsch. Wright, in contrast, is dead serious; he genuinely loves kitsch.Virtually all of McEwan's books find adults and children losing their innocence after encountering some traumatic event. Consider 'The Child in Time', in which a missing child shatters a couple's domestic existence. Consider too 'Enduring Love', in which a balloon accident torments a middle-aged couple, and 'The Cement Garden', in which children cover up and deal with the deaths of their parents.McEwan's lead characters also typically carry a corruptive secret which gradually expels them from their families or communities. Be it pregnancies, rapes, illicit romances or murders, his characters tortuously conceal this secret, only to cathartically release it during the novel's climax. We see this in 'Atonement'. But Briony's crime is not simply that she is a liar and bad novelist, but that she acts like a novelist at all. For McEwan, Briony is guilty of creating fiction. She is guilty of storytelling, which is seen to be inherently corrupt and corrupting. This resolutely postmodern theme – the unreliability of 'art' and its inability to convey the 'whole truth' – has long been McEwan's pet obsession. As such, McEwan's novel persecutes both Briony and his readers for their compulsive need to tidy up life's messiness with familiar plots and neat resolutions. Time and time again, McEwan condemns the limiting projections of artists, the trite desires of readers and demonstrates the implications of fictionality. The result is a novel, like Nabokov's 'Lolita', which attempts to comment on its obvious falsity (its construction as fiction, and the dangers this masks), whilst at the same time trying to convey 'reality'. None of this is captured in Wright's 'Atonement', which works primarily as an old-fashioned tale of love interuptus. 6/10 – Worth one viewing.

The Island," masterpiece cinema but also the explosions not as good as Michael play explosions in masterpiece like bad boys and transfarmers
","Michael Bay is number one top guy and I love him very much but I get nervous before seeing The Island because man in Swedish newspaper say it not very good film. Luckily Michael Bay never disappoint and me and friend Sven rewarded for faith. You see, The Island is more masterpiece cinema from king of masterpiece action cinema Michael Bay. Don't get me wrong. The Island is not as good as Michael Bay masterpiece auteur cinema epics like Bad Boys and Transfarmers, but it is still gold standard action cinema from the maestro delivered with one two KO knockout punch.Now while The Island is certain movie to hit ball out of park, there are some negative aspects which make it not so masterpieceful as Michael Bay masterpiece classics like Transfarmers and Bad Boys. Some people like my friend Sven say The Rock was masterpiece classic cinema too, well that is true slice of fact Sven, but I don't mention it with Transfarmers and Bad Boys in classic list above to save space.So anyway, what about The Island? Well, sad to say, it has some problems stopping it from being top level classic action masterpiece cinema auteur knockout like Transformers and Bad Boys, which as you know is number one top dog films in Swedish industry via landslide. First of all Michael Bay chose an actor who is not American and is from foreign. No big deal? Well, compare to other Michael Bay actor classic heroes and blacks, it is somewhat wrong error in judgement call selection choice. Also the movie star actress Bay chose is sexy mammal but lets be honest you cannot bang her because she is not real, so why put her in action cinema scenes and not focus instead on classic stunts and movie magic and true blockbuster glory? But don't worry. If there is one thing master Bay knows how to do when delivering gold standard classic one two knockout punch auteur cinema masterpieces, it is how to construct believable action knockout moments with deep and good feelings that stand the test of time. That is why I firmly believe The Island will go down in history as moment in time when we finally woke up to true calling of Michael Bay. And that is to deliver masterpiece classics which rock our world and blow our minds with true auteur style and moments, like when The Island has scenes with helicopters and well, I don't want to spoil it for you. Just remember to leave your brain at the door, but then bring it back inside, because as my friend Sven say, this action cinema is only true classic masterpieces from the maestro unless you bring your brain in and understand the true journey plot. And that is why Michael Bay will always be the best. He knows what judgement calls and selections to make with storyboards and film grammar and when he edits he is making statements. Don't get me wrong, I am not saying Michael play is the best, even though he is probably the best on many critic lists about true action classic cinema auteur genius constructors, but I am saying if you really want to rock your world then Bay is your number one man to deliver the goods time and time again with A plus results. And when I say 'man', lol, I don't mean that for literal. Because Michael Bay is a god. A god of true action classic auteur one two knockout punch cinema movie pictures.10/10 - Masterpiece classic action cinema auteur top ten list.",Null,3,9,27 November 2012
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Sullivan's Travels
","'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' is the Coen Brothers' homage to Hollywood's screwball comedies of the 1930s, and a giddy wink to the various depression-era Southern motifs depicted in literature and film. As such, the Coens give us a film awash with the flavours of 1930s Louisiana as mediated by 70 years of accumulated myth. Their vision is categorically not a depiction of the 'real' South, but rather a demented, postmodern take on an imaginary South encountered only in print and film.Chain gangs, baptisms, KKK rallies, unwashed yokels, farm houses, corrupt politicians, bank robbers, blues musicians (who sell their souls at the crossroads), Bonnie and Clyde car-chases, the march of 'progress' as symbolised by the spread of electricity and radio etc. etc....the film is filled with little moments and anecdotes drawn from, not history, but art's impression of history. It's a copy of a copy, paper thin and with the weight of a laminated photograph.If all Coen flicks are postmodern homages, then this one is an affectionate nod to the Preston Sturges comedy 'Sullivan's Travels'. In that film a director sets out to make an 'important' picture (called 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?') instead of a comedy for once, but then ends up realising that he should stick to what he does best. 'There's a lot to be said for making people laugh,' Sullivan says. 'Don't you know that's all some people have?'So in utilising Sullivan's proposed film title for their own spoof, the Coen's are suggesting that it will contain some 'high-minded' artistic content too. Adding in some obviously pretentious and inappropriate references to Homer provide the Coens with just the meta-parodic hook they're looking for. In this regard, the final film contains many amusing parallels with Homer's Odyssey. These include scenes with sirens, a cyclops, blind men and a mockingly self-important 'based on the Odyssey by Homer' credit, all of which serve as a sort of formalist meta-joke. 7/10 - There are some good sequences here, like a KKK ceremony which is reenacted as a MGM musical parody, but the entire film is weighed down by its cartoonishness. Elsewhere the film's self-consciously 'clever' window-dressing serves only to inflate what is essentially a jaunty lark about yokels (which is of course the point of most Coen flicks).
