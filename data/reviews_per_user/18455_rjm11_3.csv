Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," I can't begin to say how wrong this is....
","I keep this DVD on it's own shelf away from my collection because there are still studies underway to determine if it is contagious to other movies. This movie is on a whole other level of wrongness than anything else I have seen lately. Having said that, I busted a gut laughing while watching. If you look at the DVD cover and expect you are going to see comedic refinement in this film you really should have your eyes checked. Taken for what it is, it is a worthwhile watch, maybe it isn't for some people and that is fine. What you must understand that all of the jokes in the world are at 'someone's' expense. Maybe that isn't fair but that is the way it is. I rated this as high as I did for some fall down funny gags (that wrestling match with the censor bars had me crying-like Borat is John Holmes or something-I was crying)and for a weird kind of originality. Again, maybe this movie isn't for some people. It's not for me...NOT!",7,0,1,29 August 2010
Casablanca," 10 lines of text
","I don't know that I can do the 10 lines of text for this. I mean, what can I say that won't be a repetition? This is the yardstick by which all movies are measured. It also contains one of the biggest misnomers of all time. NOBODY says 'Play it again, Sam' during this movie. How many bar bets have I won with that one? (Lots) It also goes to show (to paraphrase another classic) 'you never know what you're gonna get'. This was a 'B' movie completed in a very short time. And we wind up with a timeless classic. Personal note: IMHO, and not to detract from a wonderful ensemble cast, Claude Rains steals the show. A sign of a truly great film is one you pick up in the middle, no matter how often you have seen it, and you just can't turn it off.",10,4,5,29 June 2009
Schindler's List," There is no word to describe this
","A well made and well thought out piece of work. Overall, I can say this worked in black and white when it's been done to death in other films. Direction, Production value and the Acting is nearly unparalleled. I will not mention names as all deserve equal credit for an outstanding performance. The most interesting bi-play for me was between Schindler and Goeth. As the story progresses Schindler tries to suppress his humanity for the sake of profit and Goeth tries to suppress his evil for profit. Throughout this Schindler cannot deny humanity and tries to force barbarity out as this is the only way he will survive. Goeth, perhaps, realizes the evil and tries to force out his humanity only to realize that his barbarity is the only way to survive in the regime he is in. The struggle goes on, and, I think at the end both men realize they have lost. By far for me the most interesting character is Goeth, as you can see sputters and sparks of enlightenment trying to come through, only to be dismissed. If you can watch this movie and not shed a tear, let me know, I will check you for a pulse. This film, while perhaps not a documentary is still a testament about something that should never be forgotten, much the same as Saving Private Ryan is about the combat troops (Schindler's list is not a war movie IMHO) in the European Theatre of WWII. This movie never lets up on you, there are no moments of levity to save you from an account of a dreadful time in history. Not to be missed.",9,9,13,11 April 2010
