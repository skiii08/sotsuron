The Mask," Cute, but one disappointment
","This film was a great lot of fun. It had many cute bits, it reflected a huge amount of creativity from the entire production crew.But there still was one big disappointment. We got to see Jim Carey wear the mask. We got to see the big mafioso wear the mask. We even got to see the dog wear the mask. How I wish we could have seen Cameron Diaz wear the mask!",Null,5,8,2 September 2003
