Child 44," Cold War stamps.
",Somehow Hollywood producers refuse to admit that USSR was something more than 'empire of evil'. USSR was first of all people who believed in future that they can build with their own hands. And this simple idea made USSR superpower. Yes every nation has dark side. But we should respect Russian people who's ancestors sacrificed in World War II and built great country working hard. 50s in which movie takes place actually was time of revival for USSR and fall of Stalinism. People were happy that war is over and restored country. And what is shown is like the opposite - dark world of pain. It is simply historically incorrect. Movie rides too fast. Actors play well but plot makes everything unbelievable.,6,18,39,13 August 2015
