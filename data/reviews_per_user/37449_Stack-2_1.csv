The Blair Witch Project," The best movie of this year.
","You may trust it, you may punish it. But you are afraid of the darkness...the same as I am. And you know this fear in your soul, a fear of untouched. A fear of unknown terror. A friendship crumbles down in this movie and you see it. I mean, you are inside of it all, cause of camera-style. You become one of them. One of them, who are after something but suddenly are in the middle of nowhere and their self confidence collapses down. Slowly. Steadily. Its like to watch Scott's conquering of Antarktis live.",Null,0,1,2 November 1999
