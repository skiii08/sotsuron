Kill Bill: Vol. 2," 8/10 New and improved! Contains only half the camp and all of the cinematic goodness of our regular Vol.1!
","Kill Bill Vol. 2 is just as good as Vol. 1, nay, better! That's very good indeed. The style is different, less camp, more cinema. Sometimes it's a bit slow, but QT seems to always work it around to the film's advantage. The dialog is pretty good, it contains some great stuff and some fumbles. If you saw Vol. 1 and you were not put off by the violence, then you'll have little problem with Vol. 2. Obviously, those who cannot tolerate depictions of violence, some foul language, and some ick should spend their valuable cinematic minutes elsewhere. Enjoy! It's a quality piece of work. 8/10",8,0,1,18 April 2004
Miracle," Dramatic; Terrific acting; The movie wastes nothing.
","This movie is terrific, yet I'm not a hockey fan and I don't watch sports movies. Is it possible that a movie can be all about hockey and not about hockey at the same time? It's not a retrospective of 'the game', it's about people embracing a vision. The worth of this film, and most of the drama, comes from the acting, and from the success of the writer and director in keeping the script tight and the elements of sports, emotion, family, and country balanced. Secondary to this is the drama from the hockey play itself, and this is largely helped by the on-ice cinematography. A successful effort is made to place us in the period, to help us understand the social and political climate of the day; it's important and it's well-executed. Kurt Russell does a fantastic job as coach. Merely seeing a few seconds of his performance in the preview made me want to go see the movie. Each team member gives a top-notch performance. This is not a lovable bunch of misfits, thankfully, but a group of independent young men whose individual characters enhance the film instead of trying to define the film. Patricia Clarkson does a superb job of playing the coach's wife, Patty. First to last her performance was worthy of praise. Overall, nothing in the film went to waste. The dialog was very relevant, the pace was excellent, the content well-balanced, and the cinematography was apparently great because I totally forgot I was looking through someone else's eyes. The cast and crew can look back on this effort with a great deal of pride. I sincerely hope you enjoy this film as much as I did. Thanks for reading.",8,0,0,13 February 2004
Troy," 7/10 Excellent acting, respectable dialog, terrific artistic presentation, bad direction, bad soundtrack, lacks momentum.
","THE GOOD: The acting was as good as I would expect from anyone. The characters were presented in a consistent way. The script was good, definitely held a few nice touches and avoided a few auto-complete phrases. The action, generally, was done well.THE BAD: The soundtrack was annoying. Bah. Tried to be 'epic'. It was botched. The directing... This movie has no momentum. Just when you start to care what's going on, just when something interesting is happening or is being said, something mundane and pointless follows and you're back to zero. There was way too much time spent looking at ordinary things happening, large groups of people moving around, or pan shots of scenery. We all know that ordinary things happen and that large groups of people must move around. Normally this would be ok, except that such things killed the momentum of the movie and wasted precious screen time.SUMMARY: Generally I liked the movie for what it was, and I'm very very glad that the actors did a great job with a fair script; they saved the picture. 7/10",7,3,6,14 May 2004
Knowing," Solid drama and acting. Nice effects. Standard cinematography and sets.
","Overall rating 7/10. Acting is good though not exceptional. Lesser actors would have been a disaster since the material really forced the actors to wring the most out of what they were asked to say. Script is pretty standard material for a human drama, safe and uncreative. The plot elements were above average. No eye-rolling took place while viewing. This isn't a must-have or must-see but if you watch it you won't feel let down and it really is good for mixed company. The family drama is a bit tired but whatever, that's Hollywood for you. The action goes beyond the call in terms of CGI effort, and that was a real eye-opener. The cinematography is the same boring stuff you've seen everywhere. People driving, people talking, people hurrying about. Standard shots with standard timing by people who know how to do standard perfectly. The plot is what makes this a 7 rather than a 6.",7,0,1,21 August 2009
The Alamo," 8.5/10 A fine movie. Great acting. Well-paced. Sub-par camera work.
","Well, I must say, I liked this movie a lot. This movie had... energy, terrific acting from a cast that was believable, excellent visuals, solid writing, great directing, and on a bad note, mediocre camera work. I can't think of a single important scene that I would have changed. Now, I have no idea how well this movie aligns with history, but that's not even on my radar, so it wasn't an issue for me. I would recommend this movie to anyone. 8.5/10",8,5,6,24 April 2004
District 9," Tense solid character-driven action/drama with forgivable faults. 8/10
","As the summary suggests, this movie features a solid premise, very able acting, and a sensible script. The plot is fairly well thought through and each scene follows from the last. The director must have done a fabulous job because I really couldn't predict the events of the movie. It didn't lock itself into a hero-movie path.The character-driven nature of this film is one of its best characteristics, and as a rare treat for an action movie I was able to emotionally invest in the fate of the lead characters. This extra quality offsets the typical action, and more than makes up for some of the slightly more clich√©d elements within the show. Thankfully though, they did not follow any formula closely.It *does* have some faults. There are moments when plot or scene logic doesn't hold up to serious scrutiny, and while the action is well-done, it does have a few of those 'why doesn't he just...' moments. That won't matter to you though because you'll be so intrigued with having a cinematic experience that treats you like a thinking person that you won't even bother to think about HOW the logic is incomplete or how the action should have been done. The foibles are sufficiently minor and the movie keeps moving forward.My biggest problem is with the camera work. The shaky camera effect was used in places I felt it unjustified. Certainly some of the film is believable with the hand-held quality but many parts make that really inappropriate and distracting.This movie is intelligent, and I beg for a sequel. I want that sequel to be a continuation of the story, with the same high calibre acting, attention to script quality (that's so important), and not blown way out of proportion and made horrid like sequels normally are.Thank you, everyone who contributed to District 9. This movie did not disappoint!",8,3,7,25 August 2009
Hellboy," B+ Good script, well-paced, overall very entertaining.
","Hellboy is a well-balanced and very well-paced movie that avoids tiresome action movie content (mostly).Script: Very efficient. The snappy-attitude lines are allowable because of Hellboy's partially juvenile personality.Acting: I credit Pearlman for presenting a complete character without being gabby and coy. Well-done. Almost all of the other significant characters are equally well-presented by their respective actors, save for one. del Toro certainly dropped the ball in writing/directing that character (though I won't mention who so as not to give anything away). He messed up only one character, and I forgive him. Nobody's perfect.Casting: Appropriate.Pace/balance: The movie reminded me of X2 in this respect. It moved well, didn't get stalled anywhere, and both the action and drama were moderated with smooth transitions between each.For comparison, Spiderman was good but overacted, X2 was good but with a few eye-rolling moments.Overall, I found this movie provided high entertainment value. B+",8,45,62,13 April 2004
Shrek 2," 8/10 At least as good as Shrek 1.
","Shrek 2 is at least as good as Shrek 1. There were plenty of laughs. I found that most of the humor was fresh with only a little bit of post-consumer material. The cast of characters was colorful. The script was  well-refined. The animation was fantastic as you'd expect. There isn't much else to say really. It's a fine sequel, a truly fun trip. It's especially satisfying to see a good sequel in a world that uses the sequel as a low-effort money-maker. Well not this time. I'm definitely buying this when it's available. Enjoy! 8/10",8,0,0,25 May 2004
Man on Fire," 7/10 Convincing acting, good script, well-paced, annoying cinematography.
","I like Denzel Washington and Christopher Walken, and I was happy to see both doing a good job in this film. Everyone has their bad films, and neither of these gentleman can claim this as their 'bad one'.Acting: Everyone did well in this film. Kudos to the little girl, she's a fantastic actor. (Too bad she's aware of that.) I've yet to see Christopher Walken in something really out of his style. Nevertheless, this was good, and he managed well enough with the material he was given. Denzel did what he always does, and that's good enough for now. Mickey Rourke did about what you'd expect as a slick lawyer. The supporting cast was exceptional. I was particularly impressed with the driver of the 'bad guys' car, and the guy from New Jersey.Plot: Well, gee, I don't know. A non-Mexican man in Mexico City walking around in a business suit who is wanted by corrupt officials. Frankly, he stands out like a national monument, and I haven't the experience to say whether this is possible without quick death or not. I didn't see him wearing a bulletproof vest, and anyone can be victim of a good driveby. If a reporter can find him, then so can anyone else who wants to find him badly enough.Script: No problems here. Even the one-liners were delivered with some sense of self-satire. It seemed pretty good.Overall, I like the movie. There are better, but this one's good.7/10",7,0,0,9 November 2004
Shall We Dance," 7/10 Very enjoyable, good acting minus JL, well-paced, few faults.
","I liked this movie a lot. I laughed far more than I expected, and the movie was fairly faithful to my memory of the original. Note I say 'my memory' because I saw Shall We Dansu about three or four years ago and I loved it. (I recommended it to anyone who would listen. I still love it, and I recommend it to you. Back to my review.)Acting: Jennifer Lopez Should not have been cast because her acting talent is wanting. I found it odd that someone who's been hassled so much lately has a problem acting cold. (I could rant a little but I won't.) Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon did a fine job and created a believable couple. Susan Sarandon pulled things together in my view. I liked the PI, he was very good. Gere's dancing office mate also did a fine job, but the believability of that character is the responsibility of the director. The actor did well with what he was given.Plot: Someone else said that the original worked better in the framework of Japanese culture. I agree. This movie had to make some concessions to work in an American setting.Directing: Hmm, pretty good I'd say, except for JL. Perhaps he did his best with what she had to offer, maybe they did 50 takes on her scenes, who knows. The pace of the movie was quite good, and that's important. These psudo-family dramas need to keep moving in order to keep me from falling asleep. This director kept things moving.In summary, I really felt this had lots going for it. I am surprised to see that the viewer rating was bumped down to 5.8/10 (932 votes) as of my writing this review. It's better than that, if you can excuse a few minor things.7/10",7,0,0,9 November 2004
The Bourne Supremacy," 9/10 Refreshing, smart, some tight dialog, shaky camera gets a bit old, but I loved this movie!
","No spoilers here.I've waited years for this movie.  Finally, a picture that captures action in a more realistic way than we normally see. I ignore most action-genre donuts. (Fatty with an empty heart.)I didn't see Bourne Identity, so I can't compare this with that.Acting: Really good. Appropriate casting, nice to see Brian Cox and Franka Potente involved in this film. Yes, I threw that in just to feel worldly. I confess.Plot: It's a fine plot, nothing really wrong, though I do question a few things that I won't mention here. Don't worry, it's small stuff.Script: I liked the script. This movie gives you some fresh dialog in places where other movies give bloated, cheesy, wordy goo. I wish there was more original material, but that's ok.Cinematography: The camera work was a bit of an issue for me. In some parts of the film it worked very well giving the viewer a sense of motion and speed and a feeling of loss of control, loss of spacial awareness. In other cases, it was obvious that the operator was shaking the camera like a baby's rattle. Hey, it worked for Blair Witch Project, mostly, and it works here, mostly.Techy stuff: Ok, I somehow managed to ignore most of the high technology presented in the film, so they must have done a better job than most films. So, thumbs up for technical presentation I guess.You know what I mean: a typical 'movie' computer makes about 20 unique noises per minute, processing, downloading, uploading, thinking, burping. Imagine sitting at the terminal for 8 hours hearing bleeps, bloops, swishes, dings, and blips. Now add that to all the other computers around you. Yeah, somehow most directors think we're stupid. Considering that many of us use computers daily, and those computers make no noise at all, it's surprising. Why can't they use a more realistic set of sounds, like a person saying 'C'mon process my stupid request for crying out loud!' while the computer SILENTLY does its work. Or someone telling a stupid joke, or nervously tapping a pencil. Oh, and don't get me started about fancy red blinking ACCESS DENIED windows. Oh man. But I digress.Overall, this is a refreshing intrigue/drama/action movie. If going to see an action film makes you feel dirty, rest assured, you will feel squeaky clean after this one.9/10",9,2,2,26 July 2004
Shark Tale," 5/10 The script could have been computer-generated.
","This film was an expensive exercise in mediocrity. I laughed a bit, but not much.Script: Did this movie actually have a human writer? I'm debating that. The script was so formula that it seemed it could have been written by a computer. Perhaps there are computers named 'Rob Letterman' and 'Damian Shannon' out there somewhere pumping out the next 'Hippo Story'.Characters: Why did they animate this movie at all? Really, it could have been produced with humans on dry land and it would have been the same. The fact that they were aquatic beings gave nothing to the film because every character was made to appear and move as much like a human as possible. So what's the point? At least in Finding Nemo, they were actually fish that behaved like fish. Worse than this though was the inclusion of human culture, the same blunder as Star Wars Episode 1. Absurd.Voices: Yep, they did a good job. Who cares.5/10",5,1,5,9 November 2004
