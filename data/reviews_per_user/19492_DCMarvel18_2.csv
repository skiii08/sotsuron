The Avengers," The Greatest Superhero Movie Ever!
","I've seen The Avengers about 5 times in theaters now, including the midnight premiere and I can say it is my favorite movie of all time and the by far the greatest superhero movie to ever exist. It even surpasses the legendary films from the Christopher Nolan Batman trilogy. It's a fantastic film all-around, and it has characteristics that any moviegoer or non-moviegoer would just love. The plot has Joss Whedon written all over it and that's how everybody loves it, with his other amazing pieces of work like Firefly and Buffy The Vampire Slayer. This is the first Marvel movie after its purchase by Disney, so that means amazing special effects and The Avengers doesn't disappoint with that at all. Being a hardcore Marvel comics fan, this movie is a dream. It also has a spectacular star-studded cast, Chris Evans returns as Captain America, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, and Samuel L. Jackson as Sgt. Nick Fury, with new performances by Cobie Smulders as Agent Maria Hill, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye, and by far the fan-favorite and greatest performance of the movie is Mark Ruffalo as The Hulk. People were nervous about the new Hulk because they didn't know how Ruffalo would perform as the Hulk because Edward Norton played the Hulk in the most recent Incredible Hulk movie, but Ruffalo delivered a performance that none of the other cast could top and was the hit of the movie. The Avengers is a movie that no one can hate, I guess that's why it's the 3rd top grossing movie worldwide of all-time. So, unless you hate good movies and yourself, go see the biggest movie of 2012, Joss Whedon's masterpiece, Marvel's The Avengers.",9,5,12,7 August 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," The Perfect Conclusion for the Caped Crusader!
","The Dark Knight Rises is by the far the greatest Batman movie of all time. I'm a hardcore Batman movie and comic fan at heart, but that doesn't matter. After The Dark Knight, People were curious how Nolan could top such a fantastic film with a mind-blowing conclusion to his Batman trilogy. There's not much you can say without spoiling the movie. But, Christian Bale still holds up as Batman, Anne Hathaway's Catwoman had a lot of fans worried, but she followed through with a fantastic performance. By far the greatest part of this movie is Tom Hardy's performance as Bane, it doesn't compete with Heath Ledger's Joker, but that is a very hard act to follow. The Dark Knight Rises is currently the greatest superhero movie series around and by far the greatest movie of the 2012 summer season. It is perfect for any fan of Batman, Comics, and Fantastic movies. Christopher Nolan has outdone himself again and I'm personally upset to see his amazing run on Batman to come to end, but it surely ends with a bang and will forever go down in history.",9,5,12,6 August 2012
