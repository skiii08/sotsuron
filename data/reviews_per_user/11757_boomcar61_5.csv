The Blair Witch Project," Finally
","Having just viewed 'The Blair Witch Project' for the fourth time, I am very pleased to announce that I have finally decided on a rating score, which I will mention later. This was a hard one to do a review on because I noticed different things each time that I watched it. I know that using the word 'things' can be pretty vague, but just watch this and you'll get an idea of what I mean it to pertain to. Ultimately, I considered that as far as originality goes it probably deserves a ten, and as for its psychological horror approach, in my opinion, it should get a five. Then there is Heather Donahue's acting, and, well, I just decided not to go there. So I will end up rating 'BWP' somewhere between five and ten.The film has some scary moments(mostly at nighttime), granted you should probably keep the volume at full blast since I failed to hear these scares on my first two viewings. The ending was pretty intense, and a little shocking, to say the least. The acting, collectively, was believable and the bumpy camera movements definitely add a touch of realism. 'Blair Witch Project' turned out to be, in some ways, a very genuine horror movie, and it was definitely ambitious and creative, not to mention extremely profitable. I'm also fairly certain that it's considered a cult classic among critics and viewers alike. As for myself, I'm not too fond of it. In this kind of genre it's really not my cup of tea. Still, I will definitely recommend it to the hardcore movie-goer because it really is a rarity in the horror genre. Whether or not it's a worthy one is up to the viewer.6/10 is my final vote. Followed by the Hollywood-ized sequel 'Book of Shadows:Blair Witch 2'.",Null,0,1,28 February 2005
Memento," Film Achievement
","'Memento'. Hmm. Where to begin. It's all backwards....This clever little film-gem stars Guy Pearce as Leonard, a man suffering from a brain disorder which prevents him from making new memories. He cannot remember anything after the murder of his wife, and he has tattooed his entire body with clues about the killer's identity. This guy, in my opinion, is a mess, sadly. Can he really trust his notes? Oh my, the paranoia. Anyways, I know that films of late are often credited as 'Hitchcockian', but this one is the only one that really is. It's original, to say the least, in an array of unoriginality that plagues most films nowadays. Great emotions abound. Paranoia. Confusion. Fear of the outside world. Deception. The story, honestly, is really nothing new, other than the brain-disorder part of it. I've seen several of these murder-mystery thrillers....but the great thing about 'Memento' is that its director and writer(Christopher and Jonathan Nolan)dramatize this classic tale in an intriguing and unconventional way. Great stuff. Can't complain about originality...Overall, I was definitely pleased with this title, although I have a feeling I haven't quite figured it out yet. That's the beauty of it, though. I'll keep trying, and I have some theories, but I won't address them here...10/10 is my vote. An awesome experience.",Null,0,2,29 March 2005
Halloween," Outstanding
","Halloween(1978)stars a very young Jamie Lee Curtis, the late Donald Pleasance, and, among others, P.J. Soles(the cap-brat from Carrie). The story centers around the demented/catatonic-schizophrenic Michael Myers and the brutal, cold-blooded murder of his oldest sister in 1963(done by him). Now it is fifteen years later and Michael has escaped the sanitarium and is headed for Haddonfield, Illinois, home of Laurie Strode(Curtis), his sister who was adopted shortly after the 1963 murder. Laurie has no idea about her past and wanders around with her friends, seemingly free of worry, and unaware that her every step is under careful watch from hiding eyes.In the long run I am at a loss for words. Everything is here. And it's even terrifying...and a slasher movie, what a combination. Slasher movies, to me, usually aren't scary. But Halloween is. Seriously, if you haven't seen it yet you are really missing out. It's a rare achievement in film history and is one of the best horror movies ever made. It's a perfect 10/10 all the way!!!",Null,96,130,23 February 2005
Carrie," Flawless film
","Sorry. Haven't read the book, but I know that Brian DePalma's film version is definitely in my top ten list of the best movies of all time. It's virtually flawless on every level, except for a slight problem with the sound mixing. Other than that little pet-peeve, 'Carrie' is a very worthy film experience.Furthermore, I find 'Carrie' to be a mild(and definitely morbid)coming-of-age, character study with an overtone of psychological horror. Sissy Spacek, who plays Carrie, turned in an Oscar nominated performance, and so did her screen-mother Margaret White(Piper Laurie). And we all know that Piper deserved to win that one. Her performance in this film elevates her, at least in my opinion, into one of the most talented actresses of all time. She plays a deeply disturbed/confused religious fanatic who has sheltered her daughter Carrie's entire existence from outside stimuli. This shelter is breached, however, when Carrie's fellow classmate Sue Snell(Amy Irving)volunteers her own boyfriend Tommy Ross(William Katt)to a prom date with Carrie. Sue's reason for doing this occurs in the opening scene of the film where she orchestrates an attack on Carrie involving tampons. Actually feeling remorse for this act, Sue decides that by giving up her prom date to Carrie she will definitely make up for the torment that she caused. Unfortunately things are only going to get worse for Carrie...In comes Chris(Nancy Allen), who, because of failing to comply with the terms of punishment rendered for the tampon fiasco, is banished from the upcoming prom. This infuriates the spoiled drama queen, who ultimately blames the whole thing on Carrie. So then Chris constructs a hateful vendetta and initiates boyfriend Billy(John Travolta),and some other bubba, and the three of them go to a pig farm late at night and kill a pig with a sledge hammer. The rest is history.But for those viewers who are not familiar with this classic story, Chris and Billy 'rig' the king and queen ballots and Carrie ends up winning in a landslide. As the two villains wait under the stage, Carrie and Tommy take their places and are crowned king and queen of Bates High School. Then, after a close call with Sue almost catching them, Chris pulls a rope which is connected to the bucket of pigs blood, which is directly above Carrie's head, and voil√†...Carrie unleashes her telekinetic rage on everyone in the gym(yes, even the innocent ones).I refuse to make any comments on the climax of the film since it was a scene that I had forgotten about, or for some reason skipped when I was younger. Come to think of it I was probably not allowed to watch it because it is pretty violent and disturbing(and kinda sad). Ultimately I wouldn't have wanted anyone to ruin it for me so I will leave that part alone....especially since it features one of the scariest moments in horror movie history.I definitely recommend this title, and although I do realize that it is not for everyone(judging by some of the IMDb reviews)there is still no denying the powerful performances in this film. There is nothing else to say. 'Carrie' is totally a 10/10. Nothing short of perfection.",Null,1,1,4 March 2005
Donnie Darko," Brief...
","After coming across 'Donnie Darko' several times while it was airing on cable, or something, I pretty much believed that it was something stupid since I always caught the scenes where all the kids are waiting at the bus stop and they always seemed to be teasing some girl, and I ultimately never stuck with it. But then, after coming across it at my local video store, I was surprised to see that it featured Drew Barrymore...and Patrick Swayze! Hmm. Odd. Where has he been? Anyway, I've read almost all of the reviews on this sight and I personally would find it exhausting and pointless to summarize the plot of this title...so I won't. What I will say is that 'Donnie Darko' is a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and I believe that no one should miss it. Seriously. DON'T miss this one.10/10 is my vote. Have fun with it. It's definitely on my top ten list for 'best films of all time'. Open your mind a little before you watch it, though. ;)",Null,4,8,20 November 2007
