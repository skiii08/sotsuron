The New World," New World
","Historically this movie is a farce. The inaccuracies are so many and blatant that I find myself stunned in disbelief. No one in this movie thought of reading a history book on the settlement of Jamestown. Pocahontas and Smith never had a love affair. She was a 12 or 13 year old beautiful girl fascinated and infatuated with the John Smith and English settlers. It is a myth that Smith had a relationship with Pocahontas. Even the last scene of Rolfe, who Pocahontas did marry, carrying his child on board to head for the New World was wrong. Rolfe abandon the child in England never seeing him again. Now it not bad enough the movie is historically inaccurate but after 15 minutes of beautiful cinematography the show turns into a BORE. No plot, no action, no nothing I am reminded of 1968 Elvira Madigan which was all beauty no substance. I can go to an art gallery if all I am looking for is beautiful art works. I need more than that from films.",1,5,14,24 January 2006
