Resident Evil: Afterlife," if not for Milla, it only worth 3
","The best scene of the movie was the opening scene, the Japanese girl in the rain sequence, after that, the whole movie is quite disappointed. This episode didn't offer anything new, except for the 3D. There's almost like no script at all, the character are just moving from one scene to another. They should act more zombie blasting in the movie at least. The final showdown between the bad guy and Alice also not exciting and not interesting, the only fighting scene interesting is when the scene where Alice battle the zombie at the root top, and running shooting the zombie in slowmov.is very obvious they don't know how to move the story from the previous episode, so they just kill all con Alice's and also Alice's power at the beginning of the movie.if not for Milla, i think this is a cheap B rate movie just try to ride on the 3d bandwagon to make some quick buck.for the audience, there's a shot in the middle of the credit roll, so don't leave too early.",5,6,14,11 September 2010
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Good Movie
","good movie, better than all the superheroes movie recently. the apes carry the movie very well, much better than all the human casts. the hero ape Caesar should be nominated by best actor for Oscar award. the cgi is damned good, just look at their eyes, it's full of emotion.can't wait to see the next installment how the apes and Caesar take over the world. but for those never know anything about the past 'planet of the apes', they might think the ending hanging.one thing need to mention is, according to the original 'planet of the apes' the apes didn't conquer the world from human, it's the human kill each other (world war) that destroy the mankind them-self and then the apes rise and take over the world.",Null,0,4,6 August 2011
Frozen," Should give Elsa more screen time
","It's a very moving animated film, worth a watch. but i think the screenwriter should have given Elsa more screen time. While Anna just another tangle Rapunzel, Elsa's character is very interesting, and i really like to see more about her, especially how she felt, her inner world. Her inner world must be very complicated, quilt, release, alone, fear..... i also think they should have given more time to build the love relationship between the caveman and Anna, and more screen plot between the two sisters. at the end, the defrost scene, the climate of the story, is happening too fast, they should have given more time for this climate scene to push the emotion to the highest.",7,1,5,30 November 2013
