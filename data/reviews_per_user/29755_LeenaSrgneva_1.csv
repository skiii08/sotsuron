Iron Man 3," Awesome!!!!!!
","This movie was so worth going home at 1:00 am. This was the best Iron Man yet. I think that it's the second best movie, first being The Avengers. I loved the scene at the end credits. It was worth watching and I think Robert Downey Jr. did an excellent job as always. Gwyneth Paltrow did an excellent job too. I loved Don Cheadle in this movie too. Shane Black did excellent as the director. I think Joss Whedon has a tough job to make Avengers 2 after awesome movies like these. Warning Spoilers!: I also was not expecting the Mandarin to be fake and Killian to be the main bad guy. I also was not expecting for Tony to get his arc reactor removed. I flipped out when they said Tony Stark will return!! There was also great music and I loved the song 'Can You Dig' it in the end credits by Brian Tyler. I loved how they put Bruce in the end scene too. End of Spoilers To sum it up, I loved this movie and it's my second favorite movie, first being the Avengers.",10,7,14,5 May 2013
