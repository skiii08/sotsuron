Requiem for a Dream," I found this movie utterly shattering.
","This movie was one of the hardest to watch I've ever experienced.  Ellen Burstyn gives a brilliant performance.  I NEVER speak of a movie as being depressing, but this one actually was.  It made me feel very sad and disturbed, and that feeling stayed with me for a long time.  It is a very well done film.",9,0,0,1 January 2001
