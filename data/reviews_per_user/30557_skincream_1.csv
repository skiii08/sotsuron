Marie Antoinette," Don't go to the movies to learn about history. Get a book if that's your intention.
","This is not the best period piece ever made, but in saying that, it is far from the worst. I don't know what the point is of being a history critic when viewing a movie. All period films can be picked apart by historical falsehoods, but it's pointless to do so. You'll just loose the meaning of an entire movie in the process.Amadeus, my top favorite period piece of all time, is far from accurate. It wasn't meant to be a biography though. Likewise, Marie Antoinette was not meant to be a biography either. It's a story based loosely on a historical queen. This film is Coppola's personal twist on the character.I like history, but when I want to learn about it, I go to a library, not a movie theatre. Watch this film as a story, not as a piece of history. If you do, you'll find it a lot more enjoyable.",6,2,3,28 June 2007
