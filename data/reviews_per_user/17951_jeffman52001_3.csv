Halloween," The ultimate horror movie!!
","'Halloween' in my book is the greatest horror film around.John Carpenter and Debra Hill created this masterpiece and showed they know how to make a great movie.A great cast,Jamie Lee Cutris as Laurie Strode,the late Donald Plesence as the psychiatrist Dr. Sam Loomis,P.J. Soles as Lynda,Nancy Loomis as Annie.Charles Cyphers as Sheriff Brackett,Nancy Stephens as Marion Chambers,Brian Andrews as Tommy Doyle and Kyle Richards as Lindsey.The movie started out in 1963 in Haddonfield,Illinois as Michael Myers,a little boy sees his sister,Judith,having sex with her boyfriend.As soon as her boyfriend leaves,Michael picks up a knife and goes upstairs and stabs his sister.His parents come home and see him with a knife in his hand and a blank expression on his face.Fifteen years later,Michael is going to be going to court.His psychiatrist,Dr. Sam Loomis is with a nurse,Marion Chambers go to the mental institution and see the patients outside.Micheal hits the window of the car and nearly hurts Marion.Michael escapes and drives off in the car.Dr. Loomis knows where Michael is going to.He goes to Haddonfield to find Michael.Michael goes on his killing spree,it is Halloween night and the whole town of Hadonfield will be forever effected by the mayhem of Michael Myers.'Halloween' is the greatest horror movie and it really introduced us to a really big time psychopath,Michael Myers.Nick Castle played the roll of Michael Myers really well.Nick Castle,who is also a director,directed films like 'TAG: The Assassination Game' and directed the 1984 science fiction movie 'The Last Starfighter' which starred Lance Guest,who played Jimmy in 'Halloween II'.I heard that the mask of Michael Myers is modeled to look like William Shatner a.k.a. Captain James T. Kirk of 'Star Trek' in the interview with the late Debra Hill.I give this movie 2 thumb up and 10 stars.",10,2,4,31 October 2005
The Breakfast Club," The best teen film of the 1980's and beyond.
","I would have to say that this movie about teens is the best in the 1980's and beyond,this movie really gets to the heart of what being a teenager can be and the pain of been a teenager.Five teenagers having to spend a whole Saturday in detention at first didn't know one another but got to become friends.Andrew Clark(Emilio Estevez),John Bender(Judd Nelson),Allison Reynolds(Ally Sheedy),Clair Standish(Molly Ringwald),and Brian Johnson(Anthony Michael Hall) learned more about each other as time went on.The principal Richard Vernon(Paul Gleason)looked down at them like they were very bad people,not realizing they are human like him,but learned some things from Carl the Janitor(John Kapelos)about being a teen.The gang starting to bare their souls about the way their parents treated them,that really showed that their differences do not outway their similarities.All friendships start out that way.This film really talked to me in many ways,I am an 80's man,I miss the days.This film I give 2 thumbs up and 10/10 stars.The soundtrack is so awesome,Simple Minds 'Don't You Forget About Me'is an awesome song and the other songs like 'We Are Not Alone'by Karla Devito is a super song.I recommend buying the Soundtrack.",Null,0,1,28 June 2004
