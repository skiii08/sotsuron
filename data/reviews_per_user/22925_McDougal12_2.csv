The Avengers," WOW generic dumb action movie
","This movie got all the hype, everyone seeing it buying tickets, and loving it. I couldn't see it sooner but all of my friends we're telling me how great it was. So finally get a babysitter and go over pay (16$ per ticket) to see it in IMAX3D...and it was horrible. I actually went to the bathroom and accidentally walked into the Battleship theater and didn't realize it was different until i couln't find my wife. lol. It was bad...and I like comics. I hated Thor but the other movies were good...and Thor made this movie bad. Chris Hemsworth should just quit...he's insulting. Robert Downey JR and MArk Ruffalo did all they could...but they could not save this horrible movie. The plot was like something a 3 yr old would make up playing with his action figures. SAmuel L was so generic. They over used the same jokes over and over especially with Captain America. This was just a bad movie. Out of all the awesome MArvel bad guys...Loki is the dumbest. Avoid this movie unless you still live in your parents basement, never had a girlfriend, are under the age of 7, or enjoyed transformers 3 (which this was basically the same horrible over the top bad movie). At least Scarlett Johansen was in it...gave me one thing to look at the whole time.",1,6,16,23 May 2012
Prometheus," Liked it, but praying for a director's cut blue ray asap!
","The movie was great, Fassbender is amazing as the android David, the creatures are cool and ever evolving but the plot seemed a bit less epic than expected. Also, I didn't feel very attached to the characters by the end of the movie...but all in all it was good. Don't expect Alien...it's a different movie and a lot different. I do feel as though a lot was missing, and knowing Ridley Scott, I'm willing to bet the Director's Cut will be way better (i.e. Blade Runner DC)! I won't give anything away, but the movie is very beautiful, I definitely want to watch it again because I feel as though I miss some things...its one of those types of movies.",9,2,7,9 June 2012
