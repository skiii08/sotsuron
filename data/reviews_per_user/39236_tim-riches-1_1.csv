Deja Vu," If you liked Deja Vu, you'll LOVE Pastwatch!
","Pastwatch: the Redemption of Christopher Columbus is a science fiction novel by Orson Scott Card, dealing with time travel and alternate history. It's easily the best piece of fiction I have ever read from any author. It is one of only two books that had me crying for joy by the end.The book's focus is the life and activities of Christopher Columbus. Much of the action deals with a group of scientists from a doomed future Earth who use their TempoView device to see events in the past. When the much improved TrueSight II comes out, they find they are having an effect on the past by using it. After concluding that Columbus' disastrous contact with the Native North Americans would make an ideal candidate for changing history, they decide to travel back to the 15th Century.Highly, HIGHLY recommended reading for fans of all types of fiction. A thoroughly enjoyable read!",10,6,11,4 May 2007
