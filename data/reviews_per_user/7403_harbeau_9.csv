The New World," Artistic ...crud
","Wow.I just forced myself to watch this, hoping there was some sort of redeeming factor at the end. I was mistaken.For those that are very into 'The Arts', this is probably what you want, and I would recommend it.For Joe Average...this movie will bore you to tears, with photography that has no sense of purpose (if I have to look upwards at another set of trees for an extended shot...), a soundtrack that would put my grandmother to sleep, and a plot that meanders all over the place, without seemingly any rhyme or reason. More than once I thought this film was intended for the 'TV movie of the Week' because of pauses that seemed to have no purpose. Supposedly this movie is about Pocahontas, but if you expect a script like the Disney version, you will be sorely mistaken.Not that I blame the writers/orchestra/actors/others for any of this. It is the director and the producer's fault, I know this. They decided to make a movie with Artistic Value, which has no value to anyone else.",2,0,3,18 August 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Not as good as I expected
","I did like this movie...up until the last half hour or so.Call me a sap, but I like movies with happy endings. I want Will to end up with Elizabeth. Will is a 'nice guy' and through the first film and the first part of the second, Elizabeth stands by her man. The ending, however, indicates that she basically now has the hots for Capt Jack, who has revealed himself so far to be a thoroughly despicable character. Sure, at the very end he does make one valiant sacrifice to head back to the ship...but in the end this does nothing for the ending. In fact, it is very atypical of him, and rather hard to believe. Will, being the nice guy and true friend (although Jack has backstabbed him repeatedly), agrees to go after Jack even knowing that Elizabeth has a thing for him, having seen them together.Who knows...perhaps they will wrap it up in the third, and this will just be a mediocre chapter in the middle (think Matrix 2). I'm not the writer or the director, but part of me hopes so.",6,3,7,28 July 2006
Closer," A disappointment.
","When I first watched this movie, I wasn't even sure why I didn't like it.So, I watched it again. Then I knew.The directing is good, the actors are good...but the characters they portray are not.The problem, for me, with this movie was that I didn't identify with any of the characters. We have adulterers, liars and ...well, I don't know what to even call Clive Owen's character. He's just not likable. Kind of an emotional idiot. And the relationships in the movie, to me, made very little sense.So, that's why the poor rating, from me at least.",4,0,2,16 October 2006
X-Men: The Last Stand," In one word...predictable
","Without giving away any spoilers, I would recommend to my friends to wait until this comes out on video.I found it very disappointing and predictable. Hugh Jackman, in a recent interview, stated that you wouldn't notice the 'seamless' transition to the new director...I noticed. The movie (firmly) held your hand through the entire script, treating you as a young child. Saying that, if you have young teenagers I would recommend this movie..this is who the movie seems to be geared towards.The bright spots of the movie were Mr. Jackman himself, and surprisingly (or perhaps not, considering who the movie is geared toward) the young actors in the movie, which I thought did an excellent job and were well-cast for their roles.I wouldn't say this is the worst movie I've ever seen (Have you seen Warriors of the Wasteland? If you haven't...don't!!) but it definitely doesn't hold a candle to its older siblings.",3,2,4,28 May 2006
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," A different type of movie
","This is a different type of movie. And I never thought that the first '10' I ever gave out would be for a black and white documentary about a long-dead journalist.I don't even like documentaries. Most sensationalize aspects of the characters life, to make them the 'hero' of the story. But I didn't think this one did.Edward R. Murrow was one of the pioneers of television journalism. I already knew this. In fact, this movie didn't tell me much I didn't already know, because he was already a TV icon. Go into any library, and you can find books written specifically about his brand of journalism. A quick Google search while writing this review came back with over 1.8 million hits on his full name. That isn't including derivatives, misspellings and use of just his last name. In the TV age, he is a famous man, though he didn't really try to be.But this movie told his story in a very real, very personal light. It didn't give you every detail, or try and give you an overview of his entire life. Again, because much of the story that is told is public record, it could have been warped, distorted, or told differently...but it wasn't. I got what I think was a real sense of who Edward R. Murrow was, a real person who was not entirely sure that what he was saying was the 'right' thing. But he felt it was his responsibility to tell it.In short, this movie doesn't try to do everything. It tells a story..in this case, a true story, or someone who died 6 years before I was born.And it does an excellent job of it. Well written, well directed, well cast, well acted. Kudos all around.",10,1,2,26 August 2006
Eyes Wide Shut," Seven years later...
","I just watched this movie last night, in amongst a marathon of 'sensual thrillers'.I would have to say, that amongst all the Stanley Kubrick films I found this by far the least.It wasn't so much the plot, which was thin but ...ok, I can go with that. The direction of the piece...I didn't understand, which made the movie hard to follow.On top of that was the music. What was with the piano plunking?!!?!!? On many scenes you hear a (highly annoying) one-finger-plunking on a piano. It makes absolutely no sense in relation to the movie, just leaves you annoyed and not really paying attention to the film. This movie really brings home what music can bring to a script...and how BAD music can ruin it.Granted, I also didn't really understand the ending. But the piano plunking had annoyed me to the point that I just wanted it to be over.4/10, for the production more than the script or acting.",4,2,8,5 September 2006
The Descent," The best horror movie of all time???
","Start off by saying that 'horror' is not generally a genre I go to see in theaters. I rent them, as I did with this one.'The Descent' is not the worst horror movie I have ever seen. But it is far from the best.It is trite, predictable, confusing, and...not overly scary? I realize that it is in a dark cave, and dimly lit. But when I have to have rewind and watch a scene several times to figure out what is actually happening and why I should care...it stops me from actually getting into the movie. Not to mention the sound...music is loud, speech is almost inaudible. And it is never explained why this movie is set in North Carolina but the actors have British accents? The ending made absolutely no sense at all??? (something sadly common in cheap horror flicks.)",3,1,3,14 July 2007
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Harry at his very worst...
","I was, surprisingly, disappointed at the latest installment of this series.We all want to see Harry as the hero. But in this latest, he does...very little that is heroic. In fact, he seems more like a bumbling fool that gets by mostly on luck than any real talent on his part. He is slipped most of his 'insights' from someone else. He mostly runs away from any hostile encounters. His only act that seems 'Harryish' was during an underwater scene. (I'll refrain from details to avoid spoilers). By the end of the movie, I had much more affinity and appreciation towards Hermione than Harry.On the positive side, I'm sure that this was the way the writer wrote it, or at the very least the way the director portrayed it. I hope it leads somewhere. The cinematography was good, the characters were well-portrayed. The acting was what we have come to expect from this series.A good flick to take your kids to on a Sunday matin√©e, but that's about it.",5,0,0,7 December 2005
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Two hours you will never get back.
","First, let me say I've never been a Woody Allen fan. I find his movies wooden and boring.But this movie was the exception, not the rule! Plenty of turns kept my interest. The plot was intriguing. The dialogue was interesting. Even the subtitled portions (sorry folks, I speak English and French, not Spanish) added to the film.Why, then would I rate this title so low? The ending. Wow, the ending was terrible. Ruined the whole movie, and made the watching of it two hours of stupidity that solved nothing.** SPOILERS AHEAD ** The ending made the whole movie useless. In the end, not only are the main characters in worse shape than they started...they now KNOW their lives are meaningless and terrible. Vicky is now in an unhappy marriage. Christina is single again, and knows exactly what she missed.THIS is why I dislike Woody Allen movies. Because they aren't happy unless you feel terrible at the end.",5,6,15,9 March 2009
