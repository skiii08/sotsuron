Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Plot Holes.. And lots of them..
","The only reason I'm even sitting here and writing this is to vent my gross disappointment in this movie, so I will keep this as short as possible.. I recently watched the despecialized versions of 'Empire Strikes Back' and 'Return of the Jedi'. And it made me wonder if Phantom Menace was as bad as I remember it to be. Given that the last time I watched this movie I was still in high school, my expectations weren't low. I just failed to take into account what a few hundred new stories that inhabit my memories. Here's my take on it: Lucas has gone off the deep end. His constant tweaking and the hostage situation he's created with the original trilogy by not releasing a version without all his tampering aside. This is a mess. Bad use of characters; Next to no explanation for situations; Often times rather weak (and might I say, rather racist) villains; Bad Science; Too much emphasis on effects; Bad story: etc But the most troubling thing for me is the logic in this movie.. We already know how it's going to end up.. because we've seen the original trilogy. We know for instance that that little boy is going to grow up to be evil, and that Yoda tells us that he is full of hate. So make an aggressive little b**terd Not this weird little quiet kid who has magic building powers.. You told us that Yoda trained Obi-Wan.. So make Yoda train Obi-Wan.. not some random Jedi (no matter how cool he might be). This is the story of how the Sith rise up and destroy the Jedi.. So make me feel with and for Darth Maul..This movie is filed with little annoying plot holes like that, and it drove me bonkers. You can't show me an intergalactic senate with thousands of different species and expect me to believe that they are OK with being policed by human Storm Troopers while their human/Sith emperor constructs a weapon to destroy planets..Like I said.. Plot Holes.. And lots of them.. And on a personal note as a lover of sword-duels.. Just explain to me that the Force allows Jedi to see where their enemy is going to attack.. cause it's easy to spot the difference between an actual fight where people react to each other and a choreographed swordfighting-dance where they know where they should place their sword next.Plot holes",2,0,7,17 March 2013
