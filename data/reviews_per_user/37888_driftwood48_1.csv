Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Worst Episode Ever
","The Star Wars Trilogy is one of the most remarkable achievements in film history. I waited impatiently year after year for the prequel to our beloved story. I thought that George Lucas was taking his time to make one of the best movies ever made. Well, I guess I was wrong. This movie was horrible. I would go see a sequal to Anaconda before I saw the next Star Wars.",Null,1,2,27 February 2002
