National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Great sequel
","I would see this movie again in a heartbeat! I loved the first one and the sequel did not disappoint. It was fast paced, no slow moments, and I love history too so that was an added plus. One of my favorite movies growing up was the Goonies where the kids all go in search of treasure. They have to go down in underground passages and solve riddles to diffuse booby traps. 'Indiana Jones' had this special adventure/were-off-to-find something-important feel to it too as did 'Pirates of the Caribbean' (though nowhere near to the same extent with 'Pirates'). There were some moments when you go 'how the heck can he figure this out so fast?' but, hey, I just figure Nic's character is a genius and I couldn't begin to understand geniuses anyway.Once again we have a bad guy that you love to hate who does a very good job. And the Ferrari is back so that rocks! The scenes where they are inside Mt. Rushmore are just totally awesome. It reminded me of when I went to Universal Studio's Island's of Adventure on the island called Lost Continent. The 'ride' was called Poseidon's Fury and you basically walk through this huge building that's supposed to be underground, like in this part of the movie, and you end up walking through a swirling vortex of water and watch Poseidon battle it out with his arch nemesis. Really cool! Highly recommend this movie!!!",10,0,3,18 January 2008
Terminator Salvation," Best Movie of the Summer!
","First of all I must say that everyone who has written a negative review about this movie are completely off base! They are apparently seeking something from the movies that they will never ever receive. This was an amazing film and...I know everyone is entitled to their own opinion but...if they want to be wrong that's fine, I just wish they would keep it to themselves! This movie had it all! Action, suspense, explosions, chase sequences...everything that has made the last three Terminator movies so good. Sure, Arnold wasn't in it as a major role this time but this works out okay because this movie is supposed to take place in a time when his model terminator is in the beginning stages of construction.SPOILERS AHEAD: And actually you do get to see 'him' (in a way) towards the end when a skin covered T-800 prototype attacks John. The actor they got to play it looks VERY close (I'm talking identical twin here) to Arnold. All they had to do was a bit of CG to this actor's face and poof, you had Arnold in T4! It was great seeing it too. It (the T-800) looked almost exactly like it did in the 1984 movie when it first stood up after coming through time. I totally thought it was Arnold's face computer added to the actors body, that's how well they did. The T-800 prototypes without skin also stayed true to their design from the original film which I found very impressive.There were little treats all throughout the film as well that paid homage to the first three films. They had Sarah's voice in the tapes she made for John (and we see the picture Reese carries with him later on), Kyle saying the 'come with me if you want to live' line, John taking over the 'I'll be back' line, and (my friend is the one who caught this) the music that John plays from the boom box as he reconfigures the motorcycle terminator is the same Guns n Roses song that was playing in T2 when we first met the young John Connor.There were new things too. Bale was by far the best John Connor because, let's face it, Bale is good in pretty much anything he's in. I give lots of props to Anton Yelchin as you could tell he had studied Michael Biehn's acting from T1. He had his vocal and facial inflections down pat.I only reserve level 10 rankings for movies that really deserve them. I haven't rated a movie this high since Star Wars Episode 3. What determines whether I give a 10 rating depends on how I feel as the credits are rolling. Was I just blown away? Was I rendered speechless? Were my expectations exceeded? If I can answer yes to these questions (As I was able to for SW3 and now for Terminator Salvation) then the movie gets a 10. Don't listen to all these haters...if you are a fan of the Terminator franchise you will love this movie! I will certainly be waiting eagerly for the next two installments!",10,4,9,22 May 2009
Cloverfield," must be a monster movie fan
","This movie was excellent if you like Godzilla and other old school monster movies. Like the remake of the Poseidon Adventure, new computer CGI is used to modernize the genre. With Poseidon, it was making a ship disaster flick look modern. With Cloverfield, it was likewise taking a monster movie flick and modernizing it. Cloverfield was in no way cheesy like Godzilla though.You have to be able to tolerate the hand held camera shots for the entire film. I do not think it was very slick of the director to show a skyscraper in New York falling straight down and sending a huge plume of dust flying through the streets. It hit a little to close to home and residents of NY, if they didn't already have a complex, probably will after seeing that. Yes, I know its just a movie, and I'm probably overreacting over one single scene, but come on, we can see a monster ravish the city without being shown a nearly identical shot of WTC tower collapse.I don't know exactly what I was expecting from this movie but I will say that whatever it was it succeeded and disappointed. Not very helpful I know. I guess I liked all the action and scary dark tunnel moments (I especially like the going from one tower that is fine to one that is perched precariously at an angle against the good one). On the other hand I wanted more explanation of the monster and to see a shot of the city when it was all over. All in all it was a good movie that I would recommend to disaster/monster/alien movie fans. However, I would probably rank War of the Worlds, Signs, and even The Mist ahead of this one.Like during the last movie I reviewed (The Mist) I had 'America's most immature' sitting in the row right behind me (just lucky I guess)...laughing when something serious is happening and TALKING during the movie. I'm seriously gonna start going to early afternoon shows or the midnight shows (you know, the ones where you're just about the only one in the theater). Please movie goers, when they say no talking before the movie they don't say it in French, German, or Chinese so it should be easy for the average English speaking person to understand. Okay, I'm off my soapbox now. Usually I'm a much more cheerful reviewer but that kind of stuff just bugs the crap out of me.",6,1,5,18 January 2008
The Mist," Great Movie
","I really enjoyed this movie! I would have enjoyed it more had I not been sitting next to a handful of immature viewers who laughed at inappropriate times (like when a person dies...I'm thinking 'would they laugh like that if it was a real life situation!?') So, their inability to take seriously the human nature elements of this film, instead laughing at them, kind of threw a wet blanket on an otherwise great experience.All that aside, I loved how the mist kind of did what the ocean did in 'Jaws'. Like in Jaws, you never knew what exactly was out there or where and when it would strike. I loved that about it. It plays on your imagination.POSSIBLE SPOILERS IN NEXT TWO PARAGRAPHS The ending really reminded me of a 'Twilight Zone' episode where your heart just breaks for the main character...like the one where all this man wants to do is read, then something happens and he is left all alone on earth with all the books, and then his glasses break...its that kind of 'Oh man that is so terrible for that guy' kind of ending.One thing I didn't really care for was the Mrs. Carmoda subplot. At first I thought it was Hollywood's latest attempt to trash the image of Christians. But after watching the movie I realized that most people will see that character as an inaccurate representation of what a Christian (if they are legitimate) should act like. Yes, there are some Christians out there who act like her and make the legitimate ones look bad, but I think people know this and won't think much of her tirade.In all, great King movie, like Shawshank. I have yet to see Green Mile but I loved 'The Langoliers' which this movie made me think of as well.",8,3,11,22 November 2007
