","The King's Speech is a drama based on the speech impediment of King George VI. The fantastic cast includes Colin Firth as Bertie/King George, Geoffrey Rush as Lionel Logue, and Helena Bonham Carter as Elizabeth, the kings' wife. Based on true events, this film follows Bertie as he works to overcome his challenges with stammering while also developing a close relationship with his speech therapist, Lionel Logue. Desperate to help her husband, Elizabeth finds Lionel to help. Through his eccentric methods, Lionel makes a little bit of progress with Bertie. The pressure to overcome the stammering becomes greater when Bertie is unwillingly forced to become the king. He is well aware of his inability to stand up for himself, his speech challenges, and the burden of leading a country. As the pressure of war approaches, the new King must find a way to convince his people that he is a capable leader. The public has always been aware of his inability to give a speech and are unsure how this is will affect his leadership. We watch as George struggles to find his voice, find his courage, and finally find a friend who believes in him. A movie with a similar theme of being a reluctant leader who had to stand up to great adversity was King Arthur. The Saxons were attacking England, and King Arthur had to lead the people to safety. He also had to lead his knights even though some were against the mission. The film was primarily set in the style of Georgian architecture. The room where Lionel and Bertie held their therapy sessions has a beautiful old world wall. The scale of the large old peeling paint wall with a lone couch against it contrast the majesty of the king. In the city, the shots of the posters stating 'God Save the King' increases the pressure placed upon Bertie to lead his people with courage. He knows the posters were in support of his brother David.Throughout the film, we find ourselves rooting for the king to overcome his speech impediment. The support and humor of his wife and Lionel are touching. Although this is a serious drama, there are small bits of humor and humanity. We see a glimpse of the human side of the Royal Family.",9,0,1,22 April 2012
