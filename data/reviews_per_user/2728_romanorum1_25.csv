The King's Speech," The Making of a King
","In 1925 King George V asks his second son, Albert, the Duke of York (Colin Firth), to give the closing speech of the Empire Exhibition in Wembley Stadium, London. The Duke's stammer ensures that he will fail wretchedly. In 1934 (the next scene), he is treated by a portly – and maybe a quack – speech therapist in the baggiest trousers you ever saw; his tailor must have come from Pillsbury. Anyway, the analyst encourages the Duke to smoke as he says it will relax him and give him confidence. Hmmm  He also presents the royal personage with seven sterilized ice cubes to hold into his mouth while he is supposed to read from a text. Gagging, the poor Duke fails miserably. And so we are introduced to the movie's theme: the treatment of the future king's speech impediment.Now the Duke's brother, the Duke of Windsor (Guy Pearce), the heir apparent, obviously has character flaws that hinge against his kingly leadership. Worse, he wants to marry twice divorced American commoner Wallis Simpson (Eve Best). But as the King of England is also the Defender of the Faith (Church of England), there is a dichotomy, to say the least. The Church opposes remarriage if a former spouse is still alive. And the royals and empire peoples would not accept it. Furthermore, the British government, including the Prime Minister, would resign, forcing a crisis and general elections. Hey, Duke of Windsor, can't you find just one young and attractive lass in the empire to be a king's wife? Anyway, upon the death of the Duke's authoritative father King George V (Michael Gambon) in 1936 and the abdication of the throne later that year by King Edward VIII (former Duke of Windsor), Albert becomes king. Along the way Duke is tenderly supported by his loyal wife Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) and is treated secretly by Australian speech therapist (and failed actor), Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), who does not have the proper credentials but has the experience to make his untraditional treatment work. Logue's methods are unorthodox, to say the least. But he does notice that the future king does not stammer when he sings or swears. He obtains further clues when investigating the king's background. There is the matter of protocol that one must keep when dealing with royalty: Logue calls the future king 'Bertie.' Over the years the two testy characters will go through a rather difficult relationship as they bicker on the treatment and have periods where they disconnect. It makes for uncomfortable situations. Eventually they overcome their class differences and personality quirks to have their friendship prosper for the rest of their lives. The picture ends in September 1939, when King George VI must deliver his first war address to his people and rally them against the threat of Adolph Hitler, whose troops had just invaded Poland and begun World War II in Europe. The Fuhrer had long ago mastered the art of public speaking. With the help of Logue he is successful. This is an actor's picture, and succeeds well. Some may find it uninteresting, as they will compare dramatic monarchical movies from Great Britain's remarkable history (like 'The Lion in Winter,' 'Richard III,' or 'A Man for All Seasons') to a picayune plot involving a speech impediment of a king. But Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush can act. The era is pictured well by interior stage sets, and the film is entertaining. 'The King's Speech' even won the Oscar for the Best Picture of the Year.Postscript: King George died in 1952. His oldest daughter, Elizabeth, succeeded him and rules as of this writing.",9,1,1,31 March 2015
Wind River," Murder on an Indian Reservation Where 'You're On Your Own'
","On the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming, a teenage girl, Natalie Hanson (Kelsey Asbille Chow) runs without winter clothing and barefoot in the snow. A shot rings out, and she falls to the ground. But she gets up and tries to run. It is obvious that her time is over.In the next scene, we are introduced to Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner) as he shoots one of the wolves preying upon a small herd of sheep. Employed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, he is an expert tracker and hunter. Cory has a young son, and is divorced from his Indian wife, Wilma (Julia Jones). When we next see him, Cory is tracking a mountain lion that killed a steer. After that he comes upon the body of the dead girl, six miles from the nearest dwelling. Three years earlier Cory had lost his 16 year-old daughter, Emily, after a party. She too was found dead in the snow by a sheep herder. The circumstances of Emily's death are not known, but Natalie and Emily were best friends.Cory summons the tribal police, including Ben Shoyo (Graham Greene). Since the FBI has jurisdiction over homicides on Indian reservations, the nearest agent to the area is summoned: young Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen). Although well-meaning, she is totally unprepared for the ordeal; she has neither appropriate winter clothing nor knowledge of American indian culture. She hires Cory to track down Matt Rayburn (Jon Bernthal), Natalie's boyfriend.Past the half-way part, we see in flashback Natalie with Matt together. The two were obviously in love, and Matt had plans to marry the pretty Indian girl. While tracking to find the whereabouts of Matt, Cory learns that the only folks in the area are the drill site security guards, located in trailers a few miles away. Cory wants to go to the trailers where Matt lives. After separating from the tribal police group, Cory discovers Matt's body in the snow. Meanwhile there is tension between the tribal police and drill site security guards. And like a gunfight in the old West, bullets will settle affairs.This modern western (or neo-western) was directed by Taylor Sheridan. Sheridan's film is the third of his trilogy: Sicario (2015), Hell or High water (2016), and Wind River (2017). According to Sheridan, 'Wind River' was made to highlight the sexual assaults and disappearances of Native American women on Indian reservation lands. Although the Wind River Indian reservation lands are beautiful and scenic, the film conveys the harsh realities of those who reside there. The acting is admirable all-around. Cory adequately conveys his stoicism and his hidden pain, but remains a strong man one should not mess with. He works within his code of honor all the way. But the blueprint of the film is the bleak and relentless winter landscape that dominates the actions of all of the characters. See it.",8,0,0,7 January 2020
Memento," Innovative and Clever, But Also Confusing to Viewers
","Leonard Shelby, who suffers from short-term memory loss, attempts to find the identity of the surviving thug who raped and murdered his wife (Jorja Fox) by retaining Polaroid photos and notes that are stuffed into his pockets, and by tattooing essential clues on his body. Although he was able to shoot and kill one of his wife's two assailants, the second villain caused him a serious blow to the head, damaging his brain. The police do not believe in a second attacker. As Leonard remembers the past before his wife's murders, he has anterograde, and not retrograde amnesia, and knows how to read, to drive, get gas, handle personal affairs, etc. If Leonard's conversations exceed 5 minutes or so, he will forget what the subject was to begin with. His personal struggles are obviously great. When he awakens, he has to determine where he is and how he got there. When a man chases him, he is at first confused and thinks he is chasing the man and wondering why. He knows the truth when the other man fires a gun at him.To tell the tale, Director Christopher Nolan demonstrates an unusual take: there are two alternate timelines. They comprise a black and white part told chronologically and the color sequence division that is told in reverse (non-linear). They merge in the middle of the film although the black and white scenes continue to nearly the end. Each scene is divided into 5-10 minute segments.The film begins in color with the murder of major character John Edward 'Teddy' Gammell (Joe Pantoliano) and works backwards to show the events leading up to it. Leonard, in his own mind, believes that Teddy was one of two assailants that killed his wife. But Leonard is looking at the picture from his own (flawed) perspective. Teddy may be a corrupt undercover cop who takes drug money to enrich himself, and even uses Leonard for his own purposes, but he is no murderer or rapist. And the way the film is constructed, we probably have to believe Teddy's comments because there is no other explanation from the director. Nevertheless, Leonard wrote 'Don't believe his lies,' under Teddy's photograph, and Teddy was doomed.Then there is the woman, Natalie (Carrie-Anne Morse), who also has her own agenda and definitely uses Leonard. Her boyfriend is drug dealer Jimmy Grantz (Larry Holden). Near the end of the movie, in the last black and white segment, Leonard murders (again) Jimmy because he thought that he was the man who supposedly killed his wife. During the confrontation, Leonard receives those two annoying scratches seen throughout much of the film. After that Teddy warned him to leave town, discard Jimmy's expensive suit, and drive his jaguar because he would be a sitting duck for dealers looking for him. Leonard ignores Teddy.The black and white chronological portion explains Leonard's life as an insurance claims investigator. He has authority to handle the case of Sammy Jankis (Stephen Tobolowsky), who has claimed short-term memory loss as a result of an automobile accident. After many tests Leonard concludes that Sammy's problem is mental, not physical from the accident, and advises his company to deny the claim. Later to test her husband, his diabetic wife subjects herself to a fatal test. Nevertheless, near the end of the film in a color sequence, Teddy explains to Leonard that Sammy was faking and never had a wife, and that it was Leonard's spouse who was a diabetic. Furthermore Teddy explains that it was he as a cop who was assigned to Leonard's wife's case. The two of them tracked down the thug and killed him. Also, he states that his wife survived the assault, and that Leonard invented Sammy's story as his own! Did Leonard forget to give his wife an insulin injection? Or did he give her too many? Assuming Teddy was telling the truth, why doesn't Leonard remember that his wife was a diabetic? Note that there is a color scene where Leonard lies in bed with his wife. He does appear to give her an injection in her right thigh, and right after pinches it. And near the very end we see tattoos are already on his body with his wife alive. She must have survived the assault.The film ending is in color and shows Leonard driving up to Emma's Tattoo parlor. Guess what he will have tattooed on his body this time!?The acting is top-notch throughout, as is the editing and pacing. The storyline is unique, to say the least, in the way the timelines are presented. Viewers have to pay close attention and trust their own memories when watching this one! I believe that there is a plot hole. Near the very end we see tattoos on Leonard's body with his wife alive. On the left side of his chest, a tattoo reads, 'I've done it.' (So he killed the thug who assaulted his wife.) But why is the particular tattoo missing throughout the movie? Anyway, Joe Pantoliano steals every scene where he appears. By the way, the movie doesn't say, but if this writer were a betting man he would say that Joe Pantoliano's character is called Teddy because of his strong resemblance to Teddy Roosevelt when he was a Rough Rider. Check out his old photos circa 1898.",7,2,3,3 January 2019
Shakespeare in Love," A Delightful and Spirited Romp
","The setting is 1593 London, in the glory days of the Elizabethan theater. The screen caption reads, 'Two playhouses are fighting it out for writers and audiences: The Curtain Theater with Richard Burbage, England's most famous actor, and the Rose, built by Philip Henslowe.' Plays are often closed because of plagues and bad debts. Because Henslowe (Geoffrey Rush) has a cash flow problem, he is literally being legally (?) tortured by Hugh Fennyman (Tom Wilkinson) at film's commencement. Henslowe saves further pain by explaining that as Will Shakespeare's patron, he is expecting the playwright's latest play within two weeks. The show should garner twenty pounds, or enough to pay off his debt. The working title of the play is 'Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter,' the precursor of 'Romeo and Juliet.' In reality, Will Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) cannot even get started as he has run out of ideas. Now Will needs inspiration. He tells therapist Dr. Moth (Antony Sher) that his quill is broken and that the organ of his imagination has dried up. The therapist advises Will to seek a new romance. Enter Viola de Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow). But there are complications, one of which is that Will has a wife in Stratford. Also, Viola has been promised by her rich father to another man, Lord Wessex (Colin Firth), a most disagreeable fellow. Wessex discusses his tobacco farms in Virginia, but he is several decades early! But Viola falls in love with Will, and they have an affair. When aging and sharp-tongued Queen Elizabeth (Judi Dench) seems to approve of the upcoming marriage, she quips to Wessex that 'Have her, then, but you are a lordly fool. She's been plucked since I saw her last, and not by you. It takes a woman to know it.' Viola loves poetry and wants to act, but she is not yet allowed on stage because of her gender ('the law of the land has our beauties played by pipsqueak boys'). She disguises herself as a mustachioed man, Thomas Kent.Meanwhile Kit Marlowe has been killed. Will blames himself, as he had misled Wessex into believing that Kit had plucked Viola. But Will soon learns that Kit did not perish at the hand of Wessex; rather he died in a quarrel over a bill at a tavern (In real life Marlowe died at age 32 at Deptford under mysterious circumstances.). There would be a later sword fight between Will and Wessex. When Viola is discovered to be a woman, the Rose is closed down. But then Burbage offers his Curtain Theater, and the play is on. It is successful as the Queen humorously pardons Viola (Thomas!). Of course, Will can never really marry Viola; he works on his next play, 'Twelfth Night.' While it takes a few liberties, this fictional story well captures the flavor of the late 16th century, and shows the difficulties in arranging for the plays, how they were often racked with financial problems, backstage politics, and court intrigue. The period sets and costumes are wonderfully done. John Madden created a film that is energetic and witty; it is a fine romantic comedy with tongue-in- cheek humor. For the most part, the casting works well. The statuesque Gwyneth Paltrow is quite appealing, speaks Shakespearean well, and artistically displays her 'golden apples' for folks to admire. She shows great chemistry in her scenes with Fiennes, but in reality she is much too feminine to pass as a man on stage. Judi Dench was undoubtedly authoritarian as Queen Elizabeth. Ben Affleck (as Ned Alleyn), who speaks in modern English, is no Shakespearean actor. Geoffrey Rush has some nice comical lines, like 'That's no one important, that's the author.' Rupert Everett is uncredited as Christopher 'Kit' Marlow. (At the time, the struggling Shakespeare was engaged in a rivalry with the already popular Kit as to who was the greater playwright. Nonetheless, both do show grace to each other in the film.) The feature certainly was one of the best of the 1998 year, and in fact won seven Academy Awards, including the Oscar for Best Picture.",9,1,1,15 June 2016
Stripes," An Early Comedy about the Post-Vietnam Army
","Within several hours, John Winger (Bill Murray) has lost his job, girlfriend Anita (Roberta Leighton), automobile, and apartment. Going nowhere, he convinces his friend Russell Ziskey (Harold Ramis) to enlist in the US army with him. The two buddies wind up in Ft. Arnold (Get it?), where the focus is on basic military training: hiking, running, rope climbing, grenade throwing, shooting, mortar firing, etc. The drill instructor is Sgt. Hulka (Warren Oates), who teaches about 'discipline, duty, honor, courage.' But as the brash and outspoken Winger gets under his skin so often he gets to do many push-ups. Of course, much of the dialog and happenings are fanciful. Winger's group, the 3rd platoon, Bravo Company, features more than a few misfits and includes the heavy-set Ox (John Candy), Psycho (Conrad Dunn), dimwit Cruiser (John Diehl), stoned Elmo (Judge Reinhold), and others. Hulka's superior is the inept captain, Stillman (John Larroquette). The commanding general at the fort wants a crack platoon to man the latest project, the army's prototype, the Urban Assault Vehicle (EM-50, which looks like an armored motor home). Captain Stillman is assigned the task; if he fails, he will be sent to a post north of the Arctic Circle. Meanwhile Winger's troubles continue and he tries to desert before he is foiled by Ramis. When our heroes finally escape KP, they go to town; the situation at the local bar ends in a brawl. Along the way, Winger and Ramis hook up with two WACs, Louise (Sean Young) and Stella (P.J. Stoles). A minor miracle occurs when the men of the platoon finally graduate from basic training. They eventually wind up in Europe. When the platoon blunders into Czechoslovakia, then still occupied by Russians since the end of World War II, they are captured. So it is up to John Winger, Russell, and their girlfriends (hard to believe) – Louise and Stella – to rescue them with the EM-50. Why World War III did not start there and then is . . . well it's a comedy. Will anybody get promoted? HINT: See the title. One of the movie's last images is the press cutting of the Newsworld Magazine article: 'The New Army: Can America Survive?' One does wonder. The plot is thin and the comedy spotty, but the film has its moments, such as the slapstick basic training scenes at Ft. Knox (not Arnold!). Then again, jumping the girls' bones in the general's house, the mud-wrestling match, and the skirmish with the Russians? Hmmm . . . Bill Murray's humor is sardonic and effective; it suits his personality well. Some will be turned off by his self-centeredness (and his haircut). This is an early effort by many actors, including John Candy, John Diehl, Judge Reinhold, and Sean Young. Late in his acting career, Warren Oates does very well as Hulka, whom he plays so straight that he can practically pass as a real DI. The women are all very attractive. By the way, the striking blonde girl with those gorgeous legs in Stillman's convertible at fictitious Ft. Milano in Italy is Lois Areno (née Aurino, a/k/a Hamilton). Note that in later years the movie director included an Extended Cut, which is almost 18 minutes longer than the released version, and includes several nude scenes. The movie was so popular that it made millions at the box office. 'Do-wah diddy-diddy dumb diddy-do . . .'",6,0,1,22 March 2016
L.A. Confidential," Cop vs. Cop
","'Come to Los Angeles. The sun shines bright, the beaches are wide and inviting, and the orange groves stretch as far as the eye can see. There are jobs aplenty, and land is cheap. Every working man can have his own house, and inside every house, a happy all-American family. You can have all this, and who knows? You can even be discovered. Become a movie star, or at least be one. Life is good in Los Angeles. It's paradise on earth . . . (laughs) . . . That's what they tell you anyway. That's because they're selling an image . . .' So speaks Walter Winchell sound-alike Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito) while we see sparkling images of LA life (and catch glimpses of movie stars like Marilyn, Frank Sinatra, and Deborah Kerr). Hudgens produces 'HUSH-HUSH' magazine, a Hollywood scandal tabloid. Behind all of the glamor there is the seamy side of LA, and Hudgens continues his narrative: Mickey Cohen (by the way, a real person) had taken over the Hollywood crime rackets. His associate is Johnny Stompanato, Lana Turner's love interest (also in real life). But Cohen is soon arrested and imprisoned for income tax evasion. The control of the rackets is thus left open, and hit squads are knocking off the top lieutenants. Sarcastically pointed out are the LA police, who are not against planting evidence and grabbing a few bucks and administering beatings (and, as we soon discover, are not averse to using ethnic slurs, such as wop, jig, and spic). The focus of the movie is an exposé of the LAPD, warts and all.The tale – and it is a serpentine one – is about the intertwining paths of three separate police officers who maintain the peace by their own separate actions: Edmund Exley (Guy Pearce), Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey), and Wendell 'Bud' White (Russell Crowe). Exley is squeaky clean, while Vincennes is compromising and likes to keep his hands unsoiled. White uses brutal methods, to say the least. Despite their differing tactics, and the fact that they may clash with each other (and how!), these three are all basically respectable policemen. At an inquest, Detective White is termed a 'thug' by DA Ellis Loew (Ron Rifkin), who has his own demons (see what happens to him!). White's partner is Dick Stensland (Graham Beckel), a loose canon if there ever was one. Exley was first in his class (out of 123) and chose the detective bureau against the advice of Captain Dudley Smith (James Cromwell). Exley also disagrees with the stiff and sordid Smith, who uses extreme methods that are quite frankly illegal. Exley believes in following the code of honor to the letter. Meanwhile narcotics detective Vincennes works on the side as a technical adviser on 'Badge of Honor,' a TV police show like 'Dragnet.' As a publicity guy he is also involved in publisher Hudgen's scoops, such as setting up celebrities in compromising situations.The three cops are involved with unraveling the pervasive LA corruption like peeling layers on an onion. There are a series of events that initially do not seem to be tied in. But they are all related to the twisted plot. To mention a few incidents: A parole violator beats up his wife on Christmas night, Mexican suspects are arrested and beaten in jail (they had supposedly killed a cop), White meets prostitute Lynn Bracken (Kim Basinger) at a liquor store, an ex-cop driver by the name of Leland 'Buzz' Meeks is shaken up by White, a corpse rots in a crawl space under a porch, and homosexual actor Matt Reynolds is found dead with his throat cut. But the main occurrence that sets the ball rolling is the massacre of six people (including two waitresses) at the Nite Owl Café, where a recently dismissed cop (scapegoat?) was also murdered. Now the investigation begins in earnest. Several Negroes are conveniently implicated in the carnage; they have records (they know something about the kidnapping and continuous rape of a Mexican woman). Later Stompanato reveals to White about a missing heroin cache of 25 pounds. Meanwhile slimy rich pimp Pierce Morehouse Patchett (David Strathaim), owner of the 'Fleur-de-Lis' prostitution ring, has 'cut girls' (call girls who have plastic surgery to resemble the likenesses of Hollywood actresses, like Veronica Lake and Rita Hayworth). As the film progresses key characters show up dead. Then there is a shocking revelation at the one-hundredth minute mark when even a major lead is murdered (although there are red herrings). Stick with this one until its riveting climax at the Victory Motel! The atmosphere of the movie feels like it is late December 1953 or January 1954: the cars, the clothing, and the hairstyles. The film does not need popular music of the 1950s to generate the feel of the period. Note that except for Kay Starr's 'Wheel of Fortune' (1952), most of the rather modest soundtrack comes from the 1930s and 1940s. Now one may complain that the unfurling of so many characters causes some confusion. But the story – tense and suspenseful all the way – does unfold quite neatly. And such excellent character development is often not seen enough in motion pictures. The performances of the leads are all at a high level (Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, and others) although Jack Nicholson did win the Oscar for Best Actor. Although her part was small, Kim Basinger won both the Oscar and Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress. 'L.A. Confidential' did garner the Oscar for Best Writing and also was nominated for quite a number of other Oscars, including that of Best Picture, Director, and Cinematography. It is indeed refreshing to see a big-budget feature that delivers. Roger Ebert placed this one into his top ten films listing of 1997. Some folks believe that it just might be the best movie of that year! It is certainly one of the best features of the 1990s decade!",9,4,6,20 June 2014
Sleepy Hollow," Science or Superstition?
","There is no question that Director Tim Burton's 'Sleepy Hollow' is as atmospheric as movies come, but the feature could have much better. It certainly has nice production design, art direction, and cinematography. Loosely based upon Washington Irving's short story, 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,' the stylish period piece (1799) falters from incoherency and a middling script. Even though Burton draws upon Irving's settings and characters – like Ichabod Crane, 'Brom Bones' Van Brunt, and Katrina Van Tassel – his screenwriter, Andrew Kevin Walker, does a great disservice to the source material as he turns a folk tale into a horror flick. Also, the movie simply does not know which way to turn. Initially it seems to promote progress by referencing reason and scientific knowledge, but then reverts to witchcraft. The original Irving story's main premise involved Ichabod and Brom fighting for Katrina's attention. Here it is hardly played out. By adding a back-story – childhood flashbacks of Crane's childhood – does nothing to enhance the drama. It becomes somewhat gruesome with its pile of decapitated corpses. Even the gnarled tree is blood-soaked, and when Ichabod exhumes a female corpse, the blood is fresh.It begins promisingly. Before the opening credits, a coach carrying the town's leading citizen, lawyer Peter Van Garrett (Martin Landau) rolls in the fog-shrouded forest at dusk outside the misty Dutch hamlet of Sleepy Hollow, two days north of New York City, where 'everyone is related by blood or marriage.' Strange noises are heard, and Garret is astounded when he peeks outside the carriage window and sees that his driver has become headless. The carriage still rumbles along. When Garrett attempts to escape into a cornfield, his head is also lost. Other equally grizzly deaths follow, and, in all cases, the killer takes the victim's head. The folks of Sleepy Hollow are convinced that they are being haunted by the Headless Horseman, a demonic spirit of a dead German (Hessian) soldier (a mercenary of the Crown) who was slain by Continental soldiers during the American Revolution. He can see without his head, and has his lair in the gnarled tree in the Western Woods.Jittery Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) arrives; he's a constable sent by a judge in New York City to solve the bizarre murders of the ghastly horseman. Crane is not the superstitious schoolmaster of Irving's story. In fact, Ichabod claims that reason and science can explain any unusual feature about the deaths and that a 'modern' detective method will solve the mystery. But he misspeaks when he boldly states that people are at the dawn of a 'new millennium' (confusing the year 1800 with 2001). Anyway, he sneers at the idea of a supernatural being from Hell. At first it appears that the horseman may actually be the local bigwig, Brom Van Brunt (Casper Van Dien) in costume, but Ichabod soon learns that he must abandon reason. Brom does attack Ichabod with a pumpkin at the wooden covered bridge. In the original story though, the prank occurs at the end, when the believer in ghosts is easily fooled. As Ichabod's investigation continues he finds himself falling for blonde Katrina Van Tassel (Christina Ricci), the daughter of his landlord, Baltus Van Tassel (Michael Gambon).'Sleepy Hollow' is creepy and effective largely because of Director Burton's visualization, cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki's camera- work, and Rick Heinrichs' impressive production design. However, there comes a point when the main characters have to take the helm, something not allowed by the script (although the main actors do as well as granted). Much of 'Sleepy Hollow' consists of the insipid Ichabod, with his bizarre instruments, constantly fainting and bungling to uncover the reason for the horseman's rampage. Then towards the end he finally has much of the puzzle pieced together. (The subplot about who double-crossed whom is convoluted.) Finally in the denouement – which goes on and on – Ichabod's skittish character magically morphs into the most heroic man on earth when he battles a demon! Irving focused on the romance angle, but the screen relationship of Ichabod with Katrina appears forced, and there is hackneyed dialogue between them. For instance, he says that she 'bewitched' him (Actually she believes in sorcery.). Another time Ichabod inquires why she snooped inside his room. Katrina responds, 'Because it's yours.' (Ugh!) Positives include an impressive supporting cast. In addition to Baltus' Michael Gambon, several other well-known actors include Miranda Richardson (as Baltus' wife and the Crone), Michael Gough (notary), Ian McDiarmid (doctor), and Christopher Lee (cameo). Lee is the New York burgomaster who sends Ichabod to Sleepy Hollow. Christopher Walken has a cameo as the horseman before losing and regaining his head. Danny Elfman's music score is most suitable while the set direction is superb. Much of the movie was shot with a blue filter, and the Gothic village of Sleepy Hollow has the feel of the period (as does the city of New York). There is a nice, almost surreal touch when Ichabod arrives late. The hamlet appears almost deserted, with hardly a person or horse visible. But when Ichabod enters the mansion of prosperous farmer Van Tassel, a bustling Halloween party is in progress with perhaps most of the village in attendance. Another nice scene occurs just after the Halloween party (presumably 31 October) when the November mist extinguishes the exterior village torches. Its nicely signifies the end of the last bit of warmth and the dreariness of the incoming coldness.The negatives are probably not enough to detract one from watching 'Sleepy Hollow,' but the movie should have been greater. Naming this movie something like 'The Horror of Goblin Hollow' would have avoided the unfortunate comparison with Irving. But the director obviously wanted to capitalize on the famed author's story. A plot focusing on reason and with a conspiracy involving those awful-looking town honchos with a costumed headless horseman may have been a better option. Then again, one cannot deny the uniqueness of the story-line.",7,2,3,9 December 2015
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," A Mole in the British Intelligence Service (M16)
","At the beginning, British agent Jim Prideaux (Mark Strong) is sent to Budapest to speak with a Hungarian general who wants to defect to the West. The general also knows the name of the mole that infests the British Secret Service (known as 'The Circus'). As the arrangement was a Soviet set-up, it goes badly with Prideaux being shot. Because of the disaster, agents 'Control' (John Hurt) and 'Beggerman' (George Smiley = Gary Oldman) are dismissed from service.Out of retirement, Smiley is given an independent assignment to ferret out the mole in the Circus. The top men there are Smiley and Control's successors: Percy Alleline (Toby Jones) as the new chief, Bill Haydon (Colin Firth) as the deputy, and Roy Bland (Ciaran Hinds) and Toby Esterhase (David Dencik) as the two lieutenants.Smiley picks Peter Guillam (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Mendel (Roger Lloyd Pack) to assist him. Smiley is not the dashing James Bond type of spy with the fast cars, the sexy girls, and the quick gun. On the contrary, he wears eyeglasses, speaks softly, and walks slowly. Smiley is contained and cool, and cunning and brilliant. He absorbs information like a dry sponge on a puddle of water. He rarely raises his voice, and he does so after he has trapped the culprit at the end: 'What are you then . . .'To complicate matters in a fairly complicated movie, there are sub-stories, like Smiley's wife Ann leaving him. There is another story, with Ricki Tarr (Tom Hardy) who works for Guillam. Tarr has an affair with pretty blonde Soviet agent Irina (Svetlana Khodchenkova) whom he met in Istanbul. She wants to defect, but the mole tells the Russians, who capture her. Tarr wants her back.Meanwhile the top four at The Circus, Smiley's successors, have formed a secret organization known as 'Witchcraft' unknown to Smiley. Witchcraft was created to obtain sensitive information from the Soviets in the name of Polyakov (Konstantin Khabensky). In reality, Polyakov is playing a game as he is a Soviet spy, not really a double agent, who works for the USSR! He obtains good information, while providing little (as Smiley says, 'glitter amongst the chicken feed'). What the United States tell the Circus, will be told to the Kremlin.Smiley is surprised to learn that Prideaux is back in England teaching a class in school. He lives in a trailer. The Soviets actually returned him after getting all they could out of him.Control creates a list of mole suspects with code names'Tinker' - Percy Alleline
'Tailor' - Bill Haydon
'Soldier' - Roy Bland
'Poor Man' - Toby Esterhase
'Beggarman' - Smiley (not really a suspect)Smiley finds out that Toby is a messenger to the others, who are leakers in one way or another. He forces Toby, who may have been duped, to provide Polyakov's Paris safe house address. There a meeting is taking place with Polyakov and the mole. It is Haydon. After being captured by Smiley, Haydon is being held in detention to be exchanged for another. But Prideaux finds out and shoots him with a high-powered rifle. Meanwhile, Ann has returned to Smiley. The last scene shows Smiley heading to work: he is now the new 'Control' and awaits his new team.In keeping with the spirit of the times of the Cold War, England is sufficiently chilly and gray throughout. The movie is complicated with many characters, but they are all good actors. The film is based upon the espionage novel by British author John le Carré. He has a cameo: You will catch of glimpse of him at the Soviet Embassy's Christmas celebration singing a patriotic song.",Null,0,0,4 December 2019
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," The Last of the Old Western Gangs (Also: Bonus Information about the Real Wild Bunch and the Pursuing Detective)
","Let me state right now that 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' is one of the greatest westerns of all time. It even deserves its place in the top 100 of America's best movies (#73). This writer even rated the film nine stars. It deserves all of them. On the other hand, its heroes are really anti-heroes. Yes they are the criminals, but because they are good-looking and likable and charming and humorous we root for them. But this is not the message of the traditional westerns that were about the noble guys who won in the end (played by William S. Hart, Tom Mix, Gene Autry, John Wayne, etc.) and the dastardly dudes who got what they deserved (real folks like Bill Longley, Black Jack Ketchum, John Wesley Hardin, Ike Clanton, etc.). These bad guys were so unabashedly immoral that people booed them in movie theaters. But for several years before 1969, the framework of the original American Western was transforming. Perhaps movie audiences became bored with the good guys winning. Then there were the attitudes of the counter-culture. So characters of ambiguous morality began to become central; if they still lost at film's end, they at least got sympathy. Our movie is about the 'Wild Bunch,' last of the outlaw gangs of the old American West. Its specialty was robbing banks and trains on horseback. But the frontier had closed in 1890, and even the remaining wild western pockets were becoming less of a haven. Not only was the telegraph expanding, but the telephone and automobile were already invented. Civilization and technology were making the old time gunslingers obsolete. The Pinkerton detectives and the Union Pacific Railroad were becoming more resourceful. There were less and less places of refuge, although Butch Cassidy's band did well enough at Hole-in-the-Wall pass (north of Casper in Wyoming).The feature is finely crafted, although it probably gathers more from the legend rather than from historical fact. There are many wonderful things to enjoy: The gorgeous cinematography of Conrad Hall (filmed in USA/Mexico) and fine Western settings, the music by Burt Bacharach, the script by William Goldman, the direction of George Roy Hill. The film gathered four Academy awards: Cinematography, score, song ('Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head'), and original screenplay. There are quite a few memorable scenes: Opening Thomas Edison Company silent movie that features The Hole-in-the-Wall Gang, fancy gun-work by the Sundance Kid in the sepia-toned vignette, Butch and Logan in the knife fight during the gang rebellion, the blown-up express car with flying dollar bills, continuous posse chases, the Newman-Ross bicycle scene, an angry bull, the cliff jump on horseback, the near-botched bank robbery in Bolivia where the two men clumsily attempt to speak Spanish, the ending freeze frame shootout. Although folks get shot in this film, we are spared the endless gore that characterized some filmmakers, like Sam Peckinpah.The Chemistry between Paul Newman, already a big star, and upcoming Robert Redford is masterful. Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman) is the talker, the planner, the brains of the outfit; the Sundance Kid (Robert Redford) is silent and brooding, but also quick with a gun. Wittily the two leads play off against one another in a sardonic manner. A third important lead, the lovely Katherine Ross (Etta Place), plays a delightful foil between the two men. By the way, two surviving photographs confirm that the real Etta (Ethel) Place was one of the most attractive females of the Old West. Some of the real gang members are also characters: Harvey Logan (Ted Cassidy), Flat-Nose Curry (Charles Dierkop), and News Carver (Timothy Scott). Bonus Information: Butch Cassidy (née Robert Leroy Parker), born in 1866, called his gang 'The Wild Bunch,' not 'The-Hole-in-the-Wall Gang.' As befitting the grandson of a Mormon bishop, he was affable and eschewed excessive gunplay. 'I have never killed a man,' he claimed. Butch Cassidy really did blow up a United Pacific railroad express car to smithereens near Wilcox, Wyoming on 2 June 1899. (Employee E.C. Woodcock was staggered, but survived.) Pinkerton agent Charles Angelo Siringo was already hot on the trail. Siringo's name was not used in the movie. Instead we hear Lord Baltimore and Joe Lefors and the United Pacific posse. But it was Charlie Siringo (Siringo knew Lefors) who trailed Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (née Harry Alonzo Longabaugh) for 25,000 miles, as he wrote in one of his books. Because of an error by another, Siringo just missed capturing Butch and Sundance. (By the way, Siringo tracked desperadoes from Alaska to Mexico.) In 1900 an attempt at amnesty between Butch and Utah Governor Wells failed. Nevertheless, the Old West was dying, and Butch, Sundance, and Etta Place, after visiting New York City (1901), 'relocated' to South America in Argentina. Sundance may have married Etta in December 1900. More than once Sundance and Etta returned to the USA; apparently they attended the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904. Pinkerton agent Frank Di Maio, who took over from Charlie Siringo in Argentina, had discovered the exact location of Sundance and Etta, but either a tip or the rainy season ruined his chances of capture. Etta Place returned to the USA for good in 1906/1907; her subsequent history is largely unknown. Butch and Sundance met their eventual demise at San Vincente, Bolivia in November 1908 or at Montevideo, Uruguay in 1912. Flat- Nose Curry, News Carver, and Harvey Logan were already dead. Curry was shot to death by a sheriff in 1900; Carver was killed by lawmen in 1901. To escape capture in 1904 after he had escaped from jail, Logan shot himself. Not mentioned in the movie was William Ellsworth 'Elzy' Lay, last of the Wild Bunch. Although he was captured, tried, and sent to prison in 1899, he did a very good deed in jail. So he was pardoned by New Mexico Governor Otero in 1906. Thereafter Lay went straight for the rest of his life; he died in 1934.",9,5,6,2 May 2014
MASH," An Antiwar Satire That Is Crass, Contemptuous, Derisive, Humorous, and Misogynistic
","Richard Hooker, who was a doctor in the Korean War (MASH Unit 8055), wrote about his experiences after he returned home to the USA. MASH refers to those mobile army surgical hospitals, situated just three miles away from battlefronts, which provided emergency medical attention to wounded servicemen. Instead of having a plot, the feature is a series of episodes as we observe the various personalities that comprise MASH Unit 4077. The movie is about what extremes some MASH folks went to – or so they believed they had to – in order to maintain their saneness in the face of insanity: stress generated by broken bodies and blood. The 'protagonists' are three doctors who are excellent surgeons, but appalling military men. By the way, their haircuts and facial hair are more reflective of the later 1960s instead of the early 1950s. Then again, MASH is introspective of the era in which it was filmed.To say the least, Colonel Henry Blake (Roger Bowen) runs MASH Unit 4077 so loosely that proper military bearing is practically nonexistent. With the arrivals of officers Hawkeye Pierce (Donald Sutherland), Trapper John McIntyre (Elliott Gould), and Duke Forrest (Tom Skerritt), the antics are tuned up several notches. In short, the young surgeon-officers do whatever they please and get away with it because their medical work is at a high level. They torment folks like Major Frank Burns and WAC officer Margaret 'Hot Lips' O'Houlihan. In fact two of the movie's most memorable scenes involve each of these characters: (1) the love scene with planted microphone and (2) the solo shower uncovering of 'Hot Lips.' Other unforgettable movie vignettes include grisly surgeries in tents, 'The Last Supper' parody of Dentist Waldowski, and the finale, the unbridled football game. There are many memorable quotes, but a sample one from Captain Trapper John is quite unforgettable for its utter crudeness: ' and give me at least one nurse who knows how to work in close without getting her tits in my way!' Throughout the film, The Public Address announcer broadcasts 'important' news and information to the unit. An example: 'Attention, Captain McIntyre will give a lecture on blood and fluid replacement in the mess hall at 0800 . . . uh, correction . . . at 021 . . . at 9:00 this evening.' Another: 'Attention, Captain Bandini is now performing a femoral po - a popli . . . a femoral P-O-P-L-I-T-E-R-A-L artery exp – exp – exploration and possible graft.' Music is from Japanese radio, straight from Tokyo. Robert Duvall plays the anguished major, Frank Burns, who reads from the Bible but who also has lust for 'Hot Lips.' Sally Kellerman is edgy nurse 'Hot Lips' O'Houlihan, whose actions are never malicious. She outlasts Frank Burns as her character personality does change by the end of the movie. Lt. Dish is played by Jo Ann Pflug. Of course, old timers know that dish was a term used by men for an attractive woman. Misogynistic? Of course! The chaplain is Father John Mulcahy (Rene Abourjonois), called 'Dago Red' for the color of his hair. Hmmm . . . Fred Williamson is football player 'Spearchucker' Jones. Gary Burghoff, who was the only actor to make the transition to the popular TV series, is Radar O'Reilly. By the way, the TV series, featuring Alan Alda as Hawkeye, was such a huge hit that it ran from 1972 to 1983.MASH was supposedly the first movie to use the F-word. The picture regularly shown is several minutes shorter than the original 1970 version. I have noticed that we no longer see the squirting blood from arteries or the complete frontal nudity shot of Sally Kellerman in the shower. Some folks believe that MASH is director Robert Altman's greatest work. It was, after all, nominated for five Oscars, and did win one for Best Writing, Screenplay (Ring Lardner, Jr.). It also won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture of 1970. But, love it or hate it, the movie is never boring.",8,2,3,25 August 2014
The Patriot," Action-packed, Colorful, Exciting . . . and Fictional
","Benjamin Martin is a South Carolina widower and well-to-do plantation owner with seven children. He was a brave veteran in the French and Indian War (1754-1763) that was fought on the frontier away from the settled families. Knowing that the new War of the American Revolution (1775/1776) will be fought on the 'home front,' he is reluctant to fight. There will be a heavy price to pay. His oldest son Gabriel, who has already joined the Continental Army, returns home wounded from a nearby battlefield. Before long the homestead is overrun by British forces, and Ben's family cares for both the American and British wounded. Gabriel though is taken prisoner. Brutal British Colonel Tavington (obviously the infamous Banastre Tarleton; he even wears green) orders his men to kill the entire Continental wounded, condemns Gabriel as a spy, and orders the burning of the family house. While attempting to save Gabriel's life, another son of Ben, Thomas, is shot dead by Tavington. Incensed, Ben and two other, younger sons tail a 20- man British platoon that has taken Gabriel away for execution. When the dust clears from Ben's ambush, the English are cut to pieces (all are lost save one) and Gabriel is freed. Back home Ben witnesses a significant defeat of the Americans under General Horatio Gates in an unspecified battle (it would have to be The Battle of Camden, even though it occurred later, in 1780). Gates' tactics and heavy use of militia against British regulars were disastrous. With the fastest steed, he made a quick escape. His temporary replacement is Colonel Harry Burwell (in reality serving under the most capable General Nathaniel Green of RI, George Washington's second-in-command). Meanwhile British General Cornwallis, the victor at Camden and Charleston, chastises Tavington for his cruelty, and orders him to take prisoners alive rather than shoot them.Ben now decides to join the war effort with his son Gabriel. His surviving children are sent to his dead wife's sister, the youthful Aunt Charlotte. Ben and Harry somberly discuss the strategic situation: there is no American force between Washington's in the north and their own in the south. If the southern army is defeated, Cornwallis can move north and hem-in Washington's troops, possibly ending the Revolution. In addition the Continental Army in the south is still composed mainly of militia. Determined more than ever, Ben's forces break up into smaller bands that harass and ambush the British (a la Francis Marion, the famous 'Swamp Fox'). Military recruitment is increased; slaves who enlist receive their freedom at war's end and receive five shillings per month. Over time the tide seems to be changing. There is still hope for help from the French: 'Absolument' insists French officer Villeneuve.The disappointed Cornwallis again calls upon Tavington; the latter says he can turn the tide again but 'What did you say about brutality?' The officers know that Tavington's return to his evil ways will ensure that he will not be able to return to England at war's end. Perusing a color map, they discuss the new western land of Ohio. (In reality Cornwallis was no fan of Tarleton.) Tavington's return to viciousness is with a vengeance. He orders the population of a captured small town into a church. The doors are padlocked and the building set ablaze along with the congregation (fiction). Gabriel's new wife is one of the victims. (In reality Tarleton was never as evil as Tavington's portrayal although he certainly destroyed homes and provisions). Then, during a subsequent encounter with the British, Tavington sets a trap and turns the tables. The result is that another of Ben's sons dies (Gabriel), and many Continental officers are captured. Ben is devastated. After a thought process Ben overcomes his grief and leaves his surviving family with a slave settlement. He tricks Cornwallis and recaptures the officers by a ruse.The time is fast approaching for the climatic battle to determine the victor of the southern sector. In one of the most exciting Revolutionary War battle scenes ever filmed, the battle sways back and forth. At a critical moment, Ben picks up an American flag and charges into the British ranks. The retreating Americans follow to a great victory (unspecified in the movie, but a fictional version of the Battle of Guilford Court House, 1781). Actually what had happened was that the British, after mopping up in Georgia and South Carolina, sustained two unexpected battle reverses (King's Mountain and Cowpens). To change matters, Cornwallis eagerly fights the Battle of Guilford Court House, which he actually wins. But the victory is Pyrrhic as he lost one- quarter of his entire force. General Greene, who actually chose the battle site, withdrew his unbroken Continentals in very good order. Then the British general moved through North Carolina to Virginia on to coastal Yorktown. In the movie events are indeed fast-forwarded to the Yorktown site. There the British field army is trapped by land and by sea. The northern Continental Army under Washington has already force-marched the allied troops from Newport, and are besieging the British by land. And, for once at the right place and at the right time, the French navy is shelling the hapless British. The latter's position is hopeless as they cannot stop the relentless allied bombardment of their positions. While the subsequent British surrender does not immediately stop the conflict, the writing is on the wall. With the long war finally over in 1783, Ben returns to his family and his new love interest (Charlotte). He will help rebuild the new nation.While The Patriot is not always accurate, one cannot deny that the movie is exciting and the action terrific. The cinematography is gorgeous, and who can deny those excellent set designs and costumes? The director masterfully recreates America in the late 18th century, although life was not quite as hygienic. Give kudos to the great acting. For all of these reasons the picture is recommended.",9,2,3,29 October 2014
Across the Universe," Thirty Covered Beatles' Songs
","There are no opening credits. A young man, alone at the beach in winter, laments about his lost love as he sings 'Girl.' Then we see a montage of late 1960s violence in the USA as Dana Fuchs ('Sadie') sings 'Helter-Skelter.' Next we are at a high school prom, circa 1964, where students dance to the tune of 'Hold Me Tight.' The boys sport the short haircuts of the time and wear white blazers. Then there is an inter-cut of British teens at what appears to be the 1960s 'Cavern' night club singing the same Beatles' lyrics. The English boy (Jude = Jim Sturgess) says goodbye to his girlfriend as he sets sail to America. He wants to meet his biological father. Jude was conceived during World War II when his bio-father was a US soldier stationed in England; the father never knew that his girlfriend became pregnant. Back in the USA, at a high school football practice, an Asian cheerleader, Prudence (T.V. Carpio), sings 'I Wanna Hold Your Hand' in the most deadpan manner you will ever see. Prudence grieves as she sings that she wants to be the 'man' as she eyes a sexy blonde cheerleader. Yes, Prudence is a lesbian. 'Across the Universe' is a simple story really, about young folks in love against the backdrop of the later sixties: the British Invasion aftermath, civil rights, the military draft and induction, Detroit riots, assassination, druggie culture, and hippies. Pretty heroine Lucy Carrigan (Evan Rachel Wood), who has lost her first love in Vietnam, has become radicalized. She spends time in New York's Greenwich Village and has fallen in love with Jude. Before leaving her comfortable home, Lucy reassures her mom that she will be good. Then she sees Sadie (Dana Fuchs), a Janis Joplin-like singer, perform 'Why Don't We Do It in the Road?' After that she turns naughty and literally lets her knickers down. Subsequently she joins a radical hippie group that 'progresses' from mass demonstration protests to violence to bomb-making. Ah, idealism! Meanwhile Jude finds work designing record album covers (like the psychedelic strawberry). Jude disapproves of Lucy's activist group and there's a rift. Will the former lovers ever reunite? The Beatles did sing 'All you need is love,' but do you believe that love alone is really enough? Think about that for a minute.The real center of the movie is the Beatle songbook with the majority from the later Beatles; all are covers. Some are done better than others. As previously described, Prudence's performance is oddly sung. In contrast, grubby Joe Cocker, bogged down by age and weight, can still belt out 'Come Together' with the best of them and still find time to save a careless pedestrian from being struck by a taxi. U-2 lead Bono's interpretation of 'I Am the Walrus' is very well done too. Surprisingly, female lead Evan Rachel Wood's rendition of 'If I Fell' is not bad at all. She can sing. By the way, Beatles aficionados know that the movie character names come directly from their songs: Jude, Lucy, Max, Prudence, Mr. Kite, Dr. Robert, etc. Although the actors are competent they are not exceptional. The pop art creation and choreography and sets are done well enough. Check out the businessmen with their look-alike suits, hats, and briefcases (albeit the second one from the right does trip during the song). How about the 'Strawberry Fields Forever' and 'I Want You' sequences with the coming-alive Uncle Sam posters and induction tirades? On the other hand, the prostitutes singing 'Come Together' does not exactly work at all. Unlike most musicals, this one has a song every few minutes that hampers the storyline, which runs far too long for one with just a paper-thin plot. The critics are all over the board on this movie. Dennis Schwartz (Ozus' World Movie Reviews) pans it, and Reelviews' James Berardinelli has only slightly more empathy. Leonard Maltin gives 'Across the Universe' 2 ½ stars, or OK. On the other hand, Roger Ebert rated it the number seven movie of 2007, and awarded 4 stars. Pick 'em anyway you want, but I find the feature colorful and entertaining, which is all you really need!'I am he as you are he as you are me And we are all together . . .'",7,0,0,31 December 2014
The Elephant Man," A Tortured Soul Comforted by Compassion
","In 1884 Victorian England, renowned London Doctor Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) attends a carnival side show to view a 'freak' managed by slimy Bytes (Freddie Jones). The anomaly in question - the 'Elephant Man' - 21 year-old Joseph 'John' Merrick has a large and deformed head, a twisted spine, enlarged and nearly useless right arm, a twisted foot, and numerous scale growths on his back. Bytes continually mistreats his meal ticket, and sadistically beats him without mercy. Treves first 'borrows' Merrick to use as a model for his lecture before his academic colleagues. Then he decides to rescue him from Bytes but still believes that Merrick is a mental idiot who (thankfully) does not realize his plight. Treves eventually convinces Mr. Carr Gomm (Sir John Gielgud), House Governor, to allow Merrick to have residence at the local hospital. Treves wants Merrick to be used as a source of study. Over time Merrick and Treves become friends and the latter soon realizes that Merrick is no idiot. Not only can he speak, but also is a sensitive, gentle, and intelligent individual. Even the staff begins to respect Merrick. Ultimately though, his life would not be a long one.In the surreal opening scene, a dreamlike sight, elephants are in motion and one attacks a woman. In reality, when Merrick's mother was pregnant with him in 1862, she was knocked down by a fairground elephant. Apparently - and not explained in the movie - both she and her son thought that the confrontation was the source of John's disease. This concept of 'maternal impression,' that emotional experiences of a pregnant woman could have lasting effect on unborn children, was seemingly a common belief in the 19th century. A touching moment occurs when Merrick weeps when he is in the presence of Mrs. Treves (Hannah Gordon). He explains that he never had been in the company of such an attractive woman. Also note his most sincere appreciation when he receives a grooming kit as a present. Another impassioned scene occurs near the end when John proclaims to the crowd at the train station, 'I am not an animal.''The Elephant Man' is based upon Dr. Treves' account and not upon the play of the same name. Liberties have been taken, especially with Bytes' character. The Elephant Man's real name was Joseph Merrick, not John. Dr. Treves somehow had a mental block about Merrick's given name. Shot in crisp and appropriate black and white with smooth editing, the movie by David Lynch is well-filmed. Note the dark undertones of human misery in 19th century London. The music score Adagio for Strings is lovingly played and is so apropos. The acting is great all-around, including that of the supporting cast. Anthony Hopkins as the good doctor very well plays the part of a compassionate man who had to question himself of his ulterior motivation. Freddie Jones is appropriate as the sleazy Bytes. John Hurt is totally unrecognizable and outstanding; it took seven-eight hours daily to apply his makeup, and two hours to remove. I don't know how he accomplished his role so well. 'The Elephant Man' is the second best movie of the year (1980) after 'Raging Bull.' See both.",9,0,0,24 August 2018
Slap Shot," Raucously Funny Hockey Farce
","In the film's beginning, at a sparsely attended hockey game a woman yells at a French-Canadian player, 'frog pussy!' The viewer would then know that the movie will be profanity-laced and downright raunchy. Paul Newman stars as aging veteran player-coach Reggie Dunlop of the Charlestown Chiefs, a Pennsylvania minor league hockey team on a losing streak. That is, until the participants begin to play with extreme fierceness with the addition of three Hanson Brothers, who wear thick eyeglasses and who play rough and tough. They can certainly skate. Brawls abound as the fans cheer, and Dunlop approves of all this. With the dirty tactics, the Chiefs start to win right and make the playoffs. They sell out games. Then there is the irony that I will not disclose here. Meanwhile the local mill will soon be closing, and without support the team will also fold. It looks like the last season. As Dunlop incorrectly believes that the team will be sold to a Florida interest, he plants a story in the local newspaper. The story has several subplots. Paul Newman is in his element. In fact, he stated that he had more fun making this movie than any other. He's fun to watch as usual, but his heated discussion with the team owner near the end is over the top. Strother Martin plays crafty old-timer General Manager Joe McGrath. Andrew Duncan is madcap sportscaster Jim Carr. In a minor role, Melinda Dillon as Suzanne displays her lovely boobs for us to see. Brooding Ned Braden is played by Canadian Michael Ontkean, who disapproves of the rowdy play. He wants to make it to the National Hockey League (NHL). Lindsay Crouse as Lily is Ned's long-suffering wife. Screenplay is by Nancy Dowd, whose brother Ned Dowd was a minor league hockey player who made it for a short time to the WHA (World Hockey Association), which rivaled the NHL for a few years. Ned Dowd himself plays brutish Ogilthorpe. By the way, the hockey team really is the old Johnstown Jets of the North American Hockey League (and before that the East Coast Hockey league), as the ending credits thank them specifically. They actually won their league championship in 1975. The movie, filmed before helmets were mandatory, was filmed in New York and Pennsylvania. Maxine Nightingale sings 'Right Back Where We Started From,' a fitting ending.",8,2,2,8 May 2018
Mulholland Drive," A Young Woman's Disintegrated Mind
","To understand this great movie, discount nearly all of its first three- fourths, and maybe more, as most of the earlier scenes after the opening credits are imaginary. This fact is very disconcerting to viewers, who generally like a clear-cut narrative. But when one views a David Lynch film, he/she must be prepared and understand that the director's work is often non-linear and sometimes non-chronological, and symbolic (especially metaphorical). For instance, just after the jitterbug dance, the movie camera focuses on sheets and a blanket, and we hear deep breathing, the significance of deep sleep, a dreamlike state. The first three-quarters: 'The Dream' (Illusion): The ESCAPE of Brunette 'Camilla Rhodes' (Laura Harring) from her murderers and her consequent amnesia never happened.  Coco (Ann Miller) is not the Havenhurst apartment manager (explained later).  'Betty Elms' does not exist; she is merely Diane Selwyn's alter-ego, possibly a dominant personality.  The Winkie diner scene with the semi-human creature lurking behind an alley is unreal. Could be taken as representative of Diane/Betty's evil persona.  The Hollywood meeting with the hooligan brothers, who insist upon blonde Camilla Rhodes, never happened. It is Betty's excuse for failure, and she hates Adam (Justin Theroux) the director. Lynch is probably castigating Hollywood for its countless sins, like tyrannical moguls (Mr. Roque), despotic directors, and infamous casting couches.  Hatchet-man Joe Messing's rather clumsy murder of three people is escapist Betty's imagination.  'Rita' never found 'clean' cash in her handbag (explained later).  Blonde hooker Laney's scene with Joe as a pimp at Pink's is fantasy, as Betty considers brunette Camilla's promiscuity as helping her career (dreamed as a prostitute).  Adam Kesher, who lives at 6980 Mulholland Drive, is an insufferable director with a cheating wife. Betty detests him and would delight in his misfortunes.  'Betty' remembers the waitress' name tag at Winkie's restaurant as 'Diane' (incorrect, explanation later).  The enormous tough-looking guy (acted by Tony Longo) who barges into Adam's house (inquiring about the damaged limo) is imagined.  Adam Kesher, after evacuating his house, perhaps stayed at the seedy Park Hotel.  Louise Bonner says that 'Someone is in trouble!' (a premonition, but delusional)  The cowboy is strange, polite, and unreal (flickering light). Obviously speaking in the deadpan way as directed, he convinces Adam to say, 'This is the girl.' Old-fashioned cowboys were Hollywood's good guys, and this one even wears a white hat initially. He represents reality.  The audition with Jimmy Katz (Chad Everett) really happened but not in the manner that Betty desired. Actually she failed.  Blonde Camilla Rhodes screen test: A blonde gets the main part for 'The Sylvia North Story' (imaginary). The rock 'n' roll songs are of the early 1960s (nostalgia for then teen-aged Lynch?). Betty flees when she spots Adam (his rejection of her).  2590 Sierra Bonita, apt. 17: Partially factual, but the dead woman on the bed isn't Camilla, nor was it found by 'Betty' or 'Rita.'  The two lesbian sex scenes really did happen between Diane and Camilla, not 'Betty' and 'Rita' (explanation later).  Club Silencio, is the page-turner in the movie, when the truth is revealed. The magician says, 'It is an illusion.' Betty shakes uncontrollably because she is awakening from her pleasant fantasy dream to the awful truth. A significant flaw in the first part is Betty's imperfect memory. Betty's true self is exposed when Camilla opens the blue box, revealing that reality has surfaced. The blue key represents the murder. Now the real story as told in the opening setting and as elucidated in the last quarter. The Truth (Lynch pulls the plug and divulges the real characters of earlier scenes):Pretty, wide-eyed but naïve Diane Selwyn (Naomi Watts), who won a jitterbug contest (jitterbug = a popular swing-dance in the 1930s and 1940s, less so in the 1950s), has won a Hollywood audition. Like countless others she dreams of being a great movie star. With the cash inherited from her dead aunt Ruth, she bids goodbye to her (skeptical?) guardians and departs Deep River, Ontario (NW of Ottawa - in other words, from nowhere). But duplicitous La-La land is more often one of nightmares. Disappointingly, she never succeeds, and ekes out a living from small movie roles. Diane, a homosexual, has a relationship with brunette Camilla Rhodes, bisexual and promiscuous. Camilla Rhodes catches the attention of now divorced director Adam Kesher, who wants to marry her, a situation disconcerting to jealous Diane. At the party, we learn that Adam is the son of Coco, who was never the apartment manager. While drinking an espresso ('SOS' cup), Diane spots a man whom she later imagines as a hooligan (Castigliane means 'punishing liana,' {vine}; Castigleone would have been a better name as leone = 'lion'). Director Lynch may be castigating Hollywood (or Betty's mind may be stereotyping Italians). The engagement announcement agitates Diane, who is further enraged when Camilla kisses the unnamed blonde (not really Camilla Rhodes). So, in Diane's dream, Camilla becomes 'Rita.' The engagement is the last straw, and at Winkie's, Diane with 'dirty' cash hires hit-man Joe to murder Camilla. The waitress' name tag reads 'Betty,' not 'Diane.' Diane, tormented, is going insane; she even fantasizes deceased Camilla's return in her drab apartment. The Cowboy wakes up 'Betty' (not a corpse) to reality. The semi-human creature, Diane's evil persona, holds the empty blue box (her future). Detectives search for ragged and despondent Diane. Haunted by bizarre images of her mocking guardians, whom she has failed, she reaches for her bedside pistol, aims, and fires.Unlike the fictional Diane, Naomi Watts became a big star, and deservedly so. The film features fine set-pieces and music score.",9,3,5,25 September 2013
Prisoners," Can We Ever Be Completely Safe from Demoniacs?
","Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), his wife Grace (Maria Bello), and two children enjoy a nice Thanksgiving dinner at the house of their rural and friendly neighbors, the Birches (Franklin = Terrence Howard, Nancy = Viola Davis, and two children). After the meal the two younger girls of each family – 6 year-old Anna Keller (Erin Garasimovich) and 7 year-old Joy Birch (Kyla-Drew) – go outside to play. When they do not return, the two families conduct a fruitless search. The only clue is an old and unfamiliar RV that was parked nearby. Police are called. Dining alone in a restaurant, Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is summoned. While the police are searching, they spot the RV parked close by. The creepy, spectacled driver, Alex Jones (Paul Dano), sees them and tries to flee but smashes his vehicle. When Alex is taken to a police station, it is soon discovered that he is none too bright; in fact, his IQ is that of a 10 year-old. On his own he could never have staged the crime and has few facts to provide. His aunt Holly Jones (Melissa Leo) provides limited details, saying that Alex has never been in trouble. Forensics on the RV reveals no information about the two missing girls. Area searches reveal nothing. As the girls are not found, tension obviously develops between the Dovers and Loki, who does his best. Checking a clue listing, Loki goes to the house of a defrocked and alcoholic priest, Father Patrick Dunn (Len Cariou). Loki discovers a mummified body in the basement with a circle maze medal necklace. Father Dunn says that he doesn't know anything about the man except that he had confessed to murdering 16 children, and threatened more harm. To save the children, the priest lured the man to his residence and dispatched him. Loki arrests the ex-priest. When Loki visits the Jones' house, Alex remains quiet.When Alex is released for insufficient evidence, Keller is so furious that he physically attacks him in the parking lot outside the police station. Alex says, 'They didn't cry until I left them.' No one else hears this comment. Keller is arrested but quickly released. When Grace emotionally collapses, Keller takes the law into his own hands by kidnapping Alex, holding him hostage, and driving him to an old, abandoned apartment building that his father once owned. At first Alex is tied to a radiator. Later he is restrained inside a plywood-wall (around a shower) that Keller has constructed. (Keller is a self-employed contractor engaging in home remodeling and repairing.) When Keller shows Franklin what he has done, the latter is mortified. But Keller is so desperate that he continues to beat on Alex for information. Meanwhile the mummified corpse remains unidentified by the police. When a candlelight vigil for the two missing girls is held by neighbors, Detective Loki spots a shadowy character who manages to escape after a foot chase. But Loki has garnered enough information to have a sketch made of the suspect. The real break occurs after a young saleslady at a children's discount outlet recognizes the sketch on TV. She tells Loki that the strange man shops weekly for variously-sized children's clothing. She has no other detail, but later calls Loki to say that the suspect returned, and she has his license plate number. Loki tracks down the stranger, Bob Taylor (David Dastmalchian). He is shortly arrested while bloodied children's clothing is found at his residence. At first it appears that Taylor has murdered the girls. In confinement at the station, he is asked to draw a map of the girls' whereabouts, but draws a circle maze instead. Then, in a bizarre confrontation, Taylor grabs a police gun and kills himself. Loki was not over his disappointment when the lab calls to say that only pigs' blood was found on the girls' clothing. Taylor was not a murderer, just a copycat. (While Taylor was alive he had sneaked into the Dover residence and stolen some clothing.) Meanwhile Keller is still working on Alex, and when he sees him next Alex says that the two girls are 'in a maze.' By the way, doesn't Alex at least know right from wrong? Anyway, Keller again visits Holly, who discloses some background involving Alex. WARNING: SPOILERS AHEADJoy Birch is found alive in a drugged state after she had inexplicably escaped. When Keller addresses her in the hospital, Joy responds, 'You were there.' Keller dashes away and drives to Holly's. Loki also leaves, but drives to the abandoned building instead. Keller tells Holly that he now knows that the missing girls were there. She whips out a gun and makes him drink a sedative concoction. Holly states that after her son died of cancer she and her now-missing husband (killed by Dunn) waged a war against God by kidnapping children and killing them. They abducted Alex, whose real name is Barry Millard. These actions were meant to turn parents into demons, as Keller is. Holly forces him to enter into a deep hole where Anna had been kept and covers it. Keller finds Anna's red emergency whistle. Loki is ordered to visit Holly and explain that Alex has been found. As he arrives Holly is absorbed in applying a deadly hypodermic needle into unconscious Anna's arm. Before she does so, she wheels about and wounds Loki in the head; he shoots and kills her. In a mad rush, the embattled detective drives Anna to the hospital in time. The next scene shows Loki recovering on a hospital bed and reading a newspaper headline that Alex has been reunited with his family after 26 years. Keller is still missing.While a supervised team is excavating the Jones property for bodies, Loki hears the sound of an emergency whistle emanating from the hole where Keller is confined. The credits appear. In summary, despite plot holes, this is an entertaining movie with good acting.",7,0,0,22 November 2016
"Girl, Interrupted"," Based upon the Autobiography of Susanna Kaysen
","In 1967, 18 year-old neurotic and volatile Susanna Kaysen (Winona Ryder), who attempted to commit suicide by downing a bottle of vodka and a bottle of aspirin, is rushed to a local hospital. Not only is her family life an unhappy one (despite the family's influence), but also she is confused as what to do with her life. She is in denial about her motives, and is also promiscuous. After she has survived emergency medical care, she is sent to Claymoore, a psychiatric institution in Belmont, Massachusetts. As Susanna stays for one and one-half years, her outside life has become interrupted. (Actually the title emanates from Vermeer's 17th century painting.)The hospital staff is headed by an administrator who appears to be a caring and decent man, Dr. Melvin Potts (Jeffrey Tambor) and an intelligent but detached psychiatrist Dr. Sonia Wick (Vanessa Redgrave). The supervisor on the ward is hardened nurse Valerie Owens (Whoopi Goldberg). Valerie calls Susanna 'a lazy, self- indulgent little girl who is driving herself crazy.'Placed in a women's ward, Susanna eventually receives her diagnosis: 'borderline personality disorder.' She is ambivalent and seems to deserve what she gets even though one knows that she does not really belong in Claymoore. When she tells boyfriend Toby (Jared Leto) that she has friends there, he replies, 'They are eating grapes off the wallpaper.' But Claymoore seems to give her the structure that she needs. Earlier, a nurse had warned her, 'Do not drop anchor here.' When tragedy ultimately strikes one of the inmates, Susanna seriously begins to self-examine herself and begins to cooperate with the therapists. Mentally she becomes less confused and healthier, and starts writing about her experiences. Although her book became the basis for the movie, the latter unfortunately takes many liberties. The movie, about behavior and character, is told dramatically via a series of episodes. These events include: female patient interactions; the girls breaking into the main office after hours and reading individual files; the Christmastime trip to the ice cream parlor; exercise classes; the attempt to escape; the final melodramatic confrontation in the basement. In reality, some of these events never really happened but were added in by Hollywood for dramatic effect. The other women Susanna meets at the hospital include:  Lisa Rowe (Angelina Jolie) – a rebel misfit, sociopath, and reckless; manipulative and cruel; doesn't care whom she hurts; becomes Susanna's friend.  Georgina Tuskin (Clea Duwall) – a shy and withdrawn person; suffers from schizophrenia; lives in the Land of Oz; doesn't really want to leave Claymoore; diagnosed as 'pseudologica fantastica,' a pathological liar; Susanna's roommate.  Polly Clark (Elizabeth Moss) – a schizophrenic but kindly burn victim who is also depressed with her face; will never leave Claymoore; called 'Torch' by Lisa.  Daisy Randone (Brittany Murphy) – a deeply troubled individual with an anxiety disorder; harbors a dreadful secret.  Janet Webber (Angela Bettis) – an anorexic ballerina; easily irritated; called 'Fatso' by Lisa.  Cynthia Crowley (Jillian Armenante) – a mentally-disturbed lesbian; severely depressed. Winona Ryder, who bears more than just a physical resemblance to the author of the book, is expressive and skillful at projecting mental states. She is always good. Angelina Jolie drives the movie and gives it life. Her demeaning of those around her left her a cold heart, dead inside. Jolie's haunting performance won her the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. Despite some film flaws, there are the strong presentations by an impressive cast of highly talented young actresses. Also, the script contains some sharp insights into the complexities of mental illness.",8,1,2,3 May 2016
The Great Raid," A Tribute with Little Exaggeration
","'The Great Raid' is about the most successful rescue mission in US military history. The opening monologue's newsreel footage provides a very brief summary of the Pacific Theater of Operations and Japanese anxiety as the tide of World War II changes. Shown are the terrible trials of the 1942 forced 60-mile Bataan death march, where hundreds of American soldiers and thousands of their Filipino allies perished in the Philippines. In 1944, the Japanese war ministry issued a directive that all prisoners of war (POW) were to be eliminated before rescue by the Americans. One horrible scene in particular demonstrates Japanese cruelty: the Palawan massacre, when 150 American POWs were forced into trenches, doused with gasoline and burned alive shortly after MacArthur's 1944 landing.In late January 1945, the Americans made preparations to free the remaining 500 allied POWs from the Cabanatuan prison camp. The prisoners have been weakened and starved. There are 250 Japanese soldiers in the prison camp, and 1,000 more nearby. A quarter of a million fresh American troops were already on Luzon in the north, the largest Philippine island. Lt. Colonel Henry Mucci (Benjamin Bratt) is chosen to direct the Sixth Ranger Battalion (120 men) and Filipino allies through 30 miles of jungles in a rescue attempt. Mucci's chief strategist is Captain Bob Prince (James Franco), who plans (and leads) the campaign. There is a major subplot: It involves plucky Nurse Margaret Utinsky (Connie Nielsen, based upon a real person) who smuggles medicines, especially quinine, into the POW camp. Her place of work is Manila Hospital, which harbors Japanese spies and informers. She was picked up, questioned, and tortured by the Japanese. A widow, she is romantically linked with the unfortunate Major Gibson (Joseph Fiennes), the highest ranking American soldier in the Cabanatuan camp. Debilitated, he suffers from malaria and cannot get quinine. While the Sixth rangers are the best-trained force in the US Army, they have never been tested under fire. Meanwhile just before the raid Japanese Colonel Mori (Ken Senga) receives many barrels of fuel, and awaits orders from Tokyo to liquidate all of the Bataan prisoners. A single American airplane flies over the camp at twilight to give prisoners hope. After dark the fighting begins. There are no spoilers here. The movie's promotion states right up that this is a story about a daring rescue mission. There is no mystery as to who won the world war. Rather, the film is about how the rescue was done. It is amazing that only two Americans died (The Filipinos sustained 21 casualties). The actual footage during the end credits was a real treat along with the uplifting soundtrack. As much as this tale deserves to be told, some may consider the first part to be rather slow-moving. Once the raid actually begins, however, the movie does pick up. Overall, this is an uplifting message of redemption based on actual historical events, and there is very little exaggeration. The film is narrated by James Franco.",7,3,4,7 December 2017
Sicario," An Intense Examination of the Brutal Mexican Drug Cartels
","At the beginning a brief explanation of the origin of the word sicario is provided. It actually is derived from the Latin 'sicarius' ('assassin'); in Spanish it means 'hitman.' In broad daylight in Chandler, Arizona a kidnap response unit (SWAT team) moves in against a house where drug cartel hostages are kept. An armored truck crashes through a wall. After the shootout, the team discovers 35 bodies partially encased in plastic behind the drywall; some team members retch in disgust. Two of the agents perish when a bomb explodes in an outside shed. These actions illustrate the brutality of the Mexican drug cartels. Furthermore, the raid confirms that the cartels are operating in the American southwest. At HQ, a secretive American task force (special ops), headed by unconventional Matt Graver (Josh Brolin), is assigned to legally or illegally hunt down the drug cartel honchos in Sonora, Mexico. These include drug bosses Manuel Diaz (Bernardo Sacarino), his brother Guillermo Diaz (Edgar Arreola), and top guy Fausto Alarcon (Julio Cesar Cedillo).On the task force is idealistic field agent Kate Macer (Emily Blunt), who led the assault in Chandler, and coldly violent Columbian Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro). Emily has a confidante, supposedly helpful but actually annoying Reggie (Daniel Kaluuya). After briefing, five team vehicles are driven across the Mexican border, escorted by the heavily armed Policia Federal. We are introduced to an arid and harsh land, run-down houses, and partially clothed bodies hanging upside down along freeway overpasses. There will be more brutal scenes. From the Mexican authorities, the team picks up captured Guillermo Diaz. Graver warns, 'Keep an eye out for the state police. They are not always the good guys!' When they return to the border crossing, the roads are totally jammed with barely any movement. Tension builds as the team is on the lookout for armed cartel hit-men in cars. Soon there is a shootout in front of all the civilians, but the cartel hit-men are killed; Emily kills a policeman allied with them. At HQ, Alejandro tortures Guillermo for information.After that the task force surveys a bank and captures a female money launderer. They begin to freeze the bank accounts ($17 million) of Manuel Diaz. This action forces him out of hiding and into Mexico. At a bar Kate hooks up with Ted (Jon Bernthal), a cop, and takes him to her apartment for sex. But when he removes items from his pocket, she notices that a money band is the same as used by the drug cartel. The situation turns violent, but Alejandro intervenes and arrests Ted, who is grilled and tortured for information about other crooked police on the force. Meanwhile Kate is upset; she feels that the team is operating out of bounds. She wants activities to be run by the book. Graver brings her back to reality when he tells her that his CIA unit cannot operate within the USA without a domestic agency accompanying it. 'I told you you'd be useful,' he says. 'So that's it. That's why I'm here!' she replies. Kate has received a dose of reality. With new information, the Delta Force makes a night assault on the cartel's hideaway tunnel. During the successful mission, Alejandro captures crooked Mexican cop Silvio (Maximiliano Hernández), and uses his car to capture Manuel Diaz. He kills both, and then moves against top honcho Fausto Alarcon. Killing the guards, Alejandro confronts Fausto and shoots him and his family (Fausto previously had Alejandro's wife beheaded and also had ordered his daughter thrown into a vat of acid.). Revenge yes, but why were Alejandro's family earlier killed? Was he part of the Columbian drug cartel? Do the authorities prefer the Columbians over the Mexicans because they are easier to control? Near the end Alejandro forces his way into Kate's apartment and makes her sign a document at gunpoint that the entire mission was on the up-and-up. Actually the raid was legal but Alejandro's revenge killings were not. He advises her to get a position in a small town because she is obviously in over her head. At the end women watch their children play soccer in a field. They pay little attention to the gunfire heard in the distance as the drug war has become part of their lives. Denis Villeneuve has directed a brutally realistic movie. He examines the Mexican drug cartels, their heartlessness, and how corrupting they are. His real message is that governments cannot play by the rules and so must fight fire with fire if they expect to make inroads into drug trafficking. Although the feature is generally told from the view point of Kate (Blunt), who performs well, Del Toro steals every scene where he appears. He probably merited an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.",8,3,5,29 December 2016
Raging Bull," The Best Movie of 1980, and Even of the 1980-89 Decade
","During World War II, when death and destruction are rampart, a different kind of war rages inside the mind of an American boxer. Jake LaMotta, perhaps more comfortable inside the ring than outside, has personal demons to battle. For his nature is one of insecurity and jealousy and self-destructiveness. It is by rage, and by rage alone, that drives the great fighter. Look at his ring rejoinder after his second wife Vickie states that a particular fighter (Tony Janiro) is 'good-looking.' Wham! There was another, external quandary: the rackets. They controlled who fought whom. And boxing decisions are often problematic. In Raging Bull's first fight scene, we see the undefeated Jake LaMotta crushing Jimmy Reeves in the ring but not getting the decision, apparently because of a fix (1941). In a subsequent fight he would knock out Reeves (1943). Nevertheless Jake LaMotta had to relax his own ring 'moral' standards (!) and play ball with the mob as urged by his brother. Only after he throws a fight to Billy Fox in 1947 (TKO in the 4th) and paid some cash, was he given a shot at the Middleweight title. He made the most of it when he defeated Marcel Cerdan (1949). But then again, a new problem arose: Would he have the hunger to maintain the belt? By the way, LaMotta's career did not end with his last loss to Sugar Ray Robinson (1951), as he had ten more fights. When he did retire in 1954, he had lost his title, wives, and money, although he had his jokes (and there would be more wives). It was his stand up comedy routine which later sustained him.While Raging Bulls' boxing scenes are brutal enough, look at LaMotta's deep-rooted internal turbulence when he deals with members of his own family. The man's conflict continues long after his retirement. For one thing, his words and persona remain pugnacious. To LaMotta, women always seem to be either nuns or whores, and there was little middle ground for an equal marriage partner. Thus there is domestic violence. Then we see LaMotta morph from a tough lean and mean boxer to an overweight joker, still missing a few principles (DeNiro actually gained 60 pounds for the role). What is amazing is that LaMotta is alive and well in his 90th year as of this writing. Maybe he has finally outlived his old demons. One tough dude indeed! Director Martin Scorsese has brilliantly captured the flavor of living in the teeming tenements of New York. Note how wonderfully he pays attention to detail and sets the 1940s mood. There is the grittiness, the noir, the black and white feel of the period. Inside the apartment we hear the external sounds of crying children and automobile horns. For it is a noisy and crowded and hot city that emanates through open apartment windows that lack modern air-conditioning. In the ring we bear witness not only to the precise choreography (including the sound effects) of the fight scenes – the sweat and blood of it all – but also to the claustrophobic nature of the ring itself.Besides the lead, the casting is splendid all around. To mention a few, Joe Pesci is Jake's mentor brother, Joey LaMotta, who managed and organized his bouts. Cathy Moriarty is convincing as a sensual Vicki, LaMotta's second wife. Nicholas Colasanto and Frank Vincent are appropriate as mob bosses. Robert DeNiro as Jake La Motta deservedly won the Academy Award for Best Actor. Scorsese was robbed of the Academy Award for Best Picture, no question about it. Does anyone really think that Ordinary People was better? Total Film Magazine named Scorsese the second greatest director of all time, ahead of Steven Spielberg and behind the master, Alfred Hitchcock. But it took years for Scorsese to win the Academy Award for Best Picture (2006). See Raging Bull, which is now number 4 (!) on AFI's Top 100 all-time movie listing (2007). Where does Ordinary People rank?",10,6,10,15 February 2012
Tombstone," A Throwback to the Greatest Westerns of All Time
","The opening narration by Robert Mitchum is told among scenes from several early silent features: 'The Great Train Robbery' (1903) and 'The Bank Robbery' (1908). The narrator further states that the discovery of silver created the boom-town of Tombstone (1879). A large gang of ruthless outlaws, led by psychopaths Curly Bill Brocius (Powers Boothe) and Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn), ride hard at a Mexican wedding party and thoroughly destroy it. An incensed priest warns them about the ominous signs of the apocalypse: vengeful men riding on horseback. He is abruptly gunned down by Ringo. Only a few months after rowdy Tombstone's founding, three Earp Brothers (Wyatt = Kurt Russell, Virgil = Sam Elliott, and Morgan = Bill Paxton) arrive with their three wives (Mattie, Allie, Louisa) to settle down and make money. We do not hear about brothers James or Warren, even though they were there in the 1880s; James was a saloon-keeper not involved in the politics. Tombstone is typically western in that saloons and gambling establishments thrive. Confidence men check out the Earps as they disembark from wagons. County Sheriff Behan (Jon Tenney) introduces himself; the Earps also meet town marshal Fred White (Harry Carey, Jr.). After that, Wyatt enters the Oriental to confront bully Johnny Tyler (Billy Bob Thorton), who had seized the gaming table. By disposing of the coward, Wyatt obtains 25% of the faro take. Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer), an old friend who has pneumonia, turns up to renew his old acquaintances. Entering town by stagecoach is actress Josephine Marcus (Dana Delaney) and her small acting troupe. Over time Josephine will replace laudanum-drinking Mattie as Wyatt's wife. At the Oriental gaming table, Wyatt and Doc make the acquaintance of Curly Bill, Johnny Ringo, and Ike Clanton (Stephan Lang). Ike warns Wyatt that the Cowboys dislike lawmen; Wyatt, though, is 'retired'; he had been a noted peace officer in Dodge City, Kansas. Curly Bill wins $500 and walks away happy, although Doc and Ringo eye each other. Leaving an opium den, Curly Bill is of unsound mind and fires his weapons against town regulations; eventually he murders Marshal Fred White while corrupt Sheriff Behan does nothing. The mayor wants Wyatt to be town marshal but he initially refuses. Later Wyatt becomes a lawman, along with his two brothers. Meanwhile some outlaw cowboys pull into town armed. The Earps deploy to disarm the cowboys, an action that sets up the famous shootout at the OK Corral (26 Oct 1881). When the smoke clears, two McLaury Brothers and Billy Clanton (Thomas Haden Church) are dead; Virgil, Morgan, and Doc are wounded. Billy Clairborne (Wyatt Earp III) and Ike Clanton have run away. Actually Ike did not shoot at the Earps from Fly's studio; he simply ran towards the stables. Unsuccessfully, Behan tries to arrest the Earps. 'Tombstone' is unique in that it covers six months after the OK Corral gunfight. Because of the shootout, the cowboys commence cowardly acts of vengeance. They hold a funeral for their dead comrades, carrying a sign that reads 'Murdered on the Streets of Tombstone.' On a subsequent stormy night, Virgil is ambushed by some cowboys; resulting in a buckshot-shattered left arm. After (actually three months later), Morgan is shot in the back while playing pool; he lives only a few minutes before expiring. Wyatt decides it is time to send Virgil, Allie, and Louisa to California. Curly Bill sends Frank Stillwell (Tomas Arana) to the train station to wipe out the remaining Earps. Stillwell, however, is shot to death by Wyatt, who now becomes a renegade for his vengeful action. The rest of the movie focuses on the Earp Vendetta (1882). This was a federal posse that included 'Texas Jack' John Vermillion (Peter Sherayko), 'Turkey Creek' Jack Johnson (Buck Taylor), Sherman McMasters (Michael Rooker), Warren Earp (although Warren was not in the movie), and Wyatt. These are the men of the apocalypse, the earlier warning of the priest. Cowboys are shot to death on site, whether on the plains, in the woods, at an opium den, or in a barber shop. It's not easy, though. Once, Wyatt's band is trapped in a crossfire by Curly Bill and some cohorts at Iron Springs. Wyatt bravely extricates himself and runs towards the cowboys, blazing away, and killing Curly Bill. Doc says Wyatt walks on water. (It is an historical fact that Wyatt was never wounded in any of his gun battles.)Although Sheriff Behan forms a posse (that included outlaw cowboys) to arrest Wyatt, he never locates him. Wyatt's band rests at the ranch of sympathetic Henry Hooker (Charlton Heston). Ringo sends a message challenging Earp to come to the Oak Grove (Silver Springs), but Doc Holliday arrives first and challenges Ringo, who is slain. The remaining gang-members are systematically wiped out. Ike survives (only to be killed later while rustling cattle). After the vendetta is over, a dying Doc has checked himself into a Colorado sanitarium. On his deathbed he has converted to the Roman Catholic faith. (Doc actually lived longer, until 1888.)In snowy Colorado, Wyatt visits Josephine and proposes, even though he owns nothing. Josephine says she comes from a rich family. The narrator tells us that they lived together for 47 years; Wyatt died in 1929. Two of his funeral pall bearers were silent screen cowboys William S. Hart and Tom Mix. Credits appear at movie's end. Director George P. Cosmatos has created a vastly underrated western. The photography magnificently pictures the grandeur of the West, like its sunsets. Notice the interior of the telegraph office at the beginning, the ornate bar of the Oriental, or the candle-lighting around the actors' stage. The sets are authentic, even finer details like clothing, wallpaper, saddles, and pistols of the 1880s. The exception is the red sashes, which appear solely for Cowboy identification. There are 85 speaking parts and characters are well-developed. This might have been the best western since the 1970s.",9,10,13,26 August 2016
Unbroken," A triumph of the Human Spirit: Endurance and Perseverance
","'Unbroken' is based on the excellent award-winning inspirational book (2010) by Laura Hillebrand, who has an eye for detail and description. It is a biography of the exciting life of Louis Silvie Zamperini of Torrance, California. This review includes several details that were omitted in the movie, included to clarify certain situations.Louis Zamperini (C.J. Valleroy as young Louie, Jack O'Connell in the title role) was restless and incorrigible as a Californian youth. Bullied, he was a juvenile delinquent. His older brother Pete (John D'Leo, Alex Russell), however, began to take more interest in him and became his mentor when Louie decided to run track. Pete rode his bike as Louie ran alongside him; later he ran far ahead. By high school Louie was setting state and national records: 'The Torrance Tornado' became the fastest high school runner in US history. At age 19 he was already in the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games even though his body was still too young (undeveloped) to win a medal. Nevertheless he surprised even Hitler when he ran the fastest last lap of the 5,000-meter race in 56 seconds. Although robbed of his chance to break a world track record and run an under four-minute mile at the now-canceled 1940 Olympics, Louie continues to train in the vain hope that war will end by 1944, the next scheduled games. At film's beginning Louie is a flight lieutenant, a World War II bombardier on a B-24 Liberator that has just completed a successful raid on the Japanese-held island of Nauru in the south Pacific (1943). Although the airplane is shot up and crew members are wounded, the crew limps back successfully to base at Funafuti (now Tuvalu). The next mission involves rescuing a downed B-24 crew near the island of Palmyra. But Louie's crew is given 'The Green Hornet,' an airplane that was not really fly-worthy. Sure enough an engine fails at an inopportune time and the plane has to be ditched over the vast Pacific Ocean (27 May 1943). There was no bail out because of the notorious shark-infested waters. Three of eleven crew members survive (Louie, Phil, Mac); they occupy two rubber rafts lashed together. One of them, friend Allen 'Phil' Phillip (Domhnall Gleason) has a head wound. The scenes involving the albatross and sharks are as described in the book. Sharks constantly ran their bodies and fins along the raft bottom; the men could feel them (Yikes!). The book describes how more than one of the smaller sharks actually leaped onto the raft; a timely oar saved Louie's head. Then a twenty-foot long Great White slammed against the raft bottom, sending three men into the air. Luckily they landed atop the raft. Francis McNamara ('Mac,' Finn Wittrock) eats all of the rationed chocolate, the only food. Eventually catatonic, he expires. In violation of the Geneva Convention, a Japanese Zero strafes them. After a record 47 harrowing days of thirst and starvation at sea on rubber rafts, the two survivors receive both good and bad news: they are rescued by the enemy. After interrogation at notorious Kwajalein, where prisoners were previously executed, Louie and Phil are eventually sent first to Ofuna Prisoner of War (POW) camp, then Omori in Tokyo Bay. Right away Louie is targeted by sadistic Japanese Corporal Watanabe ('The Bird,' Takamasa Ishiara), who constantly beats him unmercifully. Although the Geneva Convention excludes officers from work details, many are forced into labor. Not working meant that one-half of the already meager rations were cut. Getting enough food to avoid starvation was problematic because of pilferage. Foods allocated for prisoners were stolen by both Japanese military and civilians and sold on the black market. Although Red Cross relief packages had been sent to the POWs, they too were confiscated. To avoid starvation, POWs had to do their own pilfering! (At war's end 1500 unopened Red Cross boxes were discovered locked in a prison storehouse!) The book further describes how Louie and other men were used as test subjects for experiments in biological / chemical warfare. Cloudy liquid forcibly injected into arms caused dizziness and nausea.Serendipity strikes Louie when Japanese intelligence discovers that American military has mistakenly assumed his death. Knowing that the capture of an American Olympic athlete has propaganda value, the Japanese allow Louie to radio broadcast a harmless message that he is alive and well. After that Louie gets a nice meal in a Japanese cafeteria. But Louie is soon approached by high level Japanese civilians, who want him to disparage America over airwaves. As Louie cannot act in good conscience, it is back to POW camp with Watanabe. Towards war's end, Louie is transferred to the grimy coal barges on Japan's west coast (Naeotsu). War's end and homecoming cannot come soon enough (1945). The instincts that helped Louie endure his mutinous youth had helped keep him alive in despairing situations. Although his post-traumatic stress disorder and religious conversion were skipped, closing captions briefly explain that Louie married and later returned to Japan to forgive his captors for their cruel treatment. The exception was Watanabe, the Bird; he was assumed dead. Not until 1997 did Louie discover that Watanabe was still alive; he died in 2003. The ending shows the real life footage of Zamperini as an old man running the torch for the Winter Olympics (1998), not far from his old POW camp. Louie lived until 2014, dying just a few months before picture release.Although the movie doesn't cover Louie's post-war years, it is still entertaining. It was nominated for three Academy Awards and won several others. One should not expect the picture to be as detailed as the book. Perhaps the feature could have been extended by, say, thirty minutes; Angelina Jolie directed. The screenplay is decent enough and Roger Deakins' cinematography is excellent. Jack O'Connell plays the tough Italian wonderfully and is inspiring as a man constantly beaten down but who mentally defeats his enemies.",8,24,25,31 January 2017
Final Destination," Death Has a Design That Can Be Changed
","The movie has an interesting premise: A high school student, aboard an airplane and waiting to depart on his French classes' flight to Paris, has a premonition: a ghastly vision of an explosion. He then raises a commotion and bolts from the craft. A few minutes later the plane explodes in midair just after takeoff, killing everyone aboard. The view from the terminal is terrific, with glass shattering everywhere. The young man and six others – who have disembarked during the turmoil – have cheated death, but death, though unfeeling, hates to be cheated. And so for the rest of the movie death stalks the survivors, and picks them off one by one. Meanwhile the main character tries to figure out the death patterns to stay ahead of fate. As a mortician later tells Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) and sympathizing friend Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), 'The risk of cheating the plan, of disrespecting the design, could incite a fury that could terrorize even the Grim Reaper.'The whole feeling is one of doom, that something is out to get you, as writer Mark Twain thought of his family tragedies. Inanimate objects turn against people, like water, wind, electrical wires, vodka, gas cans, knives, lanterns, fish hooks, candles, a garage- door opener, etc. And folks die in various ways, like an elaborate strangulation, decapitation, traffic accident, fire, etc. When John Denver's tune, 'Rocky Mountain High' is played, watch out for a falling sign! So we have a bizarre chain of connected events, like a Rube Goldberg machine. In the early 20th century Goldberg created cartoons for newspapers that depicted complicated gadgets that performed tasks in complex ways. FBI agents and others think that Alex is some kind of freak, especially because of his theories about death's design. The last half of the film focuses on Alex's increasing paranoia and precautions, like his opening of tin cans while wearing heavy gloves lest he should severely cut himself and get blood-poison. His lit candles are placed in water bowls as protection against an ill wind that may knock them over.Despite an interesting story-line, the film has its negatives. For one, the acting is just so-so, especially with co-lead Ali Larter. In addition, this morphs into just another horror film. Also, there are the plot flaws. One may say, 'Why save someone's life as he will be doomed anyway?' You may come to the same conclusion by adding, 'Why do we have doctors?' Nevertheless Director James Wong's concept was popular enough with teen viewers so that four sequels were produced. But the characters were mostly created just to be knocked off, although not quite as badly as those in the 'Friday the Thirteenth' series. You may be entertained by it.",5,0,0,10 May 2017

Thomas Hart (Colin Farrell), a military attaché, is captured by Germans via a ruse: Those desperate German soldiers of a dying Reich who speak like Americans and dress in American uniforms. He is sent to POW prison, Stalag VI A in Augsburg, Germany. There he meets German commandant, Col. Werner Visser (Marcel Iures, in a marvelous performance). Almost immediately, he is greeted by Col. McNamara (Bruce Willis), the highest ranking prisoner of war in the camp. After sniffing out Hart (Hart's reaction to a most grueling interrogation by Deutsch Officer Lutz), he assigns Hart to an enlisted men's barracks, Building 27, instead of the one for officers. Apparently the Germans did allow the highest ranking POW a degree of power in the encampments. Hart blends in fairly well as he learns the ins and outs of survival, like the value of cigarettes. Before long two African-American Air Force officers, recently captured by the Germans, are placed by McNamara in the enlisted men's quarters. Staff Sergeant Vic Bedford (Cole Hauser) makes no pretense of his displeasure. Not only is Bedford bigoted, but he also knows how to obtain favors from the German guards. When Bedford is found murdered, suspicion is focused on one of the Negroes, Lincoln Scott (Terrance Howard). The other had already been shot for attempted escape after being set up (by Bedford). With approval of Col. McNamara, Scott is placed on trial by the Americans. The aim of the trial can be seen as a way for Americans to maintain their dignity under trying circumstances. McNamara assigns Hart as Scott's defense council, even though the former has only attained progress as a second-year Yale Law School aspirant. Col. Visser agrees and supports the trial, which consumes much of the second half of the feature. It soon becomes obvious that McNamara is at odds with Hart, and has motives that transcend justice. The privileged Hart has much to learn.On the other hand, Visser is sympathetic to the lieutenant, with whom he discloses his graduation from Yale back in 1928. He even gives the conflicted Hart a copy of the American Manual for Courts- Martial to assist him. He knows that McNamara 'threw him to the wolves.' Privately he tells Hart that he enjoys American culture, like reading Mark Twain; he also plays his Negro jazz records, a collection that very much relaxes him even though it is 'verboten' in the Reich. Visser is obviously not a typical nasty Nazi stereotype. Towards the end we realize that there is a shifting of events: the trial really has nothing to do with Lincoln Scott. Much about the camp was a lie; Bedford was a known snake. There is something larger afloat, an act of greater military importance that is portended earlier. As this is a World War II movie, perhaps this fact should have been expected. But it is distracting to the viewer, and will not work for many. Some may even feel that the story-line is no better than mediocre. The feature is produced by David Ladd, Alan Ladd's son. The cinematography, with its wintry bluish tone and stark, snowy scenes, works very well. The claustrophobia in each of the unheated barracks can be felt outside of the screen. In this writer's opinion, you can do worse than watch.",6,1,2,6 October 2016
Saboteur," Appearances are Deceiving
","After moving to the USA in 1939, Alfred Hitchcock, the Master of Suspense, had made such good psychological dramas like 'Rebecca' (1940) and 'Notorious' (1941). After the USA entered World War II in late 1941, it was obvious that Hollywood movie themes would focus on such subjects as espionage, the home front, national defense, and action in the field. Meanwhile Hitchcock's excellent 'Shadow of a Doubt' (1943) drew Hitchcock fully into 'Americana,' the American culture. Before 'Shadow of a Doubt' Hitchcock was already centered on war time America. In 'Saboteur,' Barry Kane (Robert Cummings) is falsely accused of (Nazi) sabotage at a California airplane plant during the dark days of World War II. During a fire of suspicious origin, Frank Fry (Norman Lloyd), a supposed factory worker, had handed Kane a fire extinguisher that he passed onto his friend, Ken Mason. Mason perished in the flames. It turned out that the fire extinguisher was filled with gasoline. As there was no worker named Fry, suspicion fell on Kane, who fled. During his truck ride, he remembered that he had noticed Fry's address on an envelope that read Deep Springs Ranch, Springville, California. At the ranch he meets boss Tobin (Otto Kruger), a 'gentleman-villain' who is onto Kane. Soon rounded up by ranch hands, he escapes the law when he dives from a bridge into a deep river (duplicated notably in 1993's 'The Fugitive'). Still handcuffed, he dries out rather quickly at the house of blind man Phillip Martin (NOT Miller, played compassionately by Vaughan Glaser). Suspense is created when Kane drops a knife in front of Martin's niece Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane) and hesitates to pick it up because of his handcuffs. We are surprised when the blind man says to his niece that he recognized the sound of the handcuffs early on. Unlike her uncle, Miss Martin does not believe in Kane, and tells him so while they are in her car. So when she later tries to summon roadside help, he uses the time to cut the handcuffs in half using the auto engine fan blade. Tension is created because of Hitchcock's use of multiple cuts between Kane and Lane: We wonder, 'Will Kane win the race and free himself?' Anyway, eventually Miss Martin begins to believe in the man's innocence, especially after the two wind up in Soda City (probably Nevada, even though filmed in California, as it is near the Boulder, or Hoover, Dam). Kane calls it 'The heart of the bicarbonate belt.' In the ghost town (since 1923) there is a most unusual coincidence when Pat and Barry inadvertently discover that Hoover Dam may have been targeted. After more than an hour into the movie the setting swiftly shifts to the East. Our hero gets a ride from Nevada without any in-between stops being shown. Continuity suffers: No Fort Larned, no Abe Lincoln Home, no Valley Forge! In NY, the villains are still well-disguised: Mrs. Sutton conducts a wonderful charity event, and the upper crust bad guys seem so polite. So whom do you trust? Anyway the target is a new ship being launched at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. There is a thrilling theater shootout before an anticlimax at the torch of the Statue of Liberty National Monument. We do not know what happens to the rest of the Nazi sympathizers, but perhaps the director wanted to remind us that enemy agents were still at large at the time and that Americans should be alert to their nefarious activities. Appearances are deceiving in this film, and we cite several examples. According to Miss Martin, Kane looks like a saboteur even though he is innocent. Mr. Martin is blind but seems aware of everything going on around him. Tobin and Sutton appear clean although they are anything but unblemished. Although Soda City is a dead town, unscrupulous activities occur there. Conversely, note that Pat Martin's billboard advertisements are interesting for describing the actions that follow: 'You're Being Followed' (warning to Kane)  'She'll Never Let You Down' (Miss Martin's later change of heart)  'Beautiful Funeral' (death in NY)'Saboteur' features many positives. The opening credits feature a nice introductory music score. Set designs are excellent throughout, and the film is well-paced. We see some attractive USA monuments: Hoover Dam, Red Rock Canyon State Park, Radio City Music Hall, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty National Monument. There is an amazing assortment of distinct characters: The circus troupe is right out of 'Freaks' (1932). Priscilla Lane is top billed, along with Robert Cummings. Vaughan Glaser (Glazer) is particularly likable. Unconscionably, he is incorrectly identified in the closing credits as Mr. Miller even though he tells Kane that his name is Phillip Martin. 'Saboteur' may not be 'Vertigo,' 'North by Northwest' or 'Psycho' but it is enjoyable and has a thrilling ending. In time the Master of Suspense would feature other USA landmarks, like Mt. Rushmore National Memorial ('North by Northwest'), the Golden Gate National Recreation Area ('Vertigo'), and the Blue Ridge Mountains ('Marnie').",8,2,3,23 September 2013
