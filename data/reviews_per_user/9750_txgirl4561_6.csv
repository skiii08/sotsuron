Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I liked it!
","This movie got so many put-downs. But I don't think that the movie was bad at all. People just expected so much more from it... but it's hard to top the trilogy, and I think Episode 1 did the best it could with the story. I really enjoyed the special effects (especially the scene with the sea monster, that was really cool)! And I LOVED the racing scene with Anakan Skywalker. No, it's not as good as the other ones, but I really liked it. It did seem to aim towards a younger crowd, but I think adults would still enjoy it. It kept my attention the entire time, and I think the little boy did a really good job.",Null,0,0,13 February 2000
Notting Hill," I loved this movie, it's a good one to rent!
","I loved Notting Hill! I thought it was a great romantic comedy! Hough (or Hugh?) Grant and Julia Roberts were wonderful! The movie was funny, and very touching! The casting was perfect! I think this is a great one to rent, if you haven't already seen it... the screenplay was very believable and smart! My favorite character was the main character (played by Hough (Hugh?) Grant)'s roommate, he cracked me up! So, go and rent it! It's really cute!",Null,0,0,12 February 2000
Liar Liar," Great movie!
","Liar Liar was great! I LOVED this movie! It cracked me up; there were lots and lots of laughs! Jim Carrey was hilarious, and the little boy (whom you've seen in many other movies) was adorable. I loved this movie; everyone I know loves it. It's so funny! It's basically about a lawyer who can't lie. Perfect story! This movie cracks you up and keeps your attention the entire time... defiantly one you can see more than once!",Null,0,0,18 February 2000
Good Will Hunting," One of the greatest movies!
","Good Will Hunting is a brilliant movie! The screenplay by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck was incredible! Matt Damon and Robin Williams both delivered amazing performances! I loved the movie; it is one of my favorites! You will stayed glued to the screen! Good Will Hunting is basically about a genius who was raised in Boston living the life of a 'slacker'. After getting into to trouble with the law, he agrees to meet with a mathematician and a therapist every week, instead of going to jail.  The relationship he builds with Sean, the therapist (Robin Williams) was very moving and unforgettable. You must see this movie!",Null,0,1,30 January 2000
The Sixth Sense," A one of a kind!
","Finally, a good scary movie. Beside the Scream trilogy, there hasn't been many horror or scary flicks that have been really good. But I loved this movie! It's one of those films; you want someone else to watch! Thought it was pg 13, it will give anyone the chills, a great suspenseful, cool movie to see. I recommend it to every 13 or over... it's really good! You'll love what happens... but I won't spoil it!",Null,0,1,18 February 2000
The Matrix," It was okay.
","This movie got a lot of hype it didn't deserve. I thought it was okay, the special effects were awesome and the overall idea was pretty cool (yet completely unrealistic)... but I really didn't think it was that great! Though I understood it, it was hard to follow... and I found myself wanting to do something else... but I forced myself to watch it, I thought maybe I'd miss out on something. I didn't. I could have easily done without this movie, it wasn't that wonderful. Yes, the special effects, once again, were cool, but think of how great this movie would have been if it kept your attention? So many loved this movie, but I thought it was really tasteless. You see it, make your own opinion, but this is mine.",Null,0,0,18 February 2000
