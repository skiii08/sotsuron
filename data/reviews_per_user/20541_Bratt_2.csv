The Double Life of VÃ©ronique," Evocative fantasy.....
","Irene Jacob carries her emotional burden lightly in a nuanced turn as the protagonist Veronique/Veronika. The sepia-toned fantasy film explores the idea of the soul of one trapped in another body. One life is influenced by the other as they look for fulfillment of their twin destinies, in music and love. Irene's face has that searching innocence which is used to good effect here. Kieslowski's direction utilizes those 'exalted silences' which are a hallmark of  European cinema. Irene's Best Actress Award at Cannes is well deserved.",Null,4,7,27 May 1999
The Thin Red Line," highlights some artistic features of the film
",The three hour film is almost a metaphysical meditation on the nature of war and evil in particular and humanity in general. What is good about this war movie is that it avoids moralising and instead concentrates on existential problems confronted by these soldiers in the face of death. The director has used documentary realism to good effect here. This is counterpointed by interspersing 'personal thoughts' of the characters.These breaks in the narrative bring in a more complex mental landscape. The battle scene on the grass covered hill slopes is among the best ever filmed. I would recommend the film to all serious moviegoers.,Null,0,0,24 May 1999
