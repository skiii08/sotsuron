10 Cloverfield Lane," A human-monster of a movie
","Maybe to be attached to that 'Cloverfield' movie back in 2008 (Does the time fly?) is the only misstep of this powerful movie. And that thing can be quickly pardoned. Because '10 Cloverfield Lane' is a surprising masterpiece of tension at a small scale that leaves the audience with a big chill far away from the theater.The less you know about the movie, the better. Also the less you expect somewhat of a direct follow up from the previous, even much better. Although that won't be a problem because the pace of this movie grabs you since the moment Mary Elisabeth Winsted picks the car and then it never let you go. The story is inventive and involving as well the round of performances. Menawhile Winstead is marvelous in the movie and Gallagher Jr. is really good there is John Goodman who gives the really first Oscar-worthy performance of the year. Goodman has always being associated to a comedic roles and he is fully capable of it. But in this terrific thriller he's masterful and flawless. Every time he appears steals the screen.With a conclusion that will divide the audience (I personally loved it, leaving you terrifically satisfied and pinning up for more) and counting some people that may find this movie a bit of hollow because they were looking for a more prominent monster, '10 Cloverfield Lane' is a brave and groundbreaking 'sequel' that has turned itself into its own. Its 'blood connection' to the first may be more for a ticket sale rather than a continuation, but this is a independent movie that must be experienced immediately. Don't let anyone to spoil you anything of the plot.",10,43,81,10 March 2016
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Best Mission: Impossible and one of the best action movies, even with its forgettable flaws thanks to the superb pace
","First of all, no doubt about this franchise is one of the better ones inside the action genre. Also 'Ghost Protocol' is a great action movie and a stunning entertainment, even if its script lacks a little more of depth. But after several watches and having passed the initial acclaim, let's face that without the powerful effect of its action sequences the plot itself couldn't live up to be an awesome action movie (just look at 'Edge of tomorrow' and the surprising rich of its story and turns that made it stands as really one of the best and most quality entertaining movies of the recent years). So, with the inventive usually relieving on how the action sequences could impress the audience, it's a powerful joy to find a 'Mission Impossible' film that actually has a deep, complex plot with unexpected surprising twists, well developed characters and moral issues of theirs shown in their frantic mission without getting confuse or losing the audience. It's the longest running time entry, but beats 'Ghost Protocol' as the most entertaining one, and the first one as the most Hitchcockian (aka intriguing). The marketing looks like it has shown most of the movie, but it doesn't. Thank god, and even in this times. 'Rouge Nation' works as a stand alone installment, but there are references of the previous one (Kremlin bombing, so the IMF was disabled – The Syndicate, referenced at the very last shot of the previous before Cruise disappeared) and the plot doesn't sacrifices itself for being spectacular. That's maybe the best narrative strength of the film (specially to those of you who really care about the plot even knowing that this picture is likely a brainless movie). But that action sequences are also so compelling and exciting. If they don't surpass the Burj Khalifa and the parking scenes from 'GP', they are at the same level of breathless greatness. The now famous 'open the door' scene with Tom Cruise literally risking his life (one more time alongside GP climbing), as the shockingly beautiful orchestrated and suspenseful delivered Opera sequence are two big stunts ready to compete with the franchise legacy. But, sadly, there are some bits that could represent some failures or problems. Meanwhile the acting delivers (Cruise on top form, Rebecca Ferguson being a really stunning addition and at the same level of relevance and supporting weigh than Cruise, Pegg continues to stabilize his role with witty confidence) some of the big assets (Baldwin, Renner and Rhames) look like being treaty as a very minor roles (specially Renner in comparison with GP), as well the villain (Sean Harris) is not as empty as Michael Nyqvist but doesn't live up to embrace the level left of the sadly late Philip Seymour Hoffman. Also that third act that has been so talky in last months can disappoint some of the audience due to its execution and resolution. Arguably it always depends on how everyone could look at this installment and how high the hype is, because I personally enjoyed how it ended (I risk my opinion and I say that has a stronger third act than GP, thematically and in terms of suspense). But maybe the ending doesn't fully compensates all the potential of the film's plot (maybe I was looking for a darker, edgier finale, but this is a light action movie too, so it couldn't stick so well). As a conclusion: 'Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation' is a satisfying action movie, incredibly entertaining and with powerful action scenes. It can be considered as the best Mission: Impossible movie (although maybe not best Cruise movie) or ranked at the same position than 'Ghost Protocol', but even with that highlights it falls short giving each role their importance inside the plot and the villain is not as good as he could be. It may not be a perfect movie for the most, yet it's going to be another superb time at cinemas with the usual Tom Cruise power and a surprisingly skillful mission that everyone who are looking for the magic of entertaining should accept.",9,6,12,30 July 2015
Spectre," 'The dead are alive': Spectre is a gift for Bond fans and a great action thriller with a surprising amount of complex and contrived heart.
","This review will be mostly spoiler free because despite all the problems that the production and the writing suffered this movie is a self conscious sleight of hands between all the things you think you know about the plot mixed with dark and funny surprises that pave their way through around the final half. And that's an incredible triumph over all the odds that must be experienced in bare bones. It's a terrific Bond film (more Bondish than Skyfall in a gloriously preposterous way)that has the equals in production values, score (Thomas Newman mixing Skyfall cues with new ones fits well), direction, performances and the brave narrative decisions taken in its script. But let me say this in advice: it may not exactly reach the same smart and complex, deeper and meaningful way achieved in the very personal Skyfall.The priceless opening sequence: Masterful. Eye popping. Five minutes (or so) in one tracking shot. Never seen before in the franchise. Maybe the best prologue EVER. This is how you start a movie in a truly rip- roaring fashion.Opening credits: It's a special affair to take part. Sam Smith tune has a little to compare with the epic scoop from Adele, but as a slow burning ballad is terrific for the movie (and very gorgeously designed for it, culminating in a very special opening titles). Is about a man who is an assassin but at the same a time a human being with his flaws (more or less in a way like Dench's M wants for Bond at their first face to face in Casino Royale) and his uncertain demise to find someone pure and up to himThe rest of the movie (If I'd reveal anything, I would deserve a ban from all the users of this site): it takes a little of time at some parts and it probably would affect in direct comparison to its predecessor. But this movie is able to live up the plot of Skyfall by deeper extravaganza and funnier build up even if it tries to rehash elements rather than add other news (wait a while in order really meet the villain, spy games in MI6 office, Bond has to operate in the shadows again). Taking its basis as a somewhat follow up (it starts as an extended epilogue indeed with a special message from someone of the past brought back from dead 'for a few moments') it develops its own big story with style, patching the whole Craig's era so far and even paying homage to certain iconic moments of his run (there's a cracking torture scene this time too that may push the rating a bit too far) and the franchise overall (the fight in the train, a cat, iconic action sequence in the snow). Just when you think that the script is falling in a familiar territory, the film suddenly subverts your expectations using human drama (very effective for Bond and Oberhauser) instead the action or the fatigue. And the reveals make these characters even more likable and interesting. This smells like the truly 50th anniversary but 3 years later due to finding itself very encouraged to include references of the whole 007 story than the personal previous outing: It 's a thrilling and tragic Bond film, with best of Connery/Moore (and Lazenby) roots (gadgets included) but without becoming too campy or an absurd parody of itself. The performances (Fiennes, Whishaw, Harris, the twisted Andrew Scott, Monica Bellucci in her little amount of screen time 'without mercy' and obviously the Bond 'new' main interest: Léa Seydoux) are top notch as we could expect from Sam Mendes (even better in the direction). But Christoph Waltz (as insanely brilliant as we were looking for even if falls short to be as resonant as Silva and being closer to a more billed Le Chiffre), Dave Bautista (perfect, brutal, ruthless and iconic) and Daniel Craig (he nails it: operatic complex, dark, emotional and riveting-best Bond EVER) are the three best things that could ever happen to the movie in performances terms.From its orgasmic start in Mexico City to his hard hitting conclusion in London, Spectre is a gift for newcomers and classics Bond fans and a great action thriller with a heart. I don't know if it's the best Craig's Bond movie (Casino Royale is still a modern classic and Skyfall maybe fell in a better context and expectations in comparison with this one), but is a perfect entertaining and that was the same exciting affair happened to the two ones mentioned. While its deep psychological punch may not being so surprising nor original this time and the effectively reliable political urgency that made Skyfall so unique is left a little underweight with the M vs. C plot, Sam Mendes and the whole team can breathe relaxed. They have wrapped up their story in a new whole level and in a spectacular victory fashion by succeeding presenting a riveting story in terms of pure emotion and action. And if this is the real farewell to Daniel Craig's run he couldn't really ask for any better final outing, as well to thank to the producers and writers to have gifted him the greatest Bond era of all. He really leaves the tux (and the broken soul inside it) on a beautiful high. I'm even afraid if he agrees to come back (with almost the same team or another) even being my favorite Bond Because to surpass this is going to be a hell of a difficulty.",10,122,245,25 October 2015
