The Avengers," Not bad, but overpraised for sure.
","I think the most amazing thing about Avengers is seeing so many main characters of different franchises teaming up; it is fantastic that they are played by the same actors as well (except for The Hulk).The plot is a clich√©, nothing interesting in that; the screenplay is not very good, either, and the acting isn't academy award material (screenplay didn't help here; when there's no realism in the story, the field for the actor gets really small: performances couldn't have been much better than that).I missed Edward Norton.It was an entertaining movie, but not more than that.",7,2,7,1 March 2015
