Casablanca," A perfect example of synergy.
","Casablanca is a great movie by accident and not by design.  With the exception of Bergman, the rest of the cast were Warner Brothers 'usual suspects.'  But, oh that chemistry:  the cast, the director, the music, and the great writing.  From this one movie, you can use a quote to fit almost every situation.  Casablanca is my favorite movie!",10,0,0,3 May 1999
