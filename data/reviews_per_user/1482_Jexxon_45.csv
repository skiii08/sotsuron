The Blair Witch Project," Scary for all the wrong reasons.
","The only praise I can give to this 'scary' film (I use the term lightly), goes to the marketing department. They must have had all sorts of geniuses working around the clock to make people want to see this garbage. Obviously, they did their job extremely well. How can you otherwise explain that: ...the absence of real actors, direction, and a script is somehow applauded? ...improvised dialogue (mostly yelling and fighting) can be a good thing? ...a pile of small rocks and a couple of twigs is supposed to send chills down your spine? ...staring a black screen for long periods of time can be considered as entertainment? ...the only scary part is the very final minute of the film (of course, by then it's too late to save the film)?Enough said...",1,1,2,20 August 2004
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Dennis the menace
","In my humble opinion, the world (or universe) needed this film as much as we needed the tiresome Matrix sequels. The new Star Wars serves no purpose as to explain the origins of Darth Vader. What we get is a seriously annoying kid running around like Dennis the menace or something.Lucas desperately tries to tie in this prequel to the original trilogy by throwing in a never ending stream of name dropping, and 'clever' winks at the old films. I just don't see the point. Do we really need three films about Darth Vader and the rise of the empire? And if we do - shouldn't they at least be fun or interesting?The plot about trade wars and political arguments isn't exactly riveting. Liam Neeson goes for a zombie approach to his character, and McGregor tries to look and sound like Alec Guiness, which feels kind of odd. The bad guys, armies of stupid anorectic robots, and some very brief moments from Darth Maul, aren't interesting either. Then, of course, there's Jar Jar Binks (why, why, why?) and Jake Lloyd as young Anakin/Vader (couldn't they find a kid with at least one ounce of charisma).The only reason these films are being made is that Lucas and ILM can do just about anything with their computers these days. It looks good, but it's very sterile and flat. Actors performing an entire film in front of a blue screen, cannot help looking like cardboard cutouts. Phantom Menace's over hype, aside, it's still just awfully long and boring (the anything but exciting pod race felt like it went on for ever, by the way). [1/10]",Null,0,1,4 October 2004
Catch Me If You Can," Glossy, but not always classy
","OK comedy/drama telling the story of young con man DiCaprio, chased by Hanks' FBI man.The opening credits and score set the tone for this retro looking film. Overall, it has an air of being old-school. It's not very dark or foul mouthed, and it's not a pure comedy either. It has a nostalgic touch to it, which I guess is supposed to draw in the crowds for an old fashioned crime caper of sorts. However, I thought the film felt kind of schizophrenic. The comedy bits are those that work best (Hanks' best work so far in my opinion), but judging from the subject matter, this should have been a considerably darker film in tone. It's like Spielberg didn't know how to put the story together as it displays numerous mood swings - sometimes serious, sometimes definitely not. Structrually, the film also feels a bit weak, it would have worked better with linear storytelling, rather than jumping back and forth in time. The acting is OK, but I could never really get to grips with DiCaprio's character (and in some scenes, neither did DiCaprio). The production design, cinematography, and score work fine together but the story never quite holds up. There is nothing remarkable about the film, and towards the end, Spielberg's sappier movie sentiments makes for some not so good movie time, unfortunately. [6/10]",6,2,6,30 December 2004
Se7en," A classic chiller
","To put it simply - Seven (i think the 7 in the title looks damn stupid) is the best film I've seen. As far as the pure cinema experience goes, I it shares the number one spot with Titanic (yes Titanic, no I'm not crazy), but Seven is the only flawless film I can think of.The story is pretty straight forward, but when Seven came out, the world hadn't yet been flooded with gritty looking, inferior serial killer rip-offs. There's a beauty to the simplicity. The film never takes the cheap way out, and deserves a lot of credit for that. There's a refreshing lack of clichés that makes it all the more easy to watch (just look at R. Lee Ermey's police captain - normally they only yell and scream at the hero, refusing to believe whatever theory he's got, but in Seven he actually listens to, and supports his men).The acting is superb all round, and the chemistry between Freeman and Pitt is pure magic. The work behind the camera (Fincher's Fight Club may be the flashier one, but this is his masterpiece), and on the sets are equally impressive. The atmosphere and setting really pulls you in to the film, never letting go until the end credits roll. And the ending... the best one ever filmed, period. [10/10]",10,0,0,7 October 2004
Dawn of the Dead," Fun for fans of the genre.
","The original is (or was) my favourite zombie film, and since remakes most of the time are dead on arrival, I was pleasantly surprised when I saw this one.It doesn't have the same depth as Romero's film (a consumer society gone very wrong, the fantasy of having a whole shopping mall to your self turning into a nightmare), but it's fast paced, gory fun that's very entertaining. It also has the benefit of having better actors - there are no slackers in this one. The camera work, and editing is fast and slick, but not nausiating as it often can be. The pacing is perfect, and there are no dull moments.In style, the film bears close resemblance to 28 Days Later, but I prefer the less moody feeling of Dawn. The film was much bloodier than I expected, and I'm glad they didn't chicken out and toned down the violence (after all, it is a horror film). My biggest problem with the film is actually that I like the slow moving zombies better than the running ones that seems to be the standard today.All in all, a remake that manages to top the original.",Null,0,0,4 July 2004
Shaun of the Dead," Weird - but a good kind of weird
","A truly weird mix of zombie film and comedy that works mainly thanks to its funny parts. They are almost always excellent (especially the really bizarre stuff), whereas the more conventional slasher bits in the film's final third isn't all that good.The film looks gorgeous and the editing and music are brilliant. The same goes for the acting. There's also great pleasure to be had in seeing or hearing all the little things happening in the background throughout the film.Overall, a wildly uneven film that's still well worth checking out.

Bloody Sunday," Fact or fiction? A good film, all the same...
","As I really don't know anything about the events depicted in this film, I can't say whether it's a realistic or biased account of what happened. As 'just' a film, I found it to be very good.The documentary style of shooting it works most of the time (the constant fade ins/outs really bothered me though), and the film builds up tension and keeps you watching. The acting is also good. Nesbitt skillfully manages to switch moods depending on who he is talking to, all with remarkable ease. Also, kudos to the actor portraying the commander (or whatever you call it) of the British paras. He doesn't seem to be acting at all, it's like you're really watching a documentary when he is on screen.Towards the end, the film does tend to skip realism a bit, as it seems to side with the demonstrators a tad too much, while showing off all English soldiers as cold blooded killers. On the whole though, a very watchable film. [8/10]",Null,16,31,22 October 2004
Spider-Man 2," The unbearable misery of being Spider-Man
","Nope. This one didn't do it for me either. I found the first Spider-Man to be pretty bad, and the sequel fails to improve.Fans of Spider-Man comics are sure to get their kicks from seeing their hero swing across the screen, but for the rest of us there's only the film itself. What's lacking in both films is the sense of any real danger. There's simply no antagonist for Spidey to fight. The first film had the Green Goblin who basically was blowing up business partners (naughty of course, but hardly very exciting), and in the second film there's Doc Ock ('possessed' by his robotic arms - how stupid is that by the way?) who's demonic plan consist of... finishing his failed experiment (which could blow up half of New York, but that's not why he does it). I'm not saying that you need some Bond criminal who wants to take over the world, but someone a bit more menacing would have been nice.Since Doc Ock stays in his laboratory for most of the film, Spider-Man has to spend his time doing something else. Namely fighting his inner feelings whether or not to continue being Spider-Man. To illustrate this conflict, we get 90 minutes of Peter Parker/Spider-Man going through hell. He's broke, he hasn't got a girlfriend, Mary Jane is marrying some astronaut, his aunt is poor and has to move, his best friend slaps him, he falls off building, falls in the street, gets pushed around etc. This isn't fun for him, and it's not much fun to watch either. There are times and places for existential drama, but I'm not sure this movie is one of them. Realising this, Raimi lets loose a final 30 minutes of action scenes making everything that happened before seem completely redundant.Overall, the script leaves a lot to be desired. It's mostly filled with silly teenage angst, but there are also some pretty gaping plot holes and stupid dialogue. Nothing is implied or subtle, everything is clearly pointed out and explained (except those plot holes of course). Every scene with aunt May made me cringe, and they've copied the vomit inducing scene on the bridge from the first film, only placed it on board a train and made it about ten times worse.I can't complain about the actors, they do what they can with what they're given. Generally though, these characters leaves me pretty cold. I simply don't care about whiny Parker and his girl trouble.The effects are better this time around, especially Doc Ock's mechanical arms, but at times it still feels very much like cartoons. The action scenes are nothing new or special (a CGI character fighting another CGI character in a CGI environment has been to death by now - how about some real people for once?). Also, I don't get Spider-Man's powers. He can get cut with a knife and bleed, but he can fall of tall buildings without getting a scratch on him? On the whole Spider-Man 2 is equal to its predecessor. A bit better looking, but exceedingly long and tedious. And more than once you get the feeling that it only functions as an introduction to the inevitable Spider-Man 3... [3/10]",Null,1,2,23 November 2004
Blade," Anaemic
","Half man, half vampire Blade (aka Wesley Snipes) is out to kill off vampires in general, and Stephen Dorff's brat-pack-vampire bad guy in particular. The latter having a nasty scheme where he's intends to take over the world (or something).The film starts off, and continues, in quite a violent fashion. It's definitely not PG-13 stuff either, but surprisingly hardcore action. In a sense, it's more gory and violent than the more 'unreal' (but in my opinion, better) sequel Blade 2. For the first half or so, things happen at a steady pace with both nice action scenes and cool characters - but then things start to fall apart.Gradually, the plot gets increasingly stupid, and the proceedings come to a screeching halt. Not that there has to be constant fighting and blood flying around, but the way too long and talky conclusion of the film was pretty uninteresting. I just couldn't give a damn about what happened anymore. The bleak gritty look that worked so well in the first half suddenly just feels gray and boring.Some editing to tighten the film and keep up the pace from the opening would have made it so much better. As would a decision to forget about dodgy CG-characters for the end battle in favour of some man to man (or as the case may be - vampire to vampire) battle that doesn't leave one character fighting a blue screen.

The Great Dictator," Not that great
","I'm not exactly a Chaplin fan, and perhaps that's part of why I didn't find The Great Dictator to be that good.The film feels too long to begin with. It's not a good thing when you sort of drift in and out of the film, suddenly realising that you weren't paying attention, and also realising that you didn't really miss anything. This almost always happened when the barber was on screen, rather than dictator Hynkel. I really didn't care for the melodramatic stuff, which is too much on the sappy side for my taste.The real joy of watching this movie comes from the crazed antics of Adenoid Hynkel. Things pick up pace every time he appears and Chaplin's satire take on Hitler is really good. In his scenes, the film lives up to its classic stature.The film feels very well made for its time, so I have no problem there either. The famous ending speech by Chaplin ruins a lot, though. It's all done with the best of intentions, but today it feels very naive and doesn't fit in with the rest of the movie. It's like Chaplin just ends the film with a propaganda speech, rather than to bring closure to the story. A more subtle approach towards getting out his message would have been much better.

Constantine," The Matrixorcist
","Demon fighter John Constantine, who literally has been to hell and back, battles it out against various creatures of the night in an effort to 'buy' his way into heaven. In Constantine he helps a cop investigate her twin sister's suicide. This puts them in the middle of the battle between good and evil.It's not easy to say so much about the plot, there isn't that much of it to begin with. Based upon a comic book, it suffers from an overload of exposition regarding characters and events. It never really evolves from being an introduction to a full fledged feature film. Still, I couldn't help liking it anyway.The film looks great, for starters. It's dark and moody, the settings are pretty much stripped down to the bare necessities, and ...well, I kind of like that. The camera work gives the film an edge that works very well and makes it interesting to watch. Style over substance can be quite disastrous, but here it works just fine.The acting is OK, I guess. Keanu is very uneven, though. Sometimes he really seems to be struggling, but from time to time, he's actually very good. I found Constantine's character pretty interesting, with a not always likable persona. I definitely wouldn't mind seeing more of him and the world he lives in. Of course, it would be nice if they could focus more on the script now that all the introductions are out of the way. Constantine is no masterpiece, but it's still fun if you're into this sort of thing. [6/10]",6,1,7,5 March 2005
Lost in Translation," Slow but rewarding.
","Is Lost in Translation a classic? No. Is it a slow, boring film about nothing at all? Definitely not. What we have here is a beautifully crafted film, that perfectly captures the theme of being lost.Murray and Johanson are two lonely, unhappy people, whose despair is perfectly symbolized by having them walking around Tokyo, feeling completely out of place. Lonely bars, dead quiet bathrooms, bad relationships, and a language they don't understand (and neither does the viewer as it isn't subtitled). Obviously, this isn't everyone's cup of tea, but for those who cannot see the greatness of brain dead action films like Armageddon or The Mummy, it sure is a welcome break.The acting is great, there's a nice dose of humor, and the photography, editing, and music works together like magic. If you like this film, it might be worth checking out some other similarly themed films like: You Can Count On Me, Happiness, Rushmore, and The Royal Tenenbaums.Lost in Translation (great title, by the way) may be slow moving, but it isn't dull.

Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," More of the same (and not in a good way)
","After the disappointing Phantom Menace, people seem to be more enthusiastic about this one. I, however, think it's just more of the same that made ep. 1 so bad.The incessant overuse of CGI makes the film look like a video game, which isn't very much fun if you cannot control what's going on yourself. The characters are still boring, and the acting and dialogue feels stilted and forced.Is AOTC a better film than Menace? Well, perhaps - had I seen this one first I would probably have thought so. But as it is now I was so bored of seeing the same thing again, that I considered not finishing the film. As for episode 3 - Lucas is going to have to put on a really spectacular show if he wants to redeem himself (though it seems painfully clear that he wont be able to pull that off).

The Italian Job," Nearly pulls it off
","After a successful theft of 35 million dollars in gold, Wahlberg's team is betrayed by one of their own, who tries to kill them and take the gold for himself. They must then try and steal the gold back and get revenge.The Italian Job (haven't seen the original) is a slick, and entertaining action comedy. Of course, it's not so much of a thinking man's movie, but pure popcorn entertainment. Thankfully it's not quite as dumb as most of those films are. There are little things throughout the film that gives a little bit of extra spice.The cast is good, having fun with their likable, albeit rather clichéd, characters. The biggest dud, however, is Wahlberg who simply can't bring any life or interesting features to the screen. A more charismatic lead would have been better.At two hours, the film is a bit too long. Especially the middle part that drags on for some time without really getting anywhere. Of course, the main reason for this film being made is the car chases (or blatant product placement). If you're really in to cars doing impossible stuff at high speeds, then you'll probably like it more than me (car chases are one of the most boring things you can put in a film), although these scenes are a bit less annoying than usual.The film looks great and technically there's not much to complain of. The biggest problem comes towards the end, when all that better-than-average writing is ditched in favour of stupid action and gaping plot holes. This happens in so many films that I'm starting to wonder if there's some secret organization out there, stealing the final reels of big budget films and messing them up on purpose... Anyway, it's a decent film that could have been better, so give it a try if you want. [5/10]",5,0,1,19 February 2005
The Matrix Revolutions," Nothing worth seeing...
","The downward spiral from Reloaded continues in this dreary conclusion to the Matrix trilogy. In short, the biggest problem is that it shouldn't have been more than one film. The original brought new exciting visual effects, and a story that had some interesting points. Also, the blend of sci-fi, action, and a noir-ish visual look, oozed of COOL.The sequels are just boring, and feel forced to begin with, as the first film pretty much showed everything you wanted to see, and managed a satisfying ending. Reloaded and Revolutions tries to expand on the mythology, and philosophy of the original resulting in a very heavy handed exposition of talky Oracles and Architects. It was much better just hearing about Zion, than seeing that it was basically a big cave where dreary zombies in a sort-of-Star-Trek counsel had endless discussions about if/why/where they would send ships. Suddenly, the audience was supposed to care about new characters (who does nothing more than look miserable) instead of following the heroes from the first Matrix (in this one Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus are mere supporting characters).
Revolutions was hyped for having an awesome battle in Zion as well as one final showdown between Neo and Agent Smith - but both these 'highlights' are just run-of-the-mill CGI frenzys, that cannot stand up to any of the action scenes in the first film. The Wachowskis' seem to have been blinded by their own excellence, and the thirst for making huge sums of money. In the process, they've forgotten what made the first Matrix so great. Like the latest Star Wars films, Reloaded and Revolutions fail to bring anything new onto the screen. The actors don't look like they're having any fun, and neither had I. Parts two and three of this trilogy are simply best forgotten.",1,2,3,19 August 2004
The Hills Have Eyes," The Hills Have Two Stars
","OK, I thought the first half of the movie was quite good: atmospheric, building up tension, decent acting, and solid production values. Then comes the cannibal/mutant attack, and every sane thought goes out the window.From the halfway mark, the characters impressively enough have the skill to make the wrong choice at every possible moment. I guess you could let it slip by if it happened once, but when it happens about fifteen times, then there's no way back on track: Someone killed the dog? Better not tell anyone. Creepy people sneaking around the trailer? Let's ditch it and go watch that fire over there. Your sister screaming in the trailer? Let's head out in the opposite direction. Finally got the upper hand on a crazy cannibal mutant that is kicking your ass? Better run off to the bathroom, so he can gather himself again. Got the drop on a mutant who's eating your mother? Run away, and shoot blindly while running. And so on, and so on ...Also, the makeup on the mutants was definitely sub-par, and kind of takes you out of the movie when it's supposed to scare you. There's plenty of blood, but the constant sharp-object-in-the-head thing does tend to get tiresome after a while. In the end, the movie feels like some R-rated Lassie movie, because let's face it - the damn dog is the real hero of the movie.",2,1,3,8 June 2006
"I, Robot"," Bad robot, bad!
","I, Robot is not a very good film. It's actually quite bad. The plot is almost non-existent, basically it's just Will Smith warning people that the robots are up to no good, but nobody believes him. Instead of caring about the story, you have time to think about all the things that are bad:Smith's character detective Spooner (that name is just too stupid) lacks sympathetic features. I cannot quite put my finger on it, but something about him made him seem like an a**hole. And he wears a real ugly hat. Smith's mix of playing tough guy and trying to be funny just doesn't cut it, it gets weird. The characters are completely uninteresting, except for the robot Sonny who seems more alive than everyone else put together. The blatant product placement, or rather full out ads (Smith's shoes and car gets more screen time than the supporting cast). The action scenes feel mostly over-ambitious - sometimes less is more.The film's only redeeming feature is the excellent effects work on the robots. They blend in perfectly with the surroundings and you don't think of them as distracting CGI. On the whole, though, a disappointment. [2/10]",Null,2,4,19 September 2004
Van Helsing," As Dracula puts it: 'I have no heart!' SPOILERS!!!
","I guess most things about this film already have been said, but... holy crap, it was so bad.Stephen Sommers' films just get worse and worse. They're all more or less bad, but for each film he's cranked up the stupid level a notch. Van Helsing is so devoid of plot and characterisation - and filled with cheesy CGI and dumb, dumb, dumb action scenes - that it will give you a headache.Sommers obviously feels like a kid in a candy store when he can pick and choose from old monster films and make his own version of them. But why cannot anyone at least stop him from writing scripts? Try to convince him, bribe him, lock him up and throw away the key - but don't give him millions of dollars and complete control ever again! He may love these monsters, but he is torturing them (and the audience). He wants to be like Frankenstein and bring life to the monsters, but he is just one of the villagers trying to burn down the castle.What's missing in Van Helsing is heart. Underneath the heavily animated, glossy surface, Van Helsing is as dead as Dracula. Do we get to know these characters? No. They're just puppets, controlled by Sommers, but ultimately still only inanimate objects, lost among computer animated sets and sceneries. They lack purpose, other than to stumble along into another fight, another plunge down an abyss, another pointless discussion. All accompanied by thunderstorms and heavy rain.Sommers should be told that less IS more - as Hyde, Frankenstein, werewolves, vampires, and hapless heroes swing from yet another rope, chain, cable, or whatever is closest at hand. Everything that happens doesn't happen for a reason, other than that it leads to more maniacal mayhem. There is no logic to anything (Dracula can only be killed by a werewolf, so naturally he often uses them for his dirty work, but keeps the precious anti-dote in a container filled with acid inside a room - opened and locked from the outside - in his castle, which is accessed via a map, that's really a mirror, that's really a portal to another world).When did actors suddenly become such a nuisance, that it's better to have them replaced by goofy looking cartoons every time they have to perform a more challenging task than uttering a line in a dodgy accent? Why must film studios defend bad films by saying that they're just supposed to be distracting fun, as if that would be an excuse for the lack of any quality whatsoever? How long will the audience put up with over-priced, over-hyped, and over-everything films?Van Helsing isn't alive. It is very dead. Very dead. [0/10]",Null,0,1,10 October 2004
Spider-Man," I don't like spiders
","I know that audiences and critics alike loved this film, but it just didn't do it for me. It starts out good enough and has a nice thing going up until Maguire actually starts being Spider-man.As soon as he gets into those tights, the film plummets. Instead of interesting characters, we get poor CGI (Spider-man looks very much like a cartoon, which doesn't cut it in a live action version), a wafer thin plot, and a villain that's completely wasted. Why put an ugly expressionless mask over such a charismatic face like that of Willem Dafoe? (By the by, it looks like they decided to use the same mask for Dr. Doom in the upcoming Fantastic-Four film.) And the 'you mess with one of us, you mess with all of us' ending was nothing short of vomit inducing. In short, a disappointment that doesn't live up to its reputation.

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Strike three
","The third of the Potter films is, by far, the visually most impressive one. The not-so-great effects from previous films are all gone, and replaced by some top notch work. Also, the overall look and feel of the film is darker and more interesting than before. That said, there are still huge problems.The plot is still virtually the same as the other two: Potter at home, mean foster family, some magic, meet up with Ron's family and off to school, a couple of new teachers, some new mysterious danger, nobody telling Potter anything, evil Malfoy brat bullying people, more talk about Harry's parents, Quidditch, and some incomprehensible talk leading up to yet another anti-climax. As before, it seems vital to have read the novels if you're going to get to grips with what's happening on screen.The acting is a bit better in this outing, but it's still far from perfect. And, the script is pretty messy, making little or no sense, and with some annoying things as well (Potter's fainting grows tiresome real fast). Now that they've got the film to look good, I'm just waiting for someone that dares to really adapt the book for the screen, making a 'real' film out of it, rather than just an illustrated version of the book aimed squarely at the die-hard fans.

Spirited Away," Half of a great film
","A truly bizarre film (whose English title, Spirited Away, perfectly sums up the film) about a little girls adventures in a bath house for gods and demons. There isn't much in the way of plot, but it sure makes for some interesting viewing.It really feels like stepping into someone's dreams (or rather, nightmares). The film had a kind of warped sense of humour that I really enjoyed. Sadly, it also has some elements that left me completely in the dark. If this is due to the fact that I'm not used to this kind of films and mythology, or if things just get lost in translation, I'm not sure. But the first hour is really good, while the second one drags on forever and loses much of the charm of the earlier bits.The animation takes a little time getting used to. At first, I thought it looked pretty crappy (growing up with Disney and 3D-animation will do that to you), but after a while I could thoroughly enjoy the movie. The animation on the film's heroine Chihrio is especially amazing. All in all, I wasn't blown away by it, but it was still much more entertaining than expected. [6/10]",6,2,17,19 December 2004
Resident Evil," Game over
","A virus that turns people into zombies is released inside a secret research facility. A couple of expert (I'll use the term lightly) soldiers are sent in to retrieve... something... I can't remember what it was, but I'm sure it isn't very important. Along with them are two amnesiacs and some other guy. Once inside, they have a limited time to get out again. Unfortunately, the dead have risen and zombie bashing ensues.You can't expect too much of a film based on a video game, but all the same - Resident Evil feels pretty sloppy. It has got a low budget feel to it, just witness the sparse settings, dodgy effects, and amateur make up. There isn't much in the way of character development either, so it's not easy to give a damn what happens to them. Also, it's not good when there are numerous plot holes in a film with little plot to begin with.There is a distinct lack of action as well. It takes close to half the film before any zombies show up, and even then it's just some erratic shooting accompanied by too fast editing and deafening rock music. There's not a lot of gore and blood either, which isn't good considering that it's a zombie film after all.It's not the worse film ever made - the premise is quite good, but wasted - but it resembles too many other films, and fails to show anything new or even remotely exciting. Milla Jovovich does her best with what little she's given, but she deserved better. Obviously, director and screenwriter Anderson doesn't have what it takes to put together even a half decent video-game film. There are worse films out there, but that doesn't mean that there's any reason to see this one. [1/10]",1,3,8,20 March 2005
City of God," Kids in the Hood
","To sum it up in one word: overrated.Let's face it, the story isn't anything new (I know most things have been done before, but still). There's no shortage of films depicting the lives of gangsters from their slow steady rise, to that inescapable fall. What's new here is the fact that we're dealing with kids. It certainly is a different take on a familiar plot, but otherwise there are no surprises. For most of the film, it's various gang members shooting each other when they're not busy doing robberies and drugs.One of the arguments for this film being a classic is that the actors are amateurs and that they are 'real'. OK, if that's what they want to show - do a documentary about them instead of trying to gloss it up with fancy visuals and editing. The latter has also been praised to great extent. My question is: why? There's nothing here that isn't in every other film these days, and certainly nothing that warrants that extra high rating. It only detracts from the story, making the characters all the less believable.It seems like the subject matter (i.e. the horrible conditions under which these kids live - and the fact that it's foreign) has influenced viewers into thinking that the film is somehow better than it actually is. It's really nothing more than a typical genre movie. What's best about the film, and not often mentioned, are some very entertaining humorous scenes that you'd not expect to find in a film like this.

Hellboy," Close, but no cigar.
","I haven't read the comics on which the film is based, but what I had seen from it looked pretty interesting. Unfortunately, the look of the film is also what is best. The look and feel of it is really like a comic with nice sets, colors, and cinematography.I also really liked the characters - how can you go wrong with a wise cracking devil, a psychic fish (where did he go for the last half of the film?), and a deadish, blade swinging Nazi assassin - but I still don't know as much about them as I'd liked to. Although the film is close to two hours, you never get to know the characters enough. Like the Harry Potter films, it feels like you have to read the source material in order to understand everything that's going on.Even more devastating is that there's no plot either. People show up and disappear without explanation, and nothing much happens (except for a couple of pretty uninspired action scenes). When something does happen, it's often marred by major plot holes that doesn't make sense.Overall, it's barely worth the watch. If they make a sequel I hope that they allow the audience to get to know the characters better, and write a script that, at least, includes a clearly defined mission and bad guy. After all, there is some potential here. I give it 4/10.",Null,0,0,4 July 2004
The Incredibles," Adult entertainment
","An animated film that's decidedly not just for kids. In fact, kids (or adults who just want to see fart jokes and explosions) will probably find this film to be pretty slow and boring. Which, of course, it isn't.The Incredibles is really a super hero/Bond tribute that deals with some rather grown up themes. There's still plenty of humour, not the laugh-out-loud kind, but more of a low key, intelligent one. It even seems wrong to call it a comedy - think of it as an action adventure, only animated.Seeing this film, it's surprising that no one has dared to do an animated version on something like the Superman, Batman, or the Hulk (after all, the latest live action versions of those franchises really sucked). There's no need for photo realism, if the source material is a comic book anyway, why not go for it and make something different? The Incredbiles' plot may be far from just that, but it's a set-up that works pretty good. The voice work is, as always, fantastic. The fact that the characters have to adapt to their voices, and not the other way around, makes it seem more 'real'. It's a pain having to listen to re-dubbed versions with each country's own 'acting talents'. Subtitles is always a better alternative (unless your entire target audience is made up of kids).What really makes the Incredibles so fun to watch is the amazing/incredible/fantastic/brilliant/superb animation. The movie has a style of its own, and the sets and action sequences are simply mind-blowing. This is a film that absolutely should get a sequel. [8/10]",8,1,2,18 December 2004
School of Rock," School's out...
","Jack Black plays a rock musician who's been fired from his band, and needs money to pay the rent for the apartment he shares with an old buddy and the latter's girlfriend. After a slight case of mistaken identity, he end up temping as a teacher for a bunch of fifth graders at some posh school. needless to say, he then goes on to teach the kids to play rock and 'stick it to the Man'...First off, I really hated this film. The School of Rock may not be a lousy film as far as the technical aspects are concerned, it's just that the script and Jack Black are so incredibly awful that it hurts. The script brings nothing new to the screen, it's just the same old clichés you've already seen too many times before. You can predict exactly what's going to happen at any given moment. The characters are are bunch of one dimensional stereotypes without any connection with the real world. Sometimes a script like this will make you shrug your shoulders with indifference, but School of Rock seems so content with being unoriginal that it makes me sad.Then there's Jack Black - playing... Jack Black, I guess. It's becoming painfully obvious that his talents are limited to screaming and jumping around. Here, he manages to surpass all his previous efforts by doing this ALL the time. I think Black is nearly every frame of this film, and he's constantly staring, glaring, shouting, twitching, and doing all other sorts of funny (read: nauseating) stuff. The character he plays is supposed to be a lovable rouge, who teaches the kids about real life, but all I could see was an obnoxious, egocentric, mooching bastard that cared about nothing except himself.There is something wrong when the theme of a film is that you should fight against conformity by adopting another set of conformity - not to mention a film where our hero tells the kids who can't sing or play an instrument, that they can be groupies... way to go, Teach.

Hero," Going through the (slow) motions
","Ever felt the need to watch some guys and girls draped in sheets flying around in slow motion for 90 minutes? If the answer is yes, you might like this one.The film is praised for it's fantastic visuals and... come to think of it, that's all there is. There is absolutely nothing to care about in this film. There is zero back story - just a handful of people with swords staring at each other, flying, jumping, and philosophizing.The entire plot is made up of fight scenes, repeated in the absurd. I think that one of the fights was depicted three times. The setting and colors were different, but if you've seen one of the fights, you've seen them all. If you deleted all the repetitions and rolled the film at normal speed, it would probably be around 30 minutes long.As noted earlier, there are some pretty pictures - but you can get that from a travel brochure as well. The rest is just sleep inducing pretentious rubbish. See Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon instead. [1/10]",1,2,8,18 December 2004
Men in Black II," Crap is this year's black
","Uninspired film-making at its worst. A completely pointless sequel (or rather scene by scene remake) of the fun original.Watching the film, its painfully evident that none of the people involved seemed to have any fun. The script is a retread of the first film, only weaker. Do the audience really want to see the same story again? Last time the villain was a bug, this time it's a plant.The actors seem very bored (Rosario Dawson is the first person I've seen who can be described as a macguffin - she's got absolutely nothing to do in the entire film), the exception being Will Smith (reduced to doing slapstick) who appears to be so desperate to be having a good time that he overacts in the absurd.The editing sucks. and the effects look real cheap, its hard to believe that this film was made five years after the first one. Rick Baker's make-up work is brilliant from time to time, but still not as impressive as in the original.Moreover, there are other things that help sink the film: All of a sudden, almost everyone seems to be an alien. There are some huge plot (if there is such a thing) holes - like what happened to Knoxville in the last third of the film. There is also an air of racism throughout the film. I can't exactly say why, but it's a feeling I couldn't get rid of.There is one scene in the film that perfectly sums up the whole movie - Jones and Smith being flushed down a huge toilet (yes, it's that bad)...

Mulholland Drive," David goes to Hollywood
","If you like David Lynch - then this should be right up your alley. If you're like me and actually prefer some sort of coherent plot - look elsewhere.Twin Peaks (on TV, that is) was great. Undeniably weird, but it wasn't too weird, and the characters were fantastic. The rest of Lynch's work is, to me at least, an unpleasant mix of dream sequences, insane characters, overacting, and story lines that are going nowhere. Unfortunately, the same goes for Mulholland Dr. as well.Sure, the acting is fine, and it looks pretty good - but ultimately it's just a series of scenes not necessarily connected to each other. It just feels like a waste of time watching something that doesn't have any substance to it (it's not as bad as Lost Highway or Wild at Heart though).The fact that it originally was supposed to be a TV-show explains some of the gaps in the plot, although that doesn't make me like it more. It could have been interesting to see how it had turned out if it had been a show on TV, but in its present state it's not much fun to watch. [3/10]",Null,3,5,3 October 2004
Mission: Impossible II," Much, much worse than the first one.
","When I sat down to see M:I-2 my expectations weren't very high, the trailers I'd seen didn't seem to promise much. Still, after having seen the film I was quite baffled over how enormously bad this movie was. The first M:I film was criticised for having a plot that was very hard to follow and this one certainly is no improvement.From the very beginning I found myself wondering a lot of what, why, and who's until I just didn't care anymore. The villain's reason for doing what he is doing, (and just what that is), is never really properly explained. And while I felt that the first film at least was shot in an appealing way and added a dark touch to the secret agent story, M:I-2 is nothing but an orgy in effects and Woo's unimaginative, and ugly, slow motion action sequences. To call it action is probably an overstatement too as nothing really happens for the first hour of the film.Those who expect to see some cool gadgets will also be disappointed since the film just contains a multitude mask changes and the same kind of Cruise-hanging-from-a-rope scene from the first film. As for Cruise's character Ethan Hunt, he has gone from being an agent to a comic book action hero with superhuman powers. In general, the film and characters are just silly, and the ending looks more like it belongs in a Steven Seagal flick.As 1 is the lowest rating on IMDb, that's what I give it, but of course it's really too high.",Null,0,0,25 December 2000
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," A love story with a twist.
","Another (literal) trip into the human psyche, ESOTSM is a romantic drama/comedy that feels like a close companion to Being John Malkovich. Basically a love story with a twist (mind erasing) manages to score despite a plot-wise light script, but with a visually arresting style, and some wonderful performances.Gondry's directing gives the film a claustrophobic, angst-ridden look that together with the sterile settings, perfectly capture Carrey's feelings after being dumped by girlfriend Winslet. The film looks very low budget, but during the journey through Carrey's mind, Gondry employs some impressive, bizarre effects.Like You Can Count On Me (another film I can heartily recommend) Spotless relies heavily on great acting in depicting everyday life. Carrey does what he does best and skips his manic spasms in favour of a very low key performance as loser Joel. Winslet's Clementine, on the other hand, is a frantic, energetic girl, that's not always easy to like, but Winslet is simply stunning in the role, and pulls of another great performance. The rest of the cast is equally good and proves that you can come a long way with real actors.Overall, the film should appeal to those who liked Kaufman's previous efforts, and who are in the mood for a nice story about a love affair that's not necessarily always straight forward.",Null,0,1,19 August 2004
Saw," Bites off more than it can chew
","Two men wake up in room, chained to the wall, a dead guy on the floor with a tape recorder and a gun next to him. That's the premise of Saw, a film that thinks it's more clever than it is.Obviously having borrowed inspiration from Seven (and other similar films), Saw is very entertaining for half an hour or so. Once the characters are established and the rules of the game are set up, the film stops dead. The story goes nowhere, relying on an onslaught of flashbacks to tell the story, leaving time for the audience to reflect upon the gaping plot holes, bad acting, and inane dialogue.Screenwriter Whannell unwisely casts himself as one of the leads, and from time to time, it feels more like a comedy watching him, Elwes, and Glover chewing up the scenery while delivering bad, albeit unintentionally funny, lines. The plot is also so reliant on characters doing (or not doing) certain things at a specific time that it just ends up defying all common sense.At first sight, Saw also seems to be a very gory film, but upon closer inspection you realise that it isn't true. Things are implied, but never really shown. I'm not saying that I'm thirsting for blood, but it would at least have made the film a bit different, rather than a rehash of old ideas and tired clichés. A promising start followed by, more or less, crap does not make a good film. However, the final minute was bloody brilliant - I'll give them that. [3/10]",3,3,5,16 January 2005
Titanic," More than the sum of its parts.
","Back in 1997 when Titanic was released, I didn't think it would ever earn back the money it cost. After all, it was basically a love story/drama set on a ship that sunk. Not exactly a crowd pleaser like say, Armageddon. Then it came out, blasted to number one at the box office, and received 14 Oscar nominations - so I felt I had to see it. Coming out from the cinema I had that wow feeling. The one you get when you're so caught up in what's going on in the film, that you forget about everything else. Three hours just flies by. In all, I've seen it three times at the movies and another eight times on video, and I still get that sense of awe when I see it.Titanic was a phenomenon. It's the sort of ground breaking cinema experience that doesn't come around very often. Sure, the script isn't the most original ever - it's almost structured like a daytime soap (poor boy meets rich girl, engaged to evil guy). But another classic like Gone with the Wind isn't exactly the stuff of deep thoughts either. What they have in common is that they're grand spectacles that give the audience 100% entertainment in an expensive wrapping.Love, drama, disaster, action, and suspense - something for almost everyone. All done by extremely talented and gifted people, who could produce a visual experience on a scale rarely seen earlier. And in the middle of this two lead actors with a chemistry between them so crucial in order for the story to work beyond its one dimensional characters.The film may have suffered a pretty severe critical backlash (just look at the rating here on IMDB), but there's a reason why it made almost twice the amount of money at the box office as the number two film. It's pure and simple entertainment, that shows just how fun it can be to go to the movies. [10/10]",10,1,4,28 August 2004
The Matrix Reloaded," Re-diculous
","I recently watched Reloaded again, thinking that maybe I missed some important detail that would give the film a whole new meaning and expand upon the myth created in the original film - but no, it's still just a mess.The film itself is devoid of what made the Matrix so much fun to see. Everything feels synthetic and artificial. The sets feel very much like sets, and the over-use of CGI doesn't help either. It's amazing that the effects actually can get worse with a bigger budget and better technology. The actors look tired and bored, the exception being Weaving's deliciously deranged Agent Smith, who is the only one that manages to liven up things in between the endless talk, talk, talk ... Why they felt the need to throw in about a dozen new characters not to care about, is a mystery to me.The only redeeming features are the Burly Brawl (unrealistic, yet so spaced out I couldn't help liking it), and parts of the car chase sequence.After the initial viewing, I checked the Internet for theories as to what was going on. Of course, there were a thousand different takes on the film, all claiming to have found a message somewhere in it. Well, I still think it's a pile of rubbish. Reloaded still doesn't make an iota of sense considering everything that happened in the first Matrix. Whether the Wachowskis just got lucky with the first part of their 'trilogy', or if the studio wisely managed to delete the worst parts - I don't know. I do know that Reloaded is nothing more than a money-making machine, disguised as a movie with an important philosophical/religious message (read mumbo-jumbo).By cleverly throwing in a barrage of existential references, the WB's make sure that people can have their own theory about what is happening. There is no right or wrong, simply because there is no real story here. The only evident message is see the film, watch the nine animated shorts, play the video game, visit our website, bow down in front of Mammon, and then you'll know what it is all about.

Mystic River," Great book, OK film.
","Dennis Lehane's novel is a really great book, one of the best I've read. While reading it, I also realized that they would never be able to transfer this to the big screen intact. What we see in the film, although very faithful to the text, is just the surface of the story, and the characters.In order to get to know more about the relationship between the characters, as well as their motivation for the choices they make, the film would have to be twice as long and have a lot of voice over. The lack of the above makes a great book an OK film.As far as the film goes, it's pretty solid overall. The acting is good, but nothing fantastic. There are some exceptions, though. The unknown actors in the beginning of the film are just bad. It's like they just picked some people off the streets and gave them some lines to read. And then there's Tim Robbins. He has (probably) the toughest role to play, but he cannot pull it off. He's going for a subtle, almost underplayed performance, but somehow manages to overplay it instead, absolutely not Oscar material. The direction isn't bad, but it's not very exciting either. The film looks great, as they've really managed to give it the same kind of bleakness as in the book. Generally, it's good drama/ thriller with an extraordinary cast, that you wish you could have got more out of. I probably would have liked the film better if I hadn't read the book already.",Null,0,0,11 June 2004
War of the Worlds," Spielberg botches yet another ending...
","The story is really simple - aliens attack earth out of nowhere and without warning. Divorcée Cruise has to take responsibility for his two kids and try and take them to safety, wherever that might be. What follows is both a journey across a devastated and chaotic country, as well as Cruise's realisation that he has to become the the father he never really was.The first two thirds of War of the Worlds are simply brilliant and, in my opinion, flawless. It's Spielberg at his very best: taught, well paced, technically perfect, funny, exciting, and horrifying all at once. Like Minority Report, this film is definitely on the dark side - not necessarily a big crowd pleasing summer blockbuster. For comparison, Independence Day also dealt with an alien invasion and the destruction of large parts of the worlds's urban areas, but it was always more about effects and spectacle. Cruise is no wise cracking hero (at least not to begin with), just a man who's really in way over his head and trying to survive.Unfortunately, the film has a last third as well. As soon as Tim Robbins' character steps into the action, the movie starts to lose focus. Instead of keeping up the relentless pace it almost grinds to a screeching halt. It's not completely disastrous (it features my favourite scene in the whole film), but compared to what came before you sort of start looking at the watch. Acting-wise, Robbins is absolutely the film's weak link. He isn't quite as awful as he was in Mystic River, but he certainly isn't good either, which doesn't help the proceedings.With about twenty minutes to go, the film also falls into the trap of having Cruise become the hero, and the tension is definitely gone. Overall, the last part of the film feels rushed and at times almost sloppy.The ending also has problems. It's true to the book, but it feels a bit anti-climactic as it more or less just ends. A bit more work than having Morgan Freeman do some voice-over work at the end would have helped. Even more damaging is the fact that the sappy Spielberg suddenly takes over. A lot of Spielberg's films suffer from endings that simply are too long, too sentimental, or too 'Hollywood', even if the rest of the film isn't (e.g. Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, A.I., Catch Me If You Can, Minority Report). I just don't buy the ending to War of the Worlds as it is so diametrically different to what happens before.In summary, War of the Worlds is very watchable, and for the most part brilliant. The problem is that the weak parts are very weak. Some more work on the script and tighter editing, and this could have been a true classic instead of 'just' a very good film.

Love Actually," I didn't hate Love Actually, but I didn't love it either...
","Obviously, Richard Curtis set out to make the ultimate love story film of all time. Love Actually contains no less than nine (I think) different stories intertwined a la Short Cuts. They try to cover virtually every aspect of love there is (however, not a gay one - I guess that wasn't PC enough for a Christmas time feel-good movie).Equally obvious is that there are way too many stories. The pacing is erratic, some subplots getting a lot of screen time, while others seem to have been forgotten about. Just witness how Laura Linney just disappears towards the end of the film. The end result would have been much better if they had just cut away half of the plots and fleshed out the remaining ones. In my opinion they should have kept the ones with Rickman - Thompson, Firth - Portugese maid, Linney, and (possibly) Keira Knightley.Too many of the others are simply completely pointless. For example, Marshall's trip to the US to sleep with American women doesn't go anywhere. The only thing it's there for is to show of some 'hot' young actresses like Elisha Cuthbert, Shannon Elizabeth, and Denise Richards. Throughout the film, there's also an obsession with showing women in (or preferably out of) their underwear. There's no reason for it, and it just feels really tacky.The filmmakers don't want to risk that the audience actually has to think for themselves - so at every key moment in the film there's usually a song or a piece of music that lets you know exactly how you're supposed to feel. I know that everybody does it, but here it's just too obvious and clumsy. This can also be said about the choice of setting the film around Christmas time, as if most of these stories weren't sappy enough...In conclusion, Love Actually is a decent film that could have been much better. Cramming in material enough for three films doesn't make it three times as good as one. There are some really great moments, but they're all to often lost among not so great ones. With a cast as great as this one, it must be tempting to use them as much as possible, but as it is now, most of them are sadly wasted. This is definitely a film where less would have been more.

To Kill a Mockingbird," It's a bird, it's a plane, it's... Superdad!
","This film may have been great once, but today it feels rather dated.Sure enough, the film looks and sounds great even by today's standards. It has a sort of fairy-tale feel to it, which is also pretty nice, but it's essentially a 1½ hour kids film with 30 minutes of courtroom drama oddly spliced in there. Therefore, I can't help but feel that the story and the way people act turns very naive at times (Little girl to angry lynch mob: Please, don't be mean! Angry lynch mob: Well... alright then.).And while the movie deals with racism, it does so with such stereotypes that it looses the edge. The blacks are humble good people (saved only by the grace of white super-dad Peck), and the most whites are a bunch of snarling rednecks. The kids are surprisingly good actors, and Dill may be one of the coolest kids I've seen on film, but after an hour of them running around playing, you grow tired of it. Peck (as the best, most caring, fantastic single parent in history) does one of those performances that you're supposed to really admire, but I think it's pretty stiff and stilted.Overall, it's good in parts, but it lacks that 'something special' that can turn it into a classic.

Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Sith is an anagram of...
","Well, at least it's slightly less awful than the previous two films, but that doesn't make it good. Many seem to think that Sith somehow finally delivers a 'real' Star Wars movie - to me it's pretty much just more of the same. The plot sets out to explain the rise of Darth Vader and the evil empire, but the three prequels barely amounts to one film of actual new and/or valuable information.The emperor's plan for taking over the universe and defeating the Jedi order seems a tad complicated, especially since the build up for the coup has been taking place for many, many years (mostly off screen) only to be carried out more or less by just saying to the senate: 'I think it's for the the best that I assume power of your planets.' (cue thunderous applauds)...Anakin's transformation into Vader is also completely wasted. He spends two films going around bitching and moaning, throwing in the odd subtle remark about how 'democracy maybe isn't always a good thing'. In Sith he changes sides in every new scene, of course there's no doubt as to which way he'll swing so the reason becomes all the more important. Unfortunately, it all comes down to his desire to possibly one day be able to save the life of his not-yet-dead girlfriend. It's just hard for me to see that he would turn into a cold hearted killer just because he's had some visions of his beloved (some actual chemistry between Christensen and Portman would have helped here) Padme, here reduced to retarded crying girl. Sorry, I just don't buy it.You can defend these films by claiming that they're made for kids, but... the first three films seemed to have worked for kids and adults alike, so why change that? The prequels have been lacking soul. They just keep throwing in stuff and characters from the old films for no other reason than that they were present in those (Anakin built C-3PO, why?). Moreover, it feels like a completely different universe; Jedis can do vertical jumps and drops like they're weightless, R2-D2 could barely roll forward in the earlier films - now he's flying and jumping around - of course, they conveniently erase the robots' memories (read, lazy writing) so maybe he forgot he could do all those films. This may seem like nitpicking, but there are so many lame things like this that I can't help focusing on them instead of the (albeit virtually non-existent) plot.Sure, there are more explosions and laser fights, but it lacks any sense of emotional involvement. Take the bad guys for example: the new films have them dropping in from time to time, but Maul, Dooku, and Grievous are just there - they don't have any back story and they're not very menacing either. They have been reduced to their light sabers - Maul had a double, Dooku's handle was bendable, and Grievous had four. Wow! Now that's some impressive character development... I mean FOUR light sabers! Genius... (sigh).I dare say that the new films have all been about showing off new visual effects that can make everything bigger and move faster. One of the truly few good things about Sith is that the effects actually look ten times better than they did in the two other prequels. Of course, they still can't hide the fact that the actors are just standing in front of a blank screen trying to interact with stuff that isn't there (like a decent script). The acting is downright bad, with the exception of McDiarmid who's quite good up until the point where he makes up for the restraint he's shown for two and a half films and start screaming and cackling like crazy... It's easy to blame the script or direction, but they don't even seem to care about their performance, which makes me equally uninterested.Sith actually has the only moment of these three most recent films that had some emotional impact on me. The literal backstabbing of the Jedi isn't exactly handled expertly, but it works. Ultimately, the prequel trilogy has a few possibly interesting themes to deal with, but Lucas seems unable to dig deeper into the mythology of his universe and settles for big booms and bright colours. And honestly, when talk first started about a trilogy of Darth Vader's birth, did you expect him to have a combined screen time of about two minutes? Like the Matrix sequels, episodes 1-3 is best forgotten as they actually manage to tarnish their originals. [2/10]",2,1,3,14 July 2005
Bruce Almighty," God awful
","Local-TV man Carrey thinks he's treated badly by everyone, and lashes out against his co-workers, girlfriend, and God. He just can's accept the fact that he's an absolute bastard living a pretty nice life. Enter God, who teaches him a lesson about life by letting Bruce (Carrey) temp for him while he's off on vacation. Hilarity ensues.Bruce Almighty is essentially a mix of previous Carrey films Liar, Liar and The Mask. If you've seen those two, you can pretty much guess what's coming. Most of the time, Almighty is a horribly bad film. Carrey's manic tantrums and crazy antics were never that funny to begin with, and by now it's been done to death.The film is divided up into three parts: An introduction where we get to know (and hate) Bruce, a middle part where Bruce has fun with his powers, and a third part, where Bruce learns the errors of his ways and becomes a better person. The beginning is bad, the middle has some fun bits, and the end is half an hour of excruciating torture.Instead of entertaining, the film raises some questions. Does anybody want to see this kind of sappy endings, where the protagonist gets a moral education in order to become a better human being? What made Aniston's character Grace (see what they did with her name there?) fall in love with Bruce in the first place? Why are the effects so cheap looking? How much money did Morgan Freeman get to sign on for this mess? It's doubtful that this film would have been made if Carrey hadn't starred in it. It's just not funny. On an ending note, and for future reference - any screenplay that includes such 'hilarious' catch phrases as 'B-E-A-utiful' or 'Good, gooood' should be burned. [2/10]",2,6,15,16 January 2005
Signs," More like crap circles...
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!!The Sixth Sense was very good, Unbrakeable reaked, and Signs is barely watchable. Conclusion: M. Night is a one hit wonder. He's used the same atmosphere in all three films but included some really odd ingredients in the latter two.These consist of the characters standing around gazing out into thin air and speaking... very... slowly... about... faith... God... and... other... philosophical... stuff... (exciting isn't it?). Moreover, the plot in Signs (if indeed there is such a thing) is so stupid and full of plot holes that it's ridiculous. Aliens who cannot open doors and evaporate in contact with water? Suspension of disbelief is one thing, but these creatures seem so stupid and without real motivation that it's hard to understand why they came to Earth to begin with.The story is a blend of sci-fi, drama, horror, and at times something resembling a spoof of similar movies. This is probably unintentional, but the film takes itself so seriously that it turns out silly. It doesn't help that all the actors seem drugged up on valium either.There are some good moments where the film actually is quite suspensful (the middle part of the film) but the beginning and (sort of) twist ending are downright laughable.

It's part standard thriller, who-dunnit mystery, slasher film, supernatural, and with (sort of) a twist ending. With a running time of just over 1Â½ hours there's no way that all this can work. Most of the characters are very one dimensional and there is no point in trying to look for clues and guess who the killer is, since the ending pretty much negates most of what seemingly was important to the plot and it all boils down to nothing.Identity is still worth a look, but in my opinion it's just an interesting failure.",Null,0,1,3 September 2003

A rather simple story - mutants must unite in order to fight off crazy general Stryker, who's out to kill them all - works excellent, and is all you need to hold the film together.Before I saw the original X-Men, I knew nothing of the characters. This is, however, not a problem in any of the two movies. I can totally buy the myriad of characters and the universe which they inhabit. And let's face it - there are a lot of characters. X2 has a huge number of participants and the real miracle is that everyone (even Halle Berry) works so good. I was never lost, but could easily follow what was happening on screen.This really is an ensemble piece, and everyone steps up to the challenge. The two 'blues', Nightcrawler and Mystique, rightly have a lot of screen time. The mix of veterans like the wonderful McKellen, and newcomers like Ashmore creates a nice dynamic to the film.The bigger budget has allowed for better and more effects that certainly are impressive. The opening attack on the White House is one of the best individual action sequences I've ever seen. Overall, the film looks fantastic and it has a nice dark tone to it. The two-hour-plus runtime whisks by fast, and if it wasn't for a slight lag in pace towards the end of the film I would have given it a ten. Bring on X3! [9/10]",9,0,0,11 January 2005
Windtalkers," Damn you...Joe Enders!
","A film that wants to be epic, but that ends up being either laughable or tedious. If you're going to make a film about the Navajo soldiers and their contribution during WW2, then maybe it could be a good idea to actually include them in the story line.As it is now, we get another over-the-top performance by Nic Cage as a constantly depressed soldier with a death wish (he's one hell of a soldier though - during each battle he alone manages to take out half of the enemy in a barrage of bullets and teeth grinding), who has to babysit an Navajo Indian. The latter's contribution to the film is to smile, say wise spiritual stuff, and occasionally turn in some coordinates over the radio.Windtalkers feels endlessly overlong and blends massive battle scenes (i.e. guys flying through the air in front of explosions in slow motion) with sequences where absolutely nothing happens. If it had been shorter it could have been fun just to laugh at it, but you cannot even do that...",Null,0,1,20 August 2004
Evil Dead II," Hail to the King, baby...
","Sequel/remake of the classic Evil Dead, this time focusing more on the humorous aspects of slicing and dicing people.Evil Dead 2 is obviously not meant to be taken seriously. It's a horror film, but not as much so as the original. What we have here is a bunch of guys having fun with effects and and a camera. It's all very tongue in cheek, and fortunately very entertaining.You don't care about continuity problems, goofs, or dodgy effects. There's an amateurish charm over the film that works just fine. It's nice to see that you can have a film with many faults without someone going back after-wards trying to cover up their mistakes and make it look better (Yes George Lucas, I'm talking to you.) The central thrust of this film is of course Bruce Campbell, who oozes of charisma as he picks up his chainsaw, ready to take on the undead. The rest of the cast are obviously just cannon fodder, but who cares? Evil Dead 2 is also interesting for its surreal tone. At times, it feels more like an art film than cheap horror. There are flaws, after all it really is a cheap horror flick, but the sheer enthusiasm and warped comedy that's gone in to this film makes up for much of it. [7/10]",7,0,1,6 February 2005
