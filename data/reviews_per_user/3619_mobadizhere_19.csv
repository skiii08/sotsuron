Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," A beautiful combination!
","Taking the story of Abraham Lincoln, then adding vampire killing into the mix, makes this film entertaining to the max! I love when films take some of the most mundane ideas, and add a sci-fi element to it, because this makes it more fun to watch, while also making it very original! Don't knock this movie until you watch it thoroughly.",9,0,2,10 September 2018
Zootopia," Surprisingly great story!
","I thought this movie was going to be some annoying furry movie. But it was much more than that, Zootopia is one of the greatest animated flicks to date. It's enjoyable, funny, and really smart. I enjoyed the main characters, and I even cared about them! I also really liked to premise itself, it's simple and easy to grip. Zootopia is one of Disney's best!",10,24,29,11 September 2018
Terminator Salvation," Sad excuse for a Terminator film
","This did not feel like a Terminator movie AT ALL. Just because John Conner is here, and someone else plays a robotic person, or how the REAL Terminator made a brief appearance at the end of the film, does not make this a Terminator movie. This film was absolutely useless for this franchise, and it was really boring. This film infuriated me physically, it sucks.",2,2,5,13 September 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," The best in the Thor series!
","Thor Ragnarok is far better than Thor 1 and 2, because this film is not dull in the slightest, whereas Thor 1 and 2 we're extremely boring. Having the Hulk really made my decision to see it in theaters, but at the same time, Watiti's direction in Ragnarok makes it worth while! This film is hilarious and fun, and is one of Marvel's best films!",10,3,6,10 September 2018
Ready Player One," Nostalgia driven and so much fun!
","I didn't expect much going into Ready Player One, I haven't read the book yet. But I was curious to see another Speilberg film. To be honest, it was absolutely amazing! Seeing the fight scenes, and the smart plot made this one of my best film experiences! The iron giant fighting Mecha Godzilla was awesome! Besides that, Ready Player One was worth it, and this'll be one for the books! Thank you Speilberg!!!",10,6,13,10 September 2018
Moana," Beautifully breath-taking!!
","Moana is just flat out perfect! Another Disney classic to add to your shelves, because Moana definitely takes the cake! The characters, story, animation, humor, all is amazingly used! This is actually based off of Hawaiian folklore, and I think it works as another Disney classic! Moana is worth the watch, so watch it!!",10,1,4,11 September 2018
Justice League," Way better than what the critics want you to think!
","Justice League is fun and worth the 2 hours. Though people do complain about how there is hardly any character development for flash, Aquaman, Cyborg and Steppenwolf, it's honestly not going to effect how you view this film. To me, Justice League is a set up for those individual films, and it tries to get you to like those characters. Steppenwolf I thought was a cool villain, one of the coolest in the DC universe. Still, Justice League is a fun ride, and you should absolutely pay for the ticket to this ride!",8,3,6,10 September 2018
The Matrix Revolutions," Such a let down...
","I absolutely loved Matrix and Matrix Reloaded, those were exciting and had potential, whereas Revolutions is really lifeless and pointless. I was honestly excited for this, after it ended I felt so offended because what I just watched. I wish this was made better, because honestly after watching the end scene in Reloaded, I was looking forward to the pay-off. This really let me down big time, I want my time back.",3,3,5,12 September 2018
Inside Out," A beacon!
","Inside Out is a charming, original story. A movie about the emotions of a 12 year old girl must be really hard to pull off, kudos to Pixar. Each and every decision reflects one emotion, one way or another. They said to have had psychologists help the writers with the plot, because they wanted to go the smart and thoughtful route. Everything about Inside Out was great, I adore this film.",10,4,9,11 September 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," MY MOST FAVORITE FILM
","I absolutely love this movie, it's something I have been craving to see ever since I was a little kid. Marvel shattered my expectations and to this day, it still makes me excited while sitting at the edge of my seat. Everything about this film is brilliant, there is no dull moment, and it'll keep you entertained through the entire running time!!",10,0,2,10 September 2018
Get Out," Exceptional and ground-breaking!
","Get Out is an instant classic! I had no idea what I was getting into when sitting down to watch this, but I was interested to see what Jordan Peele had in store! I love horror films that try not to focus on the scary aspects, rather they will focus on the overall ambiance of the film, setting up events that will happen later on, I also want to point out that the movie has it's fair share of humor and it really works! Get Out is amazingly made!",10,0,4,10 September 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Brilliant film!
","I've watched this movie only 3 times. It was never boring, nor terrible during each sitting. I'm not a huge star wars fan either, but in all honesty, I found this movie fun, hilarious, and exciting! I may not be a fan, but I still don't understand the hate towards the last Jedi. IDK if it contradicts previous film entries, or it doesn't stay true to the comics, I have no idea, no do I care. Star Wars: The Last Jedi is an excellent film, that I will never get tired of. Deal with it.",9,6,25,10 September 2018
Logan," X-Men on another level!
","Logan is one of the best X-Men films besides Deadpool! I didn't really like the old X-Men films, I thought they were boring, so I was afraid of what Logan was going to be. Logan shattered my expectations and made me so excited to watch the entire running time! Logan is another level of superhero movies, it makes me excited to see what the future of X-Men holds!",10,2,4,12 September 2018
The Happening," Stupidly enjoyable!
","The Happening is flawed, duh. But that doesn't mean it's not enjoyable. M Night Shyamalan's films are interesting sometimes, it's interesting how he thought this would be terrifying. It's not, but it's hilarious when it's suppose to be serious. That's the entertaining part about the Happening, it's thought provoking. It's still a joy to watch!",8,1,1,12 September 2018
Kong: Skull Island," The best Kong film!!
","Kong Skull Island is a huge treat, and much better than King Kong films before it! Very colorful for a film like this, this film I consider eye candy. It's fun from start to finish, and there is not a single dull moment, I admire the original ideas placed within the film! It works perfectly story-wise, ans it's really action-filled! Kong Skull Island is an adventurous film to watch anytime;",8,0,0,12 September 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," A huge disappointment.
","There is are so many things in this movie that anger me. One thing is how boring this film is, the other is why they chose Jesse Eisenberg to play Lex Luther, like really? There could've been so much entertainment with what they were working with, but decide to go the laziest route. I only give this 2 stars because of the action scenes, that is its only redeemable quality.",3,1,4,10 September 2018
Space Jam," Air Jordan Doc!
","The film that all of us enjoyed as a kid, and still enjoy many years later! Space Jam is an amazing ride for those who don't want to watch anything serious. It's a rare film with a cool premise that nobody should miss out on. It's no citizen Kane, but it's surely much more enjoyable and likable than Citizen Kane! Space Jam should be in everyones collection!",10,2,2,12 September 2018
Godzilla," Hardly any Godzilla...
","What's the point of a Godzilla movie if you can't even put Godzilla into it?? I don't get it, I feel like there's about 7 minutes of Godzilla in this obnoxiously boring flick. I'm sorely disappointed in the choice they made here, it's almost insulting. A huuuuuge missed opportunity here, but at least they can improve in the sequel. Hopefully...",2,1,2,10 September 2018
What We Do in the Shadows," Vampires meet documentary
","What a refreshing film! What we do in the shadows is one of the most original films in the last several years, I enjoyed everything about this movie, the characters were funny, the story is gripping, and the overall idea is just spectacular! This is one of those films that you don't have to give much thought to, you can just sit back and enjoy!",10,0,0,11 September 2018
