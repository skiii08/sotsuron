The Legend of Bagger Vance," Poignant film
","Call me crazy, but why is Jack Lemmon not credited in this movie? He lends about the only note of sweetness and truth in this film.  It is a lovely thing to see him at the end of this long movie, walking off into the sunset, dragging a bag of clubs towards the dunes.  I felt like they could have dedicated it to him  least.  The ending was all about him, I thought - I couldn't have cared less what Hardy Greeves thought by the end of this movie.  All I saw was Jack Lemmon talking about golf and life.  duh huh",Null,0,1,22 February 2003
