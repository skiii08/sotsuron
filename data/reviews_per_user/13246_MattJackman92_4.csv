Deepwater Horizon," A classic 'disaster' blockbuster
","Deepwater Horizon is very much like lots of other blockbusters, but it is enjoyable and worth a watch if you're not up for something too taxing. It helps that I really like Mark Wahlberg and Kurt Russell is great value.We all know the script, something bad is going to happen, but the film is well executed and the fact that is is based on a true story (that I didn't know the outcome of) adds to the tension. All the characters fill the necessary gaps; a few 'good' guys, a few 'bad' guys, lots of brave guys and a worrying partner at home for good measure. They are all done well though and you soon find yourself invested in the outcome.6.9/10 - Expect some witty dialogue, a few tense moments and lots of big action sequences. Oh and don't forget the popcorn.",7,0,0,13 May 2020
Ex Machina," An intelligent sci-fi film that will get you thinking
","I recently watched Ex Machina for the first time and spent most of the film thinking, 'I know that house!'. It's a hotel in Norway that I saw a programme on which sucked me out of the reality of the movie somewhat.Anyway, regardless of that, I enjoyed Ex Machina. It's a hard film to describe and certainly won't be for everyone. It moves slowly, making you question each characters real motivations. It's a 'proper' sci-fi film, focusing mainly on AI and consciousness, but ultimately it's about power, control and manipulation. It seems a simple premise, but is far more intelligent movie than the tagline. While watching, you always feel like each character is playing one another and something far more sinister is going on under the surface.The casting is spot on, Alicia Vikander is excellent as the humanoid android, but it's Oscar Isaacs beard that steals the show. The script is smart with real depth and the whole film is shot beautifully. The special effects are really amazing as well and easily hold up 6 years on. The major negative I have is around the ending. I won't give any spoilers, and while I liked the general 'twist', I thought the actual ending was fairly shoddy.7.4/10 - A tense, slow burning thinker that should hook you in.",7,0,1,22 May 2020
1917," A really solid war film
","First things first, I really enjoyed this movie. It was a proper, 'watch it in the cinema' war film. The way that is is filmed in one continuous shot brings both positive and negative aspects, but it certainly sucks you into the movie and doesn't let up. I thought the first 40 minutes or so were completely brilliant, comparable to other greats like Band of Brothers and Saving Private Ryan. The rest of the film was enjoyable, but there were many plot holes that took away from the reality somewhat.The cinematography is worth a special mention. It was right that it won the Oscar as it is absolutely incredible throughout. It feels like a lot of work went into the film and it certainly deserves to be watched at least once.All told, 1917 is an intense, well produced and ultimately enjoyable war film.",8,1,2,13 May 2020
Parasite," An excellent movie that you won't be able to stop thinking about
","Great movies often stay with me long after I watch them. Parasite is a great movie and one that I found myself thinking about over and over, days after I watched it in the cinema. For those that haven't seen it, it's very hard to describe what sort of movie this is. Part heist, part thriller, very 'Hitchcockian', it's incredibly tense and often very funny. It's amazing how invested you can be in a film with no clear 'good or bad guys', no one in this film is a hero.Parasite is laden with social commentary, some subtle and some not so! At times it walks the line between believable and unbelievable and will have you questioning every characters morales at one point or another. It is perfectly paced and wonderfully shot. I didn't love the very end, that's not to say I didn't get the message it was portraying, I just didn't think it was quite up to the standard of the rest of the film. I don't want to include any spoilers though and the beauty of this film is that everyone will draw their opinion.9.3/10 - I'm looking forward to watching it again sometime!",9,0,0,13 May 2020
