Skyfall," Tedious
","I went expecting to see a brilliant film after all the hype. Perhaps, if I had left after the opening sequence I would have been less disappointed. The next 2 hours seemed a lot longer and the film was far too laboured and lacked any real action. OK it's a Bond film so I wasn't expecting anything exceptional. There are far better films out there these days so that the song 'Nobody Does It Better' from a previous Bond film now seems to have been superseded. The best part was played by the Aston Martin from Goldfinger which stole the show.I know reviews are a personal thing and many people will disagree with my comments but this is a movie that I couldn't honestly recommend. Had it been at least 40 minutes less it could even have been enjoyable.",4,21,43,7 November 2012
The Hunger Games," Disappointing
","On the whole the film is fairly predictable and tends to be quite slow in parts. Having not read the books, certain scenes seem unexplained and don't fit in the storyline. The major thing that ruined it for me was the incessant shaky camera and panning shots in particular throughout the early part of the movie. Why do directors want us to have the impression that the story is being filmed by someone with a camcorder? When projected onto the big screen this is both irritating and annoying and personally I find it very off putting. Weren't steadicams beyond the budget because too much was spent on hairstyles and costumes? The movie generally seemed a bit disappointing given the hype leading up to its release. I would only recommend it to someone if there was nothing better to see on the day they decide to go to the cinema.Negative Points: 1. Shaky Camera and over use of panning. 2. Overly long build up to the 'games' part of the story. 3. Predictable and a version of In Time meets Logan's Run, Gladiator and Running Man. 4.Story not even logical, (why on earth would a young girl of about 10 be entered into a gladiator style tournament against a 20 year old man?) 5. Poor casting. 6. Bad ending (obviously Hollywood preparing for Hunger Games II). 7 It's 2 hours and 22 minutes long.Plus Points None that I can think of but it might encourage more people to read the book instead.",6,5,15,27 March 2012
Prometheus," In the Cinema No One Can Hear You Yawn
",After all the hype it was not totally unexpected that this would be a run-of-the-mill type of film. Anyone who says this is not like Alien must have a very short memory. Take this quiz:1. Who becomes infected by an Alien spore is it Ripley in Alien or Elizabeth in Prometheus?2. Which film has a double-crossing Android that turns good at the end - is it in Alien or Prometheus? 3.Which film's has the plot that there is the hidden reason for the voyage to find aliens for personal gain of a corporation -is it in Alien or Prometheus? 4. In which film is the female heroine the only human survivor at the end - is it in Alien or Prometheus? 5. Which film was directed brilliantly by Ridley Scott but falls flat on its face because it's boring and unoriginal -is it Alien or Prometheus?6. Why didn't they just call it Alien Origins?Answers - 1.Both 2.Both 3.Both 4.Both 5.Promethius. 6.It's a slick Hollywood marketing trick because if it had Alien in its title it wouldn't have attracted as many movie goers!Even the Alien from Alien appears at the end of Prometheus as the Alien.,3,12,25,1 June 2012
