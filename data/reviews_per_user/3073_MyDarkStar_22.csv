The Blair Witch Project," Hands down, the worst movie I have ever paid to see.
","So I'm standing in line the day 'Blair Witch Project' comes out with anticipation to see the horror movie that will be 'the next Exorcist'. I was excited, and filled with anticipation, because the previews were really interesting, and unlike anything I'd ever seen. I even bought into all the hype and visited the movie's web site before the movie, and read of the 'history' of the 'Blair Witch'. So, I was ready.The movie starts. I'm not scared. The characters get lost in the forest. I'm not scared. The characters whine into the camera about being lost in the forest. I'm not scared. The characters find weird figures constructed in the forest. I'm not scared. Snot runs down the girl's face. I'M STILL NOT SCARED !!!! What I am is VERY bored !!!!!This movie is total and utter junk !!! Did people actually think this movie was scary ? Or did they just get nauseated by the bobbing hand-held camera like myself. I challenge anybody to point out one single solitary scary scene in this movie. The only thing that kept me from walking out of this movie (and I have NEVER done that in my life) was the anticipation of some amazingly scary ending. After all, there was absolutely nothing scary that had happened so far in this terrible excuse of a movie. Unfortunately, that 'amazing scary ending' never came.I have two main regrets when it comes to this pathetic 'project' : 1) I dropped $7.50 (along with about 2 hours of my life) on it  ; 2) IMDB does not have a '0' rating available for movies, so I had to settle for a '1'. It doesn't even deserve that.I would write more terrible things about it, but that would be even more time I would be investing into this pathetic insult to human intelligence.Hands down, the worst movie I have ever paid to see.",4,0,2,4 December 2001
Alien 3," Terrible !
","Just like the summary says, this movie is terrible ! The plot, the cast, and the direction all make for a very boring and stale movie. Not to mention the special effects, which are particularly disapointing. This becomes very obvious during the scenes when the alien is chasing the prisoners through the hallways/tunnels. When you see the alien, it is a very obviously computer-generated animation. Also, because of the way the scene was shot, I believe the director (David Fincher 'Se7en', and 'Fight Club') tried to cover up these cheezy effects by only giving very brief glimpses of the alien. He also seems to be trying to compensate for the lack of alien content by showing a 'first person' view of the alien chasing prisoners...with the camera spinning and climbing the walls. It makes what could have been an exciting scene into an annoying and visually confusing scene.Very disapointing performances by Sigourney Weaver and Charles Dutton.'Alien Resurrection' (prt. 4) is better. This one should not have even been made. It really serves no purpose. I would recommend watching the first two, and if you still have a desire to see more of the 'Alien' movies (as you probably will because the first two are excellent movies), then watch 'Alien Resurrection' next. You will miss absolutely nothing by skipping this one.",2,299,314,2 December 2001
Ali," A complete miss
","This film just has so many things wrong with it starting from the very opening sequence. In that sequence we see Cassius Clay preparing for his upcoming title fight with Sonny Liston in Miami. While seeing him prepare, we see Liston destroying an opponent in the ring. We also see the hints of racial tension going on in southern USA, 1964. The entire sequence lasts approximately 8-10 minutes. It is long, drawn-out, and boring. It's the perfect opening sequence for this film.That's because that's exactly how this movie feels : long, drawn-out, and boring.How could someone make a film about Muhammad Ali's life & manage to make the film boring ?!?!? Here's some ways : have long (and unnecessarily drawn-out) scenes (ie : the dance scene where he meets his first wife), or simply have recreations of now-famous media scenes (the Cosell scenes ; the pre-fight scenes). I understand the need for these scenes, but I would rather watch the actual scenes than a recreations of them.By concentrating on such aspects of Ali's life, Michael Mann totally bypasses what I feel could have been more interesting aspects of Ali's life. For instance, I would have liked to see more of the conversation between the newly-named Ali & his father, as they argue on the significance of the 'Clay' name. That scene had the potential to be very revealing. I also would have liked to have seen more of Ali's first visit to Africa, when he went on his Muslim pilgrimage. Instead, the whole event is used as a way to say goodbye to Malcolm X in the film. To me, that whole part of the film could have been very significant. What did Ali see when he went on the pilgrimage ? How did it affect his life ? Did he recall any of Africa when he went back there to fight Foreman ? We'll never know from this film.I would like to have seen more scenes such as him and Joe Frazier in the car together. That was one of my favorite scenes in the movie. It gave me a chance to see more of something that is impossible for me to ever see : an actual private conversation between Ali & Frazier.But there are tons of other things that are left out of the film as well. For instance, after Ali loses to Frazier in the first fight, we don't really even get a chance to see how his first loss as a professional affects his life. This is Muhammad Ali ! How did it feel to him to lose for the first time in his life ? Eventhough Ali played it off in the media as if it didn't affect him, did it in reality ? We'll never know from this film.The pacing of the film was just terrible. As I said, the opening sequence was long, drawn-out, and boring - and was the perfect opening sequence for this film. That's because it is a microcosm of the entire film.
You want bad pacing ? Try this : It actually took the entire first 55 minutes of this film for Cassius Clay to actually defeat Sonny Liston ! The opening sequence was all about him prepping for the fight, and it continued on to the weigh in of the fight, and the prefight comments etc. Then the fight itself was actually quite boring.More bad pacing : The film goes into the mid-sixties in a daze. It doesn't really start to show anything until finally Ali has his now-famous interview with Cosell. In this scene Cosell tells him behind the scene how the government is worried of black militant groups. That is when I felt the film MIGHT start to become more interesting. I looked at my watch to see that nearly 2 HOURS had passed in the film !Even MORE bad pacing : Ali gets his fight with Frazier. Ali loses the fight. But we as the audience never really get to see the true level of brutality of that fight. Between that and the 'Thrilla In Manila' (which was completely dropped from the film) we never really get a chance to see the true damage that those two fighters endured and delivered in their fights against one another. Instead, we see glimpses of the fight, Ali's knockdown, and a few other aspects. But really it just goes straight to the next scene after that, which has Ali & his crew watching Foreman defeat Frazier. (Like I said, no concern is given on how Ali's first loss affected his psyche). After that, it is straight to Ali-Foreman. Full 'Rumble In The Jungle' : Don King, Africa, Zaire etc etc.This was actually probably the best part of the film. The film takes on a more 'personal' look at Ali when he is prepping for the fight in Zaire. We get to see him connecting with the people. Again, I would have liked to see if he recalled anything from his previous visit to Africa - but that was not to be.Even worst, the Foreman fight managed to look boring ! Still, while the fight itself looked boring, I will admit that Michael Mann did a brilliant job with showing the now-famous Foreman knockout punches by Ali. The angles he uses are different with each punch, and it is a very good perspective.Other aspects of this film bothered me. For instance, was Ali REALLY on the phone with someone who was with MLK a second before he was assassinated ? That seems far-fetched to me.The only thing keeping this film from being a complete waste of film is Will Smith's performance here. Smith does indeed do everything that one can hope from someone who is portraying Ali. However, when you get right down to it, I think there are simply some people who it is more exciting to watch in a documentary or biography, rather than a Hollywood film production.So with that in mind, watch 'When We Were Kings' for anything you would want to know about 'The Rumble in the Jungle' or HBO's documentary on Ali-Frazier I. If you want a more interesting perspective on Ali's life in general, then watch ESPN's documentary on him - they didn't name him the Athlete of the Century for nothing.",7,1,1,17 November 2002
The Ring," Highly recommended
","I really didn't know what to expect when I went to see this film. I had been told that it was worth seeing, but nothing more. The two main reasons behind me wanting to see the movie were :1) It was around Halloween & I wanted to see a scary movie 2) I had seen Mulholland Dr. and really liked Naomi Watts' performanceWith that in mind, I expected the film to be decent.But the film was much more than decent. It was downright creepy. Very creepy. It's important to understand the difference between 'scary' and 'creepy'. Scary can be accomplished in a matter of seconds (someone jumping out from behind a wall with a knife). Creepy is something that takes a while to accomplish in a film. It takes a long time on the part of the director. It requires more attention and time on the part of the viewer. This film managed to accomplish creepy very well. It reminded me of the older generation of horror films, which managed to grab you in a way that was very psychological ('The Omen', 'Rosemary's Baby', and of course 'The Exorcist'). Those types of horror are the ones that always stick with me. They are the ones that endure. They are the ones that I inevitably have to watch for at least a little bit when I pass them on late night cable even though I have seen them countless times.creepy filmvery well madeone of the best films of 2002",9,0,0,12 January 2003
Memento," Brilliant
","I have seen alot of movies in my life. I've seen just about all of the 'classics' ('Citizen Kane', 'Gone With The Wind', 'Casablanca', 'Psycho', 'The Godfather', '2001 : A Space Odyssey' etc. etc.). I've seen almost every single movie that has ever gotten a Best Picture Oscar, along with a seemingly endless amount of obscure, but great, movies.This is my favorite movie of all time. I never thought I would see a movie that would come out this recently that would make me say that. This movie is truly, truly brilliant.When it comes to movies, I am very critical. I don't just automatically say 'Oh, I'd give that movie an eight or a nine'. For me, a really good movie gets about a seven. If it is exceptionally good, eight. I gave 'Memento' a perfect 10. This is a perfect movie.I won't bother going into explaining the plot - you can read that anywhere. What I wanted to stress here is that this movie is so perfectly timeless. It will never be outdated. Better yet, it will also never be boring to talk about. There is such a large amount of psychology involved in this movie that it is impossible to catch it all by watching it once. Also, for that matter, 'Memento' manages to take on different meanings when watched from the end to the beginning (which is proper chronological order). Suddenly lines that you didn't even think of as being significant are extremely crucial. So, to watch it once is to deny yourself of a large part of the movie.That's because 'Memento' isn't just a movie. It's a puzzle. You are required as the audience to fully realize what was just shown to you. You will be told about 80% of it by the movie (though not always in an obvious way) - but there will be some pieces that you will have to think about and realize afterwards. Of course this isn't the first movie to ever be like that, but 'Memento' stretches the limits.Also, every scene in 'Memento' is essential to the grand scheme of things. If any of the scenes were left out, it would leave a hole in the plot.I have heard the backwards storyline of 'Memento' described as 'gimmicky'. However, if you truly understand the main character's condition, you realize that it is the perfect way to take the audience into his mind.It's been almost a year since I first saw this movie, and I still find myself discovering tiny little facts that just make the movie even MORE interesting. When you have seen a movie about ten or fifteen times, rate it as being a '10', call it your 'favorite of all time', and can STILL discover new interesting things about it almost a year later, then it is safe to call that movie brilliant.",10,0,1,25 January 2002
L.A. Confidential," Brilliant movie
","This is truly a brilliant movie. The cast, the direction, the production, and the plots. That's right the plots - not plot. That is probably the most brilliant aspect of this movie : it has a gigantic plot that is composed of about 5 or 6 clever subplots - all of which contribute to the movie.In fact, this movie is so extensive and rich in plot that it probably could have been a mini-series if it wanted to - not that I would have preferred that. I am just saying that to show that it is very deep and never boring. There's alot of substance to all the characters. They all have their individual stories going on. They all have an agenda. Best of all, they all have a reason for being in this brilliant movie. You just have to watch the movie closely, and you start to realize how that character that was of no significance earlier in the plot suddenly became really important - maybe only for about 5 minutes, but that's long enough.The cast is perfect for this movie. Everyone plays their role flawlessly. The film noir production of it is like icing on the cake.Better than Chinatown. Much better.",10,0,1,9 November 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Salvaging the trilogy
","After being thoroughly disappointed with 'The Phantom Menace', I had come to the conclusion that Lucas was in a very undesirable position of having to deliver a knockout punch with Ep II - or possibly face a failed trilogy.So, I came into 'Attack of the Clones' with extremely high expectations - knowing Lucas had to deliver.After watching the movie, the very first thing that came into my mind was that this was easily the most complicated Star Wars plot of all of the Episodes - easily. If I had been 8 years old in the theater watching this film (as I was when viewing the original Star Wars), then I would definately had been confused during this movie - and I have NEVER been confused during a Star Wars movie. The plot is quite complex.However, that is a good thing. The plot needed to be complex when considering the nature of the storyline. This film is taking on the difficult task of explaining how the Star Wars universe went from being a democratic Republic to a hardened dictatorship-based Empire. That's not something you can explain without deep plots that might not make immediate sense. However, the more you think about the plot and the more you realize the level of political back-stabbing that is going on by Palpatine then you realize this is very well written script.Sure, there are awkward moments. The romance is clumsy & extremely awkward. But who cares ? I mean, is that REALLY what you go to see a Star Wars movie for ? The only reason the romance is so prominant here is because it carries such important consequences in the next trilogy (Luke & Leia).As far as the action scenes go, I just do not see how anyone could ask for more in a film. The visual effects are just overwhelming. Even two viewings of this film would not be sufficient in appreciating the effects. They are just that extensive.So, in the end when judging this movie you have to ask yourself : am I looking forward to Episode III ? I believe after seeing this film you will be, and therefore Lucas succeeded.",3,0,0,19 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Loyal and brilliant film adaptation
","Having read LOTR as a child, I was of course very interested to hear that it was in the works to be adapted onscreen. I began following the news about the production, following casting choices, and reading comments from Peter Jackson, and his feelings towards Tolkien's writing - and what he felt were the most important aspects to capture from the books. I then discovered that Jackson would be filming all three films simultaneously, and releasing them one year apart. He would also be using the same production crew for the entire trilogy. I became even more intrigued. The closer the release date of the movie came, the more information I heard, and feelings towards what to expect from the upcoming film. The more I heard, the more excited I was. My expectations on opening night were ridiculously high. After all, this was the novel that was voted as 'The Novel of the Century'.The film did not disappoint ! Peter Jackson does such a brilliant job in completely creating a world that really does seem to be Middle-Earth. The landscapes are huge, lush, and photographic. The architecture is just enough off-kilter to make it seem like a different place - a different type of reality, just as you might envision it in the book. That is where the root of the brilliance of this accomplishment is - details. When you watch this movie you can just tell that Jackson and his crew were not making this film for the money they earned. They did it out of passion for their work.But every aspect of this production just feels so right. The casting is so perfect. There's no overwhelming superstar in the film, whose performance will cannibalize the other players on the screen. Everyone plays their role perfectly - nobody does too much, and nobody does too little. Another aspect that is so perfectly utilized for this production was special effects. Nowhere in the film are special effects excessively used. They are only used when needed in the production. That is it. Sometimes, special effects are needed a great deal (the Balrog scene). Sometimes a small CGI 'enhancement' perfectly captures something Tolkien first described (Bilbo's face suddenly altering when he sees the Ring again at Rivendell).Also, the pacing of the film is brilliant. You just feel like Jackson is taking you on a long journey - not one that is going to end at the end of the first film. I believe this was accomplished because of the approach to the whole project in the beginning. Instead of taking the George Lucas route of literally filming the movies individually, Jackson made all three movies simultaneously. Since I am writing this before The Two Towers is released, I cannot say conclusively that each film will have the same 'feel' to it, but I can guess that it will carry certain aspects on continuity because it is the same production crew and actors working at the same period in time. I believe this is important in the pacing of the films. It allows Jackson to approach the 3 films as one giant project, and to pace it accordingly.After The Fellowship Of The Ring delivered on every possible level I had hoped, I am even more excited for The Two Towers, and The Return Of The King. After seeing how faithful Jackson has remained to the story, I have no doubt in my mind that they will be film classics on the day they are released, just like this film.The greatest trilogy of all time ? It's off to the right start.",10,0,0,16 September 2002
Apocalypse Now," Overrated !
","I'm a very big fan of 'The Godfather I & II' (notice I didn't say III). With that said, everytime I hear the title 'Apocalypse Now' the first word that automatically pops into my head is the word 'overrated'.This movie had almost as much hype to it as Harry Potter. It also was the most expensive movie ever made at the time. Yet, after watching it time after time after time, I can't help but think that half the budget went into Brando's pocket.This movie has never has 'connected' with me. God knows I have given it plenty of chances (I've probably watched it about 10 times). Everytime I see it I keep telling myself 'This is going to be the time that I understand what all the fuss is about'....but it never happens.This movie was made in 1979, approximately five years after the last American troops left VietNam. Personally, I think that is a significant factor in the popularity of this movie. I believe in 1979 Americans were JUST starting to accept the fact that we actually lost the war (and I mean on a very wide scale - just beginning to accept). This movie plays into that mentality by showing a General who is going against his orders. It also shows disillusioned American soldier looking for answers. I think people saw one of the great American directors coming out with a 'Vietnam' movie (starring one of the all-time greatest actors) portraying the American troops that way, and instantly deemed it a 'classic'.It seems as though it kinda gave alot of Americans something to refer to and point at and say 'see, that's what it was like'...because of the names involved. So the testosterone started flowing, college dorms started putting up the movie poster, and next thing you know a huge snowball effect had started, and 'Apocalypse Now' was more-less deemed the standard when it came to Vietnam movies.Now, don't get me wrong 'Apocalypse Now' has some great moments. Some of the camera work in it is really breathtaking. But to call it a classic is simply ridiculous.",8,1,6,5 December 2001
Spider-Man," Flashy CGI cannot account for script flaws
","With Hollywood fully embracing CGI special-effects, and the audiences eating it up like the Twizzlers from the concession stand, the stage was definitely set for one of the most visually challenging comic book interpretations in film history.Spider-Man is not an easy character to put on screen. He doesn't simply fly through the air to his destination. He swings from one web to another, sticking to walls, jumping towards open windows, and grabbing whatever he has to grab in the mean time. The Green Goblin himself is difficult, riding on a jet-coaster that hovers and shoots off at great speeds, as well as fire a large arsenal of weapons.With this said, the special effects were impressive. Sure, they looked kind of cartoon-y at times, but hey, after-all it's a comic-book interpretation, right ?It wasn't the special effects that disappointed me in this movie. It was other elements. When I first heard that Willem Dafoe would be playing the role of the Norman Osborn\Green Goblin, I was excited. Here was an actor who had the talent to pull off the role, and the sinister grin to keep it consistent with the comic-book character. However, and this is important, there's a plot alteration in the movie that makes it different from the comic-book. Because Norman Osborn is trying for a military contract for body armor, the Green Goblin ends up wearing this armor and a helmet\mask throughout the movie. This ends up making him look like a Power Ranger on a gliding coaster ! Worst, it doesn't allow us to see that sinister grin that Willem Defoe has. The same grin that initially got me excited about him getting the part ends up being molded on the front of a plastic mask - and the viewer doesn't get to see Dafoe as the Green Goblin, only Harry Osborn. Dafoe's Green Goblin had potential to be better than Nicholson's Joker, before they put a mask on the Green Goblin. Even worst, it introduces a very bad plot hole : Wouldn't you think the military would know the true identity of the Green Goblin upon sight, if he is flying around in recently military-demonstrated body armor ? That is a VERY big flaw in the script !!One of the pleasant surprises in the movie was J.K. Simmons' performance as J. Jonah Jameson. He played the role perfectly, right down to the toupee.",5,0,0,2 May 2002
Dirty Dancing," An accomplishment
","This is one of those types of movies that doesn't try to be anything more than it's supposed to be. It's a cute movie, with great dancing, and great music.

Remember the Titans," Diluted Disney
","This movie is so watered down that it is just obvious that the true story that it was based upon has been Hollywood-ized to no end.There are just so many instances throughout the script that stink of being added in order to stay within the Disney Safety Net. Some of them are very subtle - almost subliminal. Others are clear desperate attempts to please all races and age groups.For the most part, Washington holds up his end of the deal and delivers a respectful performance.",5,2,5,17 February 2002
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Suspension Of Reality
","There are two types of people who walk away from 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' : those who think the concept of a human being having the ability to defy gravity and accomplish impossible physical tasks is ridiculous ; and those that are able to allow the movie to tell a beautiful fantasy epic by engaging in the concept of suspension of reality.The quicker you allow 'Crouching Tiger...' take over your mindset and send you on its amazing journey, the quicker you will enjoy the awesome power of this film. The martial arts scenes here are simply amazing. For all of the tight, quick movements that are displayed by the characters, this movie never once seems choreographed - not once. It is that good.But there is even so much more to 'Crouching Tiger...' than the martial arts scenes. The gorgeous landscapes are the perfect compliment to this epic tale. They show the depth of the great story and journey being told, without becoming the centerpiece of the film.That is because the true centerpiece of this film is Chinese culture. It is Chinese culture that calls for those anti-gravity fight scenes. It is Chinese culture that is depicted in the village scenes. It is Chinese culture that is shown in the landscapes. Most of all, it is Chinese culture that is heard through the mouths of the actors when they speak their lines.",9,1,1,10 March 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Bridging the trilogy
","I needed a little bit of time to ponder upon this installment of Lord of the Rings after seeing it. I wanted to think about how it would be viewed in the grand scheme of things for this trilogy years from now. Because basically, I don't view Lord of the Rings so much as three different movies, as much as one giant 9 hr movie that we just happen to see in three 3hr segments. Looking at it from that perspective, I think this 'segment' had two main goals :1) have more action than Part I 2) set up Part III as the mac-daddy ending-to-end-all-endings
This one does have more action scenes than Part I - though the majority of the action scenes are grouped together towards the end of the movie.
As far as setting up Part III to be an ending-to-end-all-endings, well, I think this film accomplishes that because it really kept some key parts from 'The Two Towers' book. Because of that, Peter Jackson is basically going to have a ton of material to put into Part III. I mean, there's probably about 45-60 minutes worth of material that's going to have to appear in the movie 'The Return of the King' that is from the book 'The Two Towers'. So, the third part should be pretty interesting.So, I'll admit it, I was slightly disappointed at first - but when I started thinking about what Jackson has set himself up for in part III, I realized that it's all a matter of telling the tale in a way that will make for the most successful trilogy possible.Part I : has to be awesome, make sure the entire audience wants to come back for Part II Part II : give everyone their action fix & those big battles that movie goers love Part III : make sure the audience leaves this one thinking it was a home-run on all levelsKnowing what all material Jackson left for Part III, he definitely has set up the trilogy to end with a home run.I will have to say this : The second time was much better than the first! MUCH BETTER! Somehow, the movie seemed to move along much smoother & the pace was more tolerable & balanced.On the other hand, certain aspects of the film that caught my attention in a negative way stuck out even more noticeably the second time. The best example of this was Aragorn's 'dreams' that he was having of Arwen (which were NOT part of the book). Because of the awkward change of pace to the rest of the film, these scenes felt slightly out of place - and the fact that they are not part of the book makes it look like a bad call on Jackson's part to add them. I'm convinced Jackson is viewing this whole epic as a giant stew that he wants to be able to look at 10 years from now and never have to worry about saying to himself 'hmmm...I should have put this in there when I had a chance'. I mean, after all, is anyone going to care that there are 10 minutes of mushy dream scenes between Aragorn & Arwen when they view these films back-to-back on DVD on a 11 hr Super Mega Platinum Edition years from now ?Gollum was especially impressive to me the second time around. They just couldn't have done a better job with him. They don't overuse him in the scenes and they make sure that when he says something it's memorable. Inevitably there will be comparisons to Jar-Jar, but in reality there really is no comparison. I think this is another example of how LOTR has shown up the new Star Wars in yet another way. Lucas was determined to have Jar-Jar be one of his shining accomplishments with the new trilogy (have a completely CGI character play a supporting role in the movie). Instead of having Jar-Jar viewed as a great cinematic accomplishment, Lucas has people begging him to get rid of the character. Gollum, on the other hand, is actually a very interesting character that actually brings something to the story, and you enjoy viewing on screen.I'm a little worried about what all Jackson has left for Part III, though I do understand why he left it for Part III. However, he has so much material to cover in that movie that it could be quite overwhelming to those that didn't read the books. 'Return of the King' is definitely going to have to be the longest of the three films if he is going to cover the material the way it needs to be covered.When I wrote comments on 'Fellowship' on IMDB, I said it was a good start for what could potentially be the greatest trilogy in cinematic history. I think this installation of LOTR does a proper job in bridging the trilogy & setting us up for what should be the proper ending to the greatest trilogy of all time.",8,0,0,22 December 2002
Dumb and Dumber," Jim Carrey's funniest movie !
","A very underrated movie. Both actors put on great performances for this movie. Of course the plot is ridiculous, but that's what makes it funny ! If you were to just look at the physical humor, and not pay attention to the little jokes, you would miss a great deal of why this is deceptively clever movie. Lloyd Christmas is a perfect character for Carrey's screwball type of comedy. That is because Carrey has you believing this character would actually do all the really stupid things he does in this movie. Very, very funny.",10,0,0,30 November 2001
Jerry Maguire," Two different movies...
","This movie basically has two different parts to it : the part at the beginning depicts Jerry Maquire as a low-life sports agent who will do anything to make money with his clients. The second half shows how he puts his life back together through a deep and enlightening relationship, after being fired. The problem is that the earlier part with him being the slimy sports agent is more interesting than the romance ! ...and that's a very big criticism considering the theme of this movie !I would rather see more of Jerry Maguire as that slimy sports agent. That was the entertaining part of the movie (besides Cuba Gooding Jr., who is very entertaining in his role). The romance is just stale here. Also, in my opinion, the kid's appeal wears thin in about, oh, 5 seconds ?Worth seeing once - but not twice.",4,5,14,28 November 2001

From Hell," Had potential...
","This movie started out in a very promising way. It used some very intersting direction and cinematography to illustrate the 'dreams' that Johnny Depp's character has while smoking opium. It was very effective and gripping film work. I was very excited when these scenes were shown. Unfortunately, those scenes turned out to be few and far between. From a director's point of view, I believe they were used as an instrument to catch the audience's attention.Unfortunately, the movie doesn't follow up with with that momentum. Instead, the plot gets rather murky and dark. Although this is understandable considering the subject matter, it produces some very boring and long scenes. By the end of the movie, I found myself often looking at my watch...not a good sign.",3,1,2,5 December 2001
Blow," Doesn't completely 'blow'
","Like others have said of this movie - it doesn't completely 'blow'. The film and story definitely lacked something as far as originality goes. This is especially true when you consider more interesting drug-related films have been made that are completely fictitious. That's probably the main disappointment here. The film is actually TRUE - and it could have been a 'definitive' drug story - on America's hopeless drug epidemic. However, 'Blow' never even approaches those heights. If you want that 'definitive' film on the American drug epidemic, then watch 'Traffic'.Two points worth noting :1) Much has been said about how great Paul Reubens (Pee-Wee Herman) is in this movie. It's all true. He really makes alot out of what easily could have been just another forgettable character in the movie. Great performance on his part.2) Having said how great of a job Paul Reubens did with his role, let me still ask this : WHO CAST THIS MOVIE ??? In the film, Ray Liotta & Rachel Griffiths play Johnny Depp's father & mother. Both actors did a respectable job in the movie. However, in reality, Ray Liotta is only 8 years older than Depp - and Rachel Griffith is 5 years YOUNGER than Depp !!!!! Are you going to try and convince me that there were not two different older actors who could have played those roles ? It just makes for another hurdle to get around as the viewer - and this movie does not need more hurdles. It has enough of those in other aspects of the production.",3,3,5,8 April 2002
Signs," Do not over-analyze this film !
","***WARNING : DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT SPOILERS****This film is not one that is meant to hold up to extreme analysis regarding the aliens' logic. It is a film that is based upon issues that go much deeper than alien invasion. It is a film that deals with a person's faith, and how we may indeed be given 'signs' from a Higher Power everyday of our life without realizing it.Because of that, it really bothers me when I read people criticizing the film for certain aspects. Some of the such criticisms included naming the aliens' vulnerability to water as 'silly' - because they are invading 'a planet that is 2/3 covered by water.'. Another recurring criticism was regarding what the viewer felt was a 'cheap looking special effect' in the portrayal of the aliens. To me, these criticisms only show that the viewer was viewing the movie in a very shallow way. First of all, the aliens' vulnerability to water. Just for the sake of addressing this question, let me say that one could make a case that the alien invasion depicting in this film was only the BEGINNING of the invasion. This is actually hinted at by the army recruiter who says there have been reports of 'people in shadows', and that those are reconnaissance tactics to just see the 'level of danger' in an invasion. In other words, we are only seeing the very FIRST aliens to ever come to this planet. These are the aliens that come to an alien planet to see if it is safe for the rest of the aliens ! Sure, they might have a vulnerability to a fluid which takes up 2/3 of our planet's surface - but can they still use the remainder 1/3 of the planet ? So we are seeing that first 'wave' of aliens - the 'reconnaissance' mission.Another way of addressing this criticism is to address it in the same manner as the 'alien looked cheap' criticism. My response to this is 'so what ?'. Is that what you REALLY came to see this film for ?In all fairness, the water issue goes much deeper than simply the aliens' vulnerability to it. It goes into the true underlying theme of the film : faith. The water here is used an instrument to illustrate some of the religious undertones of the film.As for the film itself, M. Night Shyamalan did a brilliant job in keeping me tense throughout the film with his quick glimpses of an alien leg disappearing behind a corn stalk, a quick shot of a shadow figure on top of a barn, or quickly moving shadows behind a boarded up door. The whole time I was wondering what exactly was going to happen. Would there actually be an all-out invasion ? Would we only see hints of the aliens ?
Shyamalan's answer to this was perfect. That is because he managed to bring together the true theme of the film (faith), with the alien invasion. Also, by only interacting with one singular alien, Shyamalan also seems to be further expressing the fact that this is only the BEGINNING of the invasion. In other words, the viewer shouldn't necessarily consider this as though the aliens' are now 'defeated'. This is only round one of the invasion....but until round two takes place, keep the faith.Don't misinterpret that as a call for a sequel because there should NEVER be a sequel to this movie. It ended perfectly.",6,0,1,4 August 2002
Gladiator," A solid Best Picture
","For all of the awards and money that went to this movie, this movie is still not regarded very highly by the online movie community (usenet groups etc..).There are several reasons for this. One is that it was in contention for Best Picture against some extremely well made movies : 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' ; 'Traffic'. These are some really incredible movies as well. All three of the movies are deserving of the Best Picture Award. The two losing movies have since become cult classics in their own right, with a very strong following.Another reason that some have played it down is because it SO many Awards. The one that seemed to bother people the most was Russell Crowe's Best Actor Award. Many felt his role was simply physical, and not too difficult to portray.These are valid points in their own right. However, I have viewed 'Gladiator' many times on cable. It is practically on every other day. With these viewings, I have noticed that the film has a great amount of staying power. There are many great performances in this movie. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is his best without a doubt.So many other elements (which it of course won awards for) will suck you into this movie again and again. I was never a fan of 'Gladiator'. Frankly, I liked 'Traffic' better. However, I still find myself watching it when it is on - and every time I watch it there is something new that I like.I believe in 5-10 years many people who believe 'Gladiator' didn't deserve all of the awards it garnished will also realize that you have to view 'Gladiator' for what it is : a gigantic epic with an enormous amount of elements to be appreciated after many viewings.",7,0,1,2 March 2002
Goodfellas," A Masterpiece !
","The only thing keeping this movie from being known as Scorsese's crowning achievement is that other movie he made known as 'Raging Bull'.I have read many times how 'Raging Bull' was the greatest movie of the 80's. That's probably true. This is possibly the greatest movie of the 90's (definitely in the top 3).The thing that makes this movie so attractive to me is that Scorsese didn't set out to make another 'Godfather'. This isn't about Mafia Kings, or Crime Lords. This is about the lower level of people who are the 'soldiers'. These are the people who are several levels down from Don Corleone. Hence, the tone of the movie is much more raw, and violent.Scorsese pays attention to every little detail in this movie. He uses so many different aspects of cinema in order to turn what may be a typical scene into something that you always remember. Examples of this include the brilliant camera work through the back entrance of the nightclub ; freeze frames that are accompanied with interesting narrative ; great shifts in scenes that highlight twists in the characters' minds. It is as though Scorsese had a whole bag of tricks that he was picking from to put into this movie - and they all work perfectly. The soundtrack is implemented brilliantly. In some cases it places an exclamation point on a dramatic scene (when the opening chords of Cream's 'Sunshine Of Your Love' play as the camera centers on James Conway you know something bad is going to be happening soon). In other cases it is used to give the viewer a sense of a time period (50's, 60's, 70's etc). Scorsese even shows the same scene twice from two different angles just to illustrate two different points of view...brilliant !I could go on forever about this movie...but that would be ridiculous. The best way to illustrate just how brilliant Scorsese is, is to point out that this isn't even considered his best movie by many !!!!!",10,0,0,4 December 2001
