The Hangover," Best comedy in years!
","What can I say, best comedy since the Jim Carry,Adam Sandler,Chris Farley days of the mid 1990's. Sure a little far fetched in some scenes but still never a dull moment. Just the little things Alan says,and the expressions on their faces, during the crew's small talk is priceless in itself.Taking place in Las Vegas just adds to the comedy value of the film. The unrated movie version is just perfect, and the original release is missing some key moments.They couldn't have picked a better cast and crew to do this comedy, 4 friends all different in many ways, but still find a way to laugh in the worst of times.",10,3,4,30 August 2011
