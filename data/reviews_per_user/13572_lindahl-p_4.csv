Scarface," www.voolife.com/bestmovies
","Scarface is about Tony Montana (Al Pacino) who manages to escape from Cuba to United States in the 70's. In the States Tony starts to work in a cheap restaurant....but Tony has much bigger plans. His ambition is to filthy rich with plenty of women and nice car and houses. He is determined to reach this goal no matter what it takes. Tony gets a foot into the gangster world after a cocaine deal that Tony handled good. Slowly he starts to climb the ladder within the gangster world in California in order to reach his goal. The movie is very violent and there is nudity, cocaine, guns, killings etc. In my opinion this is a really good movies and Scarface is one of the best gangster movies ever made. Enjoy!",10,0,3,28 July 2006
Walk the Line," www.voolife.com/bestmovies
",Walk the line was an excellent movie and the acting in Walk the line was outstanding. Joaquin Phoenix really manages to capture the character of Jonny Cash in an emotional way. As a viewer you can really feel with the character and it is very realistic. I am not surprised that he won an Oscar for this role The plot itself is about the life of Jonny Cash and how he lived. Furthermore the music in the movie is really good. I could rent the movie just to listen to the music. Jonny Cash would be proud if he saw this movie. I can strongly recommend this movie. You will not be disappointed when you see this movie. It is the perfect movie for a nice Saturady night!,8,0,0,28 July 2006
Crash," www.voolife.com/bestmovies
",Crash has been one of the best movies I have ever seen. It crashed straight into my heart. When I saw the movie I had no expectations and it is possible that this made me like the movie even more. Crash is a movie that touches on a couple of different life stories and how they link together. This movie makes you think about destiny and how easily your life can change. The acting is in my opinion terrific. Everything is very realistic and it is interesting to see how the different characters interact with each other. I cannot think of anything that I didn't like about this movie. The movie plot is quite hard to explain so I will you see for yourself. I can guarantee you that this movie is worth seeing!,10,2,10,28 July 2006
Sin City," www.voolife.com/bestmovies
","I have seen a lot of movies, but nothing like this! When I heard that it was in black and white I got a little suspicious but it turned out to be one of the greatest things with this movie. It really sets the mood for the whole movie. It is a sin not to have seen this movie. It is really good and I would say that this movie has one of the best visual effects ever made. The movie itself is dark which makes it really cool and the 'superheroes' are even cooler. You get to follow three different main characters and the plot is a little to complicated to explain so I will let you discover the movie for yourself. Their stories are different but somehow they are tied together.If you haven't seen this movie, see it!",8,0,1,28 July 2006
