Mission: Impossible III," An adrenaline rush
","It's unusual to get such an adrenaline rush from an action movie these days. It's either the explosions aren't big enough, they talk too much, the characters are too flat, or any number of things. MI3 is not without its faults, but you love to watch it. Granted, the writers have, again come up with unimaginable story lines, but all you have to do is remember this is the IMF team.J.J. Abrams directs, who also is deeply involved with the TV show 'Lost', brings his brilliance to the big screen once again. A die-hard 'Lost' fan will be able to recognize certain elements from some of the episodes, such as camera work, or even some of the choreography.This time Ethan Hunt is engaged, so now the stakes are higher on his missions. As we know from practically every spy movie ever made, the hero's girlfriend can always be used against him.Another cliché used in the movie comes about one-fourth into the film. The only woman on the IMF team must go under-cover in a party. She proves that even if you wear a barely-there red dress when everyone else is in black, no one pays special attention to you. However, the writers allow the classic 'disguise' masks to be used again and some new cool gadgets.A must-see for action fans.",7,0,0,15 June 2006
United 93," A Tale of Bravery
","Paul Greengrass directs this bold and tragic tale of the flight of United 93. Dozens of passengers were taken hostage when four terrorists hijacked their plane. No person will ever really know what had truly taken place on that plane, but Greengrass and his team piece together a story so majestically, you feel as if you were really there.It is not only the story, but the way it is told that gives the viewer a 'being there' feeling. This movie was shot in documentary style footage: the camera looks for the speaker, sometimes it lingers on one person while we listen to another, and other such moves. Unlike with the desperate attempts Open Water made at a true story, this technique brings out a real beauty of the brave people on the day of September 11.The cast is also made up of all 'no-names'. Actors who have gotten a little work here and there, but have never reached the publicity of Charlize Theron or Matt Damon. However, each actors is very good and extremely professional. Their performances blow you away.When you watch this film, you will be shaken up. In all seriousness of advice, a box of tissues may be in order. Greengrass and his team are geniuses with United 93, but some may not be ready for such a story.",10,0,1,15 June 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Not as good as the first
","A step down from 'Curse of the Black Pearl', but fantastic none the less. Captain Jack Sparrow, Will Turner, and Elizabeth Swann embark on another voyage of fantasy. Lucky for us, none of the main cast or crew has been changed; unfortunately, some of the jokes are being reused as well.Captain Jack Sparrow makes another miraculous (and side-splitting) entrance, where he then boards the 'Black Pearl' with his crew. They head out in search of a key, which leads to a chest, holding something Jack doesn't say. Complicated, yes; funny, yes. Meanwhile, back at Port Royal, Will and Elizabeth are about to be married when they are arrested for helping Jack escape the gallows. The punishment is death and the only way to escape it is to bring Cutler Beckett (the man who has arrested them) Jack's special compass.We discover Jack had made a deal with Davy Jones, and it's time to pay up. Jack, in his usual manner, tries to get out of it. Will and Elizabeth soon join him for an adventurous movie.The beloved theme music and other tunes return, along with a touch of new score. Often, it seems, the director tries to recreate the scenes that made the first 'Pirates' so famous. For instance, the 'But, why is the rum gone?' line is seen in one of Jack's early declarations 'Why is the rum always gone?'.This film is a bit of a dilemma. You should watch the first film before you see this one, in order to get a lot of what goes on, however, if you have, the second is bound to be a bit of a disappointment. Just try your best not to compare them (like anyone could resist).",8,2,3,17 July 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Computer graphics aren't spectacular, but it is true to the book
","The Chroncles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the WardrobeThe great series written by C.S. Lewis were momentous occasions to a first time reader. Anyone could let their imagination run wild to create Aslan, the great lion and King of Narnia, or the humble Mr. and Mrs. Beaver. The movie, however, lays it all out straight for you, and it doesn't do a good job. The visual effects look incredibly fake at times, but, all that aside, it is a movie you should take your kids to.Mr. Tumnus' character is one of the few I think was depicted perfectly. He is the first Naninian Lucy sees, and they both shriek in fright when they see each other. Aslan, however, fails to emit the great amount of power which the character possesses. The lion looks like what he really is: computer generated.The screenplay is well written and doesn't leave gaping holes in the plot, nor does it cut out small details to leave room for the big picture (unlike the enormous Harry Potter novels, C.S. Lewis' tales were only about 200 pages long). The movie does have a sense of reality mixed in with all of its fantasy, which makes the length of 2 and ½ hours easy to sit through for most.When you are watching, a word of caution: do not stop as soon as the credits roll, the movie isn't over yet. There is a short scene between the Proffesur and Lucy that you wouldn't want to miss.",8,0,0,26 March 2006
Ice Age: The Meltdown," New characters mixed terrifically with the old
","Though not as classic or funny as the original Ice Age, Ice Age 2 is something you won't want to miss. Once again, we travel back in time to meet up with Manny, Diego, and Sid. As the title describes, the ice is melting and the whole valley is in danger of being flooded. All the creatures must migrate to a gigantic boat waiting on the other side of the valley to float them safely on the water.The most popular character, Scrat, is back. The squirrel's muted attempts to retrieve his precious acorn from hilarious situations deserve some sort of award to the creativeness of the animators. The cute creature comes into frame every ten or twenty minutes, and the audience will laugh at his mere presence.New characters include two possums and another female mammoth who has come under the impression that she herself is a possum. The two real possums work as a team to ensure mischief for the mismatched herd in Ice age 2. Sean William Scott and John Peck voice the two and manage to excellently portray the carelessness and silliness that will make you think back to the class clowns of your own middle school. Queen Latifah is Ellie, the mammoth-believed-too-be-possum, which our beloved Manny develops a crush on.A few of the scenes are entertaining in that they look like Busby Berkly stepped in to direct them. The dancing and singing is intriguing rather than boring. Ice Age 2, thankfully, does not go the route of musical.",6,3,4,26 April 2006
The Hills Have Eyes," Ominous and predictable, but worth the ticket
","It is very unusual to walk out of a theater, after having seen a the newest horror flick, and being pleased with what you viewed. I see 'scary' movies with a hint of boredom and apprehension these days. A proper horror film has not been made for quite sometime. The Hills have Eyes is a little different.It begins ominously enough, and is quite predictable, but leads the viewers with a steady hand. The movie starts with a classic run-down gas station, at which an average American family is turned off the road by a seemingly well-meaning man. At this point the audience would be shouting at the screen 'Don't do it, it's a trap!'. . . . in the old days. Now, it is harder and harder to spook your average teenager, or, in some cases, your average five-year-old.The characters make the characteristic moves of all horror characters: following the dog into the darkness (the dog, always goes to the trouble), leaving one person alone to hold down the fort, going off alone, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. But, Hills has its redeeming qualities in that it gives excellent scare-tactics. The ending, also, ends as a cliff-hanger, allowing you to make up whatever you think would suit such a movie.",5,0,1,17 April 2006
Over the Hedge," Good for kids and adults
","When the scavenging raccoon, RJ (voiced by Bruce Willis) needs to collect an enormous amount of food to pay back a bear, he needs to get some help. He cons a forest family pf two possums, a turtle, a skunk, a squirrel, and five porcupines to help him. After their long hibernation, the family wakes up to discover human deforestation has taken away most of their home. They also find . . . the hedge. Bruce Willis is almost perfect for RJ after his role as Jimmy in 'The Whole Ten Yards'. Not only must these animals fight to find food, but they soon must escape from a deranged pest-control man.Jokes for an older audience are also there. Many inside jokes include references to 'Citizen Cane' and 'A Streetcar Named Desire'.",8,0,0,17 July 2006
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Great idea, but too old to be a real horror film
","This is a new idea brought to us by Wes Craven. You can't fall asleep, lest your nightmares should attack you. It begins with four teenagers, all of whom had the same nightmare about a man with knives for fingers. They soon find out that he's more than a dream.This movie leaves you constantly in awe of the ideas behind it. Craven's creativity allows you to see past the outdated special effects. Nightmare is a classic for a reason. The plot itself is what scares most people. Whenever you're scared of something, a person might tell you 'Sleep on it, and you'll feel better in the morning.', but here, that's out of the question.Recommended for anyone who wants to see a good movie, but not be scared senseless.",7,0,0,17 July 2006
Gangs of New York," Worth your while
","'Gangs of New York' goes back to 1863 where New York was tough, gangs roamed the streets and you had to pay due to the right person. Okay, maybe that description doesn't sound too different form the New York of today, but it is very different.The Natives and the Dead Rabbits are two of the gangs. Each fearsome and have good fighters and thinkers on their side. The Dead Rabbits are led by a Priest by the name of Vallon, his son is Amsterdam (older version is played by Leonardo DiCaprio). Dead Rabbits is composed mainly of Irish immigrants. The Natives have Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting as their leader (Daniel Day-Lewis), who despises immigrants, most specifically, the Irish. The two gangs meet and fight over the Five Points, a territory in New York that had yet to be claimed.The opening battle scene starts out lamely, Vallon has brought his ten-year old son to the battle grounds so he could possibly see history in the making. Unfortunately, all he gets to see is poorly choreographed combat, unworthy to be seen on a low-budget stage company production. As the battle continues, it picks up into a bloody and well",7,0,1,17 July 2006
