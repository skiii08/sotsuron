The Avengers," This is Joss Whedon at his best.
","(Pre-Endgame MCU Rewatch) Everything works in this film. The initial 'gathering' of heroes, the animosity and discord between the various characters (in part amplified by Loki), the chemistry between Stark and Banner, Coulson fanboying all over Cap, and the eventual bonding together for a common cause. I feel like everyone is bringing their A-game here, Ruffalo stepping in for Norton and doing an excellent job.The story and pacing is good and even the action scenes are not confusing (a la Transformers) and really spotlight every single hero and their unique abilities. Their interaction and teamwork is great. The only nitpick I could have is Cap's costume still looks a bit outdated even with the upgrade, just reminds me of that really bad '90s movie.",10,3,4,14 April 2019
The Incredible Hulk," It's not a great movie by any means, but it's entertaining at least.
","(Pre-Endgame MCU Rewatch) I'm glad they took care of most of the origin story right in the opening credits and fill in the remaining blanks shortly after. Ed Norton plays a decently well Bruce Banner but I didn't really care for him. Hulk is great and I love his look in this movie, much more menacing and dark than in the later films of the MCU.Overall plot is the usual thing they've done for decades in the comic books before the Hulk actually got interesting to read. Bruce loves Betty, Betty's father the military general doesn't like that, general chases Hulk with military might, Hulk just wants to be left alone. Yawn. If they ever try to make a Hulk movie again they should look at the later storylines, just as they incorporated parts of Planet Hulk into Thor Ragnarok.",6,0,0,5 April 2019
Iron Man 2," I found the main antagonist to be the least interesting part.
","(Pre-Endgame MCU Rewatch) A lot happens in the movie and I found the main antagonist to be the least interesting part of it. Everything else, Tony's character development (or one could say lack thereof?), S.H.I.E.L.D.'s 'meddling', and the introduction of new characters is far more interesting to watch. The Grand Prix scene, the court room scene, are all amazing. Don Cheadle is a great improvement as the new James Rhodes and Sam Rockwell depicted Justin Hammer perfectly.I always enjoy seeing more S.H.I.E.L.D. (and happy they made that into a show, Coulson is the best!) but damn if Natasha Romanoff isn't a boring character to watch. Though honestly I think that's more because I find Scarlett Johansson quite a boring and non-versatile actress. Still, it's nice to see the 'Avengers Initiative' slowly grow into something in the background of this film.Not as good as the first, but still quite a spectacle. And Robert Downey Jr. was born for this role.",8,0,0,5 April 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," I definitely enjoyed this movie and was entertained throughout!
","Great ending to the sequel trilogy s well as the Skywalker saga that spanned nine movies. Very impressively handled and rounded up the missing pieces from previous films quite nicely.The very first scene already gripped me and I knew I was going to be in a for a helluva ride. I was not disappointed; it was a fantastic experience. The fourth (I think?) act had me in nearly constant tears, and the payoff at the end was very well done.Has numerous little nods and tie-ins to previous trilogies and well worth watching!",9,1,4,19 December 2019
Captain America: The First Avenger," As a whole this is a pretty decent movie.
","(Pre-Endgame MCU Rewatch) Steve Rogers' pre-super serum days are great, the Howard Stark Expo is a nice and fun addition, and initial post-super serum Steve is hilarious. He punched Hitler in the face 200 times! Once he finally gets to see real action I feel it loses a bit of fun but it's still decent.Both Tommy Lee Jones and Hugo Weaving are excellent in this film and I expected nothing less from them. Agent Carter is a great character and if you like her I definitely recommend watching the Agent Carter series.",7,0,0,14 April 2019
Thor," Growth for both Thor and Loki.
","(Pre-Endgame MCU Rewatch) What's great about this movie is that we see Thor grow from an self-righteous egotistical silver platter boy to the more thoughtful and nuanced Thor we see in the later MCU. Similarly Loki goes through his own phase of self-discovery and starts making big (dumb) decisions based on emotion which is his staple. He's not at his best here yet.Whats not so great about this movie is the romantic subplot which was completely unbelievable for time the short time Jane Foster and Thor had spent together. While I can see some earthling swooning over Thor, there really was no need to add this and it didn't matter for the plot in any way.First appearance of Hawkeye is okay, they really don't know how to use this guy properly and I feel it could've been anyone else. Coulson is fantastic as always and I enjoy his increased role in this film.",8,2,3,14 April 2019
Iron Man," Robert Downey Jr. absolutely nails it as Tony Stark.
",(Pre-Endgame MCU Rewatch) This is just a fantastic movie from start to finish. The origin story works and does not bore you like others sometimes do. Jeff Bridges is entertaining and convincing. Great start of the Marvel Cinematic Universe!,9,0,1,5 April 2019
