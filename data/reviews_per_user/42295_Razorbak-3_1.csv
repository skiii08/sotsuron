The Blair Witch Project," Burn the Witch!
","I must first say that I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. I watched the Sci-fi channel special. I visited the web site. Now all I have to say is, `What's the big deal?'. There was almost nothing scary in this movie  psychological or otherwise. 95% of the dialog in this film was either whining or bickering. The viewer doesn't `share' in their psychological terror, they just want them dead, so that the whining will stop. I will say that I did enjoy the tense climax  but having to put up with the rest of the film to get there just wasn't worth it. An interesting note: I have never heard such a violent crowd reaction at the finish of a film. Booing, jeering and the shouting of some very colorful commentary followed the rolling of the credits.  Add some pitchforks and torches, and we might have had a good old witch burning!",1,0,2,23 August 1999
