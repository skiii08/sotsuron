"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Amusing, but not as good as it could be
","Alright. This movie is definitely interesting experience. A drama about drag queens. Now I myself have never been a fan of men's choice dressing up as women and parading around, but I am not against it. It's their choice of life. But if you have some problem with this choice of life, well then don't condemn this movie. That's YOUR problem. I suppose this film sends the same sort of message that anti-racist and pro-homosexual movies send. That there is nothing wrong with being different. I guess the fact, that this specific message is applied to the life of a drag queen, is quite original, because there are very few movies about these sort of people. But it could have been better. It seemed for me, that the idea did not reach it's full potential. I mean take the movie 'Milk'(2008) or Ang Lee's 'Brokeback Mountain' for example. They also send a same sort of message, about being different and all... And those movies just blew me away. After seeing them I was left paralyzed by their greatness for quite some time. This movie did not have that impact. But it's still nice to see it for it's good intention. And another REALLY interesting thing to watch here was Hugo Weaving, Guy Pearce and Terance Stamp in their REALLY colorful roles as drag queen's. Never in my life had I even imagined to see Hugo Weaving - Agent Smith from the 'Matrix' - one of the coolest bad ass characters ever, in the most eye blowing over-colored women's dress with HUGE feather's and make-up AND parading around ABBA's 'Mama Mia'.IT WAS HIILARIOUS!It really is an amusing movie for open and accepting people. You will not be displeased, but I do have doubts weather it will seem as one of the greatest stories ever. Go see it and have fun with it.",9,0,1,5 August 2011
Captain America: The First Avenger," A decent film for Captain America
","Right. So the first thing I definitely liked about the movie was the choice for the role of Caps. Chris Evans truly looks perfect for this role. I saw his ideal face in in the red, white and blue costume, and, as cheesy as it sounds, I actually thought that he truly looks like an Amerian hero. His determined look and serious Brooklyn dialect goes amazingly well with the portrayal of this iconic character. And this is not cheesy (I'm addressing the people, unfamiliar with this character right here) because Captain America is one of the first major comic book heroes in history. He's as equally important, if not more, as Superman. And that is why the film makers made him look so 'flawless'. Because he comes from a REALLY long time ago. Even the story is set in the 40's, when the superhero world was much simpler. Good guys were good. Bad guys were bad. That's it. Not like modern superhero's, where's there's a twist around every corner, and the bad guy turns out to be the good guy, and the good guy turns out to be the bad guy, and so on... I was really glad to finally get a really simple, but quite enjoyable hero in a movie to lay my eyes upon. Of course Chris Evans was not the only star of the film. The cast is superb (Tommy Lee Jones, Hugo Weaving, Stanley Tucci, etc.). Hugo Weaving surely gives an equally impressive performance next to Chris Evans. Probably even more impressive. He really managed to pull of the German accent portraying the German Nazi evildoer. Also a very clear character. A perfect bad guy, with no noble or kind values. Pure evil. The only problem about Hugo Weaving in this picture was that there was too little screen time for his role. His character was really appealing to me. Frankly, Hugo Weaving was actually the first reason, I wanted to go see this film. And it turned out to be a similar situation to Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight'. Everyone who loved that film, loved it for one good reason - Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker (of course that's not the only good thing about that movie). And as many times as I see 'the Dark knight', I can not get enough of the Joker. I wanted him to get more screen time. And it's the same with Hugo Weaving here. He could definitely had more on screen time. It felt as if Hugo Weaving wasn't 'maxed out'. And all of the other characters are really appealing because of their 'simplicity'. The Plot will definitely satisfy the comic book fan. It really resembles the comic story, which I really enjoyed. Because often, when a film studio decides to make a comic hero film, but DOESN'T follow the story in the comic, and makes up their own plot, it usually ends up bad. However. The people who are unfamiliar with Captain America, will probably not be impressed by the plot, because it does not stand out as something new or gripping. You have to know the comic to enjoy the story, because it's filled with details from it. Speaking of which, it was really entertaining how they used pieces and fragments in this film from other recent Marvel movies, like 'Thor', 'Ironman' or 'the Incredible Hulk'.So basically it is determined by your familiarity with Captain America, whether you'll like this movie or not so much or not at all. If you are a fan, I believe you'll at least enjoy it, otherwise not so likely.",8,0,5,2 August 2011
Apocalypse Now," Redux version is HORRIBLE. stick with the original
","''Apocalypse now'' has two versions. The original, which was out in 1979 and the Redux version from 2001, which extends the whole picture by approximately 49 minutes of cut out footage. So let it make it perfectly clear. I am reviewing the REDUX version and NOT the original, which, in my opinion, is outstanding and MUCH better than this pointless waste of effort. Now. Every technical element from the picture such as sound effects, original soundtracks, camera quality IS actually as decent as from the original, perhaps even better. But this is not actually important, is it now. I mean, you most certainly do not want to watch an extended version of ''Apocalypse Now'' just for a 'smoother' result, now do you. The main point of this new version was to get to see the movie completely uncut, to view the original with all it's cut out footage. And that, dear friends, is an absolute let down. The majority of the new footage is mostly simply pointless and boring to watch. In fact these missing scenes are SO dull, that they actually cast a sort of a shadow on the original movie in this version, thus making the whole 3 hours and 16 minutes of this film look weak and frustrating to sit through. Never have I been so disappointed in an extended version of a great film. NOT Recommended. It's pointless, TOO LONG, and boring. And if you already saw the original, you can just see it once more. It is definitely better than watching this extended version, which, in conclusion, is A WASTE OF OVER 3 HOURS.",7,3,5,18 July 2011
Garden State," Impact of emotions!
","Remember a time, when you see a movie, that really gets you watching it. A movie, that leaves such an impact on you, you stay speechless for some time. And in that moment of silent serenity, you forget about all your troubles and become happy. Well, This movie is definitely one of those extraordinary films.The story of this film is about life. About living life. It actually is, in fact, quite a simple plot, but the way it is shown is truly remarkable. It sets of on a depressed mood, and gradually reaches a beautiful climax of a really positive epiphany at the end. This life defining atmosphere goes really well with every other aspect the movie uses, like philosophical dialogs between characters, family relationships, the main character's drama, etc. The performances of all the actors are, without a doubt, amazing. Zach Braff, who plays the main character, gives a terrific performance portraying a disturbed, puzzled young man, who is searching for something in life. Such a character is probably the embodiment of a massive number of teenagers and other young people in the world, who are searching for a purpose in life. Therefore, I think that any disturbed young soul, who watches this film, will feel a deep connection between himself and this character. Natalie Portman also gives an equally, if not an even better, appearance on screen. Her acting is truly flawless in this movie, and for that matter probably every other movie she has appeared in. And another appealing thing, worth mentioning, is the absolutely outstanding soundtracks of this movie. It is amazing how well the music matches the atmosphere. Seeing some of the dramatic scenes along with this astonishing music will touch you emotionally. So, all in all, Amazing story about life, followed by terrific performance and outstanding atmosphere. Three essential elements. which, combined, will surely make an emotional impact to anyone who sees this perfect movie.",9,6,9,26 July 2011
