The Blair Witch Project," A new genre is born
","The Blair Witch Project lays foundation for a fully new genre - reality horror. The film manages most of all by its realistic camera, but also by its script and cutting, to establish an unmatched horror scenario, which no Hollywood movie with well lit scenery and all too stylish actors can ever achieve. Suspense first is subtly, later drastically raised - the audience finds themselves amused, baffled, frightened, with a shift to the latter one with the ongoing plot. The final shots at the film's peak dig themselves into your mind - probably they won't let you sleep well the next night.But the movie is more than that. The psychological development of the three actors, their way of reacting to the increasing threat, is well observed and very realistic. The same goes for the group dynamic between the three, which adds to the plot as an important dramatic element. Finally, the end leaves a lot open to discussion (which some people don't like - to my mind this helps you reflect on the movie and might give you a deeper insight into what actually happened in the film and what this might mean to you personally).You should see this film if you are into horror movies, or if you like good and innovative movies in general. But don't send your kids alone!",8,0,0,7 December 1999
